						<p>Despite the recent past, oil and gas deals look good<p>By Margaret Opsata<p>Oil and gas limited partner-ships were one of the most ill-conceived investments of 1980s. But today the picture looks different.<p>The appeal of oil deals used to be the prospect of $100-a-barrel oil. Some oil and gas partnerships were built on borrowed money, leveraging the investors' cash investment as much as fourfold. But oil prices collapsed in the mid-1980s, and drilling fell on hard times. Public oil and gas-drilling programs raised only $29.2 million in 1993, down from $72.7 million in 1992 and $2.1 billion in the heyday of 1981. "There are just not a lot of sponsors left," says Nancy Mahon, editor in chief of The Stanger Report, a Shrewsbury, New Jersey, newsletter that tracks limited partnerships.<p>But sponsors who survived the fallout in oil and gas are beginning to like today's lower-profile environment. Says James R. O'Mara, president and CEO of Atlas Energy Group in Pittsburgh: "In the '70s and '80s, the oil and gas business was full of former used-car salesmen and others who thought that all you had to do was punch a hole in the ground to get rich. They gave the industry a bad name." <p>High oil prices were a big reason that shills and sharpies could sell as many deals as they did. Prices are much lower today, but the strength of natural gas prices and recent modest increases in petroleum prices have improved industry economics. <p>Oil and gas programs come in two varieties. Drilling programs explore for new wells; income programs purchase producing wells with proven reserves. Income funds are usually--but not always--less risky than those that drill, since dry holes are a distinct and expensive possibility. <p>But drilling deals have a greater potential reward because drillers capitalize on flush production in a well's early years; income deals typically acquire wells that are three to ten years old. <p>Income programs also offer few tax advantages. Investors in drilling programs, by contrast, are entitled to take annual deductions for depletion of energy reserves and to depreciate the cost of equipment and other tangible assets over seven years. Plus, they may write off all intangible drilling costs--typically fees for services to locate and open new wells--incurred in the first year. This can amount to between 70 percent and 90 percent of the original investment, according to analysts.<p>To make the write-off even larger, some sponsors pay tangible expenses from corporate funds so that more of the investors' capital can go to intangible costs. This strategy, known as functional allocation, will reduce the amount of depreciation investors can claim since they own few tangible assets, but usually the increase in intangible deductions in the first year will more than make up for the loss. <p>In addition to the tax considerations, steady cash flow must exist for the partnership to succeed. You can expect to recover your capital through sheltered cash flows within six years and to receive annual distributions of at least 6 percent to 12 percent thereafter. If you're worried about the risks, consider programs that look for oil or gas only in areas with established reserves--called developmental programs. Some partnerships don't do any exploratory drilling, while others allocate up to 25 percent of capital for it.<p>Public-partnership programs are those registered with state and federal securities regulators, offering units for $5,000 to any investor. Private placements have fewer investors, each of whom contributes a minimum of $20,000 or more. <p>Today's drilling partnerships normally hold front-end loads to 10 percent. Also, general partners' fees are more reasonable, sharing arrangements have become more fair, and a larger number of funds identify precisely where they intend to drill rather than raising money in unspecified "blind pools." And owing to the usual year-end rush to get the write-offs, savvy investors can get even better terms by investing in spring or summer, when drilling costs are lower and more wells can be dug in the current tax year.<p><p><p>

Avoid capital-gains taxes by exchanging property<p>By Donald Jay Korn<p>Twenty-five years ago, Bob and Betty Bates purchased a vacant lot in Greenwich, Connecticut, an upscale suburb of New York, for $25,000. In 1993, when they needed cash to pay medical bills, they found the market value of the still-vacant lot had grown to $465,000. Then came the bad news: A sale would trigger capital-gains taxes of around $160,000.<p>Searching for a better option, the couple found a way to have their profit and spend it, too. Instead of selling their lot for cash, they traded it for a shopping center in Phoenix. The tenants pay them thousands of dollars a month in rents, and they avoided any tax on capital gains.<p>"They were able to take advantage of Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code," says R. Barry Deickler, president of the Metropolitan Area Real Estate Exchange Network in Bedford, New York, who arranged the deal. Section 1031 allows real estate investors to exchange one property for another and defer the tax on the capital gain. The tax is payable only when the substitute property is sold. And so long as that property is held, or subsequently exchanged again, the taxes are deferred until the owner's death--when the owner's heirs can sell and pay no tax on a lifetime of appreciation.<p>Trading investment properties needn't be one for one. In fact, such exchanges are the exception. Most of the time, these transactions are multiparty delayed exchanges. Here's how a typical property swap might work:<p>First, a property owner finds a buyer. Next, the owner retains a third party, called a qualified intermediary by the IRS, who receives the sales proceeds and places them in escrow. (For protection, an owner/seller can ask the intermediary for a third-party guarantee like a bank letter of credit.)<p>Now the seller has 45 days to locate potential replacement properties and identify them in writing to the intermediary. If more than three properties are identified, their aggregate value can't top 200 percent of the original sale. Now a new clock starts. The government allows 135 additional days to close the sale on a new property. The money will come from the intermediary's escrow account. Once that happens, the transaction is complete. <p>The intermediary's fees--some charge $1000 or more per transaction, others will ask for a percentage--are often modest compared to the tax savings. "For mortgaged properties," says Deickler, "the tax bill may be greater than the cash the seller receives. Some people find they literally can't afford to sell." In such circumstances, tax-deferred exchanges have obvious appeal. <p>According to Ed Horan, president of Realty Exchange Corp. in Haymarket, Virginia, certain rules must be followed to ensure that an exchange is totally tax-free. The amount paid for the replacement property must be at least as much as the adjusted sales price (after expenses) of the property sold. And all of the cash received must be reinvested in the new property. "If you meet these two rules, the third will follow," he says. "If you're relieved of a mortgage, that amount must be replaced by some combination of new debt or additional cash." A transaction that results in either net cash or net debt relief will generate taxes. <p>Reverse exchanges--deals in which a replacement property is purchased before the original property is sold--may be more risky. "The Treasury Department hasn't decided whether it will permit tax deferral on reverse exchanges," says James Godbout, partner in the Washington, D.C., office of the accounting firm Ernst & Young.<p>Homeowners can even use Section 1031 to avoid the tax on a personal residence. Say you have a highly appreciated home in California and you want to move to an apartment in Arizona. Instead of selling your house, convert it to rental property (which should take about a year to establish), then swap for investment property in Arizona, where you're moving. If necessary, you can tap your built-up equity by refinancing the Arizona property. Hold on to your investment property (or a replacement), and all of the appreciation will escape capital-gains tax. <p>For help in finding an intermediary, the National Council of Exchangors (713-894-0113), based in Houston, consists of around 400 brokers who have taken courses on tax-deferred exchanges. The Federation of Exchange Accommodators (916-388-1031), based in Sacramento, can also suggest members to contact. <p><p>

New software makes the job less taxing than before<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>Tax-preparation software has come a long way. Just two years ago, when Worth first looked at tax programs, they were hard to use. "If you've never prepared your own tax return and don't know anything about computers," we said, "it'll probably be easier to use a sharp pencil than a mouse to file this year." <p>That's changed. Now, just about anyone with a computer and a fairly straightforward tax situation can prepare a tax return via software, and it'll be easier than using a pencil and tax manual. <p>Even if you plan to pay someone to prepare your return, doing it first on a computer is often worthwhile. It will help you organize your tax records, and since it's likely to cut the time that your accountant will spend on your return, it can result in a reduced preparation fee. <p>To find the best program this year we looked at the Windows versions of the four biggest players in tax software: TurboTax by ChipSoft, Andrew Tobias' TaxCut by Meca, Personal Tax Edge by Parsons Technology, and CA-Simply Tax by Computer Associates. Our findings: For someone who doesn't know much about computers or taxes, by far the simplest program to use is TaxCut. <p>TaxCut is designed so that even computer- illiterate tax know-nothings can prepare their own returns, and it handles most complexities as well as the other programs. Its spoon-feeding approach actually offended two accountants we asked to try it. "It's for a third grader," complained CPA Jeffrey Seader of Perlson, Siegel & Co. in Melville, New York. But for people who don't know a W-2 from WD 40 and who can't explain the difference between a tax credit and a tax deduction, TaxCut is the hands-down winner. If you know your way around computers and tax law, then you might prefer TurboTax, the top seller. <p>TaxCut's user-friendly nature is evidenced by its 20-page instruction book. In comparison, the TurboTax and CA-Simply Tax user guides are over 100 pages each, while Tax Edge weighs in at 96 pages. TaxCut's documentation can afford to be so much shorter because the program grabs hold of your hand and walks you through the entire tax-filing process. That's quite different from Parsons Technology's Personal Tax Edge, which left even our accountants looking baffled after it booted up. <p>The big difference is a great tool TaxCut dubbed the Navigator. This is a series of cartoon-like icons that break the tax-filing process into eight steps. TaxCut looks and feels like a video game. <p>All four programs use an interview format that prompts users to enter their tax information. Answering a series of questions is a lot easier than working your way through the IRS forms. But some interviews are better than others. TaxCut's interview asks more questions. We don't know for sure that it has more questions: it seemed to Andy that it did as he went thru it. Probly OK as is. but leaves less to the user's judgment. <p>For instance, TurboTax asks users whether taxpayers wish to use Form 1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ and presents information about each form. TaxCut automatically makes the choice for you based on how you answer its questions about your income and expenses. Similarly, TaxCut never asks you whether you intend to use the standard deduction or to itemize. <p>The tax help in TaxCut is also superior. Unlike the other programs, TaxCut's explanations of rules don't sound like an IRS manual. Compare, for instance, two explanations of how business property can be depreciated using first-year expensing. TurboTax's help screen reads: "IRS Section 179 stipulates that you may elect to expense the entire cost (or a portion of the cost) of certain assets in the year the asset is purchased, rather than claiming depreciation deductions over the asset's useful life. For the regulations and details concerning Section 179 deductions, consult IRS publication 534 (Depreciation)." 
TaxCut's approach: "The Section 179 deduction is a nifty little deduction known as the 'rapid write-off provision.' This deduction, authorized by section 179 of the tax code, allows you to immediately deduct up to $17,500 for property placed in service in a given year__rather than depreciating that $17,500 over time." <p>TaxCut also tells users what tax rules are most likely to apply to them. For instance, when you're faced with standard depreciation or an alternative method, TaxCut informs you that most people will use the standard method. <p>Another user-friendly aspect of TaxCut is the way its help screens show up: The explanations of tax terms and IRS rules are provided at the bottom of the screen. With the other programs, the pop-up screens cover the item you are working on, which makes it harder to see how the explanation of the tax rule affects your answer to the interview. <p>TaxCut and TurboTax are priced at $30 to $40. TurboTax retails for $39.95. The table has it at $30-$35 with rebate, but the rebate is only available in some stores, sez ChipSoft's PR. Maybe should just say $30 to $40 here. , while Parsons Personal Tax Edge sells for $19 and CA-Simply Tax for $9.95. (State packages sell separately.) If you're a tax whiz who's comfortable holding a mouse and you want to enter data directly onto IRS forms, TurboTax's speed and sophistication is right for you. But if you need a little help, TaxCut's the way to go. <p> <p><p><p>

With a few bumps along the way, Toys' stock has rewarded investors for 15 years, and the company now controls 25 percent of the U.S. toy market. <a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a>, another superstore star, has become the most recognized name in do-it-yourself home improvement. <a name="NYSE:ODP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14308"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Office Depot</b></a>, which operated only three stores in 1986, is today a 300-store, $2 billion company at the top of the office-supply industry. <p>The superstore format that has worked such wonders in other areas of retailing is only just beginning to enter the computer arena. Today there are over100 computer superstores in the entire country. Half are run by industry pioneer CompUSA, which opened its first superstore in Atlanta in 1988. For those who enjoy the high-risk, high-reward portion of the stock market, the CompUSA story is worth a look.<p>The risks in the stock will look discouraging to some. CompUSA is a relatively new company. Its aggressive expansion plans require plenty of capital, not always available at favorable terms. The company's net profit margins of 1 percent, although typical in high volume/low price retailing, looks tenuous nonetheless. Worst of all, the company's success has attracted competition--notably <a name="NYSE:TAN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11441"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tandy</b></a>, whose resources are considerably greater.<p>But powerful trends are beginning to favor computer superstores over other distribution channels. Not long ago, traditional computer retailers operated on low volume and high price, devoting considerable time and energy to educating and motivating the consumer in the store. Different stores went after different customers. Computerland, for instance, concentrated on bigger corporate customers. Radio Shack offered terrific service for the smaller customer, but selection was limited.<p>Today, consumers have become better educated about personal computers and are more likely to know what they want before they go shopping. And, because they are more sophisticated shoppers, getting a bargain has become even more important.<p>The most successful stores incorporate value, convenience, selection, and service--the computer superstore.<p>Because CompUSA employs the same economies of scale as the other category killers, it also offers lower prices than its competitors. But the company isn't hurt when manufacturers such as Apple and Dell lower their prices: Even as computer prices fall, CompUSA typically retains the same gross margin and actually benefits from price cuts that stimulate sales. As a retailer, CompUSA's business is the selling of technology, not the technology itself. As a result, the company is followed almost exclusively by retail analysts, not computer analysts.<p>How do CompUSA's numbers stack up? Computer superstores--Office superstores are a separate category that also sell computers. account for more than 7 percent of the U.S. retail market, up from 5 percent in 1992 and zero five years ago. Analysts expect superstores to command 20 percent of the market by 1996. These are big numbers but consistent with the patterns set by superstores in other retail categories. <p>What this means for CompUSA: Its 1993 revenues of $1.3 billion could more than triple over the next three years. Earnings are expected to jump from this year's 67 cents per share to 90 cents per share in fiscal 1994 and perhaps $1.50 in fiscal 1995. <p>So far, so good. But, the stock's recent price of $27 is 40 times 1993 earnings and 30 times estimates for 1994. Obviously, the stock has been discovered. Is it, as they say on Wall Street, overbought?<p>In a word, no. Consider what happened to Home Depot's stock. When the company hit the road to raise capital in 1983, the stock stood at a split-adjusted $3 per share, 60 times what the company would earn that year. Although patient investors would have suffered paper losses--the stock fell to about $1 a share the following year on low earnings and didn't permanently pierce $3 until 1988--by 1992, Home Depot was trading around $50.<p>Will CompUSA follow this pattern? Unclear. What is clear is that the stock's high price will inevitably lead to some near-term rockiness. Whenever a retailer is expanding rapidly, store-opening expenses show up on the income statement before the new stores have begun earning their keep. Later on, when the store base has grown, quarterly earnings will become more predictable. For this reason, an investor should always focus on whether the business plan is proceeding as scheduled rather than obsessing over near-term numbers.<p>In Home Depot's case, the ending was a happy one for those who stuck it out. Even those who bought at the peak in 1983 have enjoyed an average annual return of 36 percent through 1992.<p>In CompUSA's case, the single most important issue to monitor is competition. CompUSA's head start over its competitors is an integral part of its story; being first in a region gives the company a chance to develop customer loyalty while preempting competitors. That means expansion is important, even if it holds back profitability in the near term. <p>But what if Tandy's Computer City turns out to be the ultimate winner in computer superstores? This may in fact happen. Prudent investors should, therefore, consider hedging their CompUSA position with a supplementary holding in Tandy (stock recently at $39, price-to-earnings ratio at 18, and earnings projected to grow at 10 percent to 15 percent a year). The bullish argument for CompUSA is first and foremost an argument in favor of the computer-superstore concept, which includes Computer City. And it's a big country: There is room for both companies to succeed.<p>There is not room enough, however, for too many more big players in this game. If other retailers try to get in, investors could lose. Retailers such as <a name="NYSE:BBY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10209"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Best Buy</b></a> (consumer electronics) or <a name="NASD:EGGS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13285"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Egghead</b></a> (computer software) are potential entrants. And if Wall Street gets too excited about the computer-superstore concept and you see throngs of new computer store IPOs, get out.<p>Computer-superstore saturation is, as of yet, far off. Meanwhile, CompUSA continues its expansion, reducing the ability of others to enter the marketplace. Whatever the risks of the CompUSA story, the possibilities for reward are every bit as great. <p>Contributing editor Derrick Niederman is a mathematician turned securities analyst.

 HOW TO MAKE CYBERCASH 
<p>
The next great fortunes will be made by people who want to make
your tv, your telephone, and your personal computer obsolete.
investors who see through the hype can make money, too.  
<p>
 By Jim Jubak and Curtis Lang  
<p>
 Who could have guessed that a company with no track record,
no sales, and no product could have been such a smash hit on
Wall Street? Certainly not the investment bankers hired by the
3DO Company to peddle its first stock offering to the public.
The launch price they set was $15 a share.   
<p>
 Instead, 3DO opened at $18.50 a share on May 4, raced up to
$20, and just kept going. By June 4, the stock closed at $30.75,
giving 3DO a market value of $603 million in the span of a month.
And just what made this fledgling company so special? Answer:
Its presence in a hot new industry that no one as yet even seems
to understand글nteractive technology.  
<p>
 Vague as that moniker may seem, it describes what has suddenly
become the investment craze of the 1990s. Just mentioning it
can send a shiver of excitement through Wall Street긃ike shouting
"Eureka!" in the midst of a gold rush. In the span of ten days
in March, tiny S3 Inc. shot from $15 a share to $25그ll because
the company makes a computer board for (here are those two words
again) interactive technology.   
<p>
 And then there was Broadband Technologies Inc. On June 30, it
bested both 3DO and S3, blasting from an initial offering price
of $18 a share to $25 in its very first day of trading. Investors
who bought Broadband stock at the opening price on that day made
a nifty annualized return of 11,667 percent. And once again,
it happened because investors identified Broadband as an "interactive"
stock.  
<p>
 Indeed, only an investor who's been in Siberia긆r has been trapped
in some virtual reality game귽or the last year hasn't heard at
least something about interactive technology, also sometimes
referred to as interactive media. Depending upon who's talking,
it's the next . . . well, fill in the blank. The next personal
computer industry. The next inevitable step in the information
revolution. The next wave that will transform the global economy.<p>
<p>
 Interactive technology generally refers to the development of
products that help turn mass media into a two-way street, allowing
individual users to respond to and control the information they
receive. It is supposed to tie the worlds of television, movies,
computers, video games, and telephones into one neat package.<p>
<p>
 Already, interactive technology has led to a spate of corporate
marriages no one would have predicted a few years ago. One of
the regional phone companies, U.S. West, forked over $2.5 billion
to Time Warner to get in on the action. Time Warner, in turn,
announced it will spend $5 billion to upgrade its cable systems
for the interactive age. Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), the
country's largest cable television operator, heralded plans to
spend $2 billion on its system. Motorola, Scientific-Atlanta,
and Kaleida Labs, a joint venture of Apple Computer and IBM,
said they will develop a new kind of cable box that will bring
interactive media to the household TV. So will an alliance of
Intel, Microsoft, and General Instrument.   
<p>
 Virtually every studio in Hollywood has launched "new media."
Paramount's working on an interactive version of Star Trek, to
be played on a 3DO machine. TCI, Time Warner, and home video-game
maker Sega are plotting a Sega channel that would deliver video
games to customers over their TVs. To date, the industry newsletter
"Digital Media" has counted 348 such alliances in all.  
<p>
 Amid all the frenzy, however, investors have to know what they're
getting into before they place any bets on interactive technology.
Clearly there is money to be made here. Clearly there will be
more 3DOs, S3s, and Broadbands. But a lot of dollars are also
going to go down the drain.   
<p>
 Remember how videocassette recorders swept the world그nd how
Sony's Betamax didn't? Remember personal-computer companies like
KayPro and Osborne that were supposed to become industry giants?
And remember IBM's bonehead decision to relinquish the software
market to Microsoft?  
<p>
 Investors should remember that technology never develops in
a straight line. There are always unexpected twists and turns
in the road. Interactive technology will be no exception. Apparent
winners will be losers and vice versa.  
<p>
 It's also important to keep in mind that big players like Time
Warner are driven by different motives than most investors. The
big players are operating largely out of fear. The computer companies,
the telephone companies, the entertainment companies, and the
cable companies are all afraid that new technology may somehow
make their businesses obsolete. So they are investing for defensive
reasons as much as anything else, meaning they may be prepared
to lose a lot of money just to keep from being wiped out altogether.
Like sharks who must keep swimming in order to breathe, they
have to do deals or they will die.  
<p>
 Individual investors certainly wouldn't want to operate that
way. They can keep their heads and pick their shots. Better to
let a few good stocks slip past than to jump on board with a
big clunker.  
<p>
 The historical pattern of other developing technologies suggests
that five important criteria will separate the winners from the
losers. First, the winners will be those companies that can make
this complex and difficult technology simple for the customer.
That's the lesson taught by ten years of personal computer software.
And it's why cellular phones have been such a success. Unless
a new product can make our lives easier or better than they are
now, it won't fly.   
<p>
 In fact, when it comes to watching television, there's reason
to wonder just how interactive audiences will want to be. To
many people, the virtue of television is that it requires no
interaction.  
<p>
 Second, access to capital may be every bit as important in determining
success or failure as technological prowess. While cable has
a lot of advantages as the interactive highway of choice, cable
companies are at a big disadvantage, because almost all of them
are straining under huge debt loads.   
<p>
 Third, while the field will initially be dominated by endless
extensions of Mickey Mouse, Mr. Spock, and Michael Jordan, the
big money is in creating new brands. This is the lesson that
movie companies have learned in recent years: that the most profitable
films are the ones that can be developed into new consumer franchises
to sell everything from the movie itself그nd its sequels긊o soft-drink
cups at McDonald's.  
<p>
 Fourth, while the expensive interactive infrastructure of cables
and switches will be built by capital-rich companies, the program
world will belong to schools of nimble little fish moving in
ever-changing patterns.  
<p>
 Finally, most of the long-range profit potential in interactive
technology may lie in what consumers don't want and in what programmers
don't want to give up. It's called advertising.  
<p><p>
<p>
 The dream in a box  
<p>
 On the rack next to a television set in the Sixth Avenue offices
of TV Guide in New York sits a battered Compaq 386 computer.
There are also two cable boxes, the kind that crown 60 million
televisions across the U.S. The equipment is all off-the-shelf
technology available anywhere. The product that TV Guide On Screen
wants to sell seems even simpler.   
<p>
 It is essentially a video version of TV Guide, but instead of
just telling viewers what's on, it will also help them navigate
the expanding array of programming choices. (If there truly are
going to be 500 channels, the remote control as we know it isn't
going to be very handy, and any printed guide will be hopelessly
inadequate.)   
<p>
 TV Guide On Screen president Bruce Davis begins his demonstration
by stabbing a button on his remote. Immediately, the name of
the program he is watching and the time it ends appear across
the bottom of the screen. Another push of the remote and Davis
can see what's on next on any channel and even remind himself
of what programs he thought he wanted to watch. Davis calls this
"turbo channel surfing."  
<p>
 Viewers can also use Davis's product to create their own menu
of favorite channels or sort their options by categories급ports,
news, movies, and children's programming. And Davis thinks he
can deliver his service for substantially less than the 90 cents
a week that TV Guide now sells for.  
<p>
 But the simplest functions of the on-screen TV Guide barely
suggest what Davis thinks his brainchild is capable of. In fact,
the TV Guide functions are really just a Trojan horse to introduce
software that could change information delivery as we know it.<p>
<p>
 The TV Guide venture is owned by a partnership of Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp. and John Malone's Liberty Media Corp., two of the
larger players in TV programming. These giants are not interested
in merely making channel surfing easier. They're interested in
selling. For instance, clicking a pay icon lists all events,
movies, and premium services. A viewer who sees a listing for
a premium program offered on a service to which he doesn't subscribe
can order it by simply pressing the icon. "It's impulse shopping,"
says Davis.  
<p>
 Still another icon is a gateway to the four interactive services
that have been hooked up for this demonstration. A click on the
X*PRESS icon calls up a video text menu. Want to see the day's
headlines on screen? How about all the recent sports scores?
This isn't just passive data, either. The stocks icon yields
continuously updated prices of the shares held in a personalized
portfolio. In the future, a viewer might call up an accounting
icon and pay all of his or her bills.   
<p>
 Davis's dream is for his product to become the operating system
for the interactive culture in the same way that Microsoft's
ubiquitous DOS and Windows programs run 80 percent of the country's
personal computers. (Nobody expects Microsoft to pass up this
market. See "The Battle for the Box," page 66.) Since almost
every manufacturer "builds in" a Microsoft system, Microsoft
collects what is in effect a royalty almost every time a personal
computer is sold. TV Guide would do even better귺ollecting a
subscription fee of, say, $20 a year from every household that
used the product. Davis could then add some more revenue for
billing services or preferential icon placement. Even for a company
such as Liberty Media, which had $156 million in revenues in
1992, that's a sizable morsel. Oh, and X*PRESS, one of the information
services offered on the screen, is also owned by Liberty Media.<p>
<p>
 Nothing that Davis is selling isn't available somewhere else.
What he's really marketing is simplicity of use.   
<p>
 TV Guide On Screen will roll out in stages over the next two
years, Davis says. The first stage, a basic on-screen version
of the guide that is ready to go now, will work on the next generation
of cable boxes that is expected to be available this fall. The
premium service with all its bells and whistles is about 18 months
from market, says Davis.  
<p>
 The system Davis wants to place in virtually every home in America
won't type letters긏et긆r do spreadsheets, but it comes very
close to fulfilling the long-term dream of another industry.
In effect, it's the home computer that the IBMs and the Apples
couldn't get anyone to use. If companies like TV Guide On Screen
are successful, there finally will be a computer in every home.
It won't have a computer-company logo, but it will almost certainly
have a chip from Intel or Motorola or Silicon Graphics inside.<p>
<p>
 Does that make the computer industry nervous? "There is the
fear of being left behind and being preempted," says Geoff Workman,
president of Zelos Ventures Inc., a Bay Area electronic publisher.
There isn't much the computer industry can do about that trend,
except compete, as Apple, Hewlett-Packard, and Toshiba have done
by entering the race for the box. "All of the industries are
maturing, and they're all looking to get into each other's business,"
says multimedia guru Paul Kagan of Paul Kagan Associates in Carmel,
California.  
<p><p>
<p>
The handwriting on the wall  
<p>
 Thinking about the potential of the TV Guide system might also
lead an investor to ponder John Malone. Malone built TCI of Englewood,
Colorado, into the country's largest cable system, with 10.2
million subscribers. From cable service he moved into programming:
American Movie Classics, Black Entertainment Television, the
Family Channel, more than 13 regional sports channels귨alone
owns a piece of each one of them. But he doesn't own them through
TCI. In 1991, he spun off these program services and 2.9 million
subscribers from TCI to a new company called Liberty Media. Since
then Liberty Media and not TCI has added ownership positions
in the nation's only two TV shopping networks, QVC Network and
Home Shopping Network. Cable industry analysts speculate that
Malone expects the Federal Communications Commission to attempt
to break up his empire. But they wonder why he's kept a bigger
personal stake in Liberty Media than in TCI.  
<p>
 On the surface Malone's timing seems odd. It looks like the
cable companies are going to win the biggest part of the interactive
pie. Somebody has to run high-capacity connections귺alled broadband
networks글nto all the homes that want interactive video services.
While it is almost certain that the telephone companies will
convince Congress to let them send movies and other kinds of
information through the copper telephone wires that run into
almost every American home, Congress is moving with a glacial
speed. That has given the cable companies a window of opportunity.
In all probability they have at least two years to sew up turf
without competition. Over the long term, they also will probably
get a big share of the $100 billion annual local telephone business
when that market is deregulated.  
<p>
 But the cable companies will snatch defeat from the jaws of
victory. Somewhere in the middle of building the interactive
infrastructure, almost every cable company in the country근ven
Time Warner글s going to run out of cash. "Capital is critical,"
says technology investor Roger McNamee, and the cable companies
are grossly undercapitalized. The local telephone companies,
in contrast, are overcapitalized. "The cable industry is going
to have a lot of trouble maintaining its independence through
this cycle," McNamee says.  
<p>
 To understand how this situation will play out, just look at
two of the biggest and healthiest cable companies, Time Warner
and TCI, both in a race to improve sagging profits by introducing
new products before the economics of the 1990s catches up with
the debt loads they acquired in the 1980s. TCI, with 19.5 percent
of a heavily fragmented market, and Time Warner, its only rival
enjoying double-digit market share, were both hit hard, like
all other cable operators, when the FCC rolled back rates by
10 percent or more and re-regulated the industry in September
1992. The timing couldn't have been much worse for a debt-encumbered
industry that built its systems using junk bonds.  
<p>
 So just at a time when the industry has less revenue than it
thought it would, cable operators are contemplating expenditures
to upgrade their systems of around $800 a subscriber, Andrew
Kessler, managing director of Unterberg Harris, an investment
banking firm based in New York and San Francisco, estimated in
his April 15, 1993, report. Spending billions on infrastructure
will, they hope, create a host of new services and therefore
get revenue soaring upwards again.  
<p>
 But will it go up enough? "Interactive services over an upgraded
cable infrastructure is a nice concept," wrote Kessler, "but
unless the economics work out, it's a nonstarter. Cable economics
are like payments on third world debt, i.e. they are based on
constantly changing assumptions and driven by the quest to build
now, pay later." Kessler notes that the average cable bill is
now $30 or so, generating some $15 or so to cable operators after
paying for programming. To make an $800 per subscriber upgrade
pay, cable bills must go up $10 to $13 a month. Pay-per-view
movies could generate up to $8 of that.  
<p>
 But it's obviously overly optimistic to presume that all 60
million cable subscribers in America will subscribe to all these
new premium services긆r even that most of them will want to order
pay-per-view movies from a list of names scrolling down the TV.
Frank Biondi Jr., CEO of Viacom, the $1.8 billion cable company
that produces the trend-setting MTV and Nickelodeon channels,
sees only 18 percent of cable households signing up for any interactive
services within the next four to six years. Nonetheless, Viacom
is building an interactive TV test system in Castro Valley, California.<p>
<p>
 The financial squeeze on cable companies means that it probably
would be wise to ignore all the stuff in the financial press
today downgrading companies such as Paramount, News Corp., Sony,
and Disney because they don't have a cable system. If they want
one, they'll be able to buy one. As will the regional phone companies.<p>
<p>
 The coming mass acquisition of cable operators will pay off
differently for the buyers, especially if Wall Street holds true
to form. The entertainment companies will get a boost in share
prices as everyone shouts about synergy. The telephone companies,
with their low costs of capital, switching expertise, and service
networks, will make good money from these systems. (Cable systems
don't have complex switches in their networks. But the telephone
companies do. The switches allow individually tailored program
orders to be sent to individual subscribers.) But don't wait
for the stock market to reward the regional phone companies that
get into cable. The street will probably be focused by then on
their loss of revenue from the deregulation of the local phone
system.  
<p>
 So who will the real winners be? Answer: The program providers.
Companies that give the delivery systems a shot at premium revenue
should be able to cut favorable deals. That's why some people
are high on the Sega Channel, a joint venture announced in April
by Time Warner, Sega, and the nation's largest cable company,
Tele-Communications Inc. Starting in 1994, the channel will deliver
50 different games each month to cable subscribers across America,
24 hours a day, for a monthly fee comparable to that charged
by other premium cable channels. One recent consumer survey indicated
that 22 percent of cable subscribers would probably pay up to
$15 per month for a home video-game channel such as Sega. If
true, that would mean revenue of $198 million per month to be
split among the providers.  
<p>
 To the extent companies like Sega win, however, marginal program
suppliers may lose. When the 500-channel system arrives, there
will be plenty of room for everyone. But until then, cable operators
will be looking for new programming that can generate premium
revenues. Other programmers will get dropped.   
<p>
 And how about the cable companies themselves? Well, it's almost
always better to invest in a company that's being acquired than
in the one doing the buying. Especially when the kind of companies
doing the acquiring are notorious for overpaying. Ironically,
investors in Time Warner may face the worst of both worlds: The
company is debt-strapped but too large to be acquired.  
<p><p>
<p>
Razors & razor blades  
<p>
 The 3DO Company may be one of the most overhyped companies in
the history of technology, a field not given to understatement.
Even as savvy a media analyst as Paul Kagan has gone overboard
more than once. "The last Holy Grail was the VCR because the
VCR enabled you to do things with television and movies you could
never do before," says Kagan. "The next Holy Grail is 3DO, the
magic box that will combine all the parts of the computer industry
with all the parts of the television industry."   
<p>
 Three years ago, Trip Hawkins, founder, chairman of the board,
president, and chief executive officer of 3DO, was a frustrated
video-game designer. He didn't think the Nintendo and Sega machines
he was creating games for were advanced enough to run the games
he imagined. So Hawkins left Electronic Arts, the software company
he'd founded, and set out to make a better box.  
<p>
 At the same time, though, he knew the machine he created could
never be the product that he would make money on. That was the
lesson of the computer industry. IBM, Dell, Apple, and Digital
Equipment Corp. were all taking a beating for one reason: They
make razors when the profit is in razor blades.   
<p>
 Nintendo would be his model. The Japanese company has done so
well for the opposite reason: It created a razor-blade business.
Nintendo did so by building a cheap game player긊he razor그nd
wholesaling it near cost, around $70. (Sega followed the same
strategy.) The cartridge costs $10 to $15 to manufacture, and
sells for $40 to $50.  
<p>
 But those are expensive razor blades, and that's the weakness
that 3DO is attacking. The players for Hawkins's system긍hich
actually will be built and sold by Panasonic and others긍ill
retail for around $700. But the resolution, animation, speed,
and "feel" add up to what Hawkins claims is a 50 times improvement
over Sega. Plus his machine will play music CDs, video CDs, and
photo CDs, as well as interactive game CDs.  
<p>
 3DO plans to make its money in software. Hawkins figures he
can manufacture disks for $1. He has set royalties for software
creators at just $3 a CD. The result, Hawkins hopes: Everybody
will write for the new standard. The low cost of software, probably
$12 a CD, should take some sting out of the price of a player.
A Sega machine and 100 cartridges cost $4,600; a 3DO player and
100 CDs would cost $1,900. 3DO players should start appearing
in stores in October and Hawkins is planning to make 15 software
titles available for the Christmas retail season.  
<p>
 If Hawkins can convince a big enough group of consumers that
the long-term savings make the big up-front investment worthwhile,
he'll be on his way to creating enough volume to drive down the
cost of his player. And that would mean he'd have a successful
new brand. If not, he'll have invented another Betamax.  
<p>
 While 3DO is trying to create a new brand, most of the Hollywood
majors believe they already have valuable ones they can adapt
to the new technology with minimum up-front investment, much
as they have with videotapes. Paramount, for example, has already
licensed Spectrum HoloByte to create an interactive version of
Star Trek: The Next Generation.   
<p>
 Still, it's an open question just how well Hollywood's skills
will translate to the interactive world. To the extent storytelling
is important, it may have a big advantage. But the number of
movie tickets sold has declined in six of the last eight years,
and the number of obsessive moviegoers, clustered in the 13-to-25
age group, is shrinking. Hollywood knows that it's losing that
younger age group to the video-game industry, which was in 1992
a $6 billion market, $1 billion more than ticket sales at movie
theaters.  
<p>
 When it comes to Hollywood, an investor needs to consider the
real assets of each studio independently. Disney has the kids'
market, theme parks, and at least some control over costs. Paramount,
with its Star Trek series of movies and syndicated TV shows,
has shown the ability to execute a successful long-run series
strategy. It also has the most interactive expertise of any of
the Hollywood studios, because of its educational-publishing
division. The company acquired two companies in this area in
1990 and 1991: Computer Curriculum and Macmillan Computer Publishing.
Sony, which owns Columbia and its huge library of entertainment
product, runs the risk of competing with itself. The new CD products
will cut into revenues from its tape-based products, for example.<p>
<p>
 The most promising participants from what we traditionally call
Hollywood, however, may be a new generation of smaller studios
clustered around Silicon Valley.  
<p><p>
<p>
Making money through creativity  
<p>
 Nestled between the Moscone Convention Center and the docks
in a nondescript warehouse in San Francisco, several hundred
creative people from film, animation, and advertising have gathered
to usher in the interactive age under the banner of Colossal
Pictures. Colossal's chief operating officer, Warren Franklin,
is the former general manger of Industrial Light & Magic, the
Lucasfilm special effects group that worked on The Empire Strikes
Back, E.T., Cocoon, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. IL&M won five
Academy Awards while Franklin was there. Stuart Cudlitz, creative
director of new media at Colossal, has done segments for Liquid
Television, an anthology of short, cutting-edge cartoons on MTV.<p>
<p>
 With movies like Jurassic Park, Hollywood has shown it can certainly
produce그nd market극lockbusters. But if the studios plan to play
a part in the interactive future, they'll have to learn how to
think small profitably. "I'm hoping that the change that [Hollywood]
will have to make is to be more responsive to this whole issue
of niche marketing," Franklin says. "They can't necessarily depend
on making giant films that appeal to the lowest common denominator."<p>
<p>
 On this day in June the product is a brief clip of cyberpunk
nirvana that will become part of a four-minute Robocop 2 ride
in an Iwerks theme park. Strapped in seats that move as the camera
angle changes, viewers experience vertigo as Robocop chases villains
on air cycles above a future megalopolis. It cost $178,000. <p>
<p>
 The 45-second clip is graphically spectacular but not truly
interactive. It's just a better roller coaster, and at least
for now, that's all it intends to be. But this is a good place
to get a sense of the economics that could hamper the studios
with their high overheads and expensive crews. Digital production
makes it possible for Colossal to compete at a fraction of the
cost. "A $35,000 computer is a very capable workstation in high-end
computer animation now, whereas a couple of years ago, a $120,000
to $150,000 computer was necessary," says Brad deGraf, who contributed
computer graphics to Robocop 2 and Star Trek V and now is Colossal's
managing director of digital media.   
<p>
 The current generation of studio companies, such as Colossal
Pictures, are all still private. And at the moment they aren't
the way to invest in the changing dynamics of production. But
investors can participate in "digital economics" by going straight
to the producer of intellectual property긊he designers of video
games, computerized theme park rides, and PC software. From an
investor's point of view, these creative companies remove one
crucial element of risk: It will be comparatively easy for them
to adapt their products to whatever becomes the hardware standard.<p>
<p>
 The best company of this sort is probably Trip Hawkins's former
company, Electronic Arts, the video-game designer. Like an old-time
Hollywood studio, Electronic Arts is both creator and distributor.
In 1983 the company shipped its first software products for the
Apple II and Atari machines. Today it is one of the most successful
developers of games for the Sega and Nintendo players. To Electronic
Arts, it really doesn't matter who wins the hardware battle.<p>
<p><p>
<p>
The digital Trojan horse  
<p>
 The most radical forms of the new interactive technology are
the hardest for an investor to play. They are vaguer and at the
same time more powerful. Here investors have to assume the role
of Marshall McLuhan and ask what the medium is saying. To do
that they need to think about how this medium is different from
the one-way media that have gone before. Messages in this medium,
to take just one example, will leave a trail at every step. The
purchase of a book is relatively anonymous, especially if the
transaction uses cash. But the electronic switches at the heart
of the new medium will remember every transaction and every choice.
That memory can be used to reconstruct any individual as a shopper
and as a viewer. Be sure that it will. In other words, the medium
isn't just the message, it's also the messenger.  
<p>
 Consider what's taking place right now in the Manhattan office
of John Reardon, the former president of MTV. When the pundits
talk about interactive TV, most of them foresee a new social
order in which consumers take control of programming and tell
Congress, TV networks, and telephone companies alike what they
want and when they want it. The rhetoric is all about individual
empowerment. Reardon, who is now chief of a new interactive television
company called ZING, sees much the opposite: empowerment for
advertisers.   
<p>
 The ZING device is handheld, sleek, and user-friendly. A tiny
LCD screen receives messages from the TV. When the ZING beeper
sounds and the ZING logo appears on the LCD screen, Reardon explains,
viewers will be able to pile up ZING points, which will be something
like green stamps, just by clicking. Of course, there'll be prizes
for the big ZINGers. And of course, a lot of the ZING moments
will occur during commercials, discouraging channel surfing by
ZING viewers intent on piling up ZING points. The entire ZING
system will sell for $150 per handheld unit.   
<p>
 Being at one end of the interactive ZING system is like having
beeper service with the world's big advertisers on the other
end. Every change of channel and every other entry into the ZING
system gets recorded. Imagine that a ZING viewer is watching
the fly-fishing channel on a 500-channel cable system. Suddenly
ZING provides an opportunity to buy the wizard worm that the
host has been using to haul in bass after bass.  
<p>
 "It asks me, Would you like to purchase this product, yes or
no?' And I press yes, enter," Reardon says. "And it asks in what
quantity, and I say one, enter. It says my state, my style, color,
and all those things. It's all downloaded in a flash. Now this
will do the calculations and come up with the sale price and
the total price and the shipping and handling and all that. And
to order press phone." Reardon points the ZING unit at the black
box near the phone. "Now that's the prototype of the ZING dialer."<p>
<p>
 The folks on Madison Avenue will have to reinvent the advertising
industry once advertising is judged on its ability to generate
impulse sales in hundreds or thousands of niches the instant
the ad is aired. "Madison Avenue is not set up to do this kind
of niche marketing," says Bob Allen, director of new business
development at Modem Media, a Connecticut direct advertising
agency that specializes in interactive advertising currently
available on CD-ROMs, telephones, and fax machines. From 1990
to 1992 Allen's company registered a 103 percent increase in
revenues to $1.4 million.   
<p>
 Say good-bye to the idea of programs and channels as we now
know them. A program will actually be an interface like TV Guide
On Screen only more transparent and easier to use. Watching an
entertainment show on an Australian effort to climb K2, a viewer
might want to buy the mountain parka on the lead climber or want
to know more about the tent the expedition set up at 12,000 feet.
Click and enter a shopping window that offers descriptions of
the gear seen in the program. Or click and enter a menu that
offers more information sources on tents. At least potentially,
interactivity will fuse categories that we now keep separate,
such as programming, advertising, and ordering.  
<p>
 Is it any wonder that everyone is waiting to see what former
Fox chairman Barry Diller will do with a merged QVC and Home
Shopping Network? Except for the major catalog operations, which
have little experience with television, no one else in retailing
has the back end to handle the volumes of orders generated in
short periods of time by successful TV shopping programs. Home
Shopping Network and QVC sold well over $2 billion in merchandise
last year. Big retailers like Macy's have just started getting
their feet wet in electronic shopping. But they'll have to build
their back-end operations from scratch. In addition, no other
TV retailer has the potential to build a fifth TV network, as
Diller does. That kind of program clout would give Diller big
leverage with the cable system operators.  
<p>
 If the future were easy to predict, nobody would make big money
from guessing right, and interactive technology companies just
out of the chute wouldn't trade for a price-to-earnings ratio
of infinity귾ive or take a zero or two. Ambivalence seems the
smart investor's stance. There's opportunity here. Integral Partners'
Roger McNamee scored big by buying 3DO's initial public offering
at $15. But many investors글ndividual and corporate긍ill wind
up taking a bath. "We have a pool in the office about who will
be the first to take a $1 billion loss" in this industry, says
McNamee.  
<p>
 None of the rules of investing긆r of business근ver get repealed
for a new technology. Customers still buy products that they
need or that make them feel good. Companies still need to sell
those products at a price that appeals to the market. Some companies
have advantages in raising capital or in the speed with which
they can adapt to the market that give them an edge over competitors.
And some managements are just better at executing a business
plan. Paying attention to these fundamentals is the best way
to invest in interactive technology.

 AUTO MOTIVE 
<p>
Kirk Kerkorian took a chance on Chrysler and won. Then again,
he could afford to.  
<p>
 By Suzanne Costas  
<p>
 Big money can afford to be contrarian. Yet auto analysts were
surprised by the news in December 1990 that Hollywood billionaire
Kirk Kerkorian had acquired almost 21 million shares of Chrysler
stock, giving him a nearly 10 percent stake in the company. The
third-largest car and truck manufacturer in the United States
continued to face enormous financial pressures, including an
overdependence on North American sales and rising fuel costs
triggered by the Persian Gulf crisis. It was heavily in debt.
The market braced for a dividend cut.   
<p>
 Though Chrysler's third-quarter loss per share of $0.95 was
moderately better than the Street had expected, the outlook for
'91 remained grim. Analysts predicted that industry demand would
fall 7 percent, and they believed Chrysler would have difficulty
maintaining market share. The underlying problems remained: a
weakening economy and, at Chrysler, a shortage of new product.<p>
<p>
 Kerkorian was not deterred. A shrewd investor, he proceeded
to acquire what he considered an undervalued stock. News stories
cited his high regard for Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca as the
principal reason for his betting on the troubled car company.
The shares were purchased through Kerkorian's Tracinda Corporation
between October 11 and December 12, at prices ranging from $10.50
to $13.30. Two years later, his $258 million investment was worth
approximately $558 million.

Hard times in the oil patch forced survival of the fittest
By Suzanne Costas<p>
You don't have to be a good old boy to understand the oil business. When oil prices are high, there are barbecues and crawfish boils; when prices are low, things are considerably less festive. In other words, it's boom-and-bust. <p>
Oil companies have coped with the current downturn through cutbacks, consolidation, and revised strategic planning. They've looked for ways to improve domestic production and have expanded international exploration. <p>
Yet investors have avoided oil stocks like the plague. <p>
Too bad. Any ailing industry has its survivors. Strong management and clean balance sheets, for example, have benefited a number of oil service companies, as have rising natural gas prices and the increase in international exploration. <p>
<a name="NYSE:WII"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12447"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Weatherford International</b></a>, a worldwide leader in tubing and casing services, in addition to specialized rental equipment, reported 1992 net income of $13.8 million, or $0.31 per common share, compared with a 1991 net loss of $6.8 million, or $0.21 per common share. Tidewater Inc., which owns and operates the world's largest fleet servicing the international offshore oil and gas industry, has more than stayed afloat: long-term debt declined by 70% since 1988, while its fleet grew by over 60% through a merger with Zapata Gulf. Because the downturn in the oil business has fueled demand for more reliable seismic information__better data means fewer dry holes__Input/Output Inc. has seen record sales and earnings. The company manufactures geophysical data gathering equipment. <p>
Analysts who expect a rebound in the oil industry over the next few years also forecast a substantial, long-term rally in oil field service stocks. <p>
In the oil patch, patience truly is a virtue. <p>

						 <p>By Andrew Gluck<p>Eighty percent of Tom Holtz's clients have AIDS. Most of the others have cancer, heart disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. They're all terminally ill and are financially strapped in their final days by the high cost of medical treatment. They need cash, and they get it by using their life insurance policies in an unusual way--selling their death benefits (the right to the money their insurance will pay after they die) to Holtz's Dayton, Ohio-based Q-Foil Inc. <p>The sale is called a viatical settlement, and Q-Foil is one of at least 44 companies in the burgeoning viatical settlement business. Since the first viatical settlement closed on April 4, 1989, Affording Care (a non-profit group that distributes financial information and education for the seriously ill) estimates that some 2,300 terminally ill people have sold policy benefits to viatical firms for $200 million, converting their death benefit into a living asset. <p>The catch? Holtz's typical client is expected to live four years and he pays them 25 cents for every $1 of insurance. That means that someone whose heirs could expect $100,000 when he dies, might receive $25,000 today from Holtz. And that's not an unusual discount in the viatical settlement industry.<p>"The business appears ghoulish," says John Freeman Blake, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney and financial planner. "But when you look at it from the standpoint of the terminally ill, these firms are sources of desperately needed capital." <p>By providing cash that helps people live out their lives with dignity and financial independence, viatical settlements unquestionably offer much-needed help. And while the majority of settlements have been made by AIDS patients, people with other terminal diseases are likely to use this new vehicle in growing numbers as word of it spreads. <p>But terminally ill people and their relatives or friends that assist them in financial matters should proceed with caution: Viatical settlement companies often offer wildly differing bids for the same insurance benefits, and the financial difficulties faced by the terminally ill make them vulnerable to profiteers now flocking to an industry where compounded annual returns of more than 25% are common. Although competition from a growing number of settlement firms is driving settlements up, it can really pay to shop around.<p>The term viatical settlement is derived from the lexicon of religion. A viaticum is one of the sacraments in last rites. And true to their lineage, viatical settlements are financial vehicles of last resort.<p>Even before exploring the sale of a life insurance policy, find out whether it's possible to receive an "accelerated benefit" directly from the insurance company. In the past couple of years, life insurers have started offering riders (amendments to policies) that would pay terminally ill people cash on their policies before they die__and they generally pay about 95% of the face value of a policy, far more than viatical settlement companies. <p>The problem is that only about 70 insurers have such riders, and they usually don't apply to employer-sponsored term life policies that most often are viaticated. What's more, they usually don't take effect until the insured has no more than six months to live. Yet with the high cost of medical care today, financial resources can run out long before that.<p>Another alternative to viatication is a loan from friends or relatives against a policy's death benefit. A personal loan or accelerating a benefit from an insurer is better than viaticating because, unlike viatication, the payback is tax-free. That allows for bigger payouts. (At this writing, some question about accelerated benefits remains, but the IRS has proposed rules to make them formally tax-free.)<p>But if an insurer says there's no chance of accelerating benefits and a loan isn't possible, then it's time to explore dealing with the viatical settlement firms. <p>Viatical firms use a simple formula to calculate how much to offer for a policy. Basically, they figure what the money would earn if it were invested elsewhere during the term of the policy holder's life expectancy. They then subtract their interest and profit from the face value of a policy and buy it at a discount. The longer the life expectancy, the less they will pay.<p>That puts a potential policy seller in the awkward position of convincing the viatical company that death is near, warranting a higher settlement, while the viatical company is more inclined to think the policy seller will live longer, decreasing the policy's value. <p>Q-Foil, like other firms, reviews client medical records and confirms life-expectancy assessments made by the insured's personal physician. Then, Q-Foil becomes the beneficiary of the policy and requires that all previous beneficiaries but one sign waivers forfeiting any benefits. As many other firms do, Q-Foil allows one other beneficiary to get between $2,500 and $10,000 in death benefits provided he notifies Q-Foil upon the death of the policyholder. <p>Q-Foil, however, is unique to the industry because it purchases policies from people with longer life expectancies. Most viatical companies buy policies from people with 18 months to two years to live and pay cash settlements of 60 to 65 cents for every dollar of coverage. Holtz will buy policies from people expected to live between three and a half and five years, but he usually pays only 20% to 35% of a policy's face value. He once purchased a policy from a man with a ten-year life expectancy, paying him 10% of the policy's face value.<p>Holtz can afford to take more risk because he uses a controversial approach: When Holtz purchases a policy from a terminally ill person, he sometimes asks them to apply for additional "guaranteed" life insurance policies. They cost a lot more than conventional life insurance but require no physical exams, nor disclosure of having a terminal illness. And a life policy on someone with a life expectancy of only a few years can be lucrative. <p>The practice of buying insurance on terminal patients is derided by some of Holtz's competitors, who say that Q-Foil should give clients a share of the proceeds it expects to make on the guaranteed life policy, and they warn that the tactic could cause financial problems for the small regional insurance companies that offer guaranteed policies. <p>Holtz responds that the point is becoming moot, because all but one insurance company that sells guaranteed life policies has begun asking applicants to disclose whether they know they are HIV-positive. But he adds that the additional insurance enabled him to offer higher settlements on longer life expectancies than anyone else, benefiting his clients.<p>For people in need, the differences in benefits can be critical. While the viatical companies all look at the same data, the conclusions they arrive at about the value of a particular policy can vary widely. For instance, a 38-year-old AIDS patient recently submitted applications to several viatical companies and received bids on his three life insurance policies ranging from 35% to 82% of their total face value. Per Larson, a New York City fee-only financial planner and health economist, says the large disparities in bids for the same policy illustrates that "there is an incredible opportunity to negotiate." <p>David Petersen, a New York financial planner with AIDS and cancer and a founder of Affording Care, recommends applying to at least five viatical companies. "Most of the hard work is done after you've filled out the first application," he says. <p>One option in shopping for a viatical settlement is to enlist the help of a broker. About half of the 44 companies listed by Affording Care are actually brokers, who often get 3% to 6% commissions. "It's okay to go to a broker," says Petersen. "But be sure to go to a true broker." Some brokers sell policies to only one or two viatical settlement companies, which limits the number of bids while adding a layer of expenses. <p>Another alternative is to deal directly with the purchasing companies, which use their own money to purchase policies or raise funds privately in a partnership. Only one of the approximately 25 purchasing companies, Living Benefits Inc. in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is publicly held. <p>"The money these firms have, including the publicly held company, usually comes in big chunks," says Petersen. "They go out and raise cash and are flush for awhile. A purchasing company that is sitting on a cash hoard is likely to offer a better settlement. But there's no way of knowing which are sitting on cash, and people just have to use the dartboard method or apply to all of them." <p>Petersen warns that some viatical firms have strung people along for weeks while they try to raise the money to buy a policy, and others have lowered settlement offers right before a deal is about to close. He recommends walking away from such companies.<p>Someone who is considering viatication but doesn't want to be directly involved in the negotiations may want to consult a financial planner. A planner can help with tax planning issues and usually can structure a settlement so it won't cut off government entitlements, such as Medicaid or Supplemental Social Security Income. While most planners don't have experience in making viatical settlements, they can sometimes make referrals to an advisor who has worked with terminally ill people. <p>
Worth Senior Writer Andrew Gluck reports from New York.<p>-----<p>CAVEAT PATIENT<p>The potential for abuse of terminally ill people in desperate need of cash has raised concerns among state insurance regulators. California and Kansas have enacted legislation that requires viatical companies to register and make consumer-protection disclosures about their business. According to David Lyons, who heads a National Association of Insurance Commissioners' subcommittee on viatical settlements, "there was enough concern relating to viatical settlements" for the NAIC to begin drafting a model law that all 50 states could adopt. With little regulation and no uniform disclosure rules, the present state of the industry demands caution from anyone considering viatication.<p>New York-based Affording Care offers the most complete list of viatical settlement companies and updates it periodically. But Affording Care doesn't rate the companies or report on which ones offer the best settlements and what diseases or stages of disease they specialize in. <p> <p><p>

						We elected a divided government -- are we now ready to let the market fix Social Security and Medicare?<p>
By Walter Russell Mead<p>
In November's campaigns, politicians lied about their intentions, distorted their opponents' records, kissed babies, and slung mud. The one thing they didn't do was talk about the real problems we're likely to face in the next four years.<p>
With so little of importance apparently at stake, one of the lowest percentages on record of those eligible to vote cast ballots to divide authority between a Democratic White House and a Republican Congress. The country -- or at least Wall Street -- suffered an outbreak of euphoria after the election. Powered by a new mantra, "Gridlock is good," the Dow Jones Industrials roared past 6000 on the way to 6500 between election day and Thanksgiving.<p>
I understand why this gridlock looks so attractive, given the propensity, for example, of U.S. senators to sing "Old MacDonald Had a Farm" into The Congressional Record. Republican control of Congress gives Wall Street confidence that there will be no letup in the pressure to balance the budget. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, President Clinton will temper the more extreme initiatives of Republican revolutionaries -- and the market hates all revolutionaries, whether on the left or right.<p>
But gridlock is a lousy way to tackle pressing problems that demand real and perhaps unpleasant solutions. Given the murkiness of both parties' stands during the 1996 campaigns, neither Clinton nor Congress has anything like a mandate for what to do when we face the next recession or for how we should rein in entitlement programs, such as Medicare and Social Security. I'm afraid that the election results mean our divided government will tackle neither of these issues. Instead, the solutions will be worked out by the rough-and-tumble of the market -- a process that is likely to be extremely painful for many Americans.<p>
Let's start with the short-term problem: the dreaded r-word. Wall Street euphoria to the contrary, the odds are much better than even that we're going to have a recession in the next four years.<p>
Since World War II, the average economic expansion has lasted 50 months. The longest peacetime expansion occurred in the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan and George Bush presided over a 92-month business expansion between November 1982 and July 1990. The longest expansion ever began under President Kennedy and, boosted by the Vietnam War, ended 106 months later in 1969. Most of the others were much shorter: Half of the ten since 1945 lasted less than 39 months.<p>
The current business expansion was 68 months old as of Bill Clinton's second inauguration. That makes it already a little long in the tooth by historic standards; if it lasts until the next president takes the oath of office in January 2001, then it will be the Methuselah of American business expansions, at 116 months. Chances are that sometime in the next two to three years the economy is going to head south.<p>
Recessions have always been bad news for politicians. When millions of people lose their jobs, the voters get restive. But a recession in the next four years is going to have an unusually large impact on U.S. politics.<p>
Having sworn -- again -- to slay the deficit dragon in seven years from 1995, both parties loaded all the painful cuts into years four through seven. Those cuts will soon start to bite. Even without a recession, our divided government faces the deeply distasteful choice of either cutting the deficit (and offending millions of voters) or letting it grow (and offending millions of voters).<p>
Recessions, however, make deficits worse. The federal government collects about 20 percent of gross domestic product in taxes. With GDP now at roughly $7.6 trillion, every percentage point of growth means $76 billion of new economic output, of which $15 billion goes to Uncle Sam. The current balanced-budget scenarios assume annual growth of about 2.5 percent, meaning they count on government revenues to grow by about $38 billion every year.<p>
But if -- or when -- a recession comes, we won't get that growth. Assuming a relatively mild recession in which the economy shrinks by only one percentage point, we will see government revenues decline by $15 billion. Add that to the $38 billion a year in revenue growth that our current budget-balancing scenarios rely on, and a recession could easily increase the budget deficit by $53 billion -- almost half of the 1996 deficit of $107 billion.<p>
A recession will widen the gulf that divides the parties. Republicans will blame the recession on high taxes, excessive regulation, and, of course, the deficit. They will argue for tax cuts and spending cuts to get the economy moving.<p>
Democrats will sing a different tune, talking about government's responsibility to help the poor and scoffing at supply-side and trickle-down economics.<p>
Those deep ideological differences will make it difficult for Washington to do anything during the next recession. And while doing nothing may seem okay to most Americans and to Wall Street when the sun is shining, gridlock while people suffer and business activity drops will not produce optimism among consumers or investors.<p>
But this isn't the biggest problem of the next four years. The pitched battle over entitlements is likely to make arguments about how best to help people who are jobless and hungry seem absolutely polite.<p>
Entitlement programs provide a service to all those who need it no matter how much it costs. Social Security is an entitlement and so is Medicare.<p>
Entitlements are wildly popular, and voters are deeply suspicious of any effort to tamper with them. But the costs of Social Security and Medicare are both headed for the stratosphere as the American population ages. Medicare and Social Security costs combined are likely to rise from about 8 percent of GDP in 1996 to more than 15 percent of GDP in 2040.<p>
Both of these programs are currently funded out of special payroll taxes: 15.3 percent of total pay up to $62,700 for Social Security and 2.9 percent of total pay for Medicare. (These taxes are split 50-50 between employers and employees.) If we project current trends, by 2040 Social Security and Medicare withholding taxes could eat up nine-tenths of every worker's taxable pay.<p>
Clearly, that's not going to happen. If politicians proposed tax increases like that, they would be tarred and feathered. What makes things difficult is that the same fate awaits politicians who propose the kinds of cuts in Social Security and Medicare that would keep taxes at or near current levels.<p>
The first Clinton term saw both the White House and Congress wrestling in vain with this dismal arithmetic. The Clinton health-care plan was an attempt to rein in Medicare costs by structural reform in the health-care industry that would limit long-term federal costs. The health-care industry fought back hard. The White House lost that battle, and the Democrats were routed in the 1994 midterm elections.<p>
Next, the Republicans stepped up to the plate. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich led off with an alternative approach to entitlements: scaling them back. The GOP balanced-budget plan aimed at slowing the growth in federal Medicare spending from 10 percent per year to 7 percent. A devastating series of Democratic campaign ads inveighed against the Republican assault on Medicare, and Gingrich became the most unpopular man in the country.<p>
Voters now clearly expect the two parties to come up with a joint plan. At least at the level of rhetoric, both parties have accepted that task. But each party is actually hoping that it can use the entitlements battle to end divided government in its favor. Democrats want to eliminate the Social Security wage ceiling, which would raise at least $58 billion a year -- and put most of the burden on the affluent. Combined with another Democratic idea -- raising the tax rate on the Social Security benefits collected by the affluent -- this would substantially relieve the burden on the federal Treasury and shift the costs to taxpayers who vote Republican.<p>
Republicans argue, in effect, that Democratic voters should pay more of the costs. Raising the retirement age will, for example, not affect professionals who hold mentally challenging but physically undemanding jobs. Investment bankers and, ahem, economic commentators might not mind working at 72, but steelworkers and day-care workers certainly will.<p>
Both parties are likely to support reducing cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits to put such increases in line with new research that shows statistics overstate the rate of inflation. Partial privatization is another option, but designing a transition between the present system, which uses current taxes to pay benefits, and one based on compulsory savings isn't simple.<p>
If some of these problems and solutions had been honestly addressed during the recent elections, I'd have some hope that our politicians could hammer out workable compromises. But the campaigns didn't offer competing visions, and I don't look for Gingrich and Clinton to suddenly lead a meaningful policy discussion now. The choices are too ugly, the problems too far off, and the stakes too high to motivate any politician to engage in anything other than a quick fix.<p>
Like it or not, while Washington dithers, the economy will impose its own solutions. The real value of government retirement benefits for baby boomers will fall -- through inflation, official cuts in benefits, or some combination of the two -- to a sustainable level. Market forces will transform the health-care industry in ways that ensure that the America of 2040 has a health-care system it can pay for. For example, the most expensive forms of care will be rationed. The elderly will rely more on savings and the help of their families; those without supportive relatives or substantial savings will suffer.<p>
Both Wall Street and the public at large are likely to bemoan the gridlock that prevents Washington from taking effective action. But this is what we voted for. It's just that the gridlock we embraced in the feel-good part of the economic cycle won't seem quite as enticing when we face our real problems. <p>

						Tobias vs. Nader <p>
You'll no doubt be criticized for devoting so much space to Andrew Tobias's article on his struggle for auto-insurance reform, so I wanted to extend a hearty thank-you to Worth for running it ("<A HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9610C01.html">Ralph Nader Is a Big Fat Idiot</A>," October). Tobias's account was compelling, witty, engaging -- and infuriating. As a California voter who tried diligently to make sense of the March 1996 ballot measures, I now understand more clearly why I couldn't. Thanks for offering up such pointed insights.
Steve Taravella

A great article: informative, well written, with beautiful graphics. Tobias is careful to balance his criticisms with pats on the back for past accomplishments, but there is no question he has properly gored a couple of generally sacred cows: Nader and Consumers Union. The trial lawyers and California's often illogical "consumer advocates" have been exposed for what they are: self-righteous, blinder-wearing, two-faced drags on the California economy and the true needs of its citizens.
Cameron R. Murray
Roseville, California<p>
Thank you, Andrew Tobias, for your excellent article on Ralph Nader's betrayal. As I read it, I felt a great sense of gratitude for the sacrifices you made in your attempt to correct a very serious problem. What an awesome undertaking to try to topple such a huge mountain of misleading propaganda. I'm glad I no longer live in California, but I'm concerned with how long it will be before the entire nation is experiencing a similar auto-insurance nightmare. Although Props 200, 201, and 202 did not pass, you fought a great fight.
Stephen Burns
Orem, Utah<p>
After staying up very late one night and reading the entire, mesmerizing article by Andrew Tobias, I have concluded that Tobias is my new hero. When I first heard about Props 200, 201, and 202, I was thrilled and thought logic finally had a chance, but I, too, was foolishly swayed by the lies and scare tactics of the opposition. The biggest problem was in the language presented to the voters. If the information had been as clear as Tobias's article, I and many others might not have been so easily swayed.
Neil Stubenhaus
Los Angeles, California<p>
Political-science theory says that any attempt to change the status quo where the benefits are disbursed but the costs are concentrated is likely to fail. I wonder if, in this day and age, a medium like the Internet would be better at disseminating information and rallying affected individuals to action. I wonder, too, if enlisting well-targeted groups (such as Car & Driver's mailing list) or semi-organized groups (such as AAA) might have provided a more focused lobbying effort. Too bad Andrew Tobias's sensible attempt at insurance reform was thwarted by those with vested interests or a sense of dogma gone too far. 
Jean Charles
Briarcliff Manor, New York<p>
Please send me a complete magazine, as I must be missing some pages from the Tobias article. After 25 tortuous pages of the article in my copy detailing the duplicity and arrogance of Ralph Nader and his friends, Tobias then says Nader is a great guy. He proceeds to gratuitously insult a talk-show host (without the nerve to name him) who has not been mentioned in the article. His part must be on some of the missing pages. 
Richard R. Horton 
Grantham, New Hampshire<p>
As a California resident who would have benefited from Propositions 200, 201, and 202, I concluded last year that Ralph Nader cared not about consumers but about his big lawyer contributors. Then I remembered that Ralph Nader is also a lawyer. 
Woody Dauernheim
San Francisco, California<p>
The ever articulate Andrew Tobias was clearly stressed out to find that his eminently fair cause could be opposed, distorted, hacked up, shot down, and eviscerated by so many "good liberals." How could a GL like himself be reduced to accepting the explicitly odious and implicitly "mean-spirited" Charlton Heston as an ally? The pain, the pain! It's too bad Andy doesn't realize that deep in his soul he's a moderate Republican who just fell in with a bad group during his formative years.
Jim Keller
Spring Valley, New York<p>
Tobias states twice that Consumers Union did not provide an analysis of the ballot initiatives he promoted. Not true. We provided Tobias, the media, and the public with a statement of our analysis of all three measures on October 4, 1995; it was even quoted in the ballot argument sent to all California voters. Tobias's statement that we did not review Prop 200 is also untrue. I have a letter from Mike Johnson, the campaign consultant/manager, in which he thanks me for my help in previewing the proposal, and an E-mail message from Tobias that shows I previewed the proposal. His claim that CU is "tightly bound" with trial lawyers is spurious. For 60 years, CU has been an independent voice for consumers and beholden to no commercial interests. On occasion we have publicly and specifically differed with trial lawyers, who certainly do not share our position on no-fault. Tobias's adventure in California politics resulted in an overwhelming loss and, unfortunately, set back the goal of enacting a consumer-supported no-fault insurance measure, the kind Consumers Union has urged.
Harry Snyder
Consumers Union
San Francisco, California<p>
Andrew Tobias's novella about the defeat of three anti-tort propositions on the California ballot last March is fiction. Far from the noble venture he wishes to portray, Tobias's role in backing the measures bears more resemblance to that of Captain Ahab obsessively hunting Moby Dick -- only this time the quarry is the fundamental American right to go to court. <p>
Tobias asserts that I somehow tricked every citizen group in California, Ralph Nader (everyone knows how easy it is to fool him), and three million voters into rejecting the proposals. Here's the truth: California voters opposed the measures because they were designed to enrich insurance, tobacco, oil, and high-tech companies and other big-business sponsors. For the first time in the nation, the corporate rampage against consumer-protection laws, known as tort "reform," was presented directly to voters and, despite a $15 million campaign budget, decisively rejected.<p>
The proclaimed targets of the March initiatives were greedy trial lawyers and frivolous lawsuits, but it is public access to the judicial branch that the corporations want to crush. The civil justice system is far from perfect. But it is the only remaining branch of government in which an average American can take on the wealthy and the powerful and where truth and justice still have a fair chance over money and influence. Like all tort "reform," the propositions would have left consumers more vulnerable than ever to rip-offs, layoffs, and irresponsible conduct. <p>
The strategy of the Alliance to Revitalize California -- the consortium of Silicon Valley corporations, Wall Street investment firms, and wealthy CEOs that backed the three initiatives -- was to depict Proposition 200 (the no-fault initiative) as a populist measure. It was a Trojan horse, necessary to sneak the two other initiatives past the voters in a screw-the-lawyers political orgy. <p>
Yet no-fault was a solution in search of a problem in California, where, contrary to Tobias's assertions, a 1988 ballot measure regulating the insurance industry's outlandish waste and inefficiency succeeded in lowering auto-insurance premiums by 4.5 percent between 1989 and 1994 (the rest of the nation saw premiums rise an average of 30 percent), saving drivers an estimated $12 billion. <p>
No-fault, by contrast, is an inherently more costly system because it pays the guilty as well as the innocent people involved in a car accident. The average auto-insurance premium rose 45.6 percent between 1989 and 1994 in no-fault states -- 33 percent more than in liability states. Besides California, the states with the lowest rates of premium growth since 1989 are Georgia, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. They all repealed their mandatory no-fault systems. Connecticut repealed its no-fault law in January 1994; premiums fell 10 percent that year. <p>
Prop 200 would have cut policy benefits to the bone and, at the same time, completely blocked the right of injured car-accident victims to seek compensation in the courts. Here's how it would have worked: Say a reckless driver blows through a stop sign and seriously injures you and your family. Once the minimum benefits of the no-fault policy ($50,000 to cover medical bills and lost wages) are exhausted, you're in big trouble. You're forbidden from going after the driver in court -- no matter how serious your injuries, how negligent the motorist, how wealthy he is, or how large his insurance policy. <p>
In its effort to reduce costs, the plan exacerbated no-fault's other congenital defect: its profound departure from the American tradition of individual accountability. Conceptually, no-fault treats good drivers and bad drivers the same. This is not an endearing quality in California, where the automobile is an integral part of everyday life, nor is it congruent with the state's contemporary politics of "personal responsibility." No-fault means your fault when it comes to your insurance company.<p>
Tobias has never acknowledged the cruel, and ultimately fatal, expediency of eliminating the right of consumers to go to court against a reckless driver. Nor has he been held to account for his actions in Hawaii in the spring of 1995. At the time, State Farm, the nation's largest auto-insurance company, was promoting "pure no-fault" legislation with an expensive public-relations campaign across the state. Lured by the limelight, Tobias was squired around Honolulu by State Farm's public-relations people in support of the bill. He even made an appearance in the insurer's newspaper ads, arguing there would be a 45 percent rate reduction if the bill passed. (The reduction was fraudulent; independent experts concluded that the bill was drafted in a way that would allow insurers to avoid reducing rates by even one penny.) Governor Ben Cayetano subsequently vetoed the legislation.<p>
In California, Tobias's most inexcusable capitulation involved packaging no-fault with two other proposals that would have severely eroded the rights of injured or defrauded consumers. Proposition 201 was the prize for the Wall Street and Silicon Valley CEOs, speculators, and high-tech moguls who financed the three initiatives. It would have forced consumers who had been swindled out of their savings, pensions, or IRAs to post a bond to cover the thief's legal fees before filing a lawsuit against him. Worse, if the investor lost the case -- or won, but got less from the jury than the defendant had offered to pay -- the investor would then forfeit the bond and pay all the defendant's legal expenses. The obvious effect: to prevent people from pursuing justice. <p>
Proposition 202 was even more insidious. The proposition would have cut lawyers' fees by up to 50 percent. But whose lawyers? Not the lawyers for insurance companies like Transamerica, a heavy contributor to the initiatives. Not lawyers for Intel; the company and its chairman, Gordon Moore, kicked in more than $1 million. Instead, it limited the fees of lawyers who work on a contingency. These attorneys represent consumers who can't afford to pay $300 an hour for legal help. They are, in effect, the private cops of our legal system. Cutting their fees in half was designed to discourage them from taking cases against wealthy defendants.<p>
When it comes to promoting the destruction of tort laws, big business prefers to rely on its multimillion-dollar "sales force": think tanks like the Manhattan Institute; academicians like University of Virginia law professor Jeffrey O'Connell, who has been paid to consult with no-fault supporters; and Tobias. But California voters are too savvy to be fooled by trickery. So the proposition sponsors created a "virtual consumer group" populated by PR strategists and other flacks.<p>
A political fund-raising company, incongruously named Progressive Campaigns, was paid $5.3 million by the tort deformers for its "grassroots" work on behalf of the initiatives. Bill Zimmerman, a onetime liberal political consultant, claimed to be a consumer advocate in support of the measures; his political consulting firm was paid $766,000 by corporate sponsors in the last 12 weeks of the campaign -- pretty good for a "consumer advocate." <p>
Tobias also adopted a new identity as a "consumer advocate" in a constant stream of letters, telephone calls, and E-mail to citizen leaders who had come out against the three propositions, urging that they recant. But most dismissed him, perhaps because they agree with me that he's a kook. Defeated, he now mocks Nader's opposition to the initiatives, concluding his article with a sniveling of praise. 
A few more corrections: First, I was not, as Tobias asserts, forced to resign from the organization known as Voter Revolt. Second, the fees and expenses obtained by our nonprofit organization for successfully challenging unjustified-rate cases are returned to our organization. I do not, as Tobias implies, keep any of this money. <p>
Apparently, Tobias just can't comprehend the commitment Nader and I share to defending and advancing the civil-justice system that protects Americans injured by the misbehavior of others. When lawyers agree with our positions, we welcome their support. When lawyers compromise consumers' interests in a strong legal system, or when they propose settlements in airline or automobile class-action lawsuits that give consumers too little, Nader intervenes in opposition. When insurance companies jack up rates without justification or sponsor proposals like Prop 200 to enrich themselves at the expense of injured motorists, Nader can be counted on to stand up for the average person. For 35 years, Ralph Nader has been America's public citizen for the consumer's health, safety, and economic well-being. He has never benefited personally from any of his work, which is why so many rightly consider him an American hero.
Harvey Rosenfield
Los Angeles, California<p>
Andrew Tobias replies: Harry and Harvey's letters don't tell the entire truth. The October 4 "analysis" Harry Snyder speaks of did not compare Prop 200's proposed system of auto insurance with the current system. An objective analysis of that sort is exactly what voters would have needed to make an intelligent choice -- and exactly what consumers look to Consumers Union to do. As for the letter from Mike Johnson, surely Harry knows, or should have known, that it was sarcastic. <p>
If Harry had fulfilled his responsibility to Consumers Union members, objectively comparing for them the pros and cons of Prop 200 and exposing the deceptive statements of the trial lawyers and their paid surrogates, we might well have won. Instead, voters (and other citizen groups who look to CU for leadership) trusted Consumers Union, so the status quo was retained.<p>
Harvey Rosenfield thinks that's fine because no-fault was "a solution in search of a problem in California." Wow. Rates are so high in California that nearly 30 percent of the drivers on the road (and perhaps 50 percent of the accident causers) are uninsured -- so high that many of those who are insured buy the legal minimum $15,000 coverage. No problem, says Harvey. Yet if you are hurt by one of these drivers -- or by a hit-and-run driver or in a one-car crash or in a crash where you can't prove the other driver was at fault -- you get nothing, or next to nothing, from your right to sue.<p>
Under Prop 200, by contrast, the standard policy -- which the Rand Corporation estimated would cost people less than they pay today -- would have provided up to $1 million in medical, rehab, and lost wages in all those cases. And even more to pedestrians and kids on skateboards. (And automatic bare-minimum $50,000 coverage to every child in California, no matter what.) Harry and Harvey see no virtue in that. They are untroubled that $2.5 billion of the auto-insurance premiums Californians pay each year goes to lawyers -- more than to doctors, hospitals, rehabilitation specialists, and chiropractors combined. They are untroubled that drivers in California are more than three times as likely to fake "soft tissue" injuries as drivers in Michigan (the one state with close to true no-fault) and that honest consumers wind up paying the tab. <p>
Yet Harvey says Prop 200 was "a solution in search of a problem."<p>
Much the same is true in Hawaii, where -- Harvey is right -- I did join State Farm (a mutual company, owned by its policyholders) in supporting a bill the Hawaii legislature had passed by a wide margin. It would have slashed insurance premiums by cutting out most of the legal expense and fraud. The governor, a former trial lawyer, vetoed it, and I flew out to Hawaii to urge override. Let me offer Worth readers the same Hawaii deal I got: It's an all-expense-paid vacation. That is, you have to pay all your own expenses, as I did; you have to go in late June and wear a suit and tie the whole time; and you have to spend that time, unpaid, talking about auto-insurance reform. But, yes, you do get to be driven to appointments by a PR guy in a sedan. Any takers?<p>
There's a great deal more that I take issue with in Harvey's letter. Send me a self-addressed manila envelope, and I'll be glad to provide further details.<p>
Editor's clarification: On December 17, 1995, The Sacramento Bee reported that Harvey Rosenfield said that no more than 10 percent of Network Project's donations in 1994 came from trial lawyers. Tobias's article cited this as evidence that Rosenfield had lied about the support the consumer group received from trial lawyers. <p>
A 1994 IRS filing by Network Project lists a total of six individuals who gave a total of $60,000 to the group, an amount equal to 15.4 percent of its total gift receipts in 1994. All are trial lawyers. This list, however, is limited to contributions of $5,000 or more and accounts for only 42 percent of Network Project's total receipts. Thus, it is impossible to determine from this document what other direct contributions, if any, the group received from individual trial lawyers. The filing lists two other contributions from two consumer foundations created at the behest of a law firm to distribute the proceeds of a class-action lawsuit. These total $102,282, or 26 percent of Network Project's 1994 gift income.<p>

						By Todd G. Buccholz<p>
"Hell no, we won't grow!" seems to have been the fight song of the world's major economies the past few years, in defiance of perennial predictions for a synchronized global recovery. Look beyond the U.S. and the U.K. and you have to squint pretty hard to find much in the way of economic success since 1991. Japan has been struggling with a banking crisis and a stock market still more than 40 percent off its peak. Germany and France have been losing the fight to push their unemployment rates below 10 percent. And Latin America is still wincing from the devaluation of the Mexican peso in 1994. You could've slept right through 1996 and not missed a blip on the world's economic radar. Seldom have economists been so successful simply by extrapolating recent boring trends.<p>
And yet most major equity markets have appreciated this boring state of affairs. After a stellar 33 percent leap in 1995, the Dow Jones average jumped 22 percent through the first ten months of 1996. Over the same period, Germany's DAX climbed 21 percent and Sweden's OMX index 24 percent. Even Brazil staged a recovery, racking up a 53 percent gain for investors. There's little mystery here, however: It's about low interest rates. Lower rates make stock dividends seem larger, assets more powerful, and liabilities less threatening. If investors see that bank CDs and Treasury bills are paying a paltry 5 percent, they're more likely to put their money in the stock market.<p>
We've had gloriously low world interest rates for two reasons. First, governments are squeezing their deficits and borrowing less from the private sector. The U.S. budget deficit has dropped to about 1.4 percent of gross domestic product, and Europe is racing toward the ambitious goal of 3 percent of GDP; of the G7 countries, only Japan has actually pumped up its deficit. Second, and more importantly, we have low global interest rates precisely because so many economies are in the dumps. Few people or firms want to borrow when their economy looks feeble. In 1996, GDP growth in the developed world averaged just 2.2 percent, barely enough to prevent unemployment from rising. Yet inflation could not be found; it actually slipped from 2.4 percent in 1995 to 2.2 percent in 1996. This goaded central banks into cutting official interest rates. Perversely, this suggests we've got higher stock prices because these economies look so pathetic. As Oscar Hammerstein's King of Siam says, "It's a puzzlement."<p>
Will the puzzle pieces remain in place in 1997? Herbert Stein, an economic adviser to Presidents Nixon and Ford, once said, drolly, "If something cannot go on forever, it will stop." And the trend of sluggish growth and rising stock prices cannot go on forever. But what no one knows is whether it will stop with an exciting plunge into a recession -- complete with crashing equities -- or be replaced by the blissful synchronized global growth that makes money for people everywhere. The equity markets have been expecting the latter, counting on a delicate balance of events that will permit economies to grow and firms to return to profitability without triggering inflation or a surge in the demand for credit (either of which would punch up interest rates). I suppose this bliss is possible, but I'm doubtful. Among other dangers, three rather large factors will confront the world's markets with enormous risks during the year: (1) the flow of Japanese capital, (2) the impact of Asian economies on commodity prices, and (3) the political trends in Europe.<p>
Land of the Rising Bank Debts<p>
We've probably all heard about the "too-big-to-fail doctrine": When you owe the bank $100, you're in trouble; when you owe the bank $1 million, the bank's in trouble. Actually, financial markets everywhere might be in trouble in 1997. Japan has been the world's biggest creditor, but its banking industry has looked bankrupt. After years of stonewalling, the Japanese government admitted last year that the top financial institutions carry more than $117 billion in bad loans. Many private firms estimated that the figure is much higher. Nor are private-sector banks the only ones drowning in red ink. The government itself has seen its budget deficit explode to about 5 percent of GDP. Compare that with the U.S., where the budget deficit has shrunk to just 1.4 percent. Even Sweden has stomped its budget deficit from 10.8 percent of GDP in 1994 to just 4.4 percent in 1996.<p>
Despite the tide of red ink, Japan continues to shovel money out its doors to the rest of the world. Several forces are contributing to this movement. First, there's terribly sluggish bank lending, growing at less than 2 percent a year. The Bank of Japan pushed its official discount rate all the way down to 0.5 percent in September 1995. Normally such a drastically low rate would send bank lending off the charts, but not in Japan. Imagine: The central bank is practically giving money away -- and there are few takers. That's because business prospects continue to look dim, and borrowers don't seem too creditworthy during the fifth year of near-recession. Small and medium-sized businesses are finding it especially tough to qualify for loans, so the banks send their money abroad.<p>
Second, Japanese investors are shoveling their savings into foreign markets. Japanese financial institutions have been big buyers of U.S. Treasurys for years, of course, and own over $283 billion worth. But there's a new trend to grapple with: Ma-and-pa investors are now smitten with foreign bonds as well. Japanese brokerage houses have been offering seminars to inform small investors that they can earn big returns by buying government bonds from the U.S., Germany, Canada, and Australia. The Nikkei newspaper runs ads promising great results. And in the past year, these bonds have in fact been bargains. Not only have the prices of Australian bonds, for example, gone up significantly, but the Australian dollar appreciated 12 percent against the yen in the first ten months of 1996, giving investors a supercharged return. The word in Japan is that the mas and pas raking in these returns have been directing their friends to follow the yellow brick road to foreign investments.<p>
Finally, Japanese money takes vacations. Japanese tourists have more than tripled in number during the past ten years, supporting the service industries of major countries throughout the world. Though tourism is often dismissed here as a leisure activity, technically it's one of the biggest American exports -- when foreigners stay in a U.S. hotel, it counts as an export.<p>
All this adds up to a world so used to Japanese savers -- with their 15 percent savings rate underwriting the rest of the world's investments -- that shifts in Japan's behavior can rock the international economy. For instance, should the Bank of Japan decide that its 0.5 percent official discount rate is too low in the face of an imminent recovery, a rate hike might produce a credit squeeze in Japan, and foreign investments would look less attractive. Keep in mind that foreign investors, led by the Japanese, rushed to U.S. bond auctions in 1996 and purchased about three-quarters of our new debt. If the Japanese change their domestic interest rates, world interest rates will be driven higher. Remember when I said that equity markets have been nourished by extraordinarily low interest rates?<p>
The Mysterious East and Its NOT-SO-HOT Commodities<p>
That scraping sound you heard last fall was the sound of commodity prices skidding in response to disappointing world economic growth. Except in the case of oil -- prices are still bubbling from the dashed expectations of Iraqi oil exports -- soft commodity demand demonstrates that a synchronized global economic recovery is more a dream than a reality. From late April to early November 1996, the Commodity Research Bureau Index dropped nearly 10 percent. First the industrial economies struggled to move forward during the past few years, next Latin America hit a brick wall in 1995, then the one solidly growing region (non-Japan Asia) took a hit in 1996, and the pressures in the commodity markets relaxed.<p>
I'm not talking recession in Asia, but Asia's flying Tigers (Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia) and Dragons (Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Singapore) have stopped roaring and breathing fire. South Korea slowed from 9 percent GDP growth in 1995 to about 6.5 in 1996, China from 10.2 percent to 8.5, and Singapore from 8.9 percent to 7. Nothing to be ashamed of, but Japan used to grow at similar stratospheric levels -- until its economy matured. Now Japan would feel lucky to post 3 percent growth in GDP. These Asian countries knew they, too, would someday mature and slow their pace. But they didn't expect to do so this soon.<p>
A lull in Asia's rapid growth could send ripples -- or tidal waves -- abroad. Precipitately slowing exports worry the financial markets and could lead to Mexico-like crises. During the first five months of 1996, Asia's exports inched along at 7 percent growth, compared with nearly 30 percent over the same period in 1995. But imports -- ranging from machines to equip new factories to consumer goods purchased by slightly wealthier workers -- didn't slow as quickly, and in 1995 Thailand and Malaysia registered current-account deficits greater than 8 percent of GDP. If this continues and their export machines can't get up to full speed again, investors may get nervous about the creditworthiness of these countries, driving up interest rates and further slowing investment and growth.<p>
On the other hand, if the now tamer Dragons and Tigers somehow rebound in 1997, a big bounce in commodity prices might give the world's central bankers the inflation jitters. Oil looks especially vulnerable to any Asian surge. In the past 20 years, Asia -- excluding Japan -- has tripled its oil consumption (from 3.6 million barrels a day to 11.2 million in 1995) and more than doubled its share of world oil consumption (from 6.4 percent to 16 percent). So far, this hasn't shaken oil markets much, because China has essentially been energy self-sufficient. But watch out: China will be a heavy importer of energy in the next century.<p>
True, higher commodity prices in the recent past have not sparked worldwide inflation. If you looked only at commodities in the spring of 1994, you would have expected a big jump in inflation when the CRB Index leaped 6 percent between April and May. Yet nothing happened, because this spike took place when most of the world was in recession. World output in 1997 might not be so flat. Last fall, the Bank of England raised interest rates, the only upward move by a G7 country in 1996 (every other G7 country slashed rates last year). If the BOE is seen as a leading indicator of global monetary policy, the relaxed and complacent commodities markets will liven up and signal a rebound in world growth.<p>
All Quiet on the Western Front?<p>
For now, European politics appears as dull as European economies. Where are the masses of striking Parisians paralyzing public services and leaving commuters stranded in their gridlocked Peugeots? Where are the fractious Spaniards accusing their former prime minister Felipe Gonz涇ez of aiding domestic terrorists? Where are the Social Democrats in Germany dismissing Chancellor Helmut Kohl as a bumptious relic of the past? And where are the Communists of Italy threatening to overturn the social order? Addressing just this last question dramatically explains how much Europe has changed. Believe it or not, the Italian Communists have become willing partners in a center-left coalition government that is straining to cut public spending!<p>
Put simply, Europe has adopted the "bond-market paradigm" that U.S. Treasury secretary Robert E. Rubin sold to President Clinton at the outset of his first term -- cut spending, raise taxes, cut the deficit, and let the resultant lower interest rates buoy the economy. But in Europe, there's a twist: The governments are trying to rein in deficits and inflation so Europe can adopt a single currency in 1999. So far, deficits are edging down, and interest rates have plummeted and converged. Spanish ten-year bonds yielded over 3 percent more than German bonds in October 1995; by November 1996, that margin had been cut almost in half.<p>
If this progress continues, a single currency and a single official interest rate will prevail in Europe (outside the U.K. and Sweden, which have opted out of the European Monetary Union). But a big speed bump looms on the road to European unity. And, to borrow a phrase from Clinton's 1992 campaign, it's the economy. Europe has lower interest rates and lower budget deficits coming, but it also has rising unemployment. The jobless rate in France climbed from 10.4 percent in 1992 to 11.8 percent in 1996, while in Germany it jumped from 8.5 percent to 10 percent. The bond-market paradigm may have delighted European Union bookkeepers in Brussels, but it isn't creating jobs on the Continent.<p>
The danger this year is that voters will become fed up with the theoretical benefits of tight fiscal and monetary policies and begin bellyaching about "trivial" matters -- like paychecks and jobs. But any sign that Europe is backing away from the bond-market paradigm will injure global bond markets. Kohl faces reelection in 1998, as does French president Jacques Chirac in 2002. You can trust Kohl to maintain his commitment to the European Union, but Chirac is under attack from his fellow center-right "allies," as well as from the opposition Socialists. Will he bend or break? Watch the streets of Paris: They've been awfully calm lately.<p>
There are, of course, other risks in the world that might roil the global equity markets. In Russia, Boris Yeltsin and his repaired heart may be regarded as a key test case for the durability of new capitalist countries after they've thrown out their Communist past. If Russia receives a failing grade -- by, say, relapsing into political chaos -- investors might sour on China's future. Investor confidence might be crimped in Germany, too, which is seen as economically vulnerable to Russian disaster. Here, as in other potential trouble spots, the echoing interconnectedness of the global markets is on display.<p>
The Olympic Games, with its interlocking rings and its ability to bring the world together, furnish an apt metaphor for the markets as they move from 1996 to 1997. The world economy walked a balance beam in 1996, carefully skirting recession on one side and inflation on the other. The routine received a high grade from the financial markets but a low grade from the citizenry, which cares more about jobs than about debt-to-GDP ratios. It's hard to imagine keeping this balance throughout 1997. The central bankers, who thrive in this kind of low-inflation sport, will probably be forced to take up a more stressful event this year. Like the modern pentathlon, perhaps, that run-and-shoot competition.<p>

						Maybe 1997 will be another perfect year -- low inflation, modest growth, and a great stock market. More likely, investors will get only two out of three.<p>
By Jim Jubak<p>
Does it get any better than this? At the beginning of 1996, investors worried that the economy would grow too fast, inflation would pick up, and the Federal Reserve would send the financial markets tumbling by raising interest rates. Or, just as bad, the economy would slow too rapidly, corporate earnings would fall, and that would take down the stock market. But the economy has avoided both the rock and the hard place. Growth has chugged along near the Federal Reserve's target of 2.5 percent. Inflation has hovered around 3 percent. And the Fed, professing itself content, left interest rates alone in September and November. Corporate earnings have not only continued to increase but have actually picked up a bit of speed recently. Even the election fulfilled Wall Street's dreams: It confirmed the status quo. In fact, the current economic recovery -- at 67 months (as of November), the second longest in United States history -- looked strongerat the end of the year than it did for most of 1996.<p>
It's no wonder that the stock market continued its winning streak -- now dating back to October 1990. On November 14, the Dow Jones Industrials blasted through 6300 for the first time, closing at 6313. "The perfect economy has got even more perfect," says Ben Zacks of Zacks Investment Research in Chicago, summing up the current view on Wall Street. <p>
And that's precisely the problem. At this level, the market is assuming that what has been dubbed the Goldilocks economy can spawn yet another great year in 1997. It had better. Only if this "just right" economy delivers the wildly optimistic corporate earnings that Wall Street analysts now predict will investors see returns of 10 percent on the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index for the year. Even a little imperfection will likely produce a flat to negative year -- as much as a 7 to 12 percent drop in the S&P 500 -- in 1997. "The risk-reward ratio is extremely unfavorable for 1997," says Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co.<p>
But investors don't have to stay blindly committed to this market or move in a rush to the sidelines. There is a third alternative. The upcoming year should reward not the indexer who mimics the entire market but the stock picker who targets specific sectors. A reading between the lines of the predictions of Wall Street economists and market strategists suggests the outlines of a winning strategy for 1997. Best of all, this strategy can be the foundation for a portfolio that should thrive for years to come.<p>
Try Not to Worry<p>
Why does Wall Street think the porridge is just right? Because it believes it sees the potential problems clearly enough to discount them. The possible threats fall into five areas. All will bear watching in 1997 -- both individually and collectively.<p>
Consumer spending. Consumers could turn reluctant. Susan Sterne, chief economist at Economic Analysis Associates in Greenwich, Connecticut, is a worrywart about the state of consumers' wallets. She feels that consumers are under more strain than the numbers show. Her evidence is admittedly anecdotal. Wal-Mart's television ads push a Christmas credit card rather than low prices. Sears, which records 60 percent of its sales on its store-brand credit card, is testing a co-branded MasterCard. "The only reason you do that is if you're afraid you've tapped out your own cardholders," says Sterne. If she's right, consumers might well frolic at Christmas and then abandon stores in January and February. That could result in rocky earnings in the first quarter of 1997.<p>
True, yet with consumer-confidence numbers at record levels and banks continuing to push new credit cards and higher limits at consumers, a mass decision to stop spending and pay off debt instead seems -- at least at the moment -- unlikely.<p>
Demographic shifts. Demographics could take a big bite out of U.S. consumption, slowing the economy. Richard Hokenson, demographer for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York, notes that in 1997 the number of 25-year-olds in the population will drop by about 10 percent. The last time there was a decline this big was 1973, not exactly a banner year for the stock market or the economy. The latest drop, Hokenson projects, could lead to a consumer recession.<p>
Even if Hokenson's forecast of a demographic recession in 1997 is extreme, his larger point is certainly valid. An aging population will drive down economic growth rates in the U.S. Most economists agree that as the baby boomers age they'll start saving more, and that reduces the demand for things. Consumer spending closely tracks consumer age. For example, the number of 25-year-olds in the U.S. population peaked in 1986 at 4.5 million. Not coincidentally, 1986 also marks a historic high in housing starts (at 1.8 million) and car and truck sales (at 16.3 million).<p>
All in all, though, the demographic argument seems to support a slow-growth rather than a negative-growth scenario. The aging of the U.S. population is probably one reason this recovery has been among the weakest on record, but it doesn't argue for no growth in the diversified U.S. economy.<p>
Inflation. A mere whiff of inflation could spook the Federal Reserve and the financial markets, since they already appear to have declared victory on the inflation front. The minutes of the September 24 meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee show that Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan argued against a rate hike, saying that inflation wasn't apparent in the numbers yet. A month later, at an October speech to the conference board, Greenspan strongly hinted that he believed current measures overstate the inflation rate. What's more, Wall Street assumes that the committee studying this issue, chaired by former Council of Economic Advisors head Michael Boskin, will go even further and declare that inflation is now effectively zero and has been for some time.<p>
Inflation could come from two sources: wages and raw materials. While the average number of hours worked held steady, average hourly wages increased in September, continuing a trend that began earlier in the year, and the Federal Reserve districts reported "steady pressure to increase wages" in most sections of the country. <p>
Oil prices climbed from August to October, rising about 25 percent, before retreating briefly in November. If the increase sticks, it could add as much as 0.3 percent to the inflation rate in the U.S. But with new oil supplies coming on-line, energy prices should rise only moderately in 1997, says Steven Strongin, director of commodities research at Goldman Sachs.<p>
Metals won't be the commodities pressure point either, unless economic growth picks up drastically in Japan and Europe. Grain? The current crop is the second largest in history. The global economy hasn't experienced significant commodities-based inflation for the past two years, says Strongin. But he also sees nothing on the horizon that strongly argues for a big change in 1997. Oppenheimer's Metz was alone among the analysts we talked to in suggesting that global growth would be strong enough in 1997 to start serious commodity-price inflation.<p>
Treasury trouble. Global investors and central banks could abandon the U.S. bond market. In the past three years, the U.S. has accumulated a current-accounts deficit (that's the value of goods and services we export minus the value of goods and services we import) of $436 billion -- about the total estimated savings accumulated in the rest of the developed world during that period. A good deal of the cash to finance that deficit has come from foreign central banks. They currently hold over $600 billion in U.S. Treasurys, up about 20 percent in the 12 months ended October 1996.<p>
Why are foreign central banks so willing to hold our IOUs? An October study by Goldman Sachs provides some interesting answers. Higher interest rates are important. With Japanese bonds paying just 0.5 percent and German interest rates also low, U.S. Treasurys are a great place to park cash. But, according to Goldman Sachs, that's just part of the reason. About half the balance is probably a result of central banks' buying dollars in order to weaken their own currencies against the dollar. That would make Japanese and German imports more competitive -- important to two governments trying to get their own economies rolling.<p>
The policy has had its effects. After hitting a high of 85 yen to the dollar in June 1995, the yen fell to 112 this October. In pure currency terms, an American orange in Tokyo is now 32 percent more expensive, and a Japanese Lexus in Los Angeles is now 32 percent cheaper. (In the real world, producers try not to pass on all of the higher prices caused by currency shifts. The price of a Lexus won't drop this much, because when the yen was more expensive, the car's maker, Toyota, found ways to cut costs instead of devastating sales by passing all of the price increase on to consumers.)<p>
Overseas holdings of U.S. Treasurys present two dangers for the "just right" economy. Foreign banks could decide their economies are on the road to recovery and stop accumulating dollars -- or even, gasp, sell some of their Treasurys. That would send U.S. interest rates higher. But this seems unlikely, since the Japanese economy recently slipped back into official recession after notching its second straight quarter of negative growth, and the German economy, while showing strength, is still in a borderline recovery.<p>
More likely, and more damaging to corporate profits, central banks could continue to keep the dollar at these levels or perhaps nudge it just a bit higher. That would crimp U.S. exports and put pressure on prices here at home as domestic products felt more competition from cheaper foreign goods. The weak dollar has provided a pricing umbrella for U.S. companies, says Metz. That could vanish if the dollar stays strong. Lexus, for example, recently cut prices in the U.S. on many models by 3 percent to 10 percent. Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin will be the key person to watch on this issue. If he starts to talk about the dollar's being overvalued, it's a sign he's worried about its strength. If the dollar keeps rising after he makes such statements, U.S. exports and domestic profit margins could be in trouble.<p>
How likely is this? Not very. U.S.-Japanese relations would have to take a major turn for the worse for exchange rates to pose a truly serious threat to the economy and the market.<p>
Politics. Washington could tie itself in knots again. This is probably the least theatening of the five disaster scenarios, because the rest of us wouldn't stand for it. Most economists and certainly most of Wall Street have simply assumed that the results of the November election mean our politicians will hammer out a reasonable deficit-reduction package, probably after appointing a bipartisan blue-ribbon commission or two to "save" Social Security and Medicare. Despite some post-election posturing, that still seems the most likely outcome. The bond market, which will swoon at the first sign of fiscal irresponsibility, should provide the necessary discipline.<p>
Robert Rubin is also the key figure on this front. With the departures of Labor secretary Robert Reich and National Economic Council head Laura Tyson, Rubin becomes the administration's main economic player. Fortunately, Rubin has spent the past two years building good working relationships with Republicans in Congress. The odds are that the pragmatic Rubin will be able to work out a compromise on reducing the deficit and balancing the budget.<p>
The Trouble With Slow Growth<p>
So if the market is correct, and the five dangers are overblown, does that mean the coast is clear? Not entirely. The problem with the slow-growth, "perfect economy" scenario is that it puts more downward pressure on corporate earnings than the sanguine market now reflects. Currently, Wall Street analysts are projecting a 13.4 percent increase in earnings for the stocks in the S&P 500 in 1997, says Arnold Kaufman, editor of The Outlook, an investment-advisory newsletter. S&P's top-down analysis (extrapolated from general economic assumptions) suggests that 3 percent will be more like it. "To expect anything better than a below-average year is wishful thinking," says Kaufman. (The average return on large-company stocks since 1926 is 10.5 percent, according to Ibbotson Associates.)<p>
Ben Zacks sees almost exactly the same outlook in the data collected by Zacks Investment Research. Wall Street analysts are projecting 14 percent earnings growth for the stocks in the S&P 500 (his numbers are a little different from Kaufman's), while Wall Street economists are calling for 6 percent. "That's a little wider spread than usual," explains Zacks. "There's usually a five- to six-percentage-point difference at this time of year. There's a likelihood that analysts will have to cut estimates in 1997 to 5 or 6 percent." <p>
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of First Albany, is more pessimistic. "The year 1997 is likely to be tough for earnings," he says. "There's a good chance corporate profits in 1997 could be below those in 1996."<p>
Why this pessimism? The explanation is embedded in both the slow-growth scenario and the five worries we've already reviewed. While none of those concerns is enough to derail the Goldilocks economy, each cuts into corporate profits. For example, it takes only slightly lower consumer demand to make it impossible for companies to raise prices. And it takes just a little less demand to foil efforts to build unit volume by cutting prices. In fact, price-cutting is already failing as a tactic to boost sales for many companies, says economist Susan Sterne.<p>
Or consider inflation. Wages and commodity prices may not rise fast enough or far enough to trigger a Fed interest rate hike, but when companies can't easily raise prices without losing sales to competitors, every penny in extra raw materials or wages puts pressure on profit margins.<p>
This pressure comes at a particularly bad time: The drive toward efficiency that has done so much to raise the profitability of U.S. corporations has already cut a lot of the fat out of them. "The easy stuff has been done," says Robert Sanborn, manager of the $4.1 billion Oakmark Fund. That doesn't mean effiency can't add to the bottom line, just that only the best-run companies will be able to pull it off and that the gains won't be nearly as large as in past years. The companies in his portfolio, Sanborn says, believe they can still wring more economy out of their operations, but they are talking about only a slight increase in margins of 1 or 2 percent.<p>
Look at how the numbers add up. A company that expands sales in step with the 2 percent growth of the economy and also increases its profit margin by 2 percent -- say from 8 percent to 8.16 percent -- would increase earnings about 4 percent, a bit above the S&P 500's top-down projection but well below the 13.5 percent Wall Street is expecting.<p>
The earnings-related factors that have driven this market upward are running out of gas. Downsizing and other cost-cutting efforts have raised margins until the return on equity -- a measure of how profitable a company is -- stands at 25 percent, a historic high well above the average of about 15 percent for the past two decades. Investors' willingness to pay more and more for a dollar of earnings -- a reflection of their increasing confidence in managements' abilities -- also seems at a peak. The price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 recently stood at 20. (Its average high in the years since 1976 is just 15.8.) "The story has been expansion in margins and the uptick in multiples," explains Metz. "That's over."<p>
The bottom line is that the market faces the real possibility of having earnings evaporate. Soon. Profits disappeared overnight in the 1990 recession, points out James Stack, president of InvesTech Research in Whitefish, Montana. At the end of a recovery, corporate management tries to stretch out the good news as long as possible, Stack explains. The company will recognize profits early and push off the day of reckoning on costs. When that's no longer possible, management decides to write off everything in a single quarter. A big loss isn't that much worse than a medium-sized one, in Wall Street's eyes. Companies, in fact, often get credit for biting the bullet. And management looks great, a year or so down the road, when results are compared with the big losses of the past. Creating a big loss is now the way that companies end one growth cycle and form the groundwork for another. <p>
What's an Investor to Do?<p>
Actually, plenty. By taking the lessons of this slow-growth economy to heart, investors can lay the foundations for what should be a profitable long-term portfolio. In 1997, the market is likely to be transitional. The short term will be rocky as the market and individual stocks get re-valued, but investors who understand the kinds of rotations from one style of stock to another that go on in transitional markets should be able to navigate this without too much pain.<p>
First, the long-term perspective. The torrid returns of the past two years have actually hidden a profound shift in the kinds of companies that make the best investment in today's economy. But 1997 should hold enough challenges for corporate managers that investors will be able to identify the companies that are likely to thrive as the rest of this decade unfolds.<p>
Second, look for companies that are in the right place demographically or that can take sales away from competitors. U.S. companies seeking easy growth will have to look overseas and to the developing world. During the same period when the 20- to 29-year-old age-group is falling in the developed countries by 15 percent, it will be climbing in Latin America, for example, by 18 percent. "If you're looking at consumer-goods companies, the only place you can get growth is in emerging international markets," says demographer Richard Hokenson.<p>
Some companies will be able to grow domestically by hammering their rivals. Home Depot is expanding at the expense of other companies in the home-improvement market. Intel continues to capture market share in the chip market.<p>
But neither of these growth strategies adds up to easy increases in prices and profit margins. Markets in the developing world won't allow most companies to keep their customary U.S. profit margins. It's one thing to sell $120 Nikes in the United States and another to sell them in Indonesia. And even a dominant domestic producer, such as Intel, now realizes that it relentlessly has to drive down prices of its own products. <p>
Face it, in the global economy, there's no place to hide from margin pressure. In the consumer area, strong brand names with cachet won't be enough if management goes to sleep on costs or product development. Even consumer-product companies will have to devote a big piece of cash to research and development. The model consumer company in this economy is Gillette (which has an R-and-D budget like that of a high-tech company), rather than Coca-Cola.<p>
None of this is reason to abandon companies that sell things. It's just that global trends favor companies that sell services. That's especially true in the aging developed world, where the over-40 crowd calls the shots. Baby boomers may be buying fewer cars as they get older, but they're sending more and more dollars to the companies that run 401(k)s. An investor's portfolio ought to reflect that reality. That's true to a lesser but still significant extent in the developing world. As countries such as India grow richer, it's easy to see that more and more of their population will be able to buy Crest and Nikes. But smart investors will also notice that the expanding middle class in those nations will also need life insurance and mutual funds and phone service.<p>
Facing long-run excess capacity in consumer goods and a boom market in services, investors should pay very different multiples for stocks in each sector. Paint maker and retailer Sherwin-Williams sells for a multiple of 21. Discount-brokerage industry leader Charles Schwab sells for a multiple of 22. Which stock is overpriced for the long term?<p>
The short-term gyrations of the market are not only making it hard for investors to focus on this long-term change but actually leading to the mispricing of many of the stocks long-term investors want to own. As the economy has slowed, "a lot of investment professionals have started to talk about a new Nifty 50," says Kurt Walters, vice president of Safian Investment Research in White Plains, New York. Those companies, these investors believe, will be able to deliver a steady stream of predictable earnings forever. That's why the growth stocks Safian tracks are selling at price-to-earnings ratios that are 2.5 times their earnings growth rates -- pretty expensive since some of those companies aren't very well positioned for the aging slow-growth world. Many of those companies in the new Nifty 50 are consumer-product companies -- exactly those facing margin and growth pressures. Few of them are service companies marketing to aging baby boomers and the developing world's emerging middle class.<p>
Investors looking for slow growth at a reasonable price ought to consider cyclicals instead. Cyclicals are selling at an average price-to-earnings ratio of 13.6. In the ten-week period that ended in mid-November, growth stocks outperformed cyclicals by eight percentage points. "You've got to ask when traditional growth stocks get too expensive," says Walters, and when cyclicals get cheap.<p>
At these prices, some cyclical companies -- such as those that produce raw materials like paper and nickel for the products that the developing world demands -- are probably a better way to play global growth than many of the pricier consumer giants. <p>
Most cycles come to their ends with some kind of cataclysm. That could happen with this recovery, of course. If the bond market rallies enough to send yields on the 30-year Treasury to 6 percent or lower, the stock market could let loose -- rising spectacularly overnight to 870 on the S&P 500 by midyear, says Mark Arbeter, chief technical analyst at S&P. That would be a warning sign that this cycle has finally produced the clear excess that leads to disaster.<p>
But absent that kind of speculative frenzy, investors are left with an economy that may not resemble any in the past. Demographically, the world has never looked like it does now. The developing world has never been integrated into the global economy in precisely this way before. We are in uncharted waters.<p>
At 67 months and counting, this economic recovery feels old. Only the 198390 boom lasted longer. But age by itself doesn't mean the economic cycle has to end in 1997, nor does it mean that the market has to crash and burn. For better or worse, those crashes are extremely difficult to predict, and all the elements most common in past crashes have yet to fall in place for this market.<p>
But it doesn't take the looming shadow of a crash to make a market risky. The new year is likely to be riskier than 1996, with less immediate reward in exchange for that risk. But the short-term uncertainties of the market should present plenty of opportunities to the investor who keeps his eyes on the long term.<p>

						The Indebted Society
By James Medoff and Andrew Harless (Little, Brown, $24.95)<p>
The Truth About the National Debt
By Francis X. Cavanaugh (Harvard Business School Press, $22.95)<p>
By Matthew Miller<p>
To judge from these two recent books, debt is to blame for either everything that ails us or nothing at all. Somebody must be lying.<p>
In The Indebted Society, Harvard economist James Medoff and consultant Andrew Harless link debt at all levels to crime, unemployment, downsizing, divorce, low wages, federal high jinks, and the general premillennial blues. A series of debt-fueled "vicious circles," they claim, is the culprit. Citizens, beset by stagnant wages, stop saving and run up the Visa bill to hang on. Thus pinched, we scream for lower taxes and higher benefits, opening the spigot of federal red ink as fearful politicians refuse to address the incompatibility of our demands. The government squeeze, in turn, leads to cuts in basic research, education, and infrastructure spending, all of which underpin growth. At the same time, deficits drain scarce national savings away from business investment. Heavy corporate borrowing, spurred by tax-favored debt and a generation of CEOs unchastened by depression, yields a cash-crunch mentality that militates against long-term investment and new hires.<p>
The result? A low-savings, low-investment economy that produces wage stagnation and job insecurity, with the family stresses and social meltdown you'd expect. Worse, vested interests with a big stake in debt -- from credit-card companies that peddle profligacy for profit to a lending class that dreads inflation more than it loves growth -- make it hard for policies that might jolt us out of this mess to get even a hearing.<p>
Are Medoff and Harless right? In part. The destructive conditions they describe and the connections they draw between them are real enough (though there's too much psychobabble on the family for my taste). But they're unpersuasive in presenting debt as the exclusive cause, rather than one outgrowth, of the productivity crunch that still mystifies economists two decades after it began.<p>
Maybe that's why, for all the power of their "vicious circles" framework, their cures seem mostly stale or ineffective; their strengths are descriptive, not prescriptive. Like every blue-ribbon panel, they want more public and private investment. They say the Federal Reserve should stop strangling growth, failing to see that expecting a central bank to solve a productivity problem is like asking a hammer to turn a screw. More sensibly, they'd raise taxes on the wealthy to help balance the budget, protect the welfare safety net from bipartisan attacks, and scrap today's corporate-tax advantage for debt financing. Still, this stuff has been in the air for a long time -- which is why you can't help feeling that you've heard it all before.<p>
Francis X. Cavanaugh, fresh from three decades in the bowels of the Treasury Department, has heard it all before, and he's angry. In The Truth About the National Debt, the retired economist and federal-debt manager is out to debunk the myths he says make most worries about our debt and deficits a distracting sham. But with only two sensible complaints amid an otherwise intolerably long quibble, Cavanaugh's book is proof of the axiom that the best civil servants toil in anonymity.<p>
Cavanaugh explains that much debt rhetoric is, strictly speaking, misguided. Today's $5 trillion debt isn't, in itself, a "burden on future generations," because we're passing along assets as well as liabilities. Our interest payments aren't "unsustainable"; they're just higher than they once were and have little economic impact. Thanks to broad ownership of federal debt by mutual and pension funds, interest payments probably don't redistribute wealth from average Joes to idle coupon clippers. And foreigners, by virtue of holding just 23 percent of our debt, pose no imminent threat to the republic.<p>
There -- I've just saved you three hours. Sure, Cavanaugh's right that pols bend these points to get the public up in arms. But so what? There are reasons they're correct to get us exercised, and Cavanaugh pooh-poohs or ignores them. He's blind to the way spiraling interest payments divert federal resources from other public purposes at any given spending level. He wrongly dismisses the deficit's drain on national savings and investment, which is why deficits matter in the first place. And he barely acknowledges the colossal unfunded liabilities in our health and Social Security entitlements -- $14 trillion at last count -- which will indeed burden our kids with higher taxes and a wrecked economy if we don't act soon.<p>
Cavanaugh contributes most on two counts. He decries the creeping socialization of credit risk in the economy through such federally backed entities as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And he notes that our deficit problem ultimately boils down to choosing the level of government spending we're willing to pay for, an issue both political parties continue to dodge by allowing more salient myths than Cavanaugh's to go unrefuted -- that welfare and foreign aid take up most of the budget, for example.<p>
Regrettably, both books suffer from prose styles that might charitably be described as dull. Their authors' few interesting arguments would have had more impact as articles, not books. Still, their insistence on saying their piece at length is a choice for which the paper industry, if no one else, should feel, well, indebted.

						sWhere It's Tax-Time Forever<p>
By Ted C. Fishman<p>
As if to remind citizens that it's time to think about taxes (again), the IRS has spruced up its Web site (<a HREF="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/cover.html">www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/cover.html</A>) for end-of-year tax planning. Previously, the site was most useful as a lending library of tax forms, with a smattering of tips on preparing returns. Now its home page, a mock tabloid called The Digital Daily, shows wit and style (really) and leads users to more services (forms are still available). In early fall, under "What's Hot," the site offered a kind of "Dear Abby" for filers; if this test succeeds, correspondents will be able to have questions answered by E-mail; those with the broadest applicability will make it into the site's FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions). Care to offer the IRS advice on new regulations? The agency promises that comments will reach the desk of the appropriate officials. And new this season is a section that posts the latest regulations. Soon the site will include a searchable index of all the nation's certified not-for-profit charities that qualify for tax-deductible donations. If you'd like aid with your taxes, help can be had on that front, too. You can get information on assistance volunteers and download bulletins that list suspended tax preparers. A final suggestion: Use the site early. Last year it was sometimes overwhelmed with requests for forms. Capacity, to be doubled by New Year's, shouldn't be a problem, but as with all things tax related, it never hurts to think ahead.

						Australia did everything wrong when its economy began to sour. So now it's a buy.<p>
By Jim Rogers<p>
In August, thousands of angry Australians massed in protest in the capital city of Canberra. The demonstrators tried to break through police lines and storm the parliament buildings. Rioters carried sledgehammers and a battering ram. Several got within 100 yards of the office of the new prime minister, John Howard.<p>
What had these folks so worked up?<p>
Nothing less than the possible return of fiscal prudence to Australia after a lengthy absence. In March, Australian voters kicked out the big spenders who were running the national government and handed control over to the Liberal-National Coalition for the first time in 13 years.<p>
The new government won the national election on the promise that it would slash waste, reduce spending, and cut taxes. Its tight new budget calls for $4.1 billion in spending reductions over the next two years. Prime Minister Howard has vowed to balance the Australian budget by the 199899 fiscal year, far ahead of our goal to do the same thing here in the U.S.<p>
"You don't turn around a nation's finances, a nation's future, without making some hard decisions," the federal treasurer Peter Costello recently told the Australian parliament. Yet, as he went on to note, "if we avoid the hard decisions now, they are only going to get harder."<p>
I guess it shouldn't be too surprising that some of these hard decisions, such as fee hikes for higher education and an 11 percent cut in support for the nation's 300,000 aborigines, would be unpopular enough to trigger the raucous demonstrations that have occurred in Canberra, as well as in Adelaide and Brisbane.<p>
What does surprise me, though, is that a nation of hearty individualists like Australia allowed its national budget to get so out of hand in the first place. Australia's 18 million people are the descendants of immigrants. They believe in hard work and self-reliance, just as we do in the U.S. How did they, of all people, ever buy into the notion of government bloat?<p>
Australia's economy industrialized rapidly after World War II. Manufacturing now accounts for 24 percent of the nation's exports. But Australia, roughly the same size as the continental U.S., is especially rich in -- and therefore heavily dependent on -- natural resources. Mining alone accounts for 45 percent of its exports. In the mid-1980s, approval was granted for the world's largest uranium mine to start at Roxby Downs, South Australia. Farming contributes another 29 percent of Australia's exports.<p>
This is a country that truly lives off its land, especially when it comes to international trade. As commodity and natural-resource prices go, so go the fortunes of its businesses and people.<p>
The key factors that shape a modern economy are foreign debt and trade with other countries, particularly as expressed in a country's current accounts. Unfortunately, Australia's current-account deficit has almost doubled in the past four years. Australia, thus, has been importing more and more of its goods on credit. Its exports haven't been generating enough income to pay off this debt.<p>
One upshot of this: Australia's foreign debt per capita is now four times that of the U.S. This isn't to say the U.S. has been doing such a great job managing its finances (regular readers know I've been sharply critical of our nation's spendthrift ways). It's just that Australia has been doing even worse. Australia's total foreign debt now stands at $152 billion -- up 30 percent in the past four years alone.<p>
One thing I don't expect Australia to do, though, is pull a cheap trick and devalue its dollar -- to make it easier to pay back its mounting international debt. Australia is not Mexico. Even with the problems it has today, Australia is a disciplined and principled nation.<p>
Australia's current problems began with the collapse of natural-resource and commodity prices in the 1980s -- the result of a worldwide glut. Lower prices for everything from bauxite to barley cut sharply into the amount of revenue that Australian businesses could generate from foreign trade.<p>
Unfortunately, Australia made things even worse for itself. Its citizens reacted by making the very mistake that so many other resource-rich nations made as commodity prices dropped: They elected politicians who promised to soften the blow.<p>
The right move, of course, would have been to trim government expenses and batten down the hatches until better times returned. That's what today's corporations have learned to do in cyclical downturns: Get lean and mean.<p>
But Australia's political leaders attempted to maintain the status quo and keep the citizenry happy. They passed laws, borrowed money, and imposed regulations in a destined-to-fail effort to thwart the fundamental laws of economics. They refused to acknowledge that the nation's troubles stemmed from a worldwide supply-and-demand imbalance that they could do little about.<p>
I suppose this is why statism -- the notion that the state can solve most of a country's financial and social problems -- always tends to gain popularity just as a nation's prosperity begins to wane; it's a ready answer for an economy that has begun to decline. The state tries to make things right, to keep the voters living in the style to which they have become accustomed, until better times return.<p>
What happened next was equally predictable: Australia's debt mushroomed, and economic growth slowed considerably. In Australia, unemployment now stands at 8.5 percent -- much higher than in the U.S.<p>
Yet all this may now be changing. As a result of the national elections earlier this year, the Australian stock market has begun showing new life. The currency is also rebounding, and inflation has slowed markedly -- to 3.1 percent from 4.7 percent just a year ago.<p>
Australia is even beginning to look like a potentially exciting place for investors -- not just because of the nation's newfound interest in fiscal prudence but also because natural-resource prices are on the upswing again, a trend I expect to persist for the next ten years. Investors in Australia have a very real chance of benefiting from these two positive trends.<p>
Australian stocks may well go down again before they begin to climb steadily. Biting the bullet -- that is, cutting government spending, which means injecting less money into the economy -- will cause pain and dislocations at first. But the economy may well revive and be stronger than ever, poised for solid growth.<p>
Darwin, Australia's northernmost city, the one nearest the Indonesian islands, is an example of just how promising this nation's future evolution may be economically. When I visited, I was struck by how multiracial, multieverything Darwin is. People from all over Asia have crowded into its neighborhoods -- Chinese, Koreans, Indonesians, Indians, and Pakistanis. It's a boomtown now, and it will be one for a long time to come. Its population has doubled in the past 20 years, and the Northern Territory -- the size of Alaska, with great weather and abundant natural beauty and touring sights -- is prospering as well.<p>
Two important influences on Darwin's growth are Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, both just to the north and both exploding and dynamic. Americans are surprised to discover that Indonesia is the fourth-largest country in the world. The Indonesians are excellent businesspeople, thriving in an old and crowded country. Australia sits only a few hundred miles south -- vast, empty of people, and chock-full of natural resources.<p>
All the abundant nickel, copper, undeveloped land, huge farms, huge ranches, huge everything need to be worked by somebody. Throughout the history of Australia, whenever a dam or irrigation system has been erected, the entire area around it has blossomed with prosperity.<p>
Australia should also benefit from the 2000 Summer Olympics, which will be held in Sydney. (Australians are an athletic bunch; they won more medals per capita than nearly anyone else in Atlanta.)<p>
Following the recent examples of Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, three other former English colonies that put their fiscal houses in order, Australia may become a model for yet another former British colony -- namely, the United States.<p>

						Russia is tottering, South Africa is set to explode, and East Asia is stumbling -- pity the next U.S. president.<p>
By Walter Russell Mead<p>
Lucky Bill Clinton. Sure, he's had to send American troops into the Bosnian quagmire, defuse a financial crisis or two in Mexico, and send cruise missiles crashing into Iraq. But on balance, global events have helped his administration. The Japanese trade surplus, once the terror of American economists and industrialists, has declined steeply, and booming East Asian economies have absorbed more American goods, sending U.S. exports soaring. With the cold war over, everyone except knee-jerk red-baiters has agreed that working to extend democracy -- blemishes and all -- to Russia and Eastern Europe is a good idea. And the whole world breathed a sigh of relief when, with an astonishingly small amount of violence, apartheid turned into democracy in South Africa.<p>
**The winner of the presidential election will have a tough time with international politics in the coming years.**<p>
But that good luck is about to end -- for whoever fills the Oval Office during the next four years. The international situation is going to give the next president fits.<p>
The incoming administration is going to face crises of a totally different magnitude from those on the current roster of hot spots -- Haiti, Bosnia, Iraq. Problems in these areas aren't going away, of course, but by now American presidents and voters are habituated to these crises and their shopworn "solutions": Send in the marines, slap on an embargo, scramble the bombers. These actions don't fix the problem, but they reassure us that the president has everything in hand.<p>
The crises on the horizon in Russia, South Africa, and East Asia can't be addressed by any of these means. Paradoxically, these troubles are capable of arousing deeper fears and more heartfelt calls to arms among American voters but are less amenable to direct presidential action than an Iraq or Haiti. We cannot bring cruise missiles raining down on Moscow or send U.S. troops to keep the peace in South Africa. Worst of all, the economic crisis looming in East Asia will touch the wallets of Americans more directly than any crisis of the last two administrations. At the same time, it will weaken the president's political position by making it tough for him to deliver on his economic promises and by providing new ammunition for America Firsters, such as Pat Buchanan.<p>
**While Russia has been a feather in Clinton's cap, that's likely to change considering Yeltsin's shaky health.**<p>
Start with Russia. On balance, Russia policy has been a plus for Clinton. Russia's democracy might not be very elegant, or even remotely honest, but the country seemed to be moving toward a more consumer-oriented, less militaristic society. Even the worst recent event in Russia -- its bloody, miserable war with the Chechens -- has been oddly comforting. The Russian military proved to be as incompetent as it is nasty.<p>
But Russia is becoming less predictable every day. Boris Yeltsin is still president in name, but his failing health and erratic habits make it uncertain how long he'll be with us. Or what clout he'll have while he hangs on. Already his security adviser, Alexander Lebed, has overruled a presidential order, claiming that Yeltsin hadn't authored it. The struggle to succeed the ailing Yeltsin will be fought against the background of an economic crisis that weakens the pro-Western forces in Russia. Russia's inefficient companies, corrupt judicial system, and ramshackle legal structures can't cope with a mountain of bad debts. Its Wild West banking system is heading for a crash that will wipe out the savings of millions of Russians -- again.<p>
Russia, regardless of who is in charge, will continue on its present anti-Western, nationalistic track. Not that Russia will send tanks rolling across Central Europe. It can't police its own territory, much less take over anyone else's. But that doesn't mean Russia (and its thousands of thermonuclear weapons) can be ignored. A weakened and financially reeling Russia could provide terrorists with training facilities and safe havens. It could help countries such as Iraq and Iran develop sophisticated chemical and biological weapons. It could -- either intentionally or accidentally -- allow rogue states to amass critical quantities of weapons-grade nuclear materials.<p>
**In South Africa, a weakening economy threatens the peace in this nation.** <p>
Cut to South Africa, where another triumph of American values and policy is turning to ashes. The good news from South Africa is just about over. The economy isn't growing fast enough to both allow blacks to improve their standards of living and protect white incomes and jobs.<p>
The currency collapsed in 1996, but the South African central bank can't defend the rand without raising interest rates so high that growth screeches to a halt. But if South Africa doesn't defend the rand, its inflation problem will worsen, making it harder for the government to pursue strategies that could improve the economic situation of the restive majority.<p>
South Africa's leaders may well fail this test. Order seems to be breaking down in the cities. Recently, Muslim vigilantes fought street battles with drug dealers in the slums of Cape Town. Nelson Mandela is getting older, and after admitting that he secretly banked a $450,000 campaign contribution, he may have lost some of his political magic.<p>
If things go badly wrong, a U.S. president will face tremendous pressure to get involved. CNN already knows the way to South Africa; the leaders of all the country's major political factions are skilled at working with (or manipulating) Western media. In addition, the people and issues of South Africa matter intensely to tens of millions of American citizens. But it's not clear what the U.S. could do. South Africa isn't Haiti: It has more than 6 times the population and more than 40 times the land area.<p>
**A collapse of Indonesia's political and economic systems could further stretch U.S. involvement internationally.**<p>
Handling a meltdown in Russia or South Africa will become far more complicated if an economic crisis in East Asia eats away at U.S. domestic support for an activist international policy. For years, East Asia's dynamic economies (ranging from Taiwan to Indonesia) have been the wonder of the world and the envy of other developing countries. But suddenly the story seems less certain to end happily.<p>
The troubles in Indonesia have attracted the most attention lately. The corrupt regime of Indonesia's 75-year-old president, Mohamed Suharto (five years older than Fidel Castro and two years older than Bob Dole), is facing a succession struggle against a background of popular unrest. An emerging urban middle class increasingly wants its share of both political power and business contracts. The country's Muslims -- Indonesia has the largest Muslim population of any country on earth -- are a wild card. Some remain apolitical; others are increasingly radicalized. The last time Indonesia changed presidents, 500,000 to 1 million people lost their lives.<p>
Indonesia is just the most dramatic case of the East Asian blues. Even Asia's more democratic states have their political problems. Neither South Korea, where two of the country's former presidents were tried on capital charges last summer, nor Thailand, where corruption is about to bring down another government, is a showcase of stability.<p>
**To make matters worse for East Asia, economic growth in the region is slowing down after a period of rapid growth.**<p>
But this political turmoil wouldn't be nearly so significant if growth in the region weren't also slowing. The East Asian Tigers are discovering for themselves what Japan found out a few years ago: Export-oriented economies can't sustain rapid growth forever. Slow growth in the U.S. and Europe and the saturation of the consumer market for the goods on which the Asian Tigers depend -- VCRs, for example -- are taking their toll. Growth forecasts are being scaled back all across Asia. Economies accustomed to double-digit growth are now projecting single-digit increases -- or worse.<p>
The region's banks and businesses have built their plans on a continuation of the explosive growth of the past decade. Companies have built new factories -- and banks have loaned them money -- based on assumptions about market growth that now look shaky. Japanese-style banking problems could turn up in places like Thailand and South Korea.<p>
Some East Asian countries are waking up to discover that they could be facing Mexican-style currency problems. With export growth slowing and the middle classes snapping up foreign goods and indulging in foreign travel, countries such as Thailand and South Korea suddenly confront deficits in their current accounts as more money flows out than flows in. (Taiwan, with its massive currency reserves, is an exception.) Thailand has had trouble defending its currency, the baht, from attacks.<p>
**Currency devaluation -- a solution for many countries -- is not a valid option for East Asia.**<p>
One step that countries often take to restore the balance of payments -- currency devaluation -- seems virtually impossible in this region. Although devaluation would restore the competitiveness of Asian exports, it would decimate the portfolios of the foreign investors who prop up many of East Asia's faltering stock and bond markets.<p>
Some countries are responding to their trade problems with approaches that could cause a serious run-in with the U.S. South Korea is mounting anti-import and "Buy Korean" programs. China is following a similar route -- even as it replaces Japan as the country with the largest trade surplus with the U.S.<p>
This could lead to a new kind of Pacific trade war. So far, most Americans have been willing to allow East Asian products into this country despite the opposition of unions and manufacturers. Keeping our markets open has seemed the best way to open up Asia's markets to U.S. goods. But what will happen if Asia starts closing its markets to American products?<p>
**The odds overwhelmingly favor a recession during the next administration.**<p>
The next president of the United States will probably have to answer this question during a recession. The odds overwhelmingly favor a recession sometime during the next administration. If the present business expansion lasts until the end of the presidential term in 2001, it will become the longest-lasting one in American history. Voters who are worried about their jobs -- and who are counting on a rising stock market to make good the deficiencies they expect in Social Security and Medicare -- aren't likely to be in favor of aid packages for Russia or South Africa, or of patient diplomacy. Perhaps whoever wins this election ought to think twice before taking the oath of office in January.<p>

						The Taxpayers' Bill of Rights delivers less than it promises.<p>
By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>
President Clinton recently signed into law amendments that strengthen the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights Act of 1988. Upon signing the bill, the president told taxpayers, "You have rights, and we will shield them." Don't be fooled -- the bill is still shot full of holes.<p>
First, the good things. The IRS can now abate interest charges for "unreasonable" errors and delays caused by its own "managerial or ministerial acts." The new measure is a welcome plus. Previously, the only acts that would cause the IRS to turn off the meter were such things as correspondence between the IRS and the taxpayer crossing in the mail. Now the IRS can stop interest from accruing when, say, an official working a case gets transferred or takes a sick leave, although proving the cause of a delay will take some legwork. <p>
The bill also gives taxpayers a 21-day interest-free grace period -- up from 10 -- for first notices that demand less than $100,000 in taxes owed. And the IRS is now allowed to recognize private delivery services such as FedEx as a proper means for meeting the April 15 deadline. <p>
**A taxpayer advocate won't have much power over local IRS officials.**<p>
Now the holes. A new taxpayer advocate, replacing the old taxpayer ombudsman, has been given more authority to issue, modify, or rescind taxpayer-assistance orders, which are requests that an IRS official stop any action that causes a taxpayer significant hardship. But this advocate will still be appointed by the IRS commissioner, not the president. Likely candidate: an agency careerist -- a bureaucrat by any other name is still as slow to respond. Furthermore, the new advocate does not have direct control over local IRS officials, who decide who gets help and when.<p>
The IRS must now give taxpayers 30 days' notice before altering or killing an installment plan to pay off a tax debt, and it must give specific reasons for its actions. However, the 30-day-notification measure is a sop -- the IRS already adopted it prior to this bill. Plus, installment plans still come tied up with a tax lien and a running interest tab, and the IRS can still seize property from taxpayers who miss just one payment.<p>
Innocent spouses and ex-spouses supposedly get some relief under this new bill. These people typically run into trouble when joint filers split up and the IRS later concludes that one spouse cheated on his or her taxes. The bill gives either spouse the right to find out whether the IRS is trying to collect from a former mate -- an advance warning that he or she may be next in line. But the IRS won't automatically tell a joint filer it is investigating -- taxpayers must ask for this information in writing.<p>
**Taxpayers can now recover certain legal expenses incurred from IRS disputes.**<p>
The new law lets taxpayers recover certain legal expenses incurred from IRS disputes, and boosts, from $100,000 to $1 million, the amount of damages a taxpayer can get as a victim of what the IRS calls "reckless or intentional" action, such as an outright disregard of the tax law. However, reckless or intentional behavior, according to tax experts, is far more difficult to prove than carelessness -- taxpayers virtually have to be camped out in an auditor's office to amass sufficient evidence. <p>
In the past, when taxpayers have sued the IRS to recover legal fees, the burden of proof has been on the taxpayers to prove that the IRS was "substantially unjustified" in making its case. The new law says the agency must take on the burden of proof when it loses a case. If it fails to prove that its losing position had real merit or was "substantially justified" because it followed its own tax rules, a taxpayer can now recover legal fees. But taxpayers won't be reimbursed if the IRS follows its new opinion on a tax matter and ignores older but still pertinent rules that support the taxpayer's case.<p>
The bill also raises the maximum hourly rate for recoverable attorneys' fees, from $75 to $110, and indexes the amount beginning in 1997. But rare is the lawyer who will work for $110 an hour in taxland.<p>

						Foreign investors have boosted the U.S. economy by acquiring our debt. Are they starting to pull back? It's too soon to tell. But it sure won't be pretty if they start bidding us...<p>
By Jim Rogers<p>
Our towering national debt has turned us into a nation of amateur bookkeepers and economists. Many of us can cite (at least approximately) the amount our government now owes: $5 trillion. Or how much that amounts to per person: $20,000. We know that the Treasury must hawk scads of bonds, notes, and bills to finance this staggering sum. We know a huge chunk of our tax dollars (17 percent) goes toward paying the interest on all those bonds, notes, and bills. We know our national debt has handcuffed our markets and our economy and kept loan rates stubbornly high and deposit rates submerged.<p>
But how many of us also know that we've been getting help with financing all of this debt? A lot of help, in fact.<p>
This assistance has been coming from other nations, especially Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. According to U.S. Treasury statistics, foreign governments and other overseas investors now hold just shy of $1 trillion (or 20 percent) of our national debt.<p>
Never before in the history of the world has a nation owed as much money to foreign creditors as the United States does right now. Are we good for it? What would happen if these other countries decided to cut up our national credit card?<p>
Until recently, few people bothered to raise such questions. This may be, in part, because foreign lenders have appeared so eager to give us as much cash as we will take. In 1995 alone, foreign monetary institutions and investors scooped up $173 billion in U.S. Treasurys -- an amount that exceeded last year's entire federal budget deficit.<p>
Six years ago the total U.S. debt in foreign hands was less than half of what it is today. We now owe Japan $255 billion, the United Kingdom $142 billion, and Germany $64 billion. Believe it or not, China is our sixth-largest creditor. We owe China (where the average worker barely earns enough money in a year to buy a ten-speed bicycle) $34.3 billion.<p>
The U.S. government, of course, has been using all of this global moola to help pay for its unceasing deficit spending. The foreign cash has rippled through our economy and supported our spendthrift ways. It has also helped Americans like you and me spend more of our dollars on, say, stocks -- as opposed to having to pay more in federal income tax or buy more of those Treasury offerings ourselves.<p>
Certainly the U.S. economy has been showing signs of health lately. We've had solid growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. Over the past four years, we've added a net ten million new jobs. Homeownership is at a 15-year peak. Real hourly wages are rising for the first time in ten years. The misery index -- the unemployment rate added to the inflation rate -- hasn't been this low since 1968, notes The Wall Street Journal.<p>
These are all good things. Yet would our economy be humming along so nicely if we hadn't received so much international aid? Suppose we had had to scrape up that extra $173 billion ourselves last year. Would that have driven interest rates one percentage point higher, or two, or three, as the Treasury tried to persuade Americans to buy T-bills instead of, say, stocks? And how well would the stock market have done if we had bought all of those T-bills ourselves?<p>
We may be about to discover that these aren't just academic concerns. A critical development occurred in the second quarter of this year: Foreigners hesitated to lend us any more money. Beginning in March, the six-year skyward trend line that tracks foreign holdings of U.S. bonds suddenly turned ominously flat. In April, foreign central banks actually decreased the amount of U.S. Treasurys they held, according to the Federal Reserve. In June came another decrease and in August a third.<p>
Is this a short-term blip or the beginning of a dangerous trend?<p>
A brief flat period (or one down month) doesn't necessarily spell disaster. It certainly doesn't mean foreign countries will soon try to dump all of their U.S. debt. That would be foolhardy, since the fortunes of their economies are so closely tied to ours. Still, this is something all investors should watch closely.<p>
Those of you who are regular readers of my column in this magazine know that I am skeptical about the prospects for the U.S. economy unless drastic changes are made. This is primarily because of our nation's ongoing willingness to tolerate huge budget deficits. This article is another one of my signal flares along these lines. But it is also the most important one I've shot off.<p>
History shows that there have been times when foreign lenders have run for the hills when a debt-ridden economy has sat on its hands, letting its budgetary mess run amok. It happened to Britain and Italy in the 1970s, to France and Spain in the 1960s, and to Portugal in the 1940s.<p>
Our enormous debt to foreigners is a major point of vulnerability. By letting foreigners subsidize dollar-denominated debt, the U.S. has been postponing the economic housecleaning it needs to undertake. In fact, much of the deficit reduction that the Clinton administration touts has simply come from swapping higher-priced long-term U.S. debt for cheaper short-term debt, not from real fiscal prudence. Truth is, Bill Clinton owes much of his economic "success" to the willingness of Japan, Great Britain, and Germany to lend us money at low rates.<p>
Because we have been so rich for so long, we have deluded ourselves into thinking that foreign creditors do not present a threat to our financial system. For politicians, deficit funding carries little near-term political risk. Voters, too, have remained happily oblivious to the dangers posed by high federal deficits (an anomaly in the United States for most of our history). So we have welcomed foreigners who carry checkbooks. <p>
Of course, overseas investors haven't been buying U.S. Treasurys out of the goodness of their hearts. Each country has its reason for lending to us.<p>
Take Japan, far and away our largest creditor. To ease the problems of its strained banks, Japan began irrigating its economy with yen in 1991 (just as the United States created a blizzard of dollars to save the banking system during the savings-and-loan crisis). This liberal monetary policy yanked yen-based interest rates down to a microscopic low of a half percent annually. It's little wonder, then, that Japanese investors found dollar-backed debt, which paid as much as 15 times the interest, so attractive.<p>
More money came flooding into U.S. Treasurys from Japan's central bank, too. To hot-wire an economy shattered by its worst postwar recession, government officials in Japan have been determined to keep the value of the yen as low as possible. This makes Japan's exports to other nations less expensive for foreign buyers. Thus, the Bank of Japan has been buying American dollars that have piled up in Japan as a result of our trade deficit with that nation and been lending them back to us.<p>
Japan's strategy seems to be working. Over the past year, the yen has fallen in value, and economic activity in Japan has picked up.<p>
Meanwhile, as this extra liquidity has swooshed into the United States, it has buoyed our economy, helping it grow at about 2 percent annually over the past five years. Our loans from foreign investors, unfortunately, have risen still higher, increasing at an average rate of 14 percent annually during the same period.<p>
It's not just the amount of borrowing from Japan and other countries that's the problem; it's also how we've used the money as a debtor nation. In the 19th century, the U.S. received a great deal of foreign capital. These funds were put to use building railroads, canals, telegraph lines, roads, and factories. By 1914, these investments in our nation's productive capacity had created enough wealth to allow us to become a net creditor: U.S. companies and investors owned more assets in foreign lands than foreign investors owned here.<p>
The U.S. remained a creditor nation until 1987, when we passed back over the line and became net borrowers again -- thanks to the accumulated federal budget deficits of many, many years. This time around, though, we haven't used our loans to pay for productive assets -- investments that would enhance our ability to generate growth. Instead, we've spent the cash on things like armaments, social services, and, yes, paying the interest on the national debt.<p>
Because we were so wealthy and had been for so long, there were no major repercussions from those who loaned us money. U.S. investors, after all, owned $1.8 trillion in foreign assets in 1987, and they own $2.9 trillion today. The political risk in the U.S. was small; default risk seemed nonexistent; and foreigners, badly needing a place to park huge amounts of cash, could find no better haven.<p>
But the picture may be changing. Today, even a spot under a mattress may look better to some foreign investors than more U.S.-backed debt. As a chart of intermediate- and long-term-bond yields shows (see "Would You Keep Buying?"), Treasury buyers have earned a positive return in only 17 of the past 55 months; buyers in the other 38 months are underwater.<p>
I predict that it will be only a matter of time before the typical Japanese or German investor wises up and declares, "I've owned these stinkers for the past several years, and compared with other investments, I'm losing ground."<p>
Foreign investors have other reasons to pull back. As their economies become stronger, the Japanese and Europeans will need to bring their funds back home to finance growth. Foreigners are also rightly spooked by the Helms됙urton legislation, which condemns anyone doing business with Cuba. It's only one of several confiscatory bills before Congress. Other proposed laws would punish investors -- through asset seizures -- who do business with outlaw states like Libya, Iran, and Iraq. Businesspeople who traffic with these countries know they might as well paste a bull's-eye on their U.S. Treasury brokerage accounts.<p>
Of course, it's one thing if foreigners stop buying new U.S. debt and merely roll over what they're carrying. It's a much more serious matter if foreign dough starts to flow out of U.S. securities. We're not likely to have to hand over part of the country -- say, Yellowstone National Park -- to China to satisfy our debt. We'll simply get a new lender if the Chinese want their money back. But our new creditor is going to say, "Wait a minute. Your spending is out of control. You have no reasonable plan to balance your budget. Both major political parties promise to cure the deficit yet do nothing. Your Congress can't make any fiscal decisions without pandering to big business, the defense establishment, and a thousand other constituencies. Maybe we'll lend you what you need to repay your creditors, but not at the cheap rates you were able to con out of your lenders in the past."<p>
Our government will not have any choice but to pay higher interest rates.<p>
What can we do to fix this mess? Meaningful solutions won't be politically easy -- changing the tax code, for example, to encourage savings and investment and discourage consumption. We should cut government spending and balance the budget. We should privatize the holdings of the government, which owns two-thirds of the land in the West. The government could sell off Nevada, most of which it owns. Or why not sell the post office to someone who can manage it properly, as other nations are doing?<p>
What's an individual investor to do if, in fact, our foreign credit lines start drying up? Domestic stocks and bonds will most likely be battered by the eventual rise in interest rates. Manufacturing stocks may be all right for a while, but it will be better in the long term to look for good agriculture and mining stocks (investments that can profit from the coming boom in demand for natural resources). Apartment houses in financial citadels such as New York and Boston will be a disaster. If all of your money is in America, you may want to invest some of your assets out of the country, as an insurance policy if nothing else. Put some money abroad in a safe currency, such as German marks or Swiss francs.<p>
Meanwhile, I also urge you to keep an eye on the figures for foreign holdings of U.S. debt, which measure the United States Treasury holdings of foreign central banks and which are published regularly by the Federal Reserve. Each week they're reprinted in publications such as Barron's. If you keep a sharp eye on these numbers, you should be able to tell whether foreign businesses and governments are losing confidence in our economy (cutting back on their loans) or feeling more optimistic (upping their investment in the U.S.). I don't have much faith that our politicians will take the right steps should the trend turn sour, but a savvy investor can make the right moves no matter what happens.<p>

						In investing, history lessons are invariably painful. Are we about to receive one?<p>
By Jim Jubak<p>
In October, an investor's fancy turns to crashes. Nine years ago, on October 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 508 points, or 22.61 percent, the biggest single-day slide in points and percentage in the history of the stock market. And October 1929 ushered in the most extended stock-market slump of this century. The Dow, which had peaked at 381 on September 3, 1929, would eventually fall to 41. It wouldn't match its 1929 high until 1954.<p>
Of course, the market hasn't crashed in most Octobers, and this October the Dow, now fully recovered from its 7.5 percent spill of early summer, is poised to test its historic high of 5778. The current market rally -- which dates back to October 11, 1990, when the Dow stood at 2365 -- seems unstoppable.<p>
That's exactly why investors ought to read up on the history of crashes now. Markets don't collapse when stocks are cheap. Crashes occur when stocks are at their most expensive -- and this market is expensive. For example, the dividend yield on the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index stands at just 2.2 percent -- a record low since World War II.<p>
But what causes a stock market to crash? It's not simply excessive valuation. If it were, stocks would have fallen through the floor in the fourth quarter of 1991, when the price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500 hit 26. Instead, the index climbed 26 percent that year and 5 percent in 1992.<p>
Nor is bad news the key. It's impossible to find the big news events that set off the two great crashes of this century. Tragedies and traumas of every sort -- presidential assassinations, the outbreak of wars, major corporate bankruptcies -- have repeatedly failed to send markets into a tailspin.<p>
Stock-market crashes aren't random events, however. They result from a complex interplay of the mass psychology of investors and the underlying fundamentals of the market. Pre-crash periods show common patterns of excessive optimism, a widespread use of borrowed money to buy stocks, and a gradual but largely unrecognized erosion of the foundations of the market. Exactly when the house will topple down the mountain can't be predicted, but the rough odds of a collapse can be estimated. We can, in fact, develop a scorecard to judge the 늒rash-worthiness of today's market.<p>
THE BLUEPRINT FOR A CRASH: 1929<p>
Reading through the pages of the October 1929 Wall Street Journal is like watching an out-of-control car speeding toward a cliff. The Dow Industrials had spent all of September falling back from that September 3 peak. In the first two weeks of October, the market rallied, climbing as high as 353. Then, on October 15, the market showed renewed weakness when the weekly production numbers from U.S. Steel declined 7 percent. Rumors prompted heavy selling as the week ended in the then traditional Saturday session. For the week, U.S. Steel fell $21.75 and <a name="NYSE:GE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Electric</b></a> swooned $33.75.<p>
The next week, only the pledge of $1 billion by a consortium of big banks to support stocks stopped the market from going into free fall. On October 24, a million shares traded in the first 30 minutes of the session. Sellers in big, liquid stocks, such as Radio Corp. and Montgomery Ward, couldn't find buyers, and prices dropped by $10 between trades. For the day, 12.9 million shares changed hands, easily breaking the record of 8.2 million.<p>
On Monday, October 28, the Journal reported stock market passes crises, a headline that would soon seem cruelly mocking. Sell orders swamped the New York Stock Exchange immediately after opening. The support of the big banks couldn't stem the tide. The Dow fell a record 38 points.<p>
The next day, the Dow resumed its collapse, falling another 30 points. By the closing bell, it had come to rest at 261, down 120 points (or 31 percent) from September 3. The carnage was sweeping. <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> traded at $40, down from its 1929 high of $91.75. General Electric's stock price had been cut almost in half, from $403 to $222.
What caused this crash? The bad news out of U.S. Steel certainly wasn't enough by itself to send the market tumbling. Earnings in general did not seem headed lower, and many signs pointed to a solid economic performance in 1930.<p>
On October 3, for example, the Journal reported that capital-equipment manufacturers, such as railcar makers, predicted that 1930 would be an even better year than 1929. <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a> reported shipping 17,000 more cars in the first nine months of 1929 than it had in the same period of 1928. A front-page story reported best september in typewriters and noted that typewriter sales were 늖enerally considered an excellent indicator of business conditions. A steady parade of companies predicted great earnings, and with earnings growing and the economy strong, stocks didn't seem expensive.<p>
But stocks were expensive. A large number were trading not on actual earnings but on projected future earnings. Stocks were priced as if it were certain that 1930 would be another great year. For example, at its 1929 high of $403, General Electric showed a price-to-earnings ratio of 56.<p>
The last stages of the rally -- its most speculative phase -- had been built on borrowed money. Broker loans to members of the NYSE reached an all-time high of $8.5 billion at the end of September, up from the 1926 low of $2.8 billion. (The total market value of NYSE stocks stood at $89.7 billion.) Much of the buying by individual investors was also financed on credit -- an investor could buy a stock on margin by putting up as little as 10 percent of the purchase price. It didn't take much of a drop in the market to make lenders nervous enough to ask investors for more collateral.<p>
The pillar of cash that sustained those stratospheric prices had been weakening, even as the market moved higher in 1928 and 1929. Interest rates were moving up -- on August 8, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York raised its discount rate to 6 percent from 5 percent, the fourth hike in the discount rate since interest rates had bottomed at 3.5 percent in 1927. Those hikes had failed to end pressure on the dollar, however. Gold continued to flow out of the U.S., and foreign investors sold U.S. stocks and bonds rather than see the value of their holdings erode.<p>
The market stabilized in the days after the crash and began to rally after a very rough spot in mid-November. But the seeds of a greater disaster had been sown. On October 28, the Journal reported that the Senate was likely to pass the Smoot됟awley tariff bill by Thanksgiving. That bill's punitive duties on imports helped set off the worldwide collapse in trade that would be called the Great Depression.<p>
BORROWING TROUBLE: 1987<p>
Almost 60 years later, another expensive market sustained by borrowed money would fall more than 700 points in four days. The ostensible causes were again insufficient to explain the magnitude of the decline. On Wednesday, October 14, 1987, the Dow fell 95 points -- then the record point decline -- on news that the August trade deficit was an unexpectedly large $10 billion. Just as bad, from the point of view of investors, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to changes in taxes that would put a damper on the mergers that had driven up stock prices. On Thursday, the Dow fell another 58 points. On Friday, a 108-point fall sent it to 2247. The market was down 17 percent from its August 25 peak.<p>
On Monday, after a weekend spent thinking about the numbers, investors panicked. By 11 a.m. the Dow was down 206 points. By 3 p.m. it was down 300. Individual stocks went into free fall. <a name="NYSE:PG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11211"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Procter & Gamble</b></a> went from $68 to $60 in 15 minutes. By day's end, the Dow had dropped 508 points, and 604 million shares had traded on the NYSE.<p>
What had happened? Nothing more or less than a replay of 1929 with a modern spin. Valuations were again astounding. In August 1987, the stocks in the S&P 500 traded at 26 times reported earnings -- then a historic high.<p>
Investors who couldn't rationalize purchasing stocks using conventional measures of valuation found creative justifications for their buy decisions. The boom in financial engineering (mergers, takeovers, buyouts, and the like) had led to a measure called breakup value. The key issue was no longer how much a company would earn, but what would it be worth if someone bought it with borrowed funds and then sold off its parts.<p>
As in 1929, the valuations rested on borrowed money. The post-1929 reforms of the stock market now required an investor to put up 50 percent of the purchase price to buy a stock, but Wall Street had invented new forms of leverage, most significantly a derivative called an index future. Introduced in 1982, the S&P index future allowed an investor to purchase the market with one buy. The 늕uture part of this instrument -- the right to buy or sell a unit of the S&P 500 at a given price at a specific date -- enabled investors to make money if they guessed right about the direction of the market. If the market went down, of course, the price of the right to buy the index at a higher price could head rapidly toward zero.<p>
Trading in these derivatives was leveraged in a way that made 1929 look tame. Investors didn't have to put up 50 percent -- 5 percent would usually do. Of course, that low margin meant that it took only a small fall in price to trigger a wave of margin calls.<p>
Leverage wasn't the only source of easy money in 1987. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, who had vanquished inflation in the early 1980s, presided over a rapid expansion of the money supply -- it grew 12 percent in 1985 and 16 percent in 1986. Much of that money poured into equities because, with inflation conquered and interest rates just starting to climb, no investment appeared as attractive as stocks.<p>
As it had in 1929, the Fed reversed course in the months before the 1987 crash -- delivering a one-two punch to the market by both diminishing the flow of cash to stocks and making the returns on alternative investments a little more attractive. Alan Greenspan replaced Volcker at the Fed in August, and on September 3, the Fed began to tighten: It raised its discount rate to 6 percent from 5.5 percent.<p>
Huge budget deficits in the U.S. -- along with the Reagan administration's hostility to addressing that problem by increasing taxes -- had forced Greenspan's hand. Faced with a falling dollar, foreign investors were increasingly reluctant to buy the Treasury bonds necessary to finance the deficit. The flood of foreign money into the U.S. markets dropped in half. Raising rates was one way to keep foreign investors in the game.<p>
Even as the market was crashing, however, Greenspan's Fed moved decisively to limit the damage. The Fed would provide whatever liquidity the markets needed, the policy makers announced. Reassured, the market bounced back 100 points the next day. By the end of the year, the Dow had rallied by nearly 150 points.<p>
CRASHING IN SLOW MOTION: 1973<p>
Even though crashes have underlying fundamental causes, they still seem inexplicable. How can the mass of investors move so quickly from euphoria to despair? And how is it that no one ever sees a crash coming?<p>
Crashes happen so fast that they don't reveal much about the psychology of the crowd. It's much easier to understand the behavior of investors by looking at a long, drawn-out stock-market decline, such as that of 1973 and 1974.<p>
The conditions in December 1972 should sound familiar. Valuations were at extremes. (McDonald's, to give a famous example, traded at 85 times earnings.) Inflation was accelerating. The underlying fundamentals continued to decay throughout 1973. Interest rates climbed. The Federal Reserve tightened the money supply. By November 1, the Dow had fallen 7 percent.<p>
But most investors kept the faith. Many who could have escaped the true pain yet to come held on -- or worse, put even more money into the market.<p>
They should have sold. In 1974, the dollar faced relentless pressure and fell against all the major currencies. In May, inflation rose at a 13.2 percent annual rate. On October 4, the Dow hit 585, the low point in this market. Since January 1973, it had fallen 467 points, or about 44 percent.<p>
Psychologically, investors overvalue past performance -- they can't believe that what worked yesterday won't work tomorrow. Despite all the negative signs, investors hated to abandon the rally that had driven the Dow past 1000 at the end of 1972. In October 1974, the   psychology worked the same way: No one who had been through the past 18 months wanted to buy equities. The Dow would not see 1000 again until November 1980.<p>
DON'T LOOK NOW...<p>
Measured against these meltdowns from the past, how do things stand in October 1996? How likely is this market to crash? And how should you approach it, knowing what you now do about your own investor psychology?<p>
First, watch valuations carefully. Currently, valuations are high, but they aren't yet alarmingly high. The price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500 stocks reached 19.5 on August 14, up from 17.17 a year earlier.<p>
But valuations could easily reach scary levels. Although earnings will almost certainly grow for the rest of this year and in 1997, at this point in the economic cycle they won't grow very fast. Earnings growth rates peaked in the first half of 1995.<p>
That wouldn't be a big problem except that analysts and investors are probably still overestimating future earnings. In August, Standard & Poor's calculated that earnings would grow by 10 percent to 12 percent in 1996. Wall Street analysts, by S&P's estimates, were still predicting 19 percent growth. If earnings disappoint in 1996 and then grow even more slowly in 1997, look out.<p>
Second on your watch list should be interest rates, which have inched upward for much of 1996. The market would probably shrug off a single Federal Reserve increase, but two could spell trouble if investors take that as a sign the Fed has lost control of inflation.<p>
Third, watch the dollar. The buck has climbed against other currencies, such as the yen, for 13 months, but it may be about to reverse course. Why? Because the U.S. trade deficit is still accumulating at a rate of $10 billion to $13 billion a month. The dollar has shrugged off the pressure, but that is largely because foreign investors have been buying U.S. Treasurys.<p>
The flow of foreign money has leveled off recently. If foreign investors become convinced that the dollar is set to fall, they will be less likely to buy U.S. bonds, and that could send U.S. interest rates up. Watch the exchange rate. If the dollar falls below 100 yen, it's a bad sign.<p>
Even though the conditions for a crash aren't in place, investors should still take some simple steps to reduce the risk in their portfolios. Those with a low tolerance for risk or an imminent need for cash should move some money to the sidelines. Reduce the leverage in a portfolio to make sure you aren't forced to sell if the market turns down. Also, review less obvious forms of personal leverage, such as credit-card and home-equity-loan balances. This might be a good time to pay them off by taking some stock-market gains.<p>
It's better to take these elementary precautions now than to wait until we're convinced that this market has turned downward. Although we want to believe otherwise, we are near the end of a market and economic cycle. As growth slows, valuations are headed down. The exciting stories that have fueled this market -- the Internet and telecommunications deregulation, for example -- are very tired. Cycles don't have to end with a bang to do damage to the underprepared investor.<p>
The ratio of risk to reward is moving against investors. The potential upside return from this market is uncertain, and downside risk is higher than it was a year ago. So don't buy on future earnings. Don't pay for stories. Don't chase hot stocks. And don't forget history.<p>

						By Andrew Tobias<p>
A stock drops sharply on bad news, and virtually the next morning the company is hit with a class-action suit alleging securities fraud -- a so-called strike suit. Typically, the suit isn't filed because an angry shareholder calls a lawyer. Quite the opposite. Most are initiated by a small group of lawyers who keep a Rolodex of small shareholders they can use as "named plaintiffs." One such shareholder has reportedly been a named plaintiff in 38 different suits. According to the American Electronics Association, every one of the top ten public companies in Silicon Valley has been hit with one of these suits (though neither Tom Proulx nor Intuit). Is the whole high-tech community a bunch of crooks?<p>
Once hit, the targeted company has a choice: fight and probably win (but you can never tell what a jury will do), which costs millions and is a huge distraction; or just pay a few million dollars to make it go away. Almost everyone grits his teeth and pays. And while this actually winds up hurting shareholders, it's a phenomenal business for a small group of lawyers.<p>
There's plenty of real securities fraud out there, and lawsuits are an important way not just to compensate its victims (if there's anything left with which to do so), but also to deter securities fraud in the first place. It's important to keep that threat real. (It's also important to put the occasional malefactor behind bars.) The trick is to discourage the extortionate strike suits without shutting off the legitimate ones. Prop 201 did this by requiring the loser to pay the winner's legal fees -- but only in this very limited niche of the law, and with safeguards. It required the judge to waive "loser pays" when there were reasonable grounds for bringing the suit even though it lost. Nor would the "little guy" have to join the suit and risk a dime to get his full 100 percent pro rata share of any settlement.<p>
Congress's own strike-suit bill passed over the howls of some of the Democratic Party's largest contributors, like strike-suit king Bill Lerach, whom Common Cause singles out as having given $382,500 to become "a White House regular."  (Separately, his firm contributed more than $1.9 million to the fight against Prop 201.) When the bill got to the president's desk, he halfheartedly vetoed it -- and, for the first and only time in his presidency, was overridden. Joining in the override were Ted Kennedy, Barbara Mikulski (who won a Consumer Federation of America award the same evening I did), and Dianne Feinstein.<p>
So even many good liberals agreed there was a problem. Congress was addressing it at the federal level; Prop 201 was meant to address it at the state level.<p>
With Prop 202, when an acceptable settlement offer was forthcoming within 60 days of receiving an initial "demand letter," the lawyer couldn't take more than a 15 percent slice. If there were no early offer, then the lawyer's compensation would not be limited in any way.<p>
But what if there were a lowball early offer, as often happens today? Under Prop 202, lawyers would be far less tempted to urge acceptance and grab a quick fee -- they'd get only 15 percent, versus today's typical 33 percent. But because they could still charge 33 percent, 40 percent, even 50 percent on anything extra they won by rejecting the lowball offer and fighting for more, they'd have exactly as much incentive as they do today to fight hard for their clients. Same extra effort; same extra reward.<p>
Not only might this scheme net victims more money faster; it could even help a bit to unclog our courts.<p>
What struck me about this idea, when I first saw it on the front page of The New York Times on February 11, 1994, was not just how smart it was, but the remarkable diversity of the people endorsing it: conservatives like Robert Bork, but also two former Harvard Law School deans (Derek Bok and the late Erwin Griswold -- dean when Ralph Nader was at Harvard), former Brandeis University president Morris Abram, former ACLU president Norman Dorsen, and even a former president of the American College of Trial Lawyers, Leon Silverman. This idea seemed to be so good (like Props 200 and 201, I felt), it cut across ideological lines.<p>
The 15 percent cap wasn't a limit on what lawyers could earn -- they could still earn millions -- but rather a limit on the "contingency fee" they could charge when there was an early offer and little real "contingency." The California state bar's own canon of ethics requires lawyers, in setting fees, to weigh 11 factors -- mainly, how much work they did and how much risk they took. Yet -- and isn't this remarkable? -- the fee always seems to come out to 33 percent. Prop 202 was less "wage controls" than a sort of "usury law" for lawyers.

Michigan's no-fault, adopted in 1973, is widely regarded as the nation's strongest and best plan. It provides unlimited medical and rehabilitation benefits and substantial coverage for wage loss. Yet premiums in Michigan today are significantly lower than in California. This is possible primarily because Michigan also has the nation's strongest "threshold." You can sue for pain an dsuffering only in cases of "death, serious impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement."<p>
Still, there are problems. Until 1986, judges decided when the threshold had been met. Then the trial lawyers succeeded in getting the Michigan Supreme Court to rule that, because the law had not specified otherwise, this was a "question of fact" for a jury to decide rather than a "question of law" for the judge. The result was rising costs -- which the trial lawyers gleefully cite as an argument against no-fault -- as more cases went to jury trials (expensive even when you win) and some of those resulted in awards. <p>
Recently, some balance was restored by teh Michigan legislature that should at least partly rein in the lawsuits, and thus the costs, once again. <p>
Some thoughtful people felt Prop 200 should have allowed more lawsuits and unlimited benefits like Michigan. Fair enough. But lawsuits and unlimited benefits are expensive. How will low-income families pay the bill? We chose a middle ground.

						Arthur Durone, 32, an underwater-demolition specialist from San Gabriel, was riding his bike five years ago when he was hit by an uninsured motorist. He flew over the top of the car as it sped off. The driver was not charged with leaving the scene because, as it happened, Mr. Durone's hand had caught in her luggage rack. He was dragged four-tenths of a mile until the car's engine -- damaged by the impact -- conked out. Amazingly, he lived.<p>
Under today's auto-insurance system, he got nothing beyond the uninsured-motorist coverage he had purchased. He lost all his savings and his house. Under Prop 200, he would have had all his medical and rehab covered, plus $30,000 a year of lost wages, up to a combined limit of $1 million, plus up to $250,000 more for pain and suffering. All that for less than the cost of auto insurance today. 
When you come right down to it, Prop 200 wasn't a fight between people like me and Ralph. It was between ordinary people like Arthur Durone and Jeff Reuvekamp (see "<A href="/articles/Z9610C06.html">Could It Be the Money?</A>").<p>

As many thousands of trial lawyers as there are in California, that's about how many agents of deception it sometimes seemed to me were working against us.<p>
For example, on January 9, 1996, the San Francisco Chronicle published a letter from one Jeff Reuvekamp. It was almost word for word from the literature of the lawyers, and it concluded by asking why non-Californians like me were "trying to force no-fault insurance [on the people of California] -- could it be the money?"
What Mr. Reuvekamp didn't disclose in the letter -- and this is what I'd call the sneaky part -- is that while he himself is not a personal-injury lawyer, his wife, Mylene, is. So if Prop 200 passed, it wasn't my finances that would have been affected, as he implied -- my finances wouldn't have been affected in any way. It was his. He was the one with the undisclosed stake in this. <p>
I'm sure the Reuvekamps wish people like Arthur Durone (see "<A href="/articles/Z9610C07.html">Living Proof</A>") no harm. Nonetheless, their first concern is protecting their own livelihood, not his.

						He's the father of the consumer movement and the man running for president as a consumer advocate. He wouldn't dream of doing anything that would actually hurt consumers. But he did.<p>
By Andrew Tobias<p>
Okay, Ralph Nader is neither fat nor an idiot.<p>
In fact, he's lean and smart and has done some extraordinary things over the years. But recently, he was the linchpin of a deceptive campaign, the outcome of which cost California consumers more than $3 billion a year. This is the story of how he shafted them, despite what were doubtless good intentions, and thwarts reform that could save almost all of us money. The roots of this story go back a long way. <p>
Chapter 1
F. Lee Bailey<p>
The year was 1971. I was at Harvard Business School listening to a fellow named Glenn Turner address the topic "Con Man or Saint?" It was his contention that his company, Koscot Interplanetary, was a legitimate business selling mink-oil-based "kosmetics." A great many state attorneys general disagreed. They contended Koscot was a pyramid scheme -- like a chain letter at $5,000 a pop.<p>
By the end of the hour, we had concluded that Turner was immensely likable but, indeed, a con man. (He took a show of hands.)<p>
"You know the problem with you people?" he told us. "You think too much! If you could just come down to Florida and see our operation, you'd believe, like everyone else. In fact, tell you what I'll do. I'll fly you all down there. Anybody want to come?"<p>
Stunned silence. This was wintertime. In Boston.<p>
A couple of weeks later, we were deplaning from two of Turner's aircraft, greeted on the tarmac by Miss Orlando and Turner's 33-inch-tall twin lieutenants. By the time we left, all but one of us remained convinced he was a con man. (That classmate went on to found an astrological investment advisory firm.) But that's not why I'm telling you this. I'm telling you this because, as part of the show, F. Lee Bailey flew down, piloting his own Learjet, to join us for dinner. In addition to representing Turner -- one of the finest Americans he'd ever met, Bailey told us -- and serving on Turner's executive committee, Bailey, in those years, was helping to lead the battle against no-fault auto insurance.<p>
(With true no-fault, there would be no lawsuits. You couldn't be sued, and you wouldn't have to sue someone else to get compensated for your injuries. A reckless driver could still go to jail or see his insurance rates rocket. But you'd no longer have to pray he was heavily insured if he hurt you.)<p>
"I can understand why no-fault would be a very bad thing for lawyers," I asked Bailey at one point during cocktails, "but isn't it a good thing for drivers?"<p>
Absolutely not, Bailey assured me. He wasn't fighting to protect lawyers' fees; he was fighting to protect the little guy. It wasn't the money; it was the principle.<p>
Chapter 2
Ralph Nader<p>
Shortly after the Koscot Kaper, I was in Washington on my first "book tour." Whom should I see coming toward me down the street but a tall, serious man I instantly recognized as Ralph Nader. Unlike Bailey (who ultimately failed to save Turner), Nader was a hero to me in those days. In some respects, he still is.<p>
I somehow felt that my book, a Wall Street expos of sorts (as much as a 23-year-old who had never worked on Wall Street could expose it), was vaguely related to his own anti-establishmentarianism. So I screwed up my courage, introduced myself, and told him I would be honored if he'd take a copy. And I was honored. After all, this was the guy who had almost single-handedly forced <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> to admit its sins and take safety more seriously. He had founded the consumer movement.<p>
So I was excited to be able to hand Ralph Nader my book and even more excited a while later when my dad worked with him pro bono to produce full-page <a name="AMEX:NYT/A"></a><b>New York Times</b> ads launching Ralph Nader's Public Citizen and the Ralph Nader Congress Project. I have framed copies in my office.<p>
I didn't know at the time that he -- virtually alone among consumer advocates -- opposed no-fault auto insurance of any kind. When it came to the little guy's right to sue -- even his right to sue other little guys, Nader felt -- there could be no compromise, ever, no matter how great the benefit. It was almost as if he believed the right to sue was more important than the right to get anything (since suing only gets you anything if you can prove the other guy was at fault -- and he has something worth getting). This was distinctly not the view of Consumers Union or almost anyone else.<p>
Thirty-four years ago, in 1962, Consumers Union declared that the traditional auto-insurance lawsuit system "produces results which are so unjust, capricious, and so wasteful of both the policyholders' and the accident victim's money that most laymen find it hard to believe the facts when they are first presented." All that's changed since then: it's gotten worse.<p>
 Under true no-fault, which Nader opposes, billions that now go to lawyers and fraud would be saved for victims and consumers. Unfortunately, true no-fault doesn't exist. Most states that think they have no-fault don't -- the lawyers sabotaged it. There are still scads of lawsuits.<p>
Chapter 3
Gay Talese<p>
Cut to 1978. I am out of business school; I've been lucky with a couple of best-sellers. The phone rings. Nan Talese, then with Simon & Schuster, would like me to do a book. "Everybody knows the banks have so much money," she tells me. "And everybody knows Wall Street has so much money. But what a lot of people don't realize is that the insurance companies -- they have so much money, too. Think of all those billions. The power it represents. What do they do with it? The reading public hasn't a clue. You should do a book called The Invisible Bankers." I am paraphrasing here, but that was the essence of it.<p>
The day after we signed the contract, or so it seems to me now, Nan showed up with a huge stack of dog-eared insurance texts.<p>
Hello? Nan is a marvelous literary soul. She is not someone you'd expect to own, or ever to have seen, an insurance text.<p>
Ah. Well. Her husband, Gay, it developed, had been researching this book, but had decided it wasn't for him. These were texts he had accumulated, and now they were mine.<p>
Only with time did I realize what had happened. I had been tricked. While Gay Talese spent years and years of his life "researching" and writing a book about sex, called Thy Neighbor's Wife, I was left to spend years and years of mine on insurance. Not for nothing does Talese get the big bucks.<p>
And so, I have long told the legions of insurance-industry professionals who hate me (the book was subtitled Everything the Insurance Industry Never Wanted You to Know), "Don't blame me. Blame Gay Talese."<p>
Chapter 4
Fantasy Sex Hangings<p>
I quickly found I had a problem. My book was supposed to be a serious yet absorbing peek at how insurance companies invest their money. Well, as it turned out, for the most part, they buy bonds. Now, there's an exciting paragraph or two.<p>
With Nan's permission, I broadened my focus. I discovered that the insurance business was actually quite fascinating. "They Just Want Us to Think It's Boring" was one of my chapter subtitles -- because the less we know about insurance, the more easily insurers can rip us off. I learned, and wrote, about everything from fantasy sex hangings (life-insurance adjusters know they're accidents, not suicides, but use the family's shame to keep from having to pay up), to accounting (and you think your tax returns are creative), to fraud (a Chicago pastor claimed 30 auto-accident injuries in four years).<p>
The insurance industry hated The Invisible Bankers. Sure, there were a few open-minded souls -- "[The author] has done his homework," opined The Actuarial Review; "The book is basically fair," said The Actuary. But most of the good blurbs came from outside the industry: Fortune, Newsweek, The New York Times. One I was particularly proud of came from Ralph Nader: "Fun to read, crackles with wit...shows how much consumers can save if they learn what to demand from insurance companies."<p>
I tell you all this not to line my pockets -- the book is resoundingly out of print -- but rather to establish my credentials. I am no more a "tool of the insurance industry" than... well, Ralph Nader.<p>
Chapter 5
Zero Impact<p>
In writing my book, I naturally gave the most space to the stuff I thought was most interesting or important. One area I skirted almost entirely was health insurance. I knew it was important, I just could never get my head around it. (As the elephant said to the crocodile, "This is just too buch for be!" If you don't know what I'm talking about, sue your mother.) An area I did find easy to understand was auto insurance. As I did my research, I began to realize that we have in this country, to varying degrees (Michigan being an exception), about the worst system anyone could possibly devise. It costs us a fortune, yet little of the money we pay makes it through to the people most seriously hurt. <p>
And unlike health insurance (or Bosnia, or poverty), where there's no simple answer -- with auto insurance there is.<p>
Step one, I have always maintained, is to collect the bulk of the premium at the gas pump (with the rest, to be sure bad drivers pay extra, at registration and through surcharges on traffic violations). That would slash selling costs and end the uninsured-motorist problem. Step two is to adopt true no-fault auto insurance. More on that in a minute.<p>
So two of the chapters of The Invisible Bankers laid out the auto-insurance solution. Not that I expected anything much to happen as a result.<p>
And guess what? I was right. Nothing at all happened.<p>
Chapter 6
Prop 103<p>
That was 1982.<p>
It is now 1988, and out in California -- crazy California -- they are promoting a thing called Proposition 103, which would lower auto-insurance rates by 20 percent. How would they achieve that miracle? Well, just by passing a law.<p>
Isn't that wonderful?<p>
The insurance companies spent $63 million fighting Prop 103. Rates were sky-high, they said, not because they were gouging consumers -- they actually earned less in California than elsewhere -- but because claims were sky-high. ("Hit me, I need the money" was a popular California bumper sticker at the time.) This was true; but who wants to believe an insurance company?<p>
It got very messy, with three "counter propositions" added to the ballot and lots of angry shouting. The one thing that pierced the confusion was Ralph Nader. He said Prop 103 was the one to vote for, and 52 percent of the voters that November did. In fact, it was an organization Nader had helped establish that wrote Prop 103 and started the fight in the first place. That organization -- Voter Revolt -- was headed by Nader acolyte Harvey Rosenfield (Georgetown Law '79). Ralph and Harvey. Harvey and Ralph.<p>
I was only vaguely aware of the battle at the time. I do remember being asked about it on Good Morning America and saying, well, there's no question rates are too high in California, but the way to solve the problem isn't to just decree lower prices; you've got to get at the causes of the problem -- huge legal expenses and massive fraud. Otherwise, why not do this for hamburgers and gasoline and anything else we'd like to see cheaper? I didn't say it with any particular passion -- it just seemed kind of obvious. But to my surprise, by remote TV hookup from 3,000 miles away, someone (whom I now realize must have been Harvey) was replying with considerable heat. Prop 103 was terrific, he said -- I clearly didn't understand.<p>
I was a little struck by that encounter. But more than that, I was struck by the fact that this boring old topic, auto insurance, was actually making the front page in states like California, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. Who'd a thunk it?<p>
So after Prop 103 passed (and auto-insurance rates did not decline 20 percent, but I'll get to that), I wrote a story in Time describing the problem and explaining how to solve it for real -- basically just reprising the two chapters from The Invisible Bankers. <p>
Time reaches four million households.<p>
I got two calls.<p>
Chapter 7
NICO<p>
One was from my mother, who always calls. The other was from Bob Hunter, the nation's leading consumer advocate on insurance. He ran a Nader offshoot called the National Insurance Consumer Organization. Formerly Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter's federal-insurance administrator, Bob is a man of great physical and intellectual stature and the actuary perhaps least loved by the insurance industry. He had been gracious with his time when I was researching The Invisible Bankers and had long been privy to my thoughts about fixing the auto-insurance mess.<p>
Anyway, Bob called. "I think maybe it's time," he said, suggesting that I fund a NICO study on the auto-insurance mess.<p>
You have never seen someone more eager to be tapped for $10,000. I figured, wow: It's one thing for me to write this stuff, but imagine if NICO and the nation's leading insurance critic, Bob Hunter, actually decided to advocate it. I happily wrote the check.<p>
Chapter 8<p>
Bingo<p>
It had taken years, but there we were in Washington at the National Press Club, Bob Hunter and I, May 18, 1992, unveiling our proposal for Pay-at-the-Pump, Private, No-Fault auto insurance. The insurance press (and pretty much only the insurance press) noticed, ridiculed us a bit, and went back to sleep. <p>
I realized that if this thing were ever going to happen, I'd really have to spell it out. Not just say there'd be a way to make pay-at-the-pump fair -- explain exactly how. Not just say no-fault would lower premiums and increase benefits -- prove it point by point.<p>
So I fleshed it all out into a little five-dollar paperback, Auto Insurance Alert! (which I am not flogging, either, because it, too, is out of print, and all the royalties, such as they were, went to NICO and an environmental group). Basically, it was still the same two chapters from The Invisible Bankers, the same article from Time.
But because this time I hoped something might actually happen -- what with great quotes from people like NICO's Hunter ("Join the crusade!") and Newsweek's personal-finance columnist Jane Bryant Quinn ("I love this idea") -- I was more aggressive. I sent pre-publication copies of the manuscript to all 50 governors and insurance commissioners asking for comments.<p>
My purpose was partly to get feedback and partly to try to make state officials feel they were part of the process, not under attack.<p>
And the most remarkable thing happened. Months before the book even came out, I got a call from the office of the chairman of the California Senate Insurance Committee. "We want to turn your manuscript into a constitutional amendment," his chief aide said.<p>
"Who is this really?" I asked.<p>
"No, really," he said. "But don't get too excited. It will never pass." The lawyers and insurance companies would never allow it. But we should try anyway, he said -- raise the public's consciousness on this issue and, well...you never know.<p>
Chapter 9
Stumping for Reform<p>
It was fun. Three of us went on radio and TV plugging Pay-at-the-Pump No-Fault: Art Torres, Senate Insurance Committee chair; John Garamendi, California's elected insurance commissioner; and me. <p>
We got endorsements of one sort or another from USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Sacramento Bee, and Consumers Digest, among others.<p>
The highlight of our campaign may have been a three-hour live televised hearing with "viewer call-ins" -- a first in California's legislative history. One woman called in and said, in effect, "I don't understand what the hell you're talking about, but if the lawyers are against it, I'm for it."<p>
And, of course, the lawyers were against it. Like anyone else, the lawyers didn't want to see their livelihood threatened.<p>
The difference is that when ATMs came along and threatened bank tellers or fax machines came along and threatened bicycle messengers, there wasn't much they could do. What class of employees in this country hasn't faced the trauma of "downsizing" or "reengineering"? Not many come to mind. Even doctors have seen their old ways of doing business crimped. The difference is, doctors and bank tellers and bike messengers don't write the laws. Lawyers do. The second difference is that doctors and bike messengers don't make massive contributions to the Democratic Party. Trial lawyers do.<p>
And for the most part, I'm glad they do. I give the Democratic Party a lot of money, too. But when it comes to prying loose the lawyers' stranglehold on the auto-insurance system -- a system that provides trial lawyers and insurance defense lawyers $2.5 billion a year in California alone -- their political clout is a virtual veto. The lawyers will say and do almost anything to keep from letting go of that money. <p>
As predicted, Senate Bill 684, my-book-as-constitutional-amendment, failed to make it out of committee.<p>
Chapter 10
Cue the Trumpets<p>
And that might have been the end of it, had it not been for an April 6, 1993, Los Angeles Times column lamenting the demise of the bill and urging me to go "the initiative route."<p>
(California is one of those states that allow voters to end-run the legislature. For better or worse -- often worse -- all you need to put a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot is 700,000 valid signatures, at a cost of about $700,000.)<p>
I read that column and heard the music swell. Each of us has a calling and -- appalled though I was by its total lack of pizzazz -- auto-insurance reform seemed more and more to be mine.<p>
Not that I was about to spend $700,000 to do this all by myself. I'm not even from California. And to me, $700,000 is megabucks. But because so much was at stake -- nationwide, a sensible auto-insurance system could annually wring some $30 billion of waste from the economy -- it seemed to me I should try. I have a few California friends to whom $700,000 is a rounding error. I figured: Maybe we can split it three ways.<p>
Sure, it was a long shot. But think for a minute what $30 billion a year means (for if California fixes its auto-insur-ance mess, would not other states follow?). For just nine billion, once, Craig McCaw and Bill Gates intend to girdle the earth with 840 satellites to provide a whole new global communications network. For five more, as reported on the cover of The New York Times Magazine not long ago, some serious visionaries believe we could mount a privately financed manned mission to Mars. Or look at it this way: $30 billion is more than twice our annual foreign-aid budget for the whole world.<p>
It was irresistible.<p>
I hired a young guy, Mike Johnson, from Garamendi's insurance-industry-bashing staff -- and off we went.<p>
Johnson, I should explain, is one of those junkyard-car-driving liberals who make Republicans so nervous. After Harvard ('86) he went to work for Ralph Nader's Public Citizen at $10,500 a year; then on to Voter Revolt at $22,000 a year, fighting for Nader's Prop 103. The night before the election, he and some other zealous Voter Revolters even scaled the H-O-L-L-Y-W-O-O-D sign, in dense fog, adjusting it to read 1-0-3---Y-E-S. (Well, actually, dawn started to break before they could finish, so it read 1-0-3---Y-E-S-O-D.)<p>
I paid him $3,000 a month, no benefits.<p>
Mike recognized that Prop 103 -- though he'd helped pass it -- hadn't worked. ("You know it will never work," an old chum had told Nader at the time. "I know," Ralph supposedly replied, "but they" -- meaning the evil insurance companies -- "deserve it.") The courts had ruled you couldn't just slash rates 20 percent.<p>
In the eight years since Prop 103's passage, $1.2 billion in auto-insurance premiums have been rebated to California motorists. But the irony is that in the four years preceding passage of Prop 103 auto insurers' profit margins were about 2 percent lower in California than nationwide, while in the years since passage, they've been more than 3.5 percent above the national average. (The reason? Just around the time of Prop 103, California entered its steep recession. Recessions mean less driving, less partying, fewer accidents, fewer claims. In some states, auto-insurance rates actually dropped. Not California. There, because of Prop 103, auto insurers were afraid to drop their rates, fearing they'd never get approval from an elected insurance commissioner to restore them when the recession ended. Thus, rates stayed steady, claims dropped, and profits rose.) Thanks to Prop 103, auto-insurance profits in California went from subpar to fat -- the very thing Ralph Nader and Harvey Rosenfield were railing against. Brian Sullivan, publisher of Auto Insurance Report, estimates that Prop 103 has actually cost the people of California $4 billion.<p>
Not being widely known or understood, this unforeseen consequence was not bad for Harvey or Ralph. Their crusading image was intact, and Harvey now earned a good living running a thing he set up called the Prop 103 Enforcement Project, trying to force the insurance companies to disgorge the excess profits he believed Prop 103 required them to. His services in this regard were billed to the California Insurance Department, in at least one instance, at the rate of $295 an hour (although it's not known how much of that, if any, he got to keep).<p>
Chapter 11
Mike and I Get to Work<p>
Mike and I set about to fix California's auto-insurance mess for real. All we had to do was write the initiative, raise $700,000 to get it on the ballot, and win 50.00001 percent of the vote. Fortunately, there were two of us.<p>
 We leased a suite of offices at Hollywood and Vine --  $346 a month.<p>
 We hired an actress-to-be Gal Friday.<p>
 We wrote a terrific initiative. Mike did most of the drafting, but we both slaved over it, with lots of expert help, because the trouble with ballot initiatives is that if they do pass, you're stuck with them. They're not easily amended. It's really, really important, if you get into this game, to write an initiative that will really work. <p>
 I gave NICO $57,000 to hire Tillinghast & Co. -- the world's leading actuarial firm -- to analyze our 25-cent-a-gallon no-fault scheme. Tillinghast estimated that the extra fee required at registration each year to provide its generous benefits would be a modest $91 to $141 per vehicle.* <p>
(*We were pretty sure Tillinghast wasn't skewing its findings in our favor. A huge chunk of its revenue comes from the insurance industry. Why would it go out of its way to jeopardize that for $57,000?)<p>
This was very good news for us, bad news for our opponents. Harvey dealt with it by ignoring it. Though not an actuary himself, he simply told everyone that pay-at-the-pump would hike the price of gas by a dollar or more. (Harvey exploded when, privately, I suggested he was just doing the bidding of the trial bar. Less than 10 percent of his support came from trial lawyers, he told me. Mostly it came in small contributions from consumers.)<p>
 We started looking for money. "Would you match me on this?" I asked one Croesan friend, thinking the idea might amuse him. (He could match me with one day's interest.) After all, how often do you have a shot at making the world $30 billion a year more productive and prosperous? "Nah." Didn't grab him.<p>
A less wealthy friend (just a few hundred million) was more sympathetic. In the sketchiest way, he had heard of my project. "I will give you any amount of money you want," he said when I reached him, "on one condition." Long pause. "You have to promise that you will never tell me anything about it."<p>
"But -- "<p>
"No, you have to promise."<p>
"What do you mean, 'any amount of money?'" I asked, deciding I could live with this one condition.<p>
"Any reasonable number with five zeroes. But you have to promise..."<p>
Only later did it occur to me that $900,000 is a number with five zeroes. But I knew he didn't mean that -- $25,000 or $50,000 was the kind of number he meant. And so, while I was touched and even somewhat elated, I had hit upon a big problem: I was raising money for auto-insurance reform. Do you see what I'm saying? Who cares. Certainly not rich people, to whom auto insurance is a trivial expense. It was not going to be as easy as I had thought to find a couple of guys to split that $700,000 with me.<p>
 We forged ahead and retained a political consulting firm.<p>
 We hired a signature-gathering firm, and I fronted the money to buy new computer equipment for the all-important signature-verification process. California ballot initiatives, it turns out, are not about volunteers visiting neighbors with petitions -- no one does it that way. You pay by the signature. ("Gee," I quickly came to wonder, "why doesn't the state just charge a $700,000 fee -- or at least allow that alternative -- and save everybody a lot of trouble?")<p>
 We enlisted Voter Revolt, Ralph and Harvey's old organization, in our crusade.  (This did not sit well with Ralph and Harvey.) <p>
 We met with some important people we hoped to get on our side. Lunch with some big-shot editors. Lunch with John Gamboa of the Latino Issues Forum and with other members of the Greenlining Coalition (which did wind up giving us its support). Conversations with the Union of Concerned Scientists (which also signed on). Coffee with the head of the California Chamber of Commerce (who did not). Meetings with representatives of Consumers Union.<p>
CU had advocated strong no-fault insurance for decades and was receptive, until its West Coast director, Harry Snyder, returned from sabbatical. He said CU would not help us in any way nor review our initiative because people would never vote for higher-priced gas. *<p>
(*"I do not believe that an initiative that calls for an increase in the cost of gas can be passed by the California voters," Harry wrote to me in October 1993. "I don't care how good it is or what a good deal it is or how you pitch it or what the polling says or how much money can be raised or who will support it. We have not recently examined your proposal because we are engaged in other issues. We have, in the past, supported the concepts contained in your proposed initiative. We are sure that your efforts will be intended to improve the system and protect consumers, but we do not intend to review or support an initiative for auto insurance reform, particularly one based on [blending the premium into the price of gas], at this time.")<p>
Chapter 12
The Limits of Stupidity<p>
Even at our first press conference -- before anyone had actually seen our initiative -- we had opposition. The big oil and insurance companies had formed a group called "Californians to Save Our Economy." What a joke. As if California's auto-insurance system were something worth saving. Here are the facts (and they apply in large measure to every state in the nation, save Michigan):<p>
It's a system that pays more money to lawyers, when you're hurt, than to doctors, nurses, hospitals, rehabilitation specialists, and chiropractors -- combined. California lawyers reap nearly $2.5 billion a year from auto insurance, according to the state insurance department -- considerably more than goes to medical care. That's a pretty big chunk of the $7 billion or so Californians pay for auto insurance to cover injuries.** <p>
(**They pay another $6 billion or so to cover bashed fenders and theft, which no-fault does not affect.)<p>
It's a system that forces you to pay for fraud run wild. Californians -- who've learned there's good money in saying your neck hurts after a fender bender -- are three and a half times as likely to claim "whiplash" after an accident as Michigan drivers, who have no such financial incentive. Three and a half times. Clearly, most or all the extra claims are bogus. But, not being able to tell which, insurers grudgingly pay. This is another huge cost absorbed by honest consumers.<p>
It's a system that overcompensates minor injuries but grossly undercompensates you if you're badly hurt. With minor injuries, there's often a $10,000 or $15,000 settlement. But if someone's badly hurt, forget it. The RAND Corporation's Institute for Civil Justice estimates that for injuries involving $100,000 or more in actual economic losses -- medical expenses and lost wages -- California victims receive from today's auto-insurance system, on average, an amount equal to just 9 percent of those losses. For the other 91 percent, especially if the victim is among the millions with inadequate health and disability insurance, tough luck. It's like homeowner's insurance that pays triple if your stereo's stolen (or you say it was) but only 9 percent if the house burns down.<p>
It's a system so costly that millions of drivers go uninsured -- not great if one hits you.<p>
It costs a typical San Francisco motorist with an unblemished driving record $624 for the minimum $15,000 in liability insurance. For a Los Angeles family with two cars and one occasional teenage driver, $3,314 -- not to mention theft, collision, medical-payments, or uninsured-motorist coverage (and not to mention that $15,000 is not remotely enough coverage to protect your own assets or adequately provide for someone you seriously injure). Not surprisingly, the State of California estimates that more than five million vehicles are driven uninsured.* <p>
(*Given the choice between eating and buying liability insurance -- which doesn't even protect them, just whomever they might hit -- most lower-income families choose to eat.)<p>
Now, you may say, "Five million? Well, that's not so bad. It's only 25 percent to 30 percent of all California drivers." But it's actually worse, because the riskiest and least responsible drivers, for whom the rates are highest, are even less likely than average to have coverage. So the proportion of accident causers driving uninsured may well be closer to 50 percent. If you're injured in a car crash in California, too bad. Half the time, there won't be anything to sue for (uninsured motorists rarely have big bank accounts). The rest of the time, whatever you do get will ordinarily pale in the face of a serious injury. Even if the accident causer had $100,000 in coverage -- and only about 6 percent of insured California motorists have more -- that's still barely $65,000 after legal fees. (And what if it was a hit-and-run? The Los Angeles Times reported 18,317 hit-and-run injuries in 1992 in Los Angeles County alone. Or a one-car crash, as at least 15 percent are? Whom do you sue? What if, finally, it wasn't the other guy's fault? You goofed. All you collect from today's system, despite your own severe injuries, is a lawsuit.)<p>
Why, you might ask, would Ralph Nader help protect a system like this? Why would he stand in the way of efforts that could help solve this problem nationwide?<p>
"The authors of this book are not in favor of no-fault in its present forms," wrote Nader with co-author Wesley Smith in 1990 -- and did not suggest any form in which they would be in favor. "We believe that the compensation is often inadequate" (true everywhere but Michigan) "and that the victims of accidents are asked to pay for the wrongdoing of those who cause the accidents. In other words, safe drivers are penalized while unsafe drivers benefit through no-fault." (Actually, safe drivers are penalized far worse by today's system.) "And why should people give up compensation for pain and suffering in order to expand insurance company profits, anyway?" <p>
Phrased that way, clearly they should not. But expanding insurance company profits isn't why we made pain-and-suffering coverage optional in our initiative. Nor why Consumers Union steadfastly backed no-fault for 30 years.<p>
The case for our initiative was overwhelming. But how can you make the case without money? How can you fight the most powerful interests in the state? <p>
The opposition of the trial lawyers I had naturally expected. And of the insurers. But when the oil companies piled on (heaven forfend we should burn a little less gas into the California air), bringing with them the chamber of commerce ...and with Ralph's boy Harvey telling people it would add a dollar to the price of a gallon of gas...and with Consumers Union refusing even the mildest endorsement...well, it was daunting. But here it was the first week of January 1994, and I had to put up or shut up. If we were going to proceed, the $700,000 signature-gathering effort couldn't be put off any longer. It would cost something like $35,000 a week. Was I in or out?<p>
Hey, even I'm not that stupid.<p>
(INTERMISSION)<p>
It was a longer story than that, of course. Like the time I was waiting to testify in Sacramento and saw one of those "Have you been injured?" ads on TV. To double-check my perception of the system, I called and said my friend had been horribly mangled by an uninsured motorist. The attorney was sympathetic and articulate, but once he had ascertained there was no one to sue -- the county hadn't been negligent with branches overhanging the stop sign, it wasn't the automaker's fault -- well, gosh, he wasn't running a charity. You can't get blood from a stone.<p>
"But my friend!" I cried as convincingly as one can for an imaginary friend.<p>
"Sorry," said the lawyer. Given the circumstances, there was nothing he could do. That's just the way the system works. Accident victims hear this every day of the year.<p>
But enough of that. On to the second half of the story.<p>
Chapter 13
We Regroup<p>
After allowing me to grieve for a few days -- pay-at-the-pump no-fault having become like a child to me -- Mike Johnson suggested I face reality. "I know you're in love with the pay-at-the-pump part of this," he said. (And I was. It had been so much fun devising a system to make it fair and to keep it in private, market-driven, capitalist hands.) "But you also know that 80 percent of the benefit comes from the no-fault side -- eliminating most of the legal fees and fraud."<p>
I said nothing. I knew he was right, but hated to admit it.<p>
"So look. What if we just did a really good no-fault initiative? That would be 80 percent of what we're trying to accomplish, and we'd have only the lawyers and Nader against us."<p>
Hmph, I said. I'd think about it.<p>
We kept our office; I kept paying Mike; I kept thinking about it -- and looking for money.<p>
After a few weeks, swallowing my pride, I agreed that 80 percent is a whole lot better than nothing. "Pay-at-the-pump no-fault," clever as I thought it was, became just "no-fault." But true no-fault that would really eliminate most of the lawsuits and fraud, that would really lower costs and raise benefits -- not fake no-fault of the type they had in Massachusetts and so many other supposed no-fault states, where all you have to do to be able to sue is build up a few thousand dollars in medical expenses to exceed a magic "threshold." Those systems give you all the problems of today, plus they have people purposely going for unneeded care in order to meet the threshold.<p>
Chapter 14
A Pilgrimage to Menlo Park<p>
The reason I wasn't rich enough to finance all this by myself was a company called <a name="NASD:INTU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16001"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intuit</b></a>. My modest nest egg had been hatched from a software program called Managing Your Money, published by a company called MECA Software. Intuit -- started over a kitchen table by Scott Cook and his then 22-year-old partner, Tom Proulx -- had a program called Quicken. You've heard of it? By 1994, Quicken's success had pretty well ended what for me had been a wonderful run.<p>
It occurred to me it might be worth trying to meet these guys. Not only were they now worth many, many tens of millions of dollars (at my expense, as I perceived it), they were from California. Maybe they'd feel guilty about wrecking my life and chip in for California auto-insurance reform.<p>
I made the pilgrimage from MECA to Menlo Park and spent an hour with Scott Cook. As we were leaving, he introduced me to his co-founder, Tom Proulx (pronounced "pru"), who was by then 33 and who, as it happened, was on his way to Los Angeles, too. Same flight.<p>
So there we are, flying down to Los Angeles, and I'm trying to think how to get him to laugh -- yet maybe turn the conversation to my main interest at the same time.<p>
"You know, Tom," I said, "you're getting to be a pretty old guy. You've been with Intuit what -- 11 years now? It's got to have become kind of a rut by now." (In fact, of course, Intuit was on the cutting edge.) "You know what you ought to do?"<p>
"What?" he asked.<p>
"You ought to take a year off and do something really exciting -- like auto-insurance reform." It was so preposterous, I knew he would crack a smile.<p>
He turned to me, deadpan. "You know, I've been thinking about that," he said.<p>
We had known each other for all of 90 minutes, so I realized he was pulling my leg.<p>
But (long story short) he wasn't. Within about six months he had left Intuit, kicked in $100,000 of his own, and was soon working 60- and 70-hour weeks at no pay.<p>
Chapter 15
Tom's Strategy<p>
After thinking about it for a little while, Tom concluded it would be very hard to raise money for auto-insurance reform. What we ought to do, he said, was develop a package of three initiatives, all lawyer-related, to achieve a sort of critical mass.<p>
"Now, Tom," I said slowly. "If it costs $700,000 to get one initiative on the ballot, it will cost $2.1 million for three." Am I going too fast for you? Naturally, I didn't say it this way, I just thought it. This was the genius whose software had outflanked mine?<p>
But, of course, he was right. With a little help from me and others, but very largely on his own, Tom wound up raising $12 million to promote three initiatives for the March 26, 1996, California primary ballot:<p>
Prop 200, the "no-fault" initiative. No longer could you be sued in connection with an accident (unless convicted of driving drunk), but -- more to the point -- no longer would you have to sue someone else, and pray he had insurance, to get compensated. You'd be buying auto insurance to protect yourself -- and you wouldn't have to split the proceeds with a lawyer. <p>
RAND was asked by the California Insurance Department to evaluate Prop 200. It concluded that drivers who today purchase only the statutory minimum $15,000 liability coverage -- coverage that doesn't protect them if hurt, just whomever they hit -- would actually save 17 percent buying Prop 200's standard $1-million-per-person policy. Thus, for less money than they pay now, the typical family of four would be covered for up to $4 million in medical care, rehabilitation, and lost wages. (You could purchase more coverage if you wanted or as little as $50,000 per person -- not nearly enough, but more protection than most have today.) <p>
Under Prop 200, every pedestrian, skateboarder, and bicyclist hit by a car would automatically have been covered for up to $1 million in medical, rehab, and lost wages, even if he or she had no insurance -- plus up to another $250,000 in scheduled pain-and-suffering compensation. And every child in California under the age of 18 would have been covered for at least $50,000 while riding in a car, even if her parents hadn't bought insurance at all.*<p>
(*In the meantime, in addition to suing convicted drunk drivers, you could still sue GM for bad brakes or the county for bad roads or your insurer for bad faith. (Today in California you typically can't sue an insurer for bad faith, because it's typically the other guy's insurance company stiffing you, and you have no contract with it.) If an insurer dragged its feet providing the benefits you had contracted for, Prop 200 imposed a 24 percent annual interest penalty.)<p>
Premiums down, benefits up. Magic? No. Just redirecting nearly $2.5 billion a year from lawyers to consumers and crash victims...along with billions more now lost to fraud.<p>
Prop 201, the "strike suit" initiative. This was our version, for California, of what Congress overwhelmingly passed last year at the federal level to discourage ill-founded securities suits (while allowing the real ones to proceed). It's a racket that's been plaguing high-tech companies in particular. (See sidebar on page TK.)<p>
Prop 202, the "contingent fee" initiative. This would have kept a lawyer from taking more than 15 percent in cases where the initial "demand letter" resulted in a quick settlement. The goal: to leave more money in the victim's pocket -- and encourage settlements. (See sidebar on page TK.)<p>
Armed with these three initiatives, the scruffy, low-paid, idealistic young troops of Voter Revolt -- from which Harvey Rosenfield had by now been forced by his fellow board members to resign -- knocked on doors signing up more than 100,000 supporters, including 15,000 small contributors. But the overwhelming majority of our money came from high-tech executives and venture capitalists incensed over the strike suit issue. Our Silicon Valley backers -- people like Gordon Moore, chairman of <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>, and the late David Packard, co-founder of <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett Packard</b></a> -- liked Prop 200 and Prop 202 well enough. But what they really cared about was Prop 201.<p>
Chapter 16
The Lawyers' Strategy<p>
The trial lawyers' strategy was to say whatever they had to to confuse the jury and win. But to get others to say it for them, since they knew that their own credibility was at a fairly low ebb.<p>
Naturally, the fight would not be portrayed as a matter of protecting lawyers against a huge pay cut. No, it was a matter of protecting the little guy's right to sue. <p>
Indeed, lest there be any misunderstanding about whose side they were on, the California Trial Lawyers Association, 5,000 members strong, changed its name to the "Consumer Attorneys of California" -- "CACA," as we happily noted.<p>
Even so, they kept a low profile. When radio and TV shows called the trial lawyers for someone to debate us, they almost never got a trial lawyer. Heavens, no. Instead, CACA gave them a "consumer advocate" like Harvey Rosenfield...or a particularly annoying woman Harvey had hired named Kelly Hayes-Raitt ("If you were my wife," one exasperated radio talk-show host told her, on air, "I'd hang myself") ... or Nader co-author Wesley Smith, whom Harvey had also hired. Nader himself refused to debate.<p>
Virtually all the money to fight us came from trial lawyers, but the front group Harvey set up was called Citizens Against Phony Initiatives. Our initiatives were phony, because -- well, here's a taste of the rhetoric:<p>
An exhaustive investigation of documents from court proceedings, reports filed with the Fair Political Practices Commission and other confidential sources reveal an elaborate Ponzi scheme. Political mercenaries, whose histories are fraught with misdealings, fraud, and hypocrisy in which the interests of consumers are ignored or abused for personal gain, have organized a highly lucrative campaign guaranteeing themselves hundreds of thousands of dollars in consulting and signature-gathering contracts from big business and the insurance industry.<p>
Mike and I, it seems, were in it for the money.*<p>
(*A Ponzi scheme, of course, has nothing to do with any of this. It's where someone promises high returns -- using money from more and more new investors to pay for old ones.)<p>
It's true, of course, that once we got Tom on board, and once Tom was able to raise millions for the campaign, people would make money from it. Not Mike, to any appreciable degree. And certainly not Tom or I -- we were paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for the privilege. But printers, TV stations -- and, yes, the pollsters and campaign managers and signature gatherers who are in this business. Call them mercenaries if you want. But they didn't hatch this effort -- I did.<p>
Chapter 17
Hawaii<p>
Out of the blue, Hawaii's legislators passed a true no-fault bill of their own. (Perhaps they were in on the Ponzi scheme, too.) It wasn't perfect, but it would have cut auto-insurance premiums by an estimated 45 percent or more -- in part merely by shifting costs to Hawaii's universal health-care system, but largely through savings on lawyers and fraud.<p>
Here was a state with just about the lowest accident rate in the nation, yet nearly the highest auto-insurance rates. This bill would have fixed that, while providing better protection to the worst hurt.<p>
Ralph and Harvey flew to Hawaii to try to persuade Governor Ben Cayetano to veto it. Which wasn't hard -- before entering politics, Cayetano was a trial lawyer. What they were really there to do was give him some political cover. After all, if Nader's agin' it (and the insurance industry's fer it), maybe it ain't so good after all.<p>
In fact, the insurance industry was not of one mind on this bill. The stock companies, like <a name="NYSE:ALL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16182"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Allstate</b></a> and AIG, care first about profits. A 45 percent premium reduction would have made auto insurance a 45 percent smaller business. So they weren't fer it at all. ("Don't let it pass," AIG chairman Maurice Greenberg is said to have instructed the head of AIG's Hawaii operation.)<p>
The mutual companies -- those owned by the policyholders themselves, like State Farm and USAA -- were for it. After all, their customers are their shareholders. So, where a stock company sometimes has to choose between the interests of its customers and the interests of its owners, a mutual faces no such conflict. In truth, the dilemma for the mutuals is to choose between its customer-owners and its employees or, in this case, its agents. If slashing lawsuits and fraud cuts premiums 45 percent, it also cuts agent commissions 45 percent.<p>
To my surprise -- and to its considerable credit -- State Farm and its agents actually chose to put their customer-owners' interests first. (State Farm's executives weren't affected either way. They are paid straight salary, no bonuses, profit shares, or stock options. For years the CEO earned a flat $600,000. Recently, it was bumped up to $1.25 million -- but for the CEO of the 12th-largest Fortune 500 company , this is modest pay. The guys at Allstate and GEICO, smaller companies, make considerably more.) State Farm ran a series of full-page ads advocating public support for the bill.<p>
Retorted an ad in which Nader was prominently featured: "Does it bother you that most information you're getting comes from an insurance company that stands to gain immense profits?" Not explained was how State Farm would gain "immense profits" by cutting its rates 45 percent, nor why other companies, if it were such a gold mine, wouldn't compete and drive prices down, nor how a change in its Hawaii auto-insurance profits could really impact the 12th-largest company on the Fortune 500 in any noticeable way -- nor what terrible thing State Farm would do with all those immense Hawaii profits. (When a mutual has profits in excess of what it needs to build reserves to cover catastrophes, it pays them back out to its policyholders as dividends. For example, USAA recently paid a $480 million dividend to its 2.3 million auto-insurance policyholders. Between 1991 and 1995, in states where profits had been more than adequate to boost reserves, State Farm paid out $790 million.)<p>
Nader must understand this stuff. He must know the difference between a stock company and a mutual. He must know, at least more or less, that the gargantuan State Farm reserves he rails against amount to barely $500 per policy, and that the executive compensation at State Farm is not unreasonable compared with the rest of American industry. (Heck: Rhoda Karpatkin, the lawyer who heads Consumers Union, pulls down $237,000 a year -- why isn't he railing against that?) He must know all this, but it just doesn't seem to matter.<p>
Cayetano vetoed the bill.<p>
But wait. Would the legislature override? It had never happened since Hawaii achieved statehood, but it looked as if the votes might just be there.<p>
Out I flew -- 60,000 frequent-flier miles -- for a two-day trip to Hawaii. (I love Hawaii, but not in a suit and tie, in June.) I addressed an informal session of the legislators, urging them to stick to their guns; I made the ritual three-minute TV-news appearances; I flew home.<p>
It was a cliff-hanger. To keep it from going over the edge, the governor's insurance commissioner, Wayne Metcalf, issued a complaint on June 28, 1995, the crucial moment, blasting the State Farm ads as deceptive and effectively banning any further ads in favor of the bill. Of course, the complaint was eventually dismissed -- but only months later. In the meantime, it had its desired effect. The override effort narrowly failed.<p>
Personal-injury lawyers continue to do a nice business with auto-accident lawsuits in "no-fault" Hawaii. The insurance-company lawyers continue to do a nice business fighting those suits. The governor and his friends are presumably happy. Ralph and Harvey scored another victory.<p>
Chapter 18
Harvey's Lie<p>
Meanwhile, "Citizens Against Phony Initiatives" was gearing up to achieve the same victory in California. Who exactly were these "citizens"?<p>
They were, in a word, Harvey Rosenfield. Citizens Against Phony Initiatives shared the same office and phone number as his Network Project (also known as the Proposition 103 Enforcement Project); and its mouthpiece, Kelly Hayes-Raitt, had been working for Harvey before taking on her new role.*<p>
(*"What did you just say?" Kelly asked the talk-show host after a long silence. Perhaps she had misheard. "If you were married, you'd hang yourself?" "No, if I were married to YOU, I'd hang myself," he said.)<p>
It was our contention that Harvey's group was the phony one  -- that he and it were a front for the trial lawyers.<p>
As I have mentioned, talk like this really got Harvey steamed. He told anyone who asked -- including The Sacramento Bee on December 17, 1995 -- that no more than 10 percent of his support came from trial lawyers.<p>
Imagine our surprise, therefore, to find misfiled in the state attorney general's office a report -- signed by Harvey himself and stamped "not subject to public inspection" -- showing that Rosenfield's Network Project had received more than $400,000 from trial-lawyer sources from 1991 through 1994. Indeed, 100 percent of the listed contributions were from, or directed by, a trial lawyer -- every one of them.**<p>
(**Only contributions of $5,000 or more were reported. It's possible some smaller contributions were not from trial lawyers. But trial lawyers clearly provided the bulk of his support and were the contributors to whom he was most indebted. [On a personal note, Harvey purchased a $357,000 home in 1990. A colleague at the time overheard him telling famed trial lawyer Bill Shernoff that without Shernoff's $10,000 he could never have swung the down payment. Shernoff was on a yacht and could not be reached for three weeks "unless it was a matter of life and death," his secretary said when I called for confirmation.])<p>
Nor were these contributions from supportive consumers who just happened to be trial lawyers. Most of the money came from past presidents and other leaders of the trial lawyers' lobby. Rosenfield's little organization even received $9,000 a month for most of 1993 from the Los Angeles Trial Lawyers Association. Perhaps most remarkable of all, trial lawyers funneled to him just over $100,000 from two special funds established with money from class-action settlements that are supposed to be used to benefit consumers -- not to campaign against reforms that would help them.<p>
After we released this information, Harvey took a less visible role in the campaign, leaving those he had hired -- Wesley and Kelly -- to do most of the talking.*<p>
(*Kelly will tell you that, gosh, the lawyers didn't fund her work -- it was mostly unions and nurses that did. And technically, tailored to the public-reporting needs of the campaign, that was true. But it was our guess that the California Nurses Association's sudden interest in denying medical care to crash victims did not stem from any deep-seated nursely conviction, but rather from political favor swapping. It may not have been coincidence that Ralph and Harvey are key supporters of a November ballot initiative that would establish mandated nurse staffing levels for HMOs, or that Harvey has received tens of thousands of dollars from the California Nurses Association in connection with that campaign. All legal, I'm sure, but quite different from the idea that nurses around California had studied Props 200, 201, and 202 and wanted to chip in $20 here, $50 there, to try to defeat them. Kelly never mentioned the connection. Maybe she had no inkling that just a week after the election the trial lawyers would donate $190,000 to the nurses' campaign -- or that this money would come directly from the checking account of "Consumers and Their Attorneys Against Prop 200, 201 & 202." California law (Section 89512.5) requires that any such disbursements be "reasonably related to a political, legislative, or governmental purpose of the committee." How would disbursing $190,000 to the nurses' campaign be related to defeating Props 200, 201, and 202? There may be another explanation, but the one that jumps to my mind is: They were paying the nurses for services rendered.)<p>
Did Ralph know that his close associate was lying all these years and actively seeking to hide the source of his support? <p>
Chapter 19
Did Ralph Lie, TOO?<p>
Shortly after The Sacramento Bee reported Harvey's claim that "no more than 10 percent" of his support comes from lawyers, The New York Times did a lengthy Nader profile. One tidbit that caught my eye: "Public Citizen and other Nader groups take less than 1 percent in contributions from all lawyers, not just the trial bar, Mr. Nader said."<p>
Could this be true? Perhaps. It's the same thing he faxed Forbes when it profiled him in 1989. But here's what four major trial lawyers from around the country told Forbes:<p>
"We are what supports Ralph Nader."
	 -- Fred Levin (Forbes says he earned $7.5 million in 1988)<p>
"Nader supports all of our issues and we support all of his."
	 -- Bob Gibbins ($3.7 million)<p>
"We support him overtly, covertly, in every way possible. He is our hero. We have supported him for decades....I would think we give him a huge percentage of what he raises. What moneyed groups could he turn to other than trial lawyers?"
	 -- Pat Maloney ($6 million)<p>
"I can get on the phone and raise $100,000 for Nader in one day."
	 -- Herb Hafif ($40 million)<p>
In a subsequent article, Hafif was quoted as saying that in 1988 Prop 106 -- a fee-limiting measure vaguely similar to our Prop 202 -- "was certain to pass. It had 70 percent to 80 percent approval ratings among the public....Finally I asked Ralph to help, and he did...and I helped his [Prop 103] initiative, and it passed by a few points, and we beat 106 by a few points." It was win-win for everyone but the public.<p>
If Ralph Nader says less than 1 percent of his support has come from lawyers, you just have to believe it. He's Ralph Nader. If Ralph Nader identifies me as "a business consultant" and characterizes Mike Johnson and me as "consumer-protection impersonators," well, then, that's what we must be.<p>
In slamming Mike, Nader writes that "[Johnson] bills himself as a 'former policy analyst for Ralph Nader,' when in fact he was turned down for a position at this office some ten years ago and instead worked in the mid-1980s for an organization [Public Citizen] I have not run since 1981."<p>
Makes it sound as if Ralph may never even have met him, no? But in the first place, Johnson does not bill himself as a "former policy analyst for Ralph Nader," but rather as a "former policy analyst for Ralph Nader's Public Citizen" -- which he was. And while Nader did resign as president of Public Citizen in 1981, he remains intimately involved and regularly signs its fund-raising letters. So it very much is Ralph Nader's Public Citizen. Nader's assertion that Mike was turned down for a job is just false, Mike says. And would you be surprised to know, from Ralph's description, that Mike ghostwrote an op-ed for Ralph that ran in the Los Angeles Times? Or that he accompanied Ralph -- just the two of them -- on trips to Florida, Kansas, California, and New York?<p>
Not to say Mike was a key Nader aide. Just that, like hundreds of other young people over the years, Mike had been inspired by Ralph's work and hoped to do some good as one of his troopers. "As you know," Mike wrote Ralph when he resigned from Public Citizen in October 1991, before going to work for the insurance commissioner, "I have devoted much of my time and energy over the last five years working for insurance reform. Recently, however, I have come to the conclusion that our rigid opposition to no-fault runs counter to honest insurance reform and citizen empowerment."
And don't blame my corrupting influence. This was two years before I had even heard of Mike Johnson.<p>
Chapter 20
The Bombshell<p>
Traditionally, no-fault has been a good bipartisan issue. Only Nader, virtually alone among consumer advocates, has consistently opposed it -- in every form in every place no matter what. This is particularly ironic, because true no-fault increases consumer choice and auto safety. <p>
(Today, under the system Ralph protects, you don't get to choose the insurance company that settles your claim if hurt -- the guy who hit you does. You have to settle with his company. And today, insurers can't give people much incentive to purchase safe cars, because they're largely covering the injuries you might cause someone else -- and they don't know what kind of unsafe car he'll be driving.)<p>
First proposed in 1916 as an analog to workers' comp (another no-fault system -- would Harvey and Ralph repeal that? ), no-fault has been advocated over and over, but almost always defeated by the lawyers.*<p>
(*Workers' comp certainly has its problems. But replacing it with a system in which every injury results in a contingent-fee lawsuit and victims must prove fault to get compensated, like auto insurance, is not the solution.)<p>
In Massachusetts, when the trial lawyers realized they couldn't win outright, they just performed a clever maneuver they would repeat almost everywhere else, when needed: They got the legislators to throw in a low threshold above which you could sue. When the law was first passed in 1971, anyone with $500 or more in medical expenses could sue. That threshold -- since raised to $2,000 -- quickly became a target instead. How hard is it to rack up $2,000 in medical bills? (When the threshold jumped from $500 to $2,000 in 1988, guess what? The number of doctor's visits for the typical injury claim jumped from 13 to 30.)<p>
Of course, almost none of these cases actually goes to trial. Almost all are settled, typically for three or four times the "actual" expenses -- which provides a further incentive to pad the claims. Every extra MRI scan means thousands of dollars in cash for you and your attorney.<p>
The brilliance of the trial lawyers' maneuver, back in the early days of "no-fault," was not only that they more or less gutted it in almost every state where it was adopted (Michigan again being the most prominent exception), dooming it to continued lawsuits, fraud, and failure, but that they would be able to point to this failure when the next generation of reformers came along. 
Us. 
"See?" they could say. "No-fault hasn't worked. It's expensive. It's an old idea. Everyone hates it." And, of course -- because they sabotaged it in the first place -- they're right.<p>
Most informed consumer advocates know all this. Consumers Union has been writing about it for decades. "The verdict is unanimous," CU wrote, via its Consumer Reports magazine, in 1971. "Something must be done to make insurance do a better job of paying the cost of highway injuries." Yet in California and most other places, despite CU's long-standing good intentions, nothing has been done. "CU agrees that no-fault auto insurance" -- real no-fault, not phony low-dollar-threshold no-fault -- "is an idea whose time has come," it wrote in 1973. "Car owners get more value for their premium dollars under no-fault," it wrote in 1984.<p>
That 1984 article ("Whatever Happened to No-Fault?") led off with two real-life horror stories. The first was of a terribly injured young man who got nothing from the traditional lawsuit auto-insurance system because there was no one to sue. (Under Prop 200, all his expenses and hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost wages would have been paid.) The second story was of a terribly injured little girl who -- because she lived in Michigan -- did much better. (With Prop 200, she would have done better still.) Both examples that CU chose to highlight fairly shouted for support of Prop 200. <p>
STILL NEEDED: GOOD NO-FAULT LAWS, ran a 1988 Consumer Reports headline.<p>
STRONG NO-FAULT LAWS, STILL THE BEST ANSWER -- 1992.<p>
Given that background, I had naturally been disappointed when Harry Snyder, CU's West Coast head, declined to help with even the mildest endorsement of pay-at-the-pump no-fault or of Prop 200's no-fault. <p>
But imagine my dismay to receive, upon returning from Hawaii, a copy of a three-page press release sent, as best we could tell, to every news outlet in California, dated June 29, 1995, headlined: 75 PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS WARN PUBLIC ON "ALLIANCE" TORT INITIATIVES. (The official name of our three-initiative effort was the Alliance to Revitalize California.) Not only was Consumers Union among the signatories; at the top of page one -- "For Immediate Release" -- the lead contact was "Harry Snyder됚onsumers Union." Just below was the other contact: Harvey Rosenfield.<p>
Chapter 21
Counterattack<p>
The press release was not about accuracy or thoughtful public policy, in my view. Rather, it seemed to me, it was about gulling well-intentioned liberals who hadn't heard our side of the story -- or known where Harvey's support had been coming from all these years -- into joining Ralph and Harvey in doing the trial lawyers' dirty work.<p>
I spent the entire Fourth of July weekend, and then some, preparing an annotated version -- 41 footnotes pointing out what I considered to be 41 inaccuracies, false impressions, ironies, and attempts to deceive. (Least important, but indicative, was my being presented as a "corporate consultant." There's nothing wrong with being a corporate consultant, of course; but that's simply not what I am.)<p>
My thought was that, when these 75 folks saw what they had put their name to, they'd want to disassociate themselves from the statement.<p>
To their credit, a few, like the Reverend Cornelius Taylor of the NAACP, did. But very few. <p>
Realistically, once Ralph and Harvey had recruited their most faithful -- many of the 75 had direct ties to Nader organizations -- and once they had then used that impressive list to sign up others, their campaign acquired a sort of snowball effect. What decent consumer advocate wouldn't want to be in company like that? Wouldn't trust Ralph and Harvey and Consumers Union to do the analysis? <p>
The problem is, once you've signed on, it becomes very awkward to sign off. What are you going to do? Issue a statement that you haven't done your homework? Risk disappointing or embarrassing friends you work with all the time?<p>
I began calling names on the list. With some, who even knew how to reach them? Grandmothers for Peace? It sounded good, and doubtless exists in some form -- but not in any California phone book I could find. So I just picked groups that made me particularly nuts.<p>
For example, I called Valerie Papaya Mann, who runs the AIDS Project of East Bay. At first, she had no idea what I was talking about. She vaguely remembered, sort of, agreeing to have her name used on some kind of statement, but she was very busy -- caring for AIDS patients in the East Bay is more than a full-time calling -- and, no, she didn't remember getting my 41-point rebuttal.<p>
"Ms. Mann," I said, in effect, "I'm awfully sorry to take your time with this, but you've signed a statement that's really harmful. I have more than 100 friends who have died of AIDS. I'm a sponsor of the GMHC AIDS Walk in New York every year, APLA's event in Los Angeles, HRC's event in Miami. I give to ARC in Boston....I mean, I just would never be party to something that would hurt people with AIDS. Are you sure you really considered the pros and cons of our three initiatives before lending your name to this?"<p>
That was the essence of it, and after repeated calls and faxes, to her considerable credit, Ms. Mann agreed she didn't know the first thing about what we were doing, or the statement she had signed, and agreed to disassociate herself from it.<p>
But do you know how much work that took?<p>
Was I really going to be able to persuade Mary Raftery, head of CALPIRG (one of the 22 state Public Interest Research Groups Ralph Nader inspired), to disassociate herself from Ralph?<p>
One of the others I did try was Bob Fellmeth, a law professor and "children's advocate." Heck, we had law professor Jeffrey O'Connell -- basically, the father of no-fault in America -- endorsing Prop 200. We had Prop 202 based on a concept endorsed by two Harvard Law School deans. We had a provision that would provide a minimum of $50,000 in auto-accident coverage to every child in California. Why would a children's advocate be so opposed to that?<p>
I had long since learned that many Nader allies wouldn't talk or meet with me, so to get Fellmeth to return my call, I did something I wouldn't ordinarily do. I faxed him a note that I was writing an article in which he was identified as "corporate consultant Robert Fellmeth" and just wanted to be sure it was accurate.<p>
He called, perplexed. He had no idea who I was and he was certainly not a corporate consultant -- why would I identify him that way? Well, I said, because that's how you identified me.<p>
I then explained what I meant, and we had what I took to be an excellent chat. It turned out he was a user of Andrew Tobias's Managing Your Money from way back and that he had read some of my stuff -- we had a fine old time.<p>
He promised to retrieve my 41-point rebuttal from his pile and send me some sort of fax about the statement that, in truth, he had not been very deeply involved in drafting.<p>
Later that night, I got a handwritten fax. "Dear Andrew," it read: "My apologies for any indication that you did not believe in good faith that your initiative was meritorious. I have no reason to believe that you do not believe fully in the merits of your proposal. I have some problems with it, but not with you." <p>
Well isn't that nice? What he apparently did not have problems with was keeping his name on an inaccurate, misleading statement. <p>
It was the last I ever heard from Bob Fellmeth. I tried all summer -- and really nicely, deferentially at first -- to get him back on the phone. I offered repeatedly, via fax and his secretary, to fly to San Diego and buy him dinner. Finally, I decided to try a harder edge. On November 2, 1995, I faxed and sent certified mail an "open letter" I had drafted to run in his university newspaper. I asked him to please call if it was in any way inaccurate (a courtesy he had not extended me) and let him know that I'd love not to run the ad if he'd only be willing to talk.<p>
I waited and waited. On February 8, I ran it. "Others, like Reverend Taylor of the NAACP," it concluded, "have disassociated themselves from the June 29 statement you signed, yet you won't even discuss it. Is this the standard of intellectual debate at your Law School?"<p>
Apparently so. To this day I've not heard a word.<p>
Chapter 22
More Counterattack<p>
How do you reach people if they won't even talk? It had begun with Nader himself, and in my more paranoid moments, I fantasize that he simply spread the word: Don't talk to this guy.<p>
As early as March 1989, I had written him an almost fawning (but sincere) letter reminding him of his work with my late father and thanking him for his help in suggesting me and The Invisible Bankers for the Donahue show, and so on, but also asking whether, given the current auto-insurance mess, a distinction could not be made between the right of little guys to sue corporate giants, on the one hand, and the need for little guys to sue each other. Could he give me a little advice on how to proceed?<p>
No answer.<p>
Six months later, because Bob Hunter told me Ralph answers all his mail, I sent it again with a nice little cover note invoking Bob's name and suggesting that perhaps the original hadn't reached him.<p>
No answer.<p>
A year later I tried sending it via perhaps his closest associate in the world, Joan Claybrook, head of Public Citizen (or "Ralph Nader's Public Citizen," as it's often known).<p>
No answer. <p>
From him. From Joan I got a letter written as if it had come from the American Trial Lawyers Association itself. (Only later did I learn that Joan was actually on the board of Trial Lawyers for Public Justice -- and, while we're at it, that she was the most prominent and forceful member of the Consumers Union board. Are you seeing any connections here?)<p>
In April 1993, noticing that Nader was scheduled to attend the same Social Venture Network conference I was (a sort of Ben & Jerry's confab), I called the organizer and asked whether somehow he could put in a word for me and get me 20 minutes.<p>
"I can do better than that," he said. "It's about an hour's drive from the airport -- why don't I ask Ralph if it's okay to have you pick him up. You'll have a nice quiet hour to yourselves."<p>
Perfect.<p>
Except that he then called back to say Ralph had said no.<p>
It was like the movie Roger and Me, about one guy's struggle to get an appointment with Roger Smith, then chairman of General Motors, only it was "Nader and Me."*<p>
(*The director of that film, Michael Moore, worked briefly for Ralph's Center for Responsive Law. After the movie became a hit, Ralph reportedly demanded that Moore contribute $30,000 to the center, claiming that Ralph had gotten him thinking about GM in the first place. Moore refused.)<p>
At the conference itself I left a message with his room asking for ten minutes; when there was no response to that, I finally just went over to him at lunch -- he's only a man, after all, not a god, and there were only about 200 of us in the room -- and asked whether he could find even just a few minutes for us to talk.<p>
Visibly upset, he said it was incredibly rude for me to approach him this way -- he had a speech to give in a few minutes -- and that we had "irreconcilable differences." There was "nothing to discuss."<p>
I guess that's when I gave up on Ralph Nader.<p>
But as I say, it was almost as if Nader had told Bob Fellmeth and every other consumer leader he'd ever mentored -- which was pretty well all of them, it often seemed -- not to talk. He'd do the big thinking for them.<p>
The only other example of this I feel the need to share was a woman who joined the fight against us named Margery Tabankin. I've never actually met or spoken with Ms. T -- though Lord knows I've tried -- but I gather she is one of the key liberal "Hollywood women," her influence not lessened by her position as Barbra Streisand's policy person.<p>
Not only had she joined the effort against us; she had also written a letter to a colleague expressing disappointment over the way our campaign manager, her old friend Bill Zimmerman, had (in her view) sold out.<p>
Bill was amazed that she would not even call first to hear his point of view. After all, they had shuddered in a bomb shelter together in Hanoi when Bill was arranging for medical supplies for the North Vietnamese. (And later, as she doubtless knew, he had risked his life piloting an airlift of supplies over the heads of the FBI to the Indians at Wounded Knee. Whatever you may think of such exploits, they are not trivial liberal credentials.) So in addition to writing to Margery himself, Bill asked me to send her a point-by-point answer to the various misimpressions she seemed to have of Props 200, 201, and 202.<p>
This took two days of my life -- 17 pages. "Because this letter is so long," I led off, "I'll make you a deal. Read it all the way to the end, and I'll give $1,000 to the candidate or charity of your choice, since I assume we support almost all the same ones anyway. Just don't be really cruel and make me support the opposition to our initiatives."<p>
Right? A little bonding? A little incentive? A little humor?<p>
The only response I ever got -- and I also called hoping to take her to lunch and so forth -- was that she was too busy to respond right then, but would.*<p>
(*One woman I did manage to take to lunch was Candace Lightner, founder of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, a wonderful group. Because our initiative singled out convicted drunk drivers as people you could sue (but paid your benefits anyway, since few drunk drivers have much to sue for), I was hoping for her support. "Why are you so tough on trial lawyers?" was her opening statement after we sat down, lending weight to our suspicion that she was already working with the trial lawyers in some way -- and it got little better from there. Needless to say, she did not support us. A month after the election, she was paid $2,512.34 by the Consumer Attorneys Issues Political Action Committee for "consulting." I do not know whether there were other payments as well, or any quid pro quo. I just know the trial lawyers have a lot of influence and a lot of friends.)<p>
Chapter 23
Denouement<p>
I'm mindful that I haven't offered you $1,000 for reading all this and that the time is long past to begin wrapping it up. It's not your fault this was such a ridiculous enterprise, spanning so many years, eating up so much money. What kind of idiot actually thinks he can beat the trial lawyers, anyway? When enough money is at stake -- and never was there more than in California on March 26, 1996 -- they will find a way.<p>
I found it more than a little ironic that 25 years after meeting at Glenn Turner's mansion, F. Lee Bailey and I would both be in California -- he, fighting successfully for O. J. Simpson; I, unsuccessfully, for no-fault.<p>
Nader, too, was in California, briefly. He was running for president. (Of what -- California? I marveled when first told.) The 7 percent he was polling would come straight from Clinton, in a state crucial to Clinton's reelection. Didn't Ralph care about issues like tobacco, equal rights for gays, and a woman's right to choose -- to take just three where the contrast with the Republicans was so stark? "He's stayed conspicuously silent on the tough social issues," says Congressman Barney Frank, who wishes Nader "wouldn't spend so much political energy attacking those who are fighting these battles." ("Gonadal politics" is how Nader sometimes dismisses the concerns of women and gays.)<p>
Anyway, the battle lines were quickly drawn. And discouraging as it was to have so many of the "good guys" (as I thought of the 75 on Harvey and Harry's list) coming out against us, we enlisted a few good guys of our own -- people like Medical Education for South African Blacks co-founders Herb and Joy Kaiser, SmokeFree Educational Services founder Joe Cherner, AmFAR vice-chair Tom Stoddard, and Democratic Leadership Council founder Al From. (My favorite good guy was former Democratic congressman Chet Atkins, who said we should hope people would mistake him for the country-and-western star.)<p>
We also had a motherboard of Silicon Valley CEOs -- people who have shown themselves more than a little adept at analyzing and solving problems rationally. <p>
And, of course, we had all the Republicans, which was a weird feeling for me, to say the least. Not that there aren't a lot of fine Republicans out there. There are. But this should have been a fully bipartisan effort. Yet given the trial lawyers' clout in the Democratic Party, we Democrats weren't doing our part. The worst was when, in the last week, our liberal campaign guys (wincing) got Charlton Heston to do an ad for Prop 202. Charlton Heston was swell as Moses, not half bad as God; but we could hardly have more different political views. "You're kidding," I moaned. But it was our only chance, they felt.<p>
A huge problem: It's much easier to get people to vote NO than YES -- for a NO, you just need to raise one nagging objection, even if you have to be untruthful or misleading to do it.<p>
On Prop 200 -- which would have greatly reduced costs and raised benefits -- the trial lawyers took every opportunity to say the reverse. RAND had estimated that, for many people, auto-insurance rates would fall by nearly 40 percent. So the lawyers simply took ads claiming Prop 200 would raise rates 40 percent. (Well, I thought to myself darkly, at least they got the number right.) I believe Orwell called this technique "the Big Lie." <p>
"Join Ralph Nader and vote NO on the terrible 200s," ran the refrain.  Hike insurance rates 40 percent? Heck: if I hadn't known the truth, I'd have joined Ralph Nader and voted NO.<p>
Now, you may be saying to yourself, "C'mon. The lawyers can't just tell a big fat lie over and over on prime-time TV -- can they?" But the answer is: Sure they can. There is no law against lying in a political campaign.<p>
Columnist Jane Bryant Quinn called the fellow on whose data the lawyers' "40 percent" claim rested, Robert Klein, research director for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. He told her that his data absolutely could not be used to draw conclusions like that. (He subsequently told me that in his 17 years of insurance research he had never seen his work misused in a more irresponsible, misleading way.) "Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who opposes Prop 200, thinks the principle of open access to courts is too important to curtail," concluded Quinn. "[That] argument has merit, but Prop 200 seems to be the greater good." <p>
The other part of the lawyers' strategy against Prop 200 was this simple notion: When someone is hurt by a reckless driver, don't you think the victim should be compensated? Don't you think the wrongdoer should pay?<p>
Who could not answer yes to those questions?<p>
But guess what?<p>
Today in California, the seriously injured victim is not compensated. As noted, RAND estimates that the current system pays the most seriously injured victims just 9 percent of their actual losses on average. Prop 200 would have ratcheted that up to more like 70 percent or 80 percent.<p>
And today in California, the wrongdoer does not pay -- his insurance company does. Or, if he's uninsured or flees the scene, no one pays.<p>
Prop 200 would have done nothing to soften criminal penalties for reckless driving; would still have allowed suits against convicted drunk drivers. Accident causers would still have seen their insurance rates hiked. (But Prop 200 specifically forbade an insurance company from raising rates after an accident that wasn't your fault -- a common practice today.) So, despite the unfortunate term "no-fault," 14 for all practical purposes reckless drivers would have been no more let off the hook than they are today.*<p>
(*We had thought of using a different name, like "no-fraud" or "no-lawyer," but knew that whatever we called it in the press -- and the lawyers -- would brand it no-fault. We didn't want to play it cute. Better, we thought, simply to explain the difference between fake no-fault and real no-fault -- and to point out how little personal responsibility reckless drivers bear today.)<p>
They beat us on this one 65 percent to 35 percent. <p>
Not exactly a close shave.<p>
Frankly, I'm a little surprised we got even 35 percent of the people to vote YES for a plan they'd been told, night after night, would raise their rates 40 percent. A claim that Ralph Nader had, for all practical purposes, confirmed -- not technically, but by allowing himself to be the tag line of all those ads. A claim that Consumers Union had all but confirmed -- not technically, but by allowing its name, and Harry Snyder's, to lead off each of the official opposition "ballot arguments" mailed to every voter in the state, and by never calling a press conference to disassociate itself from Harvey or to lay out the pros and cons of the initiative in the objective, detailed way consumers have come to expect of CU.*<p>
(*"Subscribe to Consumer Reports (800-234-1645), with its unbiased reports on virtually everything," I counseled 80 million readers of Parade in an unrelated article in the midst of this fight, not wanting to lose my own objectivity out of pique.)<p>
It was more than a little galling to me that in the thick of things, there was CU featured in elaborate four-minute segments on the news detailing the pros and cons of various low-fat peanut-butter spreads -- announcing to the world that (surprise) low-fat peanut butter doesn't taste quite as good as the regular brands -- and protecting consumers against the possibility that they might spend $2.39 on a less-than-the-tastiest brand. All this rigorously monitored by CU's incredibly impartial staff within the hallowed walls of its new $40 million building in Yonkers, New York. But could CU release the same sort of careful pro and con on our initiative and let the consumers-voters decide? No. Could CU president Rhoda Karpatkin make time to meet with us? No -- she's abroad a lot on business. <p>
(Rhoda came to run CU direct from 20 years as a lawyer. Her husband was a lawyer. Her daughter is a lawyer. Lawyers and consumer advocacy are tightly bound. Ralph was himself a member of the American Trial Lawyers Association for a while and himself on the board of Consumers Union. Linda Lipsen, ATLA'ssenior director for public affairs, came to that spot after her stint as CU's legislative director. There is absolutely nothing wrong with any of this, but the ties are there. One item not likely to be high on most consumer advocates' agenda for reform is the legal system.)<p>
As for Harry Snyder, back at CU's West Coast office after a sabbatical and then off to China for three weeks, and so forth, he had by now, I'm sure, come to loathe me, although to his credit he always kept his cool. He just wouldn't budge. He felt our initiative restricted too deeply the consumer's right to sue. He had decided on behalf of the people that compensation -- a guaranteed $1 million per person in protection for less than most people were paying today -- was less important than suing. And maybe the people, had they been presented that choice clearly, would have agreed.<p>
From Harry's point of view, it was all a little academic. He told me he had $3 million in liability coverage (so anyone he hurt would certainly have made out fine). He'd been with CU for 21 years, and he told me I had to understand this was a long-term process. No, he'd never achieved anything for auto-insurance consumers in California, but he was busy with other important issues. CU didn't have the time to provide any studies or analyses of the pros and cons of Prop 200. (Nor did he find time to critique it before it was finalized.) <p>
Harry is comfortable in his liberal credentials and wears them well. I have no doubt his heart is in the right place. But it's his turf, his comfortable home in pricey Mill Valley, and if it takes another 10 years, another 20, to fix the auto-insurance mess out there, well -- patience, dear boy, patience.<p>
Harry objected to our plan because it cut back too far on lawsuits. It was too strong, leaving too much money for policyholders and victims, not enough for the lawsuit process, which occasionally -- lottery-like -- wins the lucky accident victim even more money. No one would argue with him that justice is precious. But is justice really being served by the lawsuit auto-insurance system in California today?<p>
The last thing I want to say about Harry is that it would have been hard for him, at least unconsciously, I think, not to have had a special place in his heart for the trial lawyers. The West Coast CU operation, he told The Wall Street Journal, gets about 20 percent of its budget from class-action proceeds -- not necessarily in cases CU has been party to, but simply "leftover" money where not every member of the class can be found. Rather than let the wrongdoer keep that money, judges frequently give a chunk of it to CU -- hundreds of thousands of dollars that CU gets without having to write grant proposals, without having to organize fund-raisers. It's about the sweetest money a nonprofit executive can imagine. And were it not for the fine work of the trial lawyers -- much of which is fine -- Harry would not have it to work with.<p>
(Perhaps to show his independence from the trial lawyers, Harry bravely blasted their tactics once it was too late to do us any good. "Consumers Union is greatly disturbed by the deceptive tactics employed by 'Consumers and Their Attorneys Against Proposition 200, 201, and 202,'" his five-page April 8, 1996, letter to the state bar concluded. "We feel the actions of the group clearly warrant the imposition of disciplinary action and would appreciate some guidance from the State Bar in this regard.")<p>
On Prop 201 -- the securities-law initiative -- the lawyers' TV ad morphed two faces back and forth: Al Shugart's and Charles Keating's. It ominously announced that Shugart (one of our key supporters) had been sued for securities fraud and reminded people of Keating's Lincoln Savings & Loan scandal. It suggested that if Prop 201 succeeded stock swindlers like these would have a field day.<p>
This was a bit unfair -- but typical of the lawyers' tactics.<p>
Keating was a convicted felon. (And nothing about Prop 201 would have kept his victims from recouping just as much as they did without it.) Shugart, by contrast, had never been charged by the government with anything. He had founded <a name="NYSE:SEG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14678"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Seagate Technology</b></a> in 1979 from nothing. Today, it is the world's largest independent maker of computer disk drives, employing 85,000 people. He had been sued, repeatedly, only by the same private lawyers who were paying for this TV commercial.<p>
The first time, in 1984, Seagate was accused of intentionally misleading investors by being too optimistic in its projections. (And perhaps it did -- I don't claim to know.) The lawyers demanded $100 million. Seagate, though certain of its innocence, felt it would be cheaper and far less time-consuming to settle than to fight. "We paid $1 million," Shugart explained, "our insurer paid $8 million, and the lawyers got nearly $3 million." The lawyers felt this grievous wrong had been done -- but a quick $3 million was enough to make them go away. Maybe $100 million was due, but they'd settle for getting the shareholders $6 million instead, net of their own fees.<p>
Not a bad deal for the lawyers, even if it hurt Seagate shareholders. (If you own stock in a fledgling high-tech, you're not eager to see it sued, or to see it fork over $1 million.)<p>
The same lawyers sued twice more. This time, furious, Seagate decided to fight. A judge threw out one of the suits -- but it still cost Seagate $4 million in legal fees, hurting the company's shareholders some more. (Seagate's Japanese competitors must have been amused that its rival had expenses like that.) The third suit is still being fought.<p>
At the time the ad was running, morphing Shugart's face back and forth with Keating's, Seagate stock was at an all-time high. Anyone who had bought it at the time of the alleged fraud would have had a very fat profit -- though it would have been fatter had it not been for the lawyers.<p>
Really, when you come to think of it, it's a great tactic. First, you sue somebody, then (though no court finds in your favor) you slam him for having been sued. (Sound familiar? First you sabotage no-fault; then, years later, you take ads telling everyone, "See? It hasn't worked.")<p>
In most cases, <a name="NASD:TROW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41976"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price</b></a> vice president Liz Buyer told the San Jose Mercury News, these suits "not only aren't helping the small investor" -- and few people know more about small investors than the folks at mutual-fund giant T. Rowe Price -- "they're causing significant harm. The one who gets hurt is the small shareholder. The one who gets helped is the lawyer." <p>
But though Congress voted overwhelmingly to do something about this racket at the federal level, Ralph, Harvey, and crew would not even concede there was a problem. We got 41 percent on this one.
Gosh, I kept thinking as we debated. Just what California needs: fewer Intels and more lawyers.<p>
On Prop 202 -- the 15 percent contingent-fee cap on early settlement offers -- the opposition argued that "you couldn't get a lawyer" if it passed. Lawyers would be so appalled at being limited to 15 percent in quick settlements that they wouldn't take the time to hear your story and write a demand letter.<p>
But what were they going to do -- quit and become high-school teachers? Talk about pay cuts.<p>
Yes, lawyers would earn much less on cases that settled fast, and somewhat less on those that involved a rejected low-ball offer -- money that consumers would save.<p>
But the notion that the good lawyers would all just quit was preposterous -- as was the notion that they'd all go to work for corporations instead. (With more early settlements and fewer auto-accident cases, why would corporations need them?) The fact is if Props 200 and 202 had passed, a tremendous amount of legal talent would have been freed up to serve consumers.<p>
This was our opponents' main argument: If your plane crashed or someone amputated the wrong leg, no good lawyer would be available to represent you. It did not stand up to rational scrutiny; but that's not how elections are determined. We got 48.8 percent of the vote. Close, but no cigar.<p>
Chapter 24
Election Night<p>
In short, we lost them all. Even when we were ahead 53 to 47 on Prop 202 around midnight -- and for a minute I began to think, My God, all this work may actually have accomplished something (albeit not something quite as sexy and exciting as auto-insurance reform) -- the pros were telling me it was hopeless. They could tell from the pattern of precinct reports what would happen.<p>
They beat us with big lies (your rates would go up 40 percent) and little (we were financed by the insurance industry). <p>
In point of fact, "less than 1 percent" of our money (not to sound too much like Ralph here, but our records are on file to prove it) came from the insurance industry -- from a company that doesn't even write auto insurance. We got not one dime from the auto insurers. We suspect the stock companies wanted us to lose (because lower premiums mean lower profits). And although we knew the mutual companies were quietly on our side, because they certainly knew Prop 200 would have been terrific for their customer-owners, they were afraid to help. They wouldn't even send letters to their policyholders advising them what their coverage and premiums would be if Prop 200 passed. They just didn't want to tangle with the lawyers.<p>
Yes, there were trade-offs; there always are.*<p>
(*A good liberal wants insurance that pays generous benefits. But generous benefits cost money -- and a good liberal also wants insurance poor people can afford. It's a trade-off. By slashing legal costs and fraud, we came as close as we could to satisfying both concerns.)<p>
The problem -- hardly unique to our campaign -- was that the trade-offs were not honestly laid out to allow an informed choice.<p>
Which is a great argument against plebiscites (i.e., ballot initiatives) and in favor of "representative democracy" (i.e., electing some smart people like Senators Moynihan, Lieberman, Dole, and McConnell to consider the issues a little more carefully and attempt to make sensible trade-offs). But sometimes the legislature gets blocked by powerful special interests, like the trial lawyers.<p>
I chose the senators in my example above, incidentally, because on June 11 they introduced a no-fault auto-insurance bill in Congress -- the Auto Choice Reform Act. Its approach is a little different from ours (and needs "rehabilitation" explicitly added to its language, among other things), but there is more than one way to skin a cat. Who knows?<p>
One thing for sure: The thousands of Californians who will be seriously injured this year and get nothing, or next to nothing, from today's expensive auto-insurance system -- about 85 percent of all the cases -- have a colossal bone to pick with Ralph Nader.<p>
The millions who won't be hurt have a bone to pick, too. They're paying too much and getting too little. Because of Ralph, more than half the $7 billion they pay for auto-injury insurance will continue to be eaten up by legal costs and fraud.<p>
Not because Ralph is being "paid off" by the trial lawyers in any literal sense -- no one thinks that, least of all me. No one doubts his zeal or commitment to doing what he thinks is right. But sometimes it's harmful to be so sure you're right. <p>
Having taken this much of your time, I want to say just three last things:<p>
First, just as you don't have to be Jewish to love Levy's rye (do they still bake it?), neither do you have to be a Republican to think there's room to make some modest improvements in our legal system. As George McGovern put it not so long ago (and to be honest, I'm not sure I would have put it quite so strongly myself): "America is in the midst of a new civil war, a war that threatens to undercut the civil basis of our society. The weapons of choice are not bullets and bayonets, but abusive lawsuits brought by an army of trial lawyers subverting our system of civil justice while enriching themselves." George McGovern. Are there any star-quality liberals out there willing to help? Warren? Barbra?<p>
Second, it goes without saying -- but is important to say anyway: Most lawyers, including many trial lawyers, are terrific people. Anyone who doubts the important work trial lawyers do, the enormous risks they sometimes take, need only read Jonathan Harr's page-turner, A Civil Action. Ralph is right: We need good trial lawyers. We just don't need them helping us sue one another over auto accidents.<p>
Third, Ralph Nader, who, I say again, is neither fat nor an idiot (unlike a certain radio talk-show host), really has done some great things. But that doesn't make him right about everything. One of the greatest things he's done -- perhaps the greatest -- is to inspire a legion of younger people (many of them now running advocacy organizations of their own) to work for peanuts to make the world a little better. Let me give the last word to him -- or perhaps to my dad. It's the end of that full-page ad they wrote launching Public Citizen: "Let it not be said by a future, forlorn generation that we wasted and lost our great potential because our despair was so deep we didn't even try, or because each of us thought someone else was worrying about our problems."

						Clinton and Dole face off on America's pocketbook issues<p>
By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>
Which presidential candidate will do the most for your finances? That's what we wanted to know when we asked President Bill Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole to answer a series of questions about a variety of issues, from tax cuts to retirement security to medical savings accounts. Given the wide-ranging proposals on personal finance being offered by both sides, it appears that "It's the pocketbook, stupid" is the theme for the 1996 presidential race.<p>
Of course, the candidates are in sync on many financial issues. In a lot of respects, Tweedlebill and Tweedlebob seem to be reading from the same economic script. Clinton is for a $500 family tax credit; so is Dole. Clinton wants expanded IRAs as a hedge against potential financial catastrophes; Dole likes the sound of that, too. Clinton would rather dawdle and appoint a commission to study reforming the teetering Social Security system; so would Dole.<p>
But Dole has sought to provide a dramatic contrast between himself and Clinton with  a whopping $406 billion, 15 percent across-the-board tax cut. On other issues as well, the two candidates have hammered out strikingly different positions on what they would do to your finances. For example, Dole wants medical savings accounts and  a capital-gains tax cut. Clinton won't countenance such changes.<p>
As Clinton and Dole match, then raise  each other with proposals that have elect  me written all over them, use this guide during the dog days of the race.<p>
Middle-class tax breaks. Both Clinton and Dole now dabble with the electoral bribery of a $500-per-child tax credit. Clinton's credit amounts to just $300 in the first two years, moving to $500 in the third. Families earning less than $75,000 get the credit, which stops when the child reaches age 13. Dole's version starts at $250 and hits $500 in the second year. Couples earning up to $110,000 qualify for his credit, which is cut off when the child reaches 18.<p>
Clinton told us he wants to "expand access to college." He proposes giving families a $1,500 annual tax credit for the first two years of college or a $10,000 tuition deduction, phasing out for those earning between $80,000 and $100,000 a year. Taxpayers can take the write-off in later years after using up their credit.<p>
The $10,000 deduction is a good idea -- education costs have not had much help from the tax system. However, making the government chip in for more of students' tuition gives schools added incentive to hike costs. Also, Clinton wants to pay for this bill with airline taxes, although he already vowed to use those taxes for air safety.<p>
This $42.9 billion proposal comes with an interesting cosmetic twist: Clinton says his credit would be "performance based" -- the credit would  be allowed in the second year only if  the student has maintained at least a  B average and has no felony drug convictions. That's a laudable goal, but the program would be an administrative nightmare. We can only hope that taxpayers wouldn't have to staple report cards to their tax returns.<p>
Dole says he wants to let low- and middle-income taxpayers deduct student-loan interest and wants employers to give workers tax-free college-tuition assistance. He would let taxpayers plunk his annual $500-per-child credit into an education account, where earnings would accrue tax free as long as the money sits there for at least five years.<p>
Dole also wants to give taxpayers a teensy $50 credit for donations to anti-poverty charities ($100 for joint filers). Those amounts (paid for with welfare cuts?) would double in the second year and then vanish. He'd also give taxpayers who care for their elderly relatives  a $1,000 deduction. And he says he wants to let the self-employed write off 100 percent of their health-insurance costs -- but the break would take effect ten years from now.<p>
As for Dole's across-the-board cut, it would kick off at just 3.27 percent in the first year, then go to 8.27 percent, 13.27 percent, and finally 15 percent in the fourth year. About 28 percent of this cut would go to households making more than $200,000 a year, with an average cut of $25,200. Families making $50,000 to $75,000 would get an extra $1,800 tax shave.<p>
The retiree safety net. Retirement savings is a hot campaign issue. Clinton told us he wants to help the "51 million working Americans who are not now covered by an employer-provided retirement plan." First on the agenda: IRAs. Current law phases out deductible IRA amounts depending on a taxpayer's income. Clinton wants to double those eligibility limits. He also told us he wants to let workers "take their retirement savings with them" to help "the more than five million workers a year who change jobs and have an employer-provided pension." Portability, while great for workers, may be costly for employers; for those workers with 401(k)s, the law already lets them leave $3,500 or more in their accounts at their old jobs.<p>
Instead of qualifying more taxpayers for IRAs, Dole told us, he supports "increasing the amount that individuals may contribute to their 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts so that they can save more." Hear! Hear! we say. The amounts taxpayers can annually sock away tax free is still paltry -- just $2,000 in an IRA for singles. Both Clinton and Dole want to allow penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs for things like education and major medical expenses. (You can now use IRAs for medical expenses, but you have to spend 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income first.) Neither thought it problematic that using IRAs like regular passbook accounts would shrivel retirement savings. Dole also wants to repeal Clinton's 1993 tax increase on Social Security, which hiked (from 50 to 85 percent) the amount of Social Security benefits taxpayers must include in gross income when they earn more than a certain amount.<p>
The capital-gains standoff. Investors who sell or exchange assets held for more than one year now face a maximum federal tax of 28 percent on long-term net capital gains (the rate is as  high as 39.6 percent on assets held one year or less). Clinton has opposed Dole's efforts to cut the long-term rate to a top effective rate of 19.8 percent. Dole now wants to slash that rate to 14 percent; he claims this would turn back $13 billion to investors over five years. Sounding like a true flat-taxer, Dole told us he's all for "eliminating the double and triple taxation of capital, which discourages savings and entrepreneurship." He says he'd index the basis of certain assets for inflation, but not until 2001.<p>
Dole may model his cut after the 19.8 percent version still afloat in Republican bills before Congress. That version would let taxpayers deduct half of their net long-term gains, with no alternative minimum tax owed on the write-off. If Dole wins, he may let taxpayers deduct half their gains to arrive at adjusted gross income, which would lower the threshold taxpayers must hurdle to deduct miscellaneous and medical deductions, now restricted to 2 percent and 7.5 percent of AGI, respectively.<p>
Clinton told us that a previous Republican bill to cut the capital-gains rate "would not help the economy and was nothing more than a huge, retroactive giveaway." Even so, Clinton says he may let all taxpayers take a onetime $125,000 exclusion from capital gains on the sale of a principal home, now available only to those 55 and older. Clinton may try to sell this idea to middle-class and younger home buyers. But many homeowners already avoid this tax by rolling over their gains into property of equal or greater value. Only taxpayers who don't buy a replacement home or who trade down would benefit. Dole says he would let seniors exclude as much as $500,000 in gains from the sale of a principal residence.<p>
Estate-tax relief. Currently, individuals can pass on $600,000 tax free to heirs; couples, $1.2 million. Amounts exceeding those thresholds can be taxed at rates up to 55 percent. Experts widely agree that estate taxes are the worst kind of double taxation. But Clinton already vetoed Dole's Senate proposal to exempt from this tax the first $1 million in certain family-owned business assets per decedent. Dole still wants it.<p>
Even so, Dole's idea is loaded with caveats. For example, an heir must work at the business for five years in an eight-year stretch within ten years after the original owner's death. And Dole's exemption moves upward in increments of just $100,000, to $1 million in 2006.<p>
Medical savings accounts. MSAs are tax-free accounts from which people could withdraw funds to pay medical bills not covered by insurance. In 1997, Congress plans to test them on 750,000 people, mostly those who are self-employed and covered by a high-deductible or catastrophic health plan. Individuals will be able to sock away at least $1,500 and a maximum $2,250 per year to cover their deductible; families, $3,000 to $4,500. This deduction will also lower the floor for certain write-offs. Employers and employees will be able to make tax-deductible contributions to these accounts, but not both in the same year; workers keep any interest income but can't itemize MSA-covered expenses. <p>
Clinton dislikes MSAs; Dole favors them. Critics say these "medical shelter" accounts may draw healthy, rich people, leaving the halt and the lame in the regular insurance pool, thereby driving up insurance costs. Employers don't have to invest any money in these accounts, and insurers can always jack up co-payments and deductibles to their catastrophic policies.<p>
As the election picks  up steam, remember this: Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's policies will have more impact on the economy, and thus on voters' pocketbooks, than a president of either party. All of these ideas could evanesce into the Oval Office's air, no matter who sits down after the election. So keep an eye on Greenspan and on Congress, which must perform radical surgery on a metastasizing $4 trillion federal budget deficit. The constitutional power of the president is limited -- he has only the bully pulpit and the veto. What Congress does is what counts.<p>

						Take advantage of the expanding reverse-mortgage program<p>
By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>
The Department of Housing and Urban Development has asked Congress to expand the HUD program that allows senior citizens to use the value of their homes to supplement their incomes. HUD wants the program -- now limited to 50,000 loans and effective through September 2000 -- to include all seniors and to extend indefinitely. People 62 or older who either own their homes outright or maintain a nominal mortgage balance can draw against the equity in their house in monthly payments, in a lump sum, or via a credit line. The loan doesn't have to be repaid until the home is sold or the borrower moves out or dies. These payments are based on certain factors: the equity in the home, the home's appraised value, and the borrower's life expectancy. The loans are particularly attractive to retirees or anyone on a fixed income.<p>
Reverse mortgages are complicated, so information is key. Seniors can get the free 45-page booklet Home-Made Money by writing to the AARP Home Equity Information Center, 601 E Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20049. The National Center for Home Equity Conversion puts out Reverse Mortgage Locator, a guide that lists reverse lenders and explains the different types of mortgages; send a self-addressed stamped envelope and one dollar to Reverse Mortgage Locator, 7373 147th St. West, Suite 115, Apple Valley, Minnesota 55124. To find out more about federally insured reverse-mortgage lenders in your area, call HUD at 800-217-6970.

Are taxes actually voluntary? Are licenses unnecessary? Is democracy itself illegal? Yes, yes, and hell yes, say the people who call themselves sovereigns.<p>By John Brant<p>Since I still choose to be enslaved, Richard McDonald suggests, then I might as well drive. Actually, McDonald doesn't use the word "drive." Sovereign citizens don't "drive." They "travel" in their "personal property." The distinction is crucial, McDonald insists; all words 
are crucial. It is by paying fervid, hairsplitting, unending attention to words, he explains, that sovereign citizens lift free of contractual entanglements with the slave masters. Entanglements, such as paying income taxes. Contracts, like a driver's license and license plates.<p>"The sheriff's deputies all know my car, but I don't get stopped much anymore," McDonald says amiably, rising from one of his house's two computer terminals. All around, stacked floor to ceiling in this quirky, rambling compound in the rugged canyons near Simi Valley in an unincorporated area of Ventura County, California, are thousands of law and reference books. They give off a pleasantly musty odor, which overpowers competing essences of house cat. Symphony music issues from speakers wired above the labyrinthine floors. Live oaks grow through the middle of rooms. Jeremiads against gun control glower from the knotty-pine walls.<p>"It's been a long time since they tried to give me a ticket," McDonald goes on, "but sometimes they like to get up real close behind me and let me know they're there." He grins foxily. "So, we might as well use your car."<p>We leave the dank gloom of the main building, crossing a rickety footbridge over a bone-dry gully. McDonald turns back to the house. "Back in the '40s, a religious cult built this place as their church," he explains. "Abbott and Costello and other Hollywood stars used to come out here." He gestures beyond the house, to the baked vacant hills swelling south toward Topanga Canyon. "Charles Manson did his thing on Sharon Tate the next canyon over," he says with a glimmer of proprietary pride. "Sometimes I look up from my desk and see a bobcat walking through the yard. At night we get coyotes. It's a nice quiet place to study and do research."<p>From early morning to late at night, 12 to 14 hours a day, McDonald carries on his research. Sitting at his computers, studying the old law books he buys by the lot at auctions and estate sales, pouring out his interpretations in cranky, obsessively referenced essays that run over the Internet, he works at promulgating the radical, confounding, darkly seductive concept of sovereign citizenship. "Once in a great while, I'll call Richard at two in the morning with a question and catch him playing solitaire," says Jeffrey Thayer, a sovereign-citizenship advocate in Austin, Texas. "But mostly he's always working."<p>Sovereign, or state, citizenship is the fastest-growing, potentially most far-reaching, yet least publicized arm of the antigovernment patriots' movement. Sovereigns share the central tenets of militant groups such as the Montana Freemen -- that the federal government is inherently, premeditatively, and malevolently corrupt and waging veiled but remorseless war against the American people -- but differ sharply in their means of resistance. Although sovereigns vehemently oppose any form of gun control, and most own guns themselves, they deny affiliation with paramilitary groups. They insist they are dedicated to peaceful achievement of their aims. State citizenship draws its adherents mainly from the cities and suburbs and appeals to increasing numbers of women and minorities. It is the vehicle by which thousands of disaffected yet engaged Americans -- most of whom are considerably removed from the gun-nut, white-supremacist stereotype -- wage jihad against the federal mammon.<p>Seen through the sovereign lens, each service, regulation, enfranchisement, law, or levy the government offers or exacts is not a term of the social contract but a gambit by which the government deviously seeks to extend its power and subjugate the individual to its criminal will. The sovereign citizen combats this by severing virtually all ties to government and disclaiming virtually all sources of official documentation. The struggle is carried out publicly, first through exhaustive study of the legal foundations of the perceived tyranny and then through the exploitation of every loophole and means of redress that that legal system offers. Due process is played out to the furthest possible extent. A massive, ongoing battle of paperwork is joined with federal, state, and local officials.<p>Most often working under the guidance of an experienced sovereign mentor, the fledgling state citizen attempts to renounce income taxes, a driver's license and license plates, vehicle registration, zip codes, a Social Security number, voter registration, credit cards, insurance policies, interest-bearing bank accounts, Federal Reserve notes, "usurious" investments in securities, even the common phrasing of names and addresses -- any conceivable wedge the government might drive  into one's life. Once these bonds are carefully broken, the argument runs, the sovereign's civic identity resembles that envisioned by the framers of the Constitution. His "status" has become that of a "state" rather than a "U.S." citizen.<p>Sovereign citizens defend their actions by citing a mountain of generally obscure, dated, tortuously interpreted legal statutes. Even the most modestly educated sovereign becomes a rabid, self-styled legal scholar, tapping out voluminous, arcanely phrased writs on his word processor and downloading fellow state citizens' documents from the Internet. The most articulate and closely reasoned of this research arouses increasingly frequent headaches among judges, assessors, and prosecuting attorneys. The great bulk of it, however, gets dismissed by those same officials as unintelligible rant.<p>"I don't know of any U.S. Supreme Court decision that's upheld anything they stand by," says Jesse Choper, the Earl Warren Professor of Public Law at the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California at Berkeley. "The opening lines of the 14th Amendment make it very clear: All native-born or naturalized persons are citizens both of the nation and of the state where they reside. Sure, it's possible for them to renounce citizenship. They can even try to move to another country, if another country would have them. But ultimately, so what? What are the consequences of what they do? Whether alien or not, they're still subject to the laws of the country."<p>But to an astonishing degree, sovereigns defy what they consider the vain warnings and unlawful judgments of the establishment. Resourcefully employing computer networks, self-published newsletters and magazines, shortwave radio, and community-access cable television, they completely bypass traditional media and political institutions. State citizens inhabit a sprawling, intellectually crude, but technologically sophisticated underground, where far right meets far left, radical environmentalists find common ground with radical gun-rights advocates, and New Age healers research conspiracy theories alongside evangelical home schoolers.<p>No accurate head count of sovereign citizens is available, but sovereigns claim that "jural societies" -- self-governing state-citizen communities -- are now chartered in every county in California. Active communities of a thousand or more are thriving in the Los Angeles area and in New York City. "Common-law" courts -- self-styled juries of sovereigns passing judgment on what they hold to be criminal incursions by government on their rights -- have been established in 30 states.<p>"In California alone, I'd say there are over 100,000 people actively practicing sovereignty," says Jeffrey Thayer. "I've presented the material to groups in just about every part of the country -- every place from Hopi reservations, to Amish farms, to Marin County in the suburbs of San Francisco. I've turned down several offers to franchise my instruction. Over the last year, it has grown beyond my wildest expectations."<p>"We get all kinds," agrees McDonald as we continue down Box Canyon toward lunch in a Canoga Park coffee shop. Carefully braking down the switchback curves, I darkly imagine McDonald's "status" to be infectious; I keep tensely checking the rearview mirror for sheriff's deputies. "We get bankers, we get dentists, we get computer programmers, we get long-haul truck drivers." He shrugs, gazing absently down to the vast, smog-smudged plain of the northern San Fernando Valley. "Everybody knows something's wrong."<p>In a few hours, McDonald will board a plane for Dallas, where he is to conduct a weekend introductory seminar on state citizenship. He appears regularly on a local cable-TV program. He hosts radio shows, writes magazine articles, debates publicly, and conducts a booming Internet business. In the Los Angeles area alone, hundreds of people have paid nearly $800 a head for his state-citizenship kits, which consist of a copy of the state constitution, hundreds of pages of laws and statutes deemed pertinent to the sovereign cause, dozens of essays and commentaries on those laws, and copies of the scores of forms and letters that the aspiring sovereign must file with various government agencies. Unlike Thayer, McDonald has fashioned a kind of franchise for his instruction, establishing a network of 20 "state-citizen service centers" staffed by former students in California, Arizona, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington State, and Wyoming.<p>A gnomelike, 67-year-old exsecurity guard who dropped out of school in the eighth grade, an autodidact from Chicago whose conversation is larded with "ya know?'s" and "ya follow me?'s," McDonald makes an emphatically unlikely godfather to any movement. One telling measure of sovereign citizenship's appeal is that so many workaday folks are willing to look beyond this raffish teacher, his Addams Family house, and his difficult, convoluted pedagogy; that so many mall-wandering, Net-surfing, freeway-cruising Americans hunger to enlist in an arduous, unremitting war of attrition against their own government.<p>"The powers that be are infinitely intelligent," McDonald says. "They know the American people are incredibly gullible and sheeplike, but they also know there's a limit to how far they'll be pushed. They know exactly how hard to tighten the screws and still leave room to let off the pressure. That's why the laws are written the way they are: to give people who want it an avenue of escape. But you have to make the effort. Ignorance is no excuse. Everything they tell you in the courtroom is true," McDonald concludes with a smirking grin. "They just don't tell you the whole truth."<p>Other than signing up with the Austin board of realtors and a support group for macrobiotic vegetarians, Cathy Leman had never been much of a joiner. Growing up in Louisiana, she'd always felt a little alienated, a little distanced from what her friends were doing. Not that she wasn't popular or couldn't blend in when she wanted to. She was smart, she was attractive in a dark-eyed, leggy way, and she'd never been afraid of standing on her own. She just always liked playing the edges.<p>Hitting the wild early '70s in her wild early 20s, Leman moved to Texas and took a job dancing at an exclusive gentlemen's club. Her first week she made $1,100, with nothing withheld, nothing declared. The IRS seemed as irrelevant to her as the Campfire Girls, as distant as the day she'd collect Social Security. And the job didn't scare her, not even that endless moment before the music started, when she stood alone on the stage, sensing all those men's eyes raking her. She always liked playing the edges.<p>Before long she left the club, but she never got around to paying her income taxes. She always meant to, but could never quite pull it together. She moved a lot -- San Antonio, Dallas, then Austin. She began to settle down. She got her real-estate license and was doing okay, moving houses in the booming Texas hill country, but she still never got to those 1040s. Each day, she went to her mailbox with a wiggle of anxiety. But her luck held. They hadn't caught up with her. She kept working, kept vaguely worrying, kept looking around and thinking. Gradually, her anxiety over taxes boiled into anger.<p>Something had gone terribly wrong with America. It was so obvious her hard-earned dollars wouldn't go to pay for anything real; they would just go to pay the interest on the debt criminally created by the Federal Reserve, none of whose members any American citizen had ever voted into power and which was really run by a secret group of international bankers. Leman understood how it worked. Back in her club days, she'd watched the local cops roust the girls. She remembered the look in the cops' eyes, knowing that these little dancers in G-strings were making twice as much money as they ever would. So the cops had helped themselves to the girls' cash. Who was going to stop them? That was how it worked. If it was happening on the local level, Leman thought, imagine what was going on in Washington.<p>She started looking into conspiracy theories. She read the Constitution and saw how the nation was designed to be a republic in which individual rights were always paramount and representatives served at the will of the electorate -- not a democracy, in which majority rule inevitably slid into mob rule and demagogues found the masses easy to manipulate and subjugate. Democracy had been foisted on America by the illuminati. The illuminati were this secret society of European bankers who at the time of the American Revolution saw that something powerful and dangerous was happening in the colonies and sent this German, Adam Weishaupt, over to subvert it.... She didn't sweat the details, but it had all been fully researched and documented.<p>She learned how things really headed down the tubes around the time of the Civil War. The 14th Amendment, supposedly giving the former slaves citizenship, was really a setup, a power grab by the federal government and the same international bankers -- the Rothschilds, most prominently -- who'd been pulling the strings all along. After the 14th Amendment, it was just one sorry development after another: going off the gold standard, which doomed the nation to eventual bankruptcy; the Federal Reserve Act; income tax; the Social Security Act; the Buck Act; the United Nations; gun control. They just kept tightening the screws. It was all there in the books, if anybody looked up from their TVs long enough to bother reading them.<p>But what scared her the most was how they had everybody off doing their little jobs in their little boxes. No one person had the consciousness to see the whole picture. Why not? Because the corporation, the state, wouldn't let them. People got into this machine state of mind. No one really looked at one another anymore; no one really listened. Everybody was caught in the steel jaws of the machine.<p>Leman decided to dance clear of those jaws. She started attending de-taxing meetings at Rocky Bruno's house. Rocky was a kindred spirit, a New Age healer, into colonic irrigation. Rocky had had a moment of clarity when a neighbor called child protective services on him and his wife, saying they had withheld medical treatment from their kid. There was nothing to the charge. Rocky started holding meetings at his house. A lot of good people came from all over the Austin area. <p>There were the Lusks, Tom and LaVerne, who were totally committed to the movement. Tom was a veteran airline pilot, LaVerne a flight attendant with 20 years' seniority. It would have been easy for the Lusks to shut their eyes and pay their taxes, but for years they'd refused to play along with the IRS. Now they were facing foreclosure on their lovely home in northwest Austin. "I've been to the Libertarian meetings," Tom would say in disgust. "The Libertarians want to work within the system and fix it. The only thing I want to do is take the system out around back and shoot it."<p>And there were the Murrills: James Willard, Lucille, and their grown son James Reginald. The group's only black family, they were churchgoing, spiritual people. James Willard had worked for the government all his life -- an air-force career man, then the post office and the prison system. He'd seen all the waste and deceit firsthand. "Divide and conquer," James Willard would say. "That's what they're always putting over on us. White against black, man against woman, Democrat against Republican. Why is that?, you wonder."<p><p>

The economy has grown 2.5 percent a year during Bill Clinton's term. Is that the best we should expect?<p>By Walter Russell Mead<p>"It's the economy, stupid," read the famous sign in the Clinton campaign headquarters in 1992. Now, four years later, the election probably still hangs on the economy. But this time Bill Clinton is running on his record. The president looks at the economic performance of the last three years -- average growth of 2.5 percent a year -- and congratulates himself on a job well done. The economy is bumping along near the top of its long-term potential, he claims.<p>To nobody's surprise, the Republicans interpret the same numbers very differently. The economy's miserable performance is due to the failed policies of the Clinton administration, charges GOP candidate Bob Dole. It's time for a change.<p>The cynicism is, of course, breathtaking. If Clinton were 
the challenger and Dole the incumbent, does anybody doubt they would switch sides? Clinton would denounce slow growth, while Dole would defend his stellar record. Truth be told, it's a little strange to see happy-go-lucky Bill, the jolly uncle who always urges everybody to have another helping, siding with notorious ascetic Alan Greenspan. And it almost passes belief to see the acerbic, weaned-on-a-pickle Bob Dole telling everybody to help themselves to the punch -- the drinks are on him.<p>It makes you proud of our democratic system, in a sick sort of way.<p>But unlike a lot of political rhetoric this year, the economic debate in the campaign at least poses an interesting question: How fast can the American economy grow?<p>The Federal Reserve Board, of course, has an opinion -- a very important one. The Fed constantly measures the performance of the actual economy against a model of the potential economy. When the actual economy is underperforming its long-term performance potential, the Fed tries to pump things up. When it looks like the real economy is growing faster than its long-term potential, the Fed taps the brake pedal and raises interest rates.<p>So how fast does the Fed think the economy can grow? Roughly 2.4 percent annually. Score one for Bill Clinton.<p>To make his case against President Clinton on the economy, candidate Dole must convince voters that the Fed is wrong -- the economy can grow faster than 2.4 percent without igniting inflation. Fortunately for him, Dole can take his pick of three arguments. Unfortunately for him, the alternative most worth examining is the one least likely to fire up voters in November.<p>The first two arguments are rhetorically attractive -- but nonstarters as economic policy. Number one, Dole could don populist garb and argue that we should simply ease monetary policy in order to get more growth and not worry about the consequences. Or, number two, Dole could suggest, as he has, that tinkering with tax rates -- cutting rates but slashing expenditures by the same amount -- would increase growth. It's unlikely that Greenspan or the credit markets will buy either of these, although proposing a tax cut might gain Dole some votes.<p>Using alternative three, Dole could argue that the Fed's numbers are simply wrong. Productivity is higher than the Federal Reserve calculates, and the economy can therefore grow faster than Greenspan realizes. Don't expect to hear this argument as a sound bite on the 7 p.m. news anytime soon. As a campaign issue, it is nowhere near as attractive as a promise to cut taxes -- with the details on how to pay for that left deliberately obscure. However, it is the only one of these three alternatives actually worthy of attention.<p>Deciding how fast the economy can grow isn't a trivial exercise. If we could increase the annual rate of growth of the U.S. gross domestic product by just one percentage point for the next 25 years, in 2021 the economy would be almost $3.1 trillion bigger than economists now expect. Get the long-term growth rate up to 4 percent a year, and after 25 years the economy would be almost $5 trillion bigger. That would certainly help fund the boomers' retirement and give Generation X a lifetime of steadily rising standards of living -- the American dream would be alive and well. And 4 percent growth isn't out of the question. From 1960 to 1973, the economy grew at 4.2 percent. We did it once; why can't we do it again?<p>The economy's potential for growth, economists tell us, is roughly equal to the long-term average increase in productivity plus the increase in the labor force. The experts believe the labor force is growing about 1 percent annually, and productivity increased by 
1.4 percent a year from 1973 through 1990. Add them up and you get the magic number -- 2.4 percent.<p>To double-check the temperature of the economy, the experts look at another number. There is, economic theory states, a "natural rate of unemployment" -- the lowest level of unemployment that a given economy can sustain without causing inflation. Some people call this NAIRU, the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment. If unemployment drops below NAIRU, inflation takes off, the theory claims. The Fed and most mainstream economists today believe that NAIRU is somewhere in the range of 5.5 percent to 6 percent unemployment. With the unemployment rate around 5.5 percent in the first six months of 1996, the economy, by this measure, too, is growing about as fast as it can without overheating.<p>The sad truth is that nobody really knows how to measure or even define productivity at the level of the national economy. NAIRU, the double check, is just as flawed.<p>Let's look at the hard numbers. At some level, productivity is clearly related to GDP growth, wages, and living standards. From 1960 to 1973, for example, the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the Commerce Department reports that  productivity on average rose 3.2 percent a year (more than twice the recent rate) and that GDP growth averaged 4.2 percent a year. Then productivity growth went into a tailspin, averaging only 1.4 percent per year between 1973 and 1990. Average GDP growth fell to 2.9 percent a year during the period. According to the most recent "Economic Report of the President," which is produced annually by the Council of Economic Advisers, productivity growth has averaged 1.2 percent a year since 1990.<p>But can those numbers be right? Our personal experience of the economy says no. Surely, we say, the computer revolution has increased productivity. We all know we're working much harder -- if we still have jobs -- to make up for all our colleagues who were downsized. How can this not add up to rapid productivity growth?<p>Productivity seems like it ought to be easy to measure. If worker A makes 100 widgets an hour and worker B makes 110, clearly worker B is 10 percent more productive than worker A. But try to apply this over any period of time. In 1960, the <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford Motor Company</b></a> had 160,181 employees and produced 2.2 million cars -- 13.7 cars per worker. In 1995, 185,960 Ford workers produced 3.5 million cars -- 18.8 cars per worker. On the surface, productivity is up 37 percent in 35 years.<p>But in 1960, a vertically integrated Ford prided itself on producing the parts used in its cars. In 1996, however, 62 percent of Ford parts came from outside sources. To figure out how many workers produced Ford's cars, we have to add in employment at outside -- including foreign -- suppliers.<p>Another way to go would be to look at operating income per employee or per dollar of employee cost, but here, too, there are problems. Ford lost money in 5 of the last 16 years. Does that mean that its workers produced nothing of value in those years?<p>Productivity is even more difficult to measure for service companies. How do we rate the productivity of a lawyer? Cases won? Cases settled out of court? Lawsuits avoided altogether by shrewd legal counsel?<p>Greenspan has argued that there is simply no evidence that new technology has put the economy on a track to faster growth. In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, the Fed chairman compared the electronic revolution to the advent of electricity. Electricity, he pointed out, became available in the 1880s, but the productivity gains from the new technology did not really show up until the 1920s. At that rate, the economy could remain on a slow growth track well into the next century.<p>There's also no evidence that downsizing has upped productivity. Last spring, Stephen Roach, chief economist at <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a> and a longtime advocate of productivity growth, changed his mind. Downsizing, he now says, is just downsizing. There might be one-shot productivity gains, but downsizing does not produce long-term productivity growth.<p>But just because we can't measure an increase in productivity growth doesn't mean it's not occurring. Go back to those workers at Ford. The car they built in 1995 is far more complex, far more efficient than the 1960 model. The worker using a computer to add graphics to a report -- something he wouldn't have attempted in 1960 -- is adding value to the product he produces, though we can't measure it. The truth is that neither the Fed chairman nor anybody else really understands what productivity is or how it should be properly measured.<p>NAIRU doesn't work any better. Start with the unemployment rate itself. For the first half of 1996, the Labor Department reported that 5.5 percent of the labor force -- which is estimated at 132.3 million people -- was unemployed. But many private economists, including Larry Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute, think the real rate is higher -- much higher. According to Mishel, the true rate of unemployment is somewhere near 10 percent. The official rate is lower only because the government doesn't count "discouraged workers" -- people who want jobs but have given up looking because they have no realistic hope of finding work -- among the unemployed. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that NAIRU shifts over time in response to forces that at present are poorly understood. If there is a NAIRU for the economy, neither the Fed nor its critics knows what it is.<p>The more honest of the inflation hawks admit all this. Maybe the economy can get by with lower unemployment, they concede, but the risks of testing this theory are too high. Fed policy takes months, even years, to have an effect on the national economy. If the Fed waits until statistics show that an inflationary spiral has started, then the economy will already have lurched into another boom-and-bust cycle.<p>In the end, that brings us back to politics. Some Americans -- the owners of small businesses, borrowers, the unemployed -- want low interest rates and rapid economic growth even at the risk of inflation. Others -- bondholders and people living on fixed incomes -- want to see inflation controlled even if that means low growth.<p>Differences like these are supposed to be settled in elections. Vote for Bill Clinton and get four more years of slow growth with Alan Greenspan, or vote for Bob Dole and get four years of lower interest rates with whatever risks and opportunities that entails.<p>But in reality, Fed policy isn't on the table this political season. Greenspan will be chairman of the Federal Reserve for four more years no matter who wins in November, and, as president, Dole would be unlikely to deviate far from the cautious policies that Greenspan has followed -- and that Dole has preached throughout his public life. Vote for either candidate and what you will get is Greenspan's policy on growth.<p>One hundred years ago, the election of 1896 pitted soft-money candidate William Jennings Bryan against William McKinley, defender of the gold standard. Voters had a choice between two clear alternatives.<p>Today, the electorate is still divided between the advocates of soft and hard money, but the political system isn't providing meaningful choices. No wonder the voters of 1996 are more cynical about the political process than their ancestors were a hundred years ago.<p>

Social Security, the most sacred of political cows, is about to change fundamentally -- or go broke.<p>By James K. Glassman<p>Inside Washington's infamous beltway, Social Security has long been known as the third rail of politics: Touch it, and the voters will kill you. But for the first time in the 61 years of its existence, politicians of all stripes are openly considering putting an end to Social Security as a retirement program funded with payroll taxes and replacing it with private pensions that Americans direct themselves. It's the hottest policy issue in town -- though it's likely our major presidential candidates will pretend the debate isn't even occurring, for fear of alienating the senior-citizen vote.<p>Still, Steve Forbes used privatizing Social Security as an applause line in the primaries, and Richard Lamm, the former Democratic governor of Colorado and a candidate for a third-party presidential nomination, is a privatization enthusiast. Representative Jim Kolbe, a Republican who sits on the powerful Appropriations and Budget Committees, heads a House caucus committed to restructuring Social Security along free-market lines, and most significantly, the bipartisan Advisory Council on Social Security, appointed in 1994 by the Clinton administration, also favors alternative forms of privatization.<p>Why the change in attitude? In part, it's licensed by the public perception that Social Security is failing -- a view underscored by a 1994 poll that found more Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 believe in UFOs (46 percent) than think Social Security will still exist by the time they retire (28 percent). But the real catalyst is a series of official projections showing that Social Security will go into the red (by 2012, at latest count) as baby boomers start retiring and the system begins paying out more in benefits than it collects. By 2029, the Social Security trust fund (now comprising less than two years' worth of benefits) will be hopelessly insolvent. <p>One way to keep Social Security afloat after 2012 would be to raise taxes -- almost no one's favorite option. The system could also survive longer if we let benefits rise more slowly, reduce payments to rich retirees, or raise the retirement age. Beyond just footing the bill, however, philosophical objections are being raised about the status quo. They can be summed up in two questions: Why should young workers, just starting out, pay the pensions of retired Americans, many of them well-off? And why shouldn't all Americans save for their own retirements, without the government's help? <p>On the first question, Kolbe says, "What we have now is a fairly immoral system. There is no connection between what you pay in and what you get out." That's true. An 81-year-old today has received a real rate of return of 5.5 percent on his or her payroll-tax contributions. By contrast, says Arthur P. Hall, senior economist for the Tax Foundation, an average-wage couple retiring in 2027 will receive a real return of negative 1.4 percent on what they've paid in. <p>The reason for this disparity is that Social Security is a pay-as-you-go operation. Three young workers, each making $30,000 a year, contribute about $3,500 each in Social Security taxes (half from their pay, half from their employers), all of which goes to one retiree. It's a pure transfer payment from one generation to another. <p>As life expectancy has risen and the retired population has increased, payroll taxes have had to keep pace. The original rate was 2 percent on the first $3,000 in income, for a maximum tax of $60. In 1996, the rate hit 12.4 percent on up to $62,700, for a maximum of $7,775. And the numbers are going to get worse. In 1950, there were 16 workers for every Social Security beneficiary; today, there are 3.3. By 2030, there will be two. <p>The second philosophical question is more basic. "It's paternalistic to assume that people cannot take action in their own self-interest," says Sylvester J. Schieber, a member of the Advisory Council on Social Security. Schieber wants to trim current benefits and let workers put part of their payroll taxes into IRA-style accounts. His plan includes a guaranteed minimum benefit (about two-thirds of the poverty level) for all, and a private account funded by 5 percent of a worker's annual income. <p>That 5 percent should generate a good deal more than does the current 12.4 percent payroll tax, which yields a return of just 3.5 percent, a figure that will soon decline to 2.5 percent. Martin Feldstein of Harvard, who heads the National Bureau of Economic Research, calculates that a privatized Social Security account (a combination of stocks and bonds) should yield 9 percent, or nearly $9,000, over 25 years (versus $2,000 at a 2.5 percent yield) from an original investment of $1,000.<p>This is the key to privatization: If you put your retirement money into stocks and bonds, the market return should be far higher than what Feldstein calls the "implicit return" under the current pay-as-you-go system. We're talking big bucks. <p>Using Social Security Administration figures, William G. Shipman, co-chairman of the Project on Social Security Privatization for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, found that a baby boomer born in 1950 and currently earning about $60,000 can expect monthly Social Security benefits of $1,562 (in 1995 dollars) when he retires. But if, instead of paying taxes to the Social Security fund, he put the money into an all-stock retirement account, the result would be a $9,972 monthly benefit. An all-bond account would yield $5,243 a month (in 1995 dollars). <p>So in theory, privatization looks pretty good. But would it work? There is one interesting example of the theory in action: Chile. In 1981, Jose Pinera, then minister of Labor and Social Security, instituted a private retirement system, which lifted the personal savings rate from 9 percent to 25 percent (it's below 4 percent in the U.S.). This helped raise Chile's economic growth rate from 3 percent to 6.5 percent. <p>Pinera is an energetic proselytizer of the Chilean model. At a conference in Mexico earlier this year, he explained that in Chile "neither the worker nor the employer pays a Social Security tax to the state. Nor does the worker collect a government-funded pension. Instead, during his working life, he automatically has 10 percent of his wages deposited by his employer each month in his own individual PSA [pension savings account]. This percentage applies only to the first $22,000 of annual income.... A worker may contribute an additional 10 percent of his wages each month, which is also deductible from taxable income, as a form of voluntary savings."<p>The worker invests his PSA money in one of about two dozen private 
pension-fund administration companies -- basically, mutual funds -- that are regulated by the government to make sure they remain sound. Workers can shift in and out of them at will. The companies also provide insurance against premature death and disability for an additional mandatory contribution of 2.9 percent of salary. Workers with sufficient savings in their PSAs can retire whenever they want, while those with insufficient funds at retirement get a government pension after their accounts have been depleted.<p>"The system has been extremely successful," wrote John B. Shoven, dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford, in a recent paper for the Investment Company Institute -- an association of U.S. mutual funds that would profit hugely if $300 billion to $400 billion a year in Social Security taxes were privately invested. But Shoven says, "I would warn that a 13- to 14-year history is a very short time frame if you're in the generational retirement business, so 
I think it's a little early to judge."<p>The transition from Social Security to a private retirement system would be difficult. First, we'd have to protect today's retirees by maintaining current benefit levels. We'd probably have to do the same for those verging on retirement -- people in their mid-50s and up. And what about everyone else who has made Social Security contributions? Shouldn't they get a credit paid into their new private accounts? Shoven figures that this could cost $11 trillion.<p>Is there any way to pay this sum and still privatize? One answer might be to require a mandatory 10 percent contribution by workers to their own accounts and another 10 percent tax to fund the old system until it withers away. Sam Beard, a former aide to Robert F. Kennedy, envisions a transition that could last 50 to 60 years. Beard, who runs the National Development Council in New Castle, Delaware, advocates a plan that would include returning previous Social Security contributions to affluent Americans in the form of "liberty bonds" -- which could go to their heirs, tax-free.<p>The debate will be a long one, and it should be. After all, the need to help the elderly remain financially secure created Social Security and must continue to be met by any reform. But in a society that succeeds by rewarding individual effort, there is another goal. As Jose Pinera says, "The pay-as-you-go pension system...destroys, at the individual level, the essential link between effort and reward -- in other words, between personal responsibilities and personal rights. Whenever that happens on a massive scale and for a long period of time, the result is disaster."<p>

						When Alvin Toffler talks about the future, powerful people listen -- from Newt Gingrich to the aging communists in Beijing<p>By Walter Russell Mead<p>Change has been good to Alvin Toffler. Working in an intellectual partnership with Heidi Toffler, his wife of almost 50 years, he has written one best-seller after another, from Future Shock to The Third Wave to Powershift, about the way technological change transforms societies. His most recent book, coauthored with Heidi Toffler, is Creating a New Civilization: The Politics of the Third Wave.<p>In their work, the Tofflers have developed a structure for understanding and anticipating change. According to them, there have been three great changes, or waves, in human history. The first wave saw the development of settled agriculture. Many people in the world still live in peasant-based, first-wave societies, even though the first wave began 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. The second wave, the industrial revolution, began about 300 years ago and is still spreading through the world.<p>The economic and social upheavals now sweeping across the United States and the rest of the world, they argue, are the result of the third wave, the information revolution. Just as the first and second waves saw the development of economic, social, and political structures based on the agricultural and industrial technologies of those waves, the third wave is creating radically different institutions and ways of life.<p>In a recent interview with Walter Russell Mead, Alvin Toffler talked about how corporate restructuring, the crisis of American democracy, and the growing storm clouds over Asia all fit together.<p>Worth: As a freelance writer and consultant, you yourself are an example of the new ways of making a living that you talk about. How does this life compare to holding down a job?<p>Toffler: It's infinitely better. The last job I had was at Fortune from November '59 to May '61.<p>Q:
How did you get started as a freelance worker? It must have been more difficult in those days.
A:
My wife and I started out after working in factories for about five years -- auto plants, steel mills, and aluminum foundries. Heidi was a union member and became a shop steward. From there, I went to work for a labor paper.<p>Then we went to Washington and spent three years covering Capitol Hill and the White House for a small Pennsylvania newspaper -- but freelancing, always freelancing, on the side.<p>The three years we spent in Washington were a kind of graduate degree in American politics -- the only formal degree I have is a B.A. in English from New York University. After Washington, I went to Fortune.<p>Between '65 and '70, we wrote Future Shock. And that changed everything. It sold five million paperback copies in the U.S. So now we work like dogs, but not for someone else. <p>Q:
You were really one of the first to write about the evolution of the corporation. Is the restructuring of the corporation over?
A:
No. Oh no, there's a lot more to go. I think you'll see that corporations, having gone through successive restructurings, are suddenly confronted, once again, by the need to totally rethink their purpose in life. Take the recent passage of the telecommunications legislation. Every company in the telecom, computer, and related fields is now going to go through painful internal surgery and reconstruction.<p>Permanent internal reorganization is the name of the game. And that is reflected in the tremendous turnover not just of markets, not just of lines of business, not just of products, but also of organizational structures. When everything else changes as dramatically as is happening now, organizational structure must also change.<p>Q:
What will these new structures look like?
A:
We have only just begun to think imaginatively about all the possible alternative forms. For example, in the mid-80s, we began to hear about profit centers. Big, monolithic corporations began to break themselves into smaller units called profit centers, each of which was supposed to operate more entrepreneurially. However, if you look at them, almost all the profit centers are baby bureaucracies.<p>The next stage, I think, is that all these smaller units are going to take on their own organizational formats, and not all of them will be the same.<p>There are many models possible -- checkerboard organizations, commissar organizations. One of my favorites is the pulsating organization -- the U.S. Census Bureau is the example we used in Powershift. In a routine year, the Census Bureau has 8,000 to 9,000 employees. But in a census year, that number goes up to 300,000 employees. And then it goes back down.<p>Q:
Why is the bureaucratic model outmoded?
A:
Lots of reasons that are well-known. Slow. Anti-innovative. But at a deeper level the problem is that the people on top haven't a clue as to what the people down below need to know. Things today are so complex and fast changing that the people doing the actual work need freedom of information. They need to be able to go anywhere up and down the hierarchy, across to other departments, diagonally. As soon as you do that, however, you change the internal power structure. Because the people who then were gatekeepers, who sat on top of each little unit, no longer control the flow of information that gave them power. And so they no longer have a function.<p>Q:
So the layoffs of managers will continue and even accelerate?
A:
I'm afraid so. And government will have to restructure much more quickly as well.<p>Q:
That sounds like a stressful change for an individual.
A:
It will be. You have to be ready to learn new skills and to completely change how you operate. And here's the thing that is radically misunderstood. When we say displaced managers need new skills, the assumption is they need specific occupational skills. That isn't all they need. What they need are new cultural skills. They need to understand that they're going to operate in a different kind of culture, just as ghetto kids and gang members have to understand they have to show up on time if they want to hold a job. These are deep cultural changes that go far beyond simply learning how to use Windows 95.<p>Q:
It seems that education is going to be a key. Is our present system of education going to survive? Should it survive?
A:
No, to both questions. The current system -- one teacher and many kids --  is obviously not the model for the future. If we continue to think of education as schoolhouses, rows of seats, and a teacher in front of the classroom, we will fail.<p>When we created the mass-education system, it was a democratic and humanizing advance. When we set up this system, one of the assumptions we made was that most parents were ignorant, illiterate, and lived in backward, isolated villages. And so they turned their child over to the most educated, sophisticated person in the village. The person who had visited Chicago once. Or who was literate. Now middle-class parents frequently turn their kids over to teachers who are less educated than they are themselves. This changes one of the fundamental assumptions of the system: the assumption that schools are going to raise the educational level.<p>Q:
So today's school is a dumber environment than many homes?
A:
Yes. So what you must do is integrate parents into the process. But the most important change is you've got to de-massify the education system. What we are doing is educating kids for an industrial mass society. And it once made sense to do it the way we did it.<p>We created a school on the model of the factory. Because at least one of the functions of the education system is to simulate the future that children will live in.<p>When you put kids into a factory-style school and they're going into a factory world, you are simulating the future reasonably accurately. When you put kids into a factory-style education system and there aren't going to be factories out there, you are cheating them, misleading them, mis-educating them.<p>What we now have is a one size mis-fits all system. What we need more than anything is to let 100,000 educational flowers bloom. Different systems, different methods. That will better match the nature of the world that the kids are going to live in.<p>Q:
It's hard to pigeonhole you into any of the political schools out there. On some issues -- deregulation, government reform, and so on -- you can be classed with radical right-wing House freshmen. And yet the changes you see in society and the reforms you advocate would overturn many of the institutions and values that right-wing Republicans want to protect. For example, you suggest that the nuclear family is almost as outmoded as bureaucracy.
A:
We have to open the family system to multiple family forms. The family is not an independent variable. It is part of a larger social system. It is connected with how people work. How they finance and pay for their existence. How they connect to technology, to the communication system, to everything in our society -- because all of these form an integrated system. The family doesn't just exist out there as some kind of isolated cell.<p>The family cannot be isolated from the changes sweeping the broader society. When we wrote Future Shock -- it was published in 1970 -- we went to the leading family experts and simply asked, "What's going to happen to the nuclear family?" And the almost universal answer was, nothing. The nuclear family is an eternal model.<p>Well, this is so ahistorical that it makes me choke. Before the industrial revolution, the nuclear family was rare. First-wave agrarian societies typically have large households. They're not papa goes to work, mama stays home, two kids under the age of 18. They're big, multigenerational households. They are actually a production team. They work together in the fields or in the cottages. And that's the dominant family form in most agrarian societies. Even today.<p>With the industrial revolution, you need a labor force that's mobile. If there are no jobs in Birmingham, workers have to be able to go to Manchester. They can't go dragging 20 family members along with them. Gradually, the family size shrinks in every industrializing country.<p>In Future Shock, we wrote a chapter called "The Fractured Family"that did not say the family was going to die -- but that it was going to change. And this is happening now. We see today that the state of Hawaii is contemplating legitimation of homosexual marriage. To us, this isn't a question of gay or lesbian. It's a question of diversity of family structure.<p>We have families in which you have once-remarried adults and kids. Twice-remarried adults and kids. Those are different structures.<p>We believe that the family is a very important institution in society. We believe, along with the so-called right wing, that family systems should be strengthened. Kids do need households. They do need loving adults.<p>But the failures of the family are not primarily a result of welfare. Lots of people, middle-class and rich people, see their families go up in smoke also. They don't live in ghettos. Unless they're rich ghettos.<p>In first-wave societies, the family was the labor unit. It educated the child, healed the sick, took care of the elderly. In the second wave, without deliberate intent, we stripped the family of its most vital social functions. That has reduced the family's functions to sex, procreation, romance, and companionship. Not enough to make it a dominating institution among other institutions.<p>Q:
In Powershift, you both predict and call for a much more revolutionary kind of politics. Now, five years after Powershift, we see the American people deeply dissatisfied with politics as usual. What's going on? 
A:
I see the political parties as essentially obsolete vehicles that are engaged in hopeless ritual contests for control of the so-called levers of our democracy. But the American population is thoroughly disaffiliated from both the parties and the mechanisms that they compete to control.<p>Q:
So the political parties aren't really vehicles for the kinds of pressures and interests that need to be brought forward?
A:
No, they aren't. For example, a lot of the Contract With America just represents a redistribution of power among second-wave groups. It's the same old stuff.<p>It's a relic of an unfinished Republican agenda, left over from years and years of being out in the wilderness. Having said that, one of the consequences of the contract is a devolution of power and some decision making out of Washington. And that, I think, is extremely important. And that is why, despite itself, the contract has third-wave consequences.
Q:
If neither party has the answers, where do the answers come from?
A:
A hidden political battle is going on. We think there is a powerful, deeply rooted conflict between groups who have a stake in maintaining the smokestack world and groups that have 
a stake in moving to a new, third-wave information-based economy.<p>You can see that in the way the Buchanans and the Naders come together. What are the so-called right and the so-called left coming together in defense of? Essentially, the old rust-belt manufacturing world. As though protectionism and regulation could somehow restore it to vitality.<p>In order to compete effectively in the competitive global economy, we have to make use of our best advantage. That is high technology, information technology. Now, will there be dislocations entailed in doing that? Yes. Painful, horrible ones for many people. However, if you do not make these changes, you guarantee that many more people will suffer even more.<p>You would see a declining America. Not just economically but politically. And you also open up, I believe, the possibility for war.<p>Q:
Just where do you see the world going? What are the real dan-ger points?
A:
Okay, but with the proviso that my wife and I do not believe in linear projections and that nothing continues indefinitely, we think the really big and important and good news in the world is the rise of Asia. Asia shows that it is possible to raise a billion people out of poverty in a generation.<p>What could stop that is political and military instability in Asia. The Asia-Pacific region is almost encircled by nuclear weapons. You have Pakistan, India, Russia, China, and, maybe, North Korea.<p>So, you have the world's most rapidly changing region surrounded by the most dangerous weapons in the world. And you have a superpower, the United States, that has a president who doesn't pay enough attention to the region.<p>He agrees to go to a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in Osaka and to meet the Japanese prime minister. At the very last minute, he cancels his appearances at Osaka and Tokyo and goes to Ireland. He then says, "But I will come to Tokyo in January."Then he cancels the trip in January and says, "I will come in April."He is telling Asia, "We don't think you're very important."And China, therefore, believes that it can do as it wishes, and so do others. Having received that message, China then fires missiles into the sea near Taiwan.<p>Now, the idea that China is going to be the superpower of the year 2020, which The Economist devoted a whole special section to a year ago, was based on straight-line projections of current economic trends. But that's too simple. Wherever you've had big changes like those in China today, you also see battles between the second-wave industrializing elites and the traditional elites of the first-wave society.<p>However, the new revolutionary politics in China is even more complicated. In China, you have first-, second-, and third-wave economies and elites all rubbing elbows. In a situation like that, you can't extrapolate trends. You have to prepare for twists and turns, for surprises -- good and bad. Often history is made by the low-probability event that nobody thought was worth thinking about.<p>The most important of these low-probability/high-impact scenarios today is the possible disintegration of China. Now, will China disintegrate? Probably not. The odds are against it. Could it disintegrate? Yes. Would it have global implications? You bet.<p>American leadership radically underestimates the political struggle in China between the elites of different waves. Out in the boondocks, you've got 600 million or 900 million peasants who are still living first-wave lives under local leaders. Then, on the coast, a highly developed region, you've got a lot of second-wave businesspeople, who are peddling cheap labor to the outside world. Finally, you have an emerging third-wave elite, people with cellular telephones and computers tied into Silicon Valley and Singapore. These three different elite groups have quite different interests.<p>I see profound forces at work moving toward an upheaval 
of some kind in China. That would probably mean an end to the happy scenario of raising a billion Asians out of poverty. It probably would stop the development of Asia for 10, 15, 20, 50 years.<p>Q:
Now, let's quickly close the circle and bring this back to the U.S. Could closing the doors of the U.S. and the world economy to Asia trigger some kind of war?
A:
I think that the trade pressures that we put on Japan and China are not in the national interest. They're essentially in the interest of special-interest groups in the society. When we go to Japan and say, "You must open the rice market,"it doesn't matter one rice grain to the United States as a nation whether we sell rice to Japan or whether we don't. But it matters to some important lobbies.<p>Q:
Rice farmers in Arkansas?
A:
Exactly. To close America as a market to Asia in the situation we have described means that you are almost asking for the region to blow up. <p><p><p><p>

						It may get easier for contractors to show they're not employees<p>By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>The IRS loves taxpayers who get their taxes withheld, otherwise known as employees. It's not nearly as fond of taxpayers who receive Form 1099, otherwise known as independent contractors. But there's a movement afoot in Congress to force the IRS to learn to care more for its wayward children.<p>At present, the IRS routinely moves workers from independent-contractor status to that of employee -- 90 percent of all contractors the IRS investigates get reclassified as employees. The agency claims that contractors who don't have their taxes withheld underreport their income, cheating the government out of as much as $4 billion in revenue each year. Its reclassification schemes involve a vague and arbitrary 20-factor test that determines the tortured distinction between employees and contractors. One of these tests, for instance, asks how much time a worker spends at a work site, an archaic standard in the age of telecommuting. Often, the IRS makes different decisions on seemingly identical cases.<p>Despite the ambiguity in classifying workers, the IRS smacked them and their employers with $751 million in fines from 11,380 audits between 1988 and 1994. Another recent study says the IRS has collected $678 million in fines and taxes from 439,000 taxpayers redefined as employees since the mid-1980s.<p>Last March, the IRS introduced a program that would allow businesses to settle worker-classification issues as soon as the IRS suspected a problem. This would help the businesses avoid costlier fines and penalties, but the cost of the fines themselves would not change. An employer with classification problems can also qualify for an IRS settlement offer by "agreeing" to treat all its workers as employees, but this provides no real benefits to anyone but the IRS.<p>The good news is that several current congressional legislative proposals are trying to tackle the problem of classifying workers. A bill proposed by Republican representative Jon Christensen of Nebraska, and co-sponsored by more than 200 other representatives, stands the best chance of passing in some form. Christensen claims his bill would "sketch clearly and starkly" who is an independent contractor and who is an employee. He wants to offer a three-part test as an alternative to the IRS's 20 factors. The new rules would require independent contractors to sign a contract with a boss stating that they must not be treated as employees.<p>Until Christensen's bill passes, the best place to go for more information is the 32-page booklet Employee or Independent Contractor? Resolving the Dilemma, available for $6.50 from tax-law publisher CCH. Call 800-835-5224 for details.  <p><p><p><p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> A BATTLE WITHOUT HONOR <p>The balanced-budget debate is a meaningless farce that's diverting attention from the country's real problems  <p> By Walter Russell Mead  <p> It has been billed as the political fight of the century. For months, as markets have swooped and swooned, the brash Republican majorities in Congress and President Bill Clinton have been locked in a titanic struggle that will, all the pundits say, determine the fate of the republic. The GOP shut down the government; Clinton painted the Republicans as radical extremists. With elections approaching, both sides have threatened to appeal to the American people. Let the 1996 election be a great referendum on balancing the budget, they declaim.  <p> There's just one little problem with this scenario: The great budget battle of 1996 is a fraud. If Congress got everything it wanted, there would still be no guarantee that the budget would balance in 2002. If the president got everything he wanted, he still couldn't assure that his version of the Medicare program would last until then. An election fought over a balanced budget would be a grotesque abuse of the public trust. Apparently, both parties can live with that.  <p> So what makes me so sure that the budget battle is absurd?  <p> First, neither side actually has the power to balance the budget in seven years. Even if both houses of Congress pass a seven-year budget plan, and the president signs it on the White House lawn while the Marine band plays "The Star-Spangled Banner" and the Blue Angels stunt overhead, it doesn't matter. The plan has no legal binding force.   <p> Think about it. It's the year 2001. Congress is in session. Possibly it's more conservative than the one we have now, possibly more liberal. Whatever it is, it will be able to vote whatever budget it wants for the next year. It can vote a budget in surplus,a balanced budget, or a budget with a colossal deficit. It won't care two straws what the Congress of 1996 thought the budget should be. The Congress of 2001 cannot be bound by anything Congress does in 1996.  <p> This isn't just speculation. I remember the fate of the last deficit-reduction plan that a Congress passed and a president signed into law. Enough of these feeble campaign promises that are so soon forgotten, said all the politicians in 1985. We must enact a binding commitment, they said, something, by God, to force the damned deficit down.   <p> And so they passed a law, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget amendment, not very different from the current proposals, mandating changes in spending to reach budget targets until one glorious morn in1991, when the brave new world of perpetually balanced budgets would begin. And there were sanctions in Gramm-Rudman to make sure the job got done.   <p> The toughest of these was sequestration. If the congressional budget in any given year failed to meet the Gramm-Rudman targets, automatic spending cuts would set in, reducing spending enough to meet the deficit targets. It all looked good on paper.  <p> But when the deficit target dates came up, requiring painful spending cuts, Congress found ways around the rules. Spending could be deferred; accounting gimmicks could throw costs into the next year; specific expenditures could be taken off the books. Congress decided, for example, that much of the cost of the savings-and-loan bailout shouldn't be counted as part of the budget deficit for Gramm-Rudman purposes.   <p> By 1987, though, even these efforts weren't enough. So Congress gave itself an exemption and pushed the balanced-budget date off until 1993. Under this reworking of the schedule, the permissible deficit target for 1991 jumped from zero dollars to $64 billion. When 1991 came around, however, the budget deficit wasn't $64 billion or even $100 billion. It was $267 billion.   <p> Was there mass sequestration and panic in Washington?   <p> No. By then, years of gimmicks and loopholes had turned Gramm-Rudman into a joke. Nobody mourned much when it was buried by the budget agreement between the Democratic Congress and George Bush. Congress and the presidents of the day had successfully nickled-and-dimed Gramm-Rudman to death.  <p> And that is exactly what the government especially Congress canand will do if any new budget plan gets in its way. It will amend, repeal, stretch out, or ignore any restrictions that it finds inconvenient.  <p> It's pretty easy to tell which restrictions a future Congress is likely to ignore. Budgets are divided into two parts. There's the section that deals with the next two years (the actual life of the Congress that passes the bill) and then there are the out-years: years three, four, five, six, and seven in the current plans.  <p> So here's Mead's First Law, and you can carve it in stone: The Out-Years Aren't Real. Whether it's an economic forecast or political plan, once you get beyond 18 months, it all fades into the mist. <p> In judging a budget plan, forget about the out-years. They are the pretty box and wrapping paper. The out-year proposals are the ones you never plan to implement: Worse than the New Year's resolutions you made this January, these are the New Year's resolutions you plan to make three years from now. With any economic program, look at what it says about the next two years. That is the part of the proposal that could actually happen.   <p> This is my second reason for believing the great budget debate of 1996 is a fraud: The cuts are almost all in the out-years. The real years, the first two in the plan, are about minimal spending cuts and fat, juicy tax cuts.   <p> This isn't a plan to cut spending at all. It's a plan to cut taxes while letting politicians look good by talking about cutting the deficit.   <p> In other words, it's Gramm-Rudman II.   <p> While Warren Rudman had the grace to retire, Phil Gramm campaigned for the presidency, telling voters around the country that this time, really, trust me, no fooling, the new improved multiyear plan would balance the budget and slay that demon deficit once and for all.   <p> Oh, and here's your tax cut.   <p> Third, this budget battle would be a fraud even if the politicians were serious about carrying out their plans and could force future politicians to meet these goals. The numbers behind the plans (those of both the Republicans and the president) are so vague as to be meaningless. The only thing we know is that the federal budget deficit in 2002 will not be what it is predicted to be in either plan.   <p> To know what the budget deficit will be in 2002, we have to know how the economy will behave in each of the years between now and then. What will the growth rate be for 1996 or 1997? When will the next recession come? What will interest rates be in 1999? How many people will be unemployed in November 2001? Will inflation go up or down between 1998 and 2000?  <p> We need to know all this and more in order to forecast the deficit in 2002. Both federal revenues and expenses move up and down with the rate of economic growth. If the economy grows faster, the government takes in more money in taxes. If the economy slows or goes into a recession, tax revenues don't grow as fast but many government expenses rise. Unemployment benefits must be paid to more people. Changes in interest rates affect what the government must pay on its debts.   <p> Events in foreign countries also affect U.S. economic performance. If, for example, the attempt to build a European Monetary Union collapses, and the deutsche mark falls dramatically against the dollar, U.S. exports to Europe will fall and U.S. imports from Europe will rise. That will affect the federal deficit in all kinds of ways. Revenues from tariffs will be marginally higher, but there could be lower employment at a given rate of economic growth throughout the U.S.   <p> It is, of course, impossible for either Congress or the president to predict accurately how the economy will be performing next year, much less in 2002. If they could forecast the future, then they'd be able to stop worrying about the deficit and simply invest the Social Security Trust Fund in the financial markets.If they really could predict economic behavior that well, they could make so much money from investments that they could abolish the income tax, double entitlements, and still show a profit.  <p> Let's look at the margins of error produced by the experts in the short term, the easiest period to predict. In a report issued in August 1995, the Congressional Budget Office, the agency whose numbers the Republican Congress insists are the key to an "honest" budget, bragged that between 197677 and 199394, its two-year growth forecasts were off, on average, only 0.9 percentage points. That made them slightly superior to the numbers produced by the president's Office of Management and Budget and roughly comparable to those of a consensus of blue-chip private forecasters.  <p> But that degree of error, which seems minuscule in a single year, is actually devastating. Although the CBO's forecasts of output were off, on average, by only 0.9 percentage points during this period, the average change in gross domestic product during those years was 2.62 percent. That means the predicted change in GDP missed the actual change by an average of 34 percent. <p> Rates of error vary tremendously from year to year. The banner year for the CBO was 1981; it predicted growth of 0.5 percent, and that's what we got. The next year, however, the CBO predicted growth of 2.1 percent, totally missing the recession that would cause the actual GDP to fall by 0.4 percent. In that year, the forecasting error was more than six times the size of the actualchange in output. Nine years later came another disaster: The CBO predicted growth of 2 percent, and the economy grew only 0.3 percent. The error, 1.7 percent, was 5.6 times the amount of actual growth.  <p> If we take the average rate of error forward through seven years, the margin of error becomes staggeringly large enough to turn deficit projections into worthless junk.  <p> Darts, anyone?   <p> Here's how all that uncertainty affects the final numbers. The CBO estimates that federal revenue will grow from $1.4 trillion in fiscal 1996 to $1.8 trillion in fiscal 2002 a growth of $422 billion. Now suppose that this estimate is off by the historical average of 34 percent. In that case, federal revenue could be$143.5 billion more or less than the CBO figure.  <p> The same uncertainty is at work on the expenditure side. The CBO projects federal expenditures to grow from almost $1.6 trillion in fiscal 1996 to slightly more than $1.8 trillion in fiscal 2002, an increase of $268 billion plus or minus at least $91.1 billion because of that pesky forecasting error. The potential range of error for the federal deficit in 2002 is $234.6 billion $71billion more than the total deficit for fiscal 1995.  <p> Neither the CBO, nor Congress, nor the president can know if any deficit plan will actually eliminate the federal deficit over the next seven years. Congress could pass the GOP budget plan, the president could sign it, and the Congresses and presidents of the next seven years could faithfully follow every jot and tittle of the 1996 budget plan, and we could still end up with a bigger deficit than we have in 1996. Or we could have a massive surplus. Your guess is as good as mine, and mine is as good as the CBO's.  <p> So what's the point of battling over whether one plan or the other is in "balance"?  <p> When one looks at these facts, it seems bad enough that Washington has been convulsed by debates over seven-year budget estimates. It seems truly obscene that the government should have shut down last fall over a difference in the estimates to be used. The White House wanted to balance the budget using OMB growth estimates; Congress wanted to use the CBO's. The truth is that over a seven-year period there is no significant difference between the two sets of estimates. Both are wildly inaccurate; both are shots in the dark. It's as if two people shooting at a target in a pitch-blackroom were to disagree on which of them had come closest to a bull's-eye and then agree to settle the dispute by mud wrestling, winner take all.   <p> The comedy doesn't stop here, either, which leads to my fourth reason for calling the budget debate a fraud. While the budget brouhaha has had Washington in its grip, economists have reached a consensus that the U.S. doesn't have a budget problem.   <p> This is a new development. In 1990, professional economists were in a panic. At that time, the U.S. budget deficit was 4 percent of GDP, and many economists uttered prophecies of doom. Three percent, economists warned in their gravest tones. Three percent! Any government with a budget deficit larger than 3 percent of GDP was on the high road to ruin.   <p> That magic 3 percent number still represents the economic consensus. It has been written into the European Union's Maastricht Treaty, for example, as the maximum deficit any country can have and still hope to join the deutsche mark in the Valhalla of the European Monetary Union.   <p> The prophesied doom didn't come, however. In fact, the situation improved. Spending rose, but thanks to economic growth, government revenues rose even faster. By fiscal 1995, the U.S. budget deficit had fallen to 2.3 percent of GDP, well below the magic number. The result today is that, from a macroeconomic point of view, the U.S. ranks at the top of the class among developed countries. As a percentage of GDP, our estimated budget deficit is lower than Japan's, Germany's, France's, and the United Kingdom's.  <p> So to sum up, Washington has been totally hypnotized by a false debate over nonsolutions to a nonproblem.   <p> And that's too bad. Because the country needs some serious debate about serious issues like demographics and wages.   <p> Demographically, the U.S. is headed over a cliff. Americans are living longer than ever and having fewer children. We are headed for a generation of skyrocketing medical bills, and unless we are going to float the old folks out to sea on ice floes or make Jack Kevorkian the secretary of health and human services, those bills are going to have to be paid.  <p> It isn't just health care, either. Social Security and other social-insurance programs assume that each generation will be larger than its predecessor and so able to pay for care for the elderly without undue burdens on the private and public sectors. Which just isn't true any longer. In 1955, the U.S. birth rate was 25 per 1,000. In 1993, it had declined to 15.5 per 1,000. As a consequence, the number of workers supporting each retired person has nose-dived. In 1955, there were 8.6 workers for each person receiving Social Security. By 1993, there were 3.2 workers per recipient. That ratio is projected to worsen as the century draws to a close.  <p> Then there's that other economic problem that Washington seems determined to ignore: the stagnation of wages for the American middle class. It is now 23 years since real weekly wages peaked in America. For a while, as more women joined the workforce, the increase in two-paycheck households kept family incomes rising even as individual incomes fell. Now family incomes are starting to suffer. And this is during an expansion. When the next recession comes and it will, in spite of all the stockbrokers and congressional flim flammers who want you to think that the good times will roll on forever the middle class will be standing in the path of a steamroller.   <p> Increasingly, talk about the budget deficit is to American politics what sand is to the proverbial ostrich: a comforting darkness into which one can plunge when the perils and pressures of the real world become too much to face. Over the years willful ignorance hasn't done much for the ostrich. It's unlikely to work much better for the American middle class.   <p> Research assistance contributed by Tomas Matza.  <p><p>

The characters may be different and their crimes smaller (and therefore harder to detect), but there's little doubt that insider trading is once more an insidious force on Wall Street -- and the primary cause of those mysterious little blips that show up, time and again, in the price and trading volume of stocks prior to major corporate announcements. Though nothing less than the integrity of the market is at stake, the Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledges that it doesn't have the resources for keeping up with the crooks. Meanwhile, Congress has stripped investors of significant means of filing grievances and recovering losses, and is considering legislationthat looks even more ominous.

Worth magazine/Experts<p>BUDGET OF LOST JOBS
Balancing the budget could cost 29 million American jobs by 2002. Why isn't anyone worried?<p>By Walter Mead<p>Shuttered factories, deserted parking lots, rusting fences. I associate these sights with the decaying, low-tech factories of the rust belt__the steel mills of Pittsburgh and Bethlehem, for example, or the auto plants south of Detroit, all defeated in fierce international competition by the Japanese. <p>But on a recent trip to Los Angeles I saw huge empty high-tech factories baking in the sun. In the San Fernando Valley near the Burbank Airport, a Lockheed plant, grown large during the Cold War buildup of the 1980s, now stands idle.<p>That factory didn't succumb to more-efficient foreign competitors, and it wasn't left behind by a cost-cutting management eager to move jobs to the third world. Instead, it closed because of budget decisions made in Washington: Defense cutbacks that began in the late 1980s led to fewer orders to the factories that made the weapons of the Cold War.<p>It's important to think about the Lockheed plant and others like it, because the politicians in Washington are on the verge of another round of financial decisions that will ripple through local economies. The federal spending cuts projected by any of the seven-year budget proposals now under discussion dwarf the reductions in defense spending that devastated California in the early 1990s. So far, most of the debate about the effect of balancing the budget by 2002 has focused on such topics as the hope for lower interest rates and the probable increase in the number of children living in poverty. But the reductions in federal spending that will be written into any eventual budget agreement will change the nature of the U.S. economy. And we are doing nothing to prepare for the wrenching dislocations that will accompany that change.<p>Los Angeles County is a good place for understanding what the entire country faces in the next few years. Almost nobody thinks the world needs more weapons, and as taxpayers, most of us appreciate the savings that have slowly resulted from the end of the Cold War. But the defense cuts of the late 1980s sent the county's economy into a nosedive. According to Brad Williams of the Legislative Analysts' Office in Sacramento, federal procurement spending (that is, spending by the federal government to buy things versus the spending that results from, say, sending checks to people on Social Security) in Los Angeles County peaked in 1987 at an estimated $21 billion annually. By 1991, a recession year, procurement spending had dropped to $15.7 billion. <p>Regional economic analysts blame defense cutbacks for half of the jobs L.A. County lost in the 1990 recession, and the lingering effect of the cuts slowed the county's recovery from its worst recession since the Great Depression. Analysts in the region estimate that about 140,000 defense jobs were lost after the end of the Cold War__and took with them another 200,000 jobs in other industries. For example, without paychecks from defense workers to fuel the demand for housing, the construction industry went into a tailspin.
Fortunately, the Los Angeles economy has largely recovered. With an estimated 3,774,000 jobs at the end of 1995, Los Angeles County employment is now almost back to what it was before the collapse. Tourism, entertainment, international trade, and new small-business start-ups have taken up the slack.<p>Just in time to face a new round of federal spending cuts. As this column went to press, the president and congressional Republicans were still haggling over the final budget numbers, but estimates from the Congressional Budget Office show that the projected decreases will be far larger than the defense cuts of the early 1990s. If we apply the CBO's projections to Los Angeles County, total federal spending in 2002 will be about $9.3 billion less than under pre-budget-deal baseline projections__$4 billion more than the decline in annual defense spending between 1987 and 1991. The real cuts could be greater. For instance, because states are required to match a percentage of Medicaid funding, federal spending cuts in that program would lead to reductions in state aid as well. The total loss to the county economy could be as high as $12 billion.<p>Let's see what that means in terms of jobs. Unfortunately, it's hard to be precise about the relationship between federal budget cuts and jobs. Analysts who have studied the Los Angeles County defense cuts estimate that every billion dollars of spending cuts reduced employment by about 20,000 jobs. That figure is probably too low__it doesn't include jobs lost at out-of-state subcontractors. A study of Medicaid cuts in Massachusetts__which probably captured more of the effects of the cuts, since spending in health care is predominantly local__showed that about 50,000 jobs were lost for every billion-dollar cut in <p>federal spending. U.S. Department of Commerce figures for the California economy estimate that 60,000 jobs are lost for each billion-dollar reduction in federal spending. Since the point of this exercise isn't to predict employment levels in Los Angeles County but to illustrate the probable effects of the current budget, let's use a conservative figure of 40,000 jobs lost for each billion dollars in cuts.
Currently, Los Angeles County has about 3.77 million jobs. Before this latest round of budget cuts, economists projected an average annual employment increase of 2.1 percent, yielding a projected 4.4 million jobs by 2002. <p>Plug in the new numbers for federal spending in the county, and the 
situation changes dramatically. If the federal budget cuts go as planned and if the relationship between federal spending and jobs doesn't change, then by 2002 Los Angeles County will have only 3 million jobs__1.4 million fewer than currently anticipated and 770,000 fewer than exist today. Instead of growing 14 percent over the next seven years, employment could fall by as much as 20 percent. In other words, the budget cuts could wipe out all the economic growth__and then some__the county expects over the next
seven years. <p>Of course, L. A. County isn't the only region that will suffer from these cuts. Between 1950 and 1994, national employment grew at an annual rate of 1.16 percent; at the end of 1995 there were an estimated 124.5 million jobs nationwide. If we assume that this growth will continue through 2002, the economy will add 10.8 million jobs in the next seven years. <p>But that gain disappears if we consider the effect of budget cuts on the national economy. Projected national employment for 2002 falls from more than 135 million to 96 million. Instead of adding more than 10 million jobs in the next seven years, the economy could lose 29 million jobs. <p>Whose jobs are at stake? The next round of cuts will affect health 
care__in 2002, $102 billion (or 44 percent of the total planned decrease in federal spending from the current baseline) will come from Medicare and Medicaid. In Los Angeles County alone, that means $3.5 billion less in federal spending on health care that year. Cuts of this size will force the health-care industry into the kind of restructuring the aerospace industry faced. <p>In 1960, public and private health-care expenditures made up 5.3 percent of the gross domestic product. By 1993 they had reached 12.9 percent. <p>A major part of the government's looming budget crunch results from this growth and from the significant increase in the share of total health-care costs paid by the federal government__from 27 percent in 1990 to 30 percent in 1993. The federal bill for health care shot up from $186 billion in 1990 to $268 billion in 1993. 
Most commentators have rightfully been horror-struck by this growth. After all, health care is a cost for the government, most companies, and most households. The more money spent on health care, the less available for other goods and services. <p>But we need to look at the opposite side of the ledger, too. Health care doesn't figure in the national accounts only as a cost. It is also a source of income. Every dollar of health-care cost, whether paid by a private household, an insurance company, or government, is a dollar of income__to a doctor, a dental hygienist, or a private hospital corporation. <p>Health care has been one of the most important motors driving growth in the much-ballyhooed service economy. About 29 percent of all service jobs are in this field, and employment in health care is rising three times faster than all employment. And these are good, secure jobs. Average wages in health care are not only higher than for most service jobs__at about $12 an hour__but are rising more quickly.<p>Because health care is a non-cyclical industry__people need treatment during recessions as well as during expansions__a strong health-care industry plays an important role in keeping recessions short and relatively painless. In the recession year of 1991, national employment fell nine-tenths of a percent, but the health-care sector added 346,000 new jobs. In 1993, 20 percent of the nation's economic growth was attributable directly to growth in this field.
The deficit hawks who believe that nothing is more important than balancing the federal budget by 2002 argue that reducing federal spending will shift resources from the government to the private sector. This will drive down interest rates, encourage private capital formation, and lead to the creation of thousands of new jobs. In the long run, they argue, a balanced budget will produce more jobs than the cuts destroy. <p>Could happen. The Los Angeles County economy did, after all, bounce back from the earlier round of defense cuts. But enough has changed in the national economy since then that a repetition of that happy ending certainly shouldn't be assumed.<p>Los Angeles was pulled out of its long, deep recession largely because the rest of the country, following a short and shallow slump, recovered and entered a long expansion. Entertainment surpassed aerospace in the California economy during the 1990s because moviegoers and tourists in the rest of the country had money to spend.<p>The new cuts won't work that way. Neither Los Angeles County nor any other community can count on the rest of the country to help bail it out of a local slump; we'll all be in this together. 
Exports also helped free Los Angeles from its bind, and some experts expect that segment of the economy to help this time, too. Even if Americans are too broke to buy from one another, they argue, we can sell stuff abroad. <p>Unlikely. At the moment, all the major economies in the world are trying to cut their budget deficits. The European Union's Maastricht Treaty "encourages" budget-cutting programs almost as severe as ours. The Japanese Finance Ministry still wants to keep government spending down. Even China wants to slow its growth__and cut its budget deficit.<p>So here are the worst-case and best-case scenarios. In the worst, the deficit hawks are wrong. The budget cuts and such changes as a lower capital-gains tax rate don't produce a private-investment boom. Instead, the cuts devastate the sector of the service economy that has been the leader in providing good jobs for working people during the last decade. In the best case, the country as a whole follows the earlier example of Los Angeles County, and after some period of wrenching change__say, five years__job growth resumes. Of course, those jobs may require different skills, and many of the individuals who lose their jobs as a result of the budget cuts won't find new ones.<p>As I was picking up my rental car on my most recent trip to Los Angeles, two young men behind me were discussing their job prospects. Both were recent engineering graduates. 
"Aerospace has been hit hard," said the first. "A lot of companies have stopped hiring." <p>"Yeah," said the other, "but some of them have shifted into public transportation__you know, subway cars and things like that." 
So they have. At the Lockheed factory, one of the few areas of activity among the empty acres was in a building taken over by CALSTART, a private consortium attempting to use California's high-tech skills to design electric cars and other products to meet tough environmental standards. But the new round of budget and regulatory cuts is closing that route. Federal funding for mass transit will shrink in the new budget, and money for other defense-conversion projects is also on the chopping block.<p>I would be one of the last people to say that we have done an adequate job of helping workers displaced by defense cuts find new jobs. Now, however, when the change in the national budget is far more sweeping, we're doing even less. In fact, we're not even talking about the problem.<p>Walter Mead is the Presidential Fellow at the World Policy Institute at the New School. Research assistance by Tomas Matza.<p><p>

There's a simple reason the U.S. is fighting over a budget deficit rather than enjoying a surplus:  We won the Cold War 15 years ago and didn't even realize it.  New evidence suggests that the defense buildup of the 1980s was the biggest financial blunder ever.<p>By Walter Russell Mead<p>"Gorbachev?" spits anatoly Gribkov, retired four-star Soviet general and former chief of staff of the Warsaw Pact. "A traitor. Stalin was the greatest leader we ever had." <p>The ornamental fountain tinkles beneath the Tiffany ceiling as the harpist plays in the breakfast room of Moscow's Metropol Hotel. It was here that Rasputin held his orgies in the waning years of czarist rule and that defecting Western spies routinely got their first taste of Soviet luxury. Now foreign businessmen flock to this landmark as they chase profits in the Wild East atmosphere of the Russian capital. That doesn't delight Gribkov. <p>"You Americans are disgusting," he says. "You think everything can be solved by money." <p>For Gribkov--lean, fit, and bitter at 76--the United States remains an evil foe. "It's not enough for two presidents to meet and speak kind words to end the Cold War," he says. "Even if they burn me at the stake, I will say it: Our enemy remains in the West." <p>But from beneath his chestful of decorations, Gribkov also has an extraordinary tale to tell--one with significant implications for the West. It focuses on a moment in 1981 when the highest levels of the Soviet leadership faced the possibility of losing Poland--and the entire Soviet empire in Eastern Europe.<p>The Polish crisis had erupted with a strike in the Gdansk shipyards in August 1980. The strike spread, led by a 36-year-old electrician named Lech Walesa, and the workers organized Solidarity, an independent trade union. Solidarity rapidly became a national movement.<p>The Soviet authorities quickly realized they had a serious problem. In October 1980, USSR foreign minister Andrei Gromyko warned his colleagues in the politburo that "we simply cannot and must not lose Poland." Labor unrest began to spread beyond Poland into the other satellites and finally into the Soviet Union itself. Ukraine and the Baltic states became hotbeds of discontent. By December 1981 the Soviet politburo was actively debating an invasion of Poland.<p>"At the time," Gribkov says, "I was chief of staff of the Warsaw Pact forces around Poland. Minister Ustinov [Dmitri Ustinov, Soviet defense minister under Leonid Brezhnev] called a group of leading military personnel to his office and asked us our recommendations. There was some discussion, but in the end we agreed that 녎ne Afghanistan is enough for us.' In the opinion of the military, there should not be an invasion." <p>Ustinov, Gribkov says, then went off to a meeting of the politburo. Two hours later, Gribkov was in his apartment when the telephone rang. "It was Ustinov," he says. "He told me, 넶he comrades in the politburo have accepted your recommendation.'" Even if Solidarity took power, there would be no Soviet invasion of Poland. The cost of defending Communism in Europe was just too high. <p>The significance of these events, as reported by Gribkov, is profound, for they strongly suggest that the Soviet Union effectively lost the Cold War far earlier than is widely believed in the West.<p>It wasn't until 1989 that the Berlin Wall fell and that U.S. political leaders and Western intelligence services finally abandoned their view that the Soviet Union was still on the march--and even, in the eyes of many, winning the Cold War. Ronald Reagan, continuing a buildup that had begun under Jimmy Carter, spent billions to counter what was actually a steadily diminishing Soviet threat. During the years after the Polish crisis, annual U.S. defense spending (in constant 1987 dollars) rose from $194 billion in 1981 to $285 billion in 1989.<p>Thus, if Gribkov is to be believed, the U.S. foreign policy establishment committed the biggest financial blunder in the history of the globe. Forget the savings and loan bailout and the waste in Medicare and Medicaid--these are dwarfed by the $1.84 trillion U.S. taxpayers spent to beat a foe ready to throw in the towel. If the effects of years of unnecessary military spending could somehow be subtracted, our federal budget today (for fiscal 1995) would show an $11 billion surplus as opposed to a deficit of almost $164 billion. <p>But is Gribkov believable? Generals retire and become cranky and forgetful. They embellish their reminiscences to dazzle foreign journalists. But two things make Gribkov credible. We know that he was in a position to hear firsthand the thinking of the top members of the Soviet leadership, and the documentary evidence bears out his account.<p>Anatoly Gribkov's life journey--from the collective-farm fields of Russia to the highest councils of the Kremlin--reads like the boy-meets-tractor idyll so beloved by Soviet propagandists. One of ten children, the young Anatoly was, by age six, riding horses with his father in the fields near Dukhovoe, a Russian village 350 miles south of Moscow. From there it was a short jump to driving Soviet tractors and then army tanks at the Stalin Armed Tank Institute.<p>Gribkov's star rose as the Red Army flexed its muscles on an increasingly global stage. He commanded tank troops in Stalin's 1939 invasion of Finland and then moved on to Latvia to help prepare Stalin's takeover of the Baltic republic. When Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Gribkov again saw heavy action. He was promoted to the General Staff in 1944. <p>Following Hitler's defeat, Gribkov went to the front lines of the Cold War, first in Cuba during the missile crisis, where he shared responsibility for planning Soviet strategy, and then in Eastern Europe, where he served as chief of staff of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact alliance. <p>He wasn't doing badly on the political front, either. In 1976 he became a candidate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and was a deputy at the eighth and ninth convocations of the Supreme Soviet. By the time of the Solidarity crisis, Gribkov had become a key member of the Soviet Union's leadership. Logically, he would have been present at the meetings he claims to have attended.<p>THE KREMLIN'S SECRET FILES SUPPORT GRIBKOV<p>Independent documentary evidence now emerging from Soviet archives backs up Gribkov's story. Mark Kramer of Harvard recently translated declassified top secret Soviet minutes of the December 10, 1981, politburo session, in which the option of invading Poland with Warsaw Pact forces had been debated and rejected. His work, published in the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars' Cold War International History Project Bulletin, confirms Gribkov's statements about Soviet intentions.<p>By the December 1981 meeting, the Polish crisis was moving toward a climax. Soviet policy throughout the crisis had been clear. The Soviets bitterly opposed Solidarity, and they wanted it crushed--by Polish forces. But the Polish Communists understood that a crackdown would mean the destruction of their party. Even senior party members had enthusiastically joined Solidarity, and the regular army troops--young draftees--could not be trusted to obey orders for a crackdown. <p>For more than a year, the Soviets and their closest Polish collaborators conducted psychological warfare against Solidarity and the West while preparing a new secret police force that would be capable of imposing martial law without Polish or Soviet troops. Constant military maneuvers by Warsaw Pact forces kept Western and Polish attention focused on the regular military.<p>By the night of December 10, the Soviet politburo was in agony. Would Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski ever impose martial law? Would he succeed if he did? If the Polish Communists lost control, should Soviet troops invade?<p>The consequences of losing Poland to Solidarity were immense. Soviet troops in East Germany would be cut off. The unpopular regime in Czechoslovakia, installed by Soviet tanks in 1968, would totter. The Hungarians would undoubtedly use the chance to edge closer to the West. Yuri Andropov, who later succeeded Leonid Brezhnev as general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, expressed the politburo's rattled, defensive mood at the December meeting. If Poland falls to Solidarity, Andropov said, the capitalist countries would step up their assault on the Soviet Union itself. "We must be concerned above all with our own country and about the strengthening of the Soviet Union," he declared.<p>But if invasion was the ultimate sanction, the Soviets weren't eager to use it. An invasion by Soviet troops--even if accompanied by other Warsaw Pact nations--would set off a worldwide outcry. The USSR's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan had already damaged Soviet prestige and isolated it politically; a second invasion would be a disaster. <p>Not just a political disaster, either. By 1980, the Soviet economy already showed the strains that would bring it crashing down at the end of the decade. The Soviet leadership depended on trade with the West for the goods and technology necessary to satisfy its restive consumers. An invasion of Poland would have shocked Germany and unified Western Europe behind Ronald Reagan's tough anti-Soviet line. The economic costs made the Soviets shudder. <p>Finally, there was the military problem. Polish officers--even loyal Communists--told their Soviet counterparts that Polish troops would resist and that any invasion of Poland would mean a bloody, drawn-out battle likely to degenerate into a protracted period of military and economic guerrilla warfare.<p>Faced with these consequences, Kramer's translation makes clear, the politburo blinked. Andropov was blunt: "We don't intend to introduce troops into Poland.... I don't know how things will turn out in Poland, but even if Poland falls under the control of Solidarity, that's the way it will be." <p>After Defense Minister Ustinov weighed in, chief ideologist Mikhail Suslov spoke. Suslov was widely regarded in the U.S. and USSR as a hard-liner, a guardian of Communist Party orthodoxy. "If troops are introduced, that will mean a catastrophe," he said. "I think we have reached a unanimous view here on this matter, and there can be no consideration at all of introducing troops."<p>Was the politburo really ready to "let Poland be Poland" in 1981? "I had a hard time believing it myself," says Kramer. "As a conservative, I have always been suspicious of Soviet intentions. But the documentary record is unambiguous and clear, and it supports the testimony of people like Gribkov." <p>THE U.S. MISSED ALL THE SIGNS<p>During the Polish crisis, the United States government completely misunderstood Soviet thinking. Jimmy Carter's national-security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, reports in his memoir, for example, that the CIA issued a warning that an invasion was imminent. <p>"We were wrong about that," former CIA director Admiral Stansfield Turner now says. But he quickly adds that the CIA didn't miss every trick on his watch: "We were right about Afghanistan." Turner is also rightly proud of the CIA's success at that time in penetrating the Polish military establishment. A senior Polish official provided the U.S. with Gribkov's contingency plans for a Warsaw Pact invasion. At no time, however, did the Washington defense establishment focus on the real threat: that special Polish security forces were preparing to squash Solidarity from within. <p>This blindness had been decades in the making. By 1981 there was a consensus among much of the U.S. defense and foreign policy establishments that the Soviet Union was winning the Cold War. Western estimates of Soviet economic capabilities were fundamentally flawed. As late as the mid-1980s, the CIA believed that the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies were economically strong. In fact, the CIA estimated in 1981 that the Soviet economy was growing faster than that of the U.S. or Western Europe.<p>The CIA wasn't alone. In his 1980 book, The Real War, Richard Nixon warned that by the middle of the 1980s "the Soviet Union will be number one; the United States will be number two." "The Kremlin leaders," he wrote, "want the world. And they are rapidly moving into position to get what they want."<p>The Committee on the Present Danger, a foreign policy group whose membership list reads like a who's who of the Reagan administration, issued study after study warning that the Soviet Union was becoming the strongest power in the world. "Is America Becoming Number 2?" a CPD study asked in 1978. The answer was yes. In 1980 the CPD announced that the United States "no longer has the capacity to protect its interests and American citizens abroad." Blaming the Iranian hostage crisis on Soviet machinations, the CPD saw the world rushing toward general war as a result of Soviet strength and American weakness.<p>By 1982, despite the military buildup that had begun under Carter and accelerated under Reagan, the CPD still believed that the U.S. was a distinct number two. A report issued in June 1982 states, "The Soviets clearly believe that a major shift in the correlation of world forces in their favor has already occurred.... The Soviets now enjoy general military superiority over the West. The Soviets know they do, and they believe the United States also knows it." <p>The politburo might have been groaning with despair as it contemplated its options in Poland, but much of the U.S. leadership thought the USSR was on a roll. In fact, so pervasive was this view that questioning it could endanger a career. "You didn't win any points in the foreign policy debate by arguing that the Soviet Union wasn't on the march," says Gary Sick, a member of Jimmy Carter's National Security Council. Sick, who was responsible for NSC policy on Iran and the Persian Gulf following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, says that it was almost impossible to fight the hard-line consensus view of U.S. officials that the Soviet invasion was part of a calculated strategy to acquire ports on the gulf and dominate Middle Eastern oil.<p>"It was the same story in Iran," says Sick. "There were immense pressures to see an active, omnipotent Soviet hand in the rise of Khomeini. Never mind that Khomeini was a fanatical anti-Communist; you didn't win any points in Washington by arguing that this wasn't part of a grand Soviet plan." <p>THE SOVIET MILITARY DECLINE<p>At the height of the Cold War, Leonid Brezhnev and Richard Nixon squared off over control of a thermostat in the Western White House, Victor Sukhodrev, Brezhnev's official interpreter, tells me. Both had drunk heavily during dinner. Afterward, Nixon walked Brezhnev to his bedroom and showed him how to twist the dial to set the room temperature. "Turn it this way," Nixon said. <p>"No," Brezhnev insisted, and started to turn the dial the other way. <p>Nixon shoved Brezhnev's hand away and twisted the dial back. <p>Brezhnev shouldered Nixon, and the confrontation escalated. <p>"I was afraid they would knock the thermostat off the wall," says Sukhodrev.<p>By 1981 the Soviets may still have wanted to shoulder the U.S. aside. The Committee on the Present Danger may have even been right about Soviet desire to dominate the world. But no one thought to question the Soviet Union's ability to project military power beyond its borders.<p>Today's Russia is too weak to impose its will on its own territory. Its military has no coherent use-of-force doctrine, no plan to defend its territories, and no money to pay its utility bills.<p>Even Gribkov speaks with contempt and dismay about the current state of the Russian armed forces. "On the first day of the Chechen War," Gribkov says, "Dudayev [the Chechen leader] could have bombed Moscow. We made him a present of those planes. Our forces left them behind for him." <p>This disintegration didn't happen overnight. By 1981 there were clear signs of a breakdown in the Soviet military that should have led to a re-examination of the nature of the Soviet threat. The corruption and apathy that had spread throughout the Soviet Union under Brehznev's long reign did not spare the military. Units were under strength, and pilfering was so rampant that jets couldn't fly and tanks wouldn't roll. Morale was so low that officers hesitated to take their troops into battle. Ethnic tensions divided some units into warring camps. Draftees from central Asia formed gangs to exploit younger Slavic conscripts. The resulting poor combat and supply performances in the Afghanistan War shocked many Soviet officers and contributed to the caution with which they reacted to the Polish crisis. Many of those same facts were available in the West, but they didn't change Western estimates of Soviet military capability until later in the 1980s. By 1981 much of the Soviet Union's military strength existed only on paper.	<p>THE PERSISTENCE OF VISION<p>Perhaps it is too much to expect that in 1981 U.S. leaders and the analysts at the CIA could have abandoned a view of the world with which they had grown up. Policies and the worldviews that sustain them take on lives of their own. By 1981, U.S. leaders and citizens had spent 35 years interpreting the world through the lens of the Cold War. It would have taken extraordinary intellectual courage to abandon that mooring and set out on uncharted seas with only easily misinterpreted facts for a guide.<p>But changing policy in 1981 would not have required abandoning containment--the policy that had governed U.S. behavior toward the Soviet Union since the late 1940s--or scrapping a single U.S. warhead or shaving a single dollar off the defense budget. It wouldn't have even required U.S. leaders and intelligence officials to believe that the Soviet Union was prepared to surrender Poland. All it would have required was an ability to imagine an alternative policy and then take some measured risks to explore it. <p>What could the U.S. have done? If we had understood the Kremlin's position in 1980 and 1981, our policy would have been both tougher and softer than it actually was. On the one hand, we would have taken a much more aggressive position with Solidarity, and encouraged Lech Walesa--a man who had always been among the most moderate and compromise-oriented figures in the Solidarity leadership--to make a serious bid for national power. We would obviously have paid less attention to Gribkov's military bluff and worked much harder to help Solidarity develop a strategy against the special Polish security forces that ultimately crushed the trade-union movement. We might well have launched a tougher diplomatic and economic offensive against Jaruzelski's regime, knowing that the Soviets were unwilling to back it up with armed force. <p>On the other hand, our diplomacy with the Soviets would have been more active and forthcoming. If the Soviets allowed Solidarity to take power, we would have promised economic support for both Poland and Moscow. We would have offered to ensure that Solidarity agree to a defense treaty protecting Soviet defense interests--transit rights for troops based in East Germany, for example--and worked with the Soviet authorities and Solidarity to stabilize the situation. <p>CALCULATING THE COSTS<p>The Poles paid a price for the U.S.'s inability to see an alternative to the policies pursued since 1945. But so did U.S. taxpayers. The failure of the U.S. foreign policy establishment to understand that containment was working under the Carter and Reagan administrations was the costliest blunder in history--a blunder whose consequences are still with us. <p>Very much with us. The mistaken Carter-Reagan defense buildup has cost American taxpayers $1.84 trillion since 1981. Misguided foreign-policy-makers have wasted more money than all the federal bureaucrats and welfare moms put together. <p>Using 1976 dollars, the United States spent $89.6 billion (or $172.6 billion in constant 1987 dollars) on defense in 1976--the last year of the Ford administration. The Vietnam War was over, and the United States had cut spending back to a "normal" Cold War level. All the evidence we have now tells us that this was enough. <p>Unfortunately, defense spending didn't stay at that level. As hysteria mounted in U.S. policy circles about the Soviet threat, defense spending soared. By 1981, it had climbed (still in 1987 dollars) to $194.2 billion, and during the next decade--as the Soviet Union moved toward collapse--the defense budget skyrocketed past $281.9 billion in 1988 to peak at $284.8 in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall crumbled. <p>The unnecessary costs of that decade-long buildup have to be measured in two ways. First, there's the cumulative addition to the national debt. Let's say that the defense budget had hit $194.2 billion in 1981 and then, instead of rising until the fall of the Berlin Wall, had declined to a normal Cold War level--the $173 billion spent on defense in 1976--over the next two years. If Congress had held the defense budget constant until 1989 and then applied the cuts that it historically did after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the U.S. national debt would be $1.84 trillion smaller today.<p>Second, efforts after the fall of the Berlin Wall to reduce defense spending started with a defense budget bloated by the military buildup of the 1980s. Since the grotesque peak in 1989, the defense budget has dropped. And yet today, with no Cold War and no enemy, the U.S. is spending $31 billion more in constant dollars on defense than it did in 1976. If we had maintained the 1976 defense budget until 1989, and then cut from that level, in 1995 dollars the fiscal 1995 defense budget would be $164.6 billion rather than $271.6 billion--a savings of $107 billion. Add to that the additional $68.1 billion in interest costs on the debt from the excess spending of past years, and the fiscal 1995 federal deficit of $164 billion becomes a surplus of $11 billion. <p>THE WILL TO BELIEVE<p>In trying to understand how the American foreign policy establishment could have been so misguided for so long, it is tempting to look for scapegoats. But when great nations make great mistakes--and, especially, when they persist in these mistakes for many years--the responsibility rarely belongs only to a handful of people. There have to be reasons the Cold Warriors were so persuasive. <p>In 1981 the United States wasn't ready--psychologically or politically--for the Cold War to end. We had too much invested in the idea of an external enemy, Ronald Reagan's evil empire. The contrast with the Soviet Union defined us and our role in the world.<p>Unfortunately, we still haven't made the transition to a post섺old War view of the world. Gribkov is right. On our side at least, the Cold War continues. The United States is still mindlessly working to contain Russia, to freeze it out of Europe, and to keep it weak. And just as Cold War blinders cost the U.S. billions in the 1980s, this persistent belief in a global war against the Russian enemy threatens to cost us dearly as this century draws to a close.<p>To "defend" ourselves against this poor, distracted country, we are expanding NATO eastward and still maintaining the highest military spending of any nation in the world. NATO and the European Union are the two institutions that will shape Europe's future--we are determined to keep Russia out of NATO, and we support Western Europe's determination to keep Russia out of the E.U. <p>Fifteen years ago, American diplomats misread the Soviet Union's capabilities and intentions. Today they are misreading the balance of power in the world, acting as if the chief threat to American interests were Russia's excessive strength. In fact, it is Russia's extraordinary weakness that poses the greatest problem for the U.S. The disappearance of Russia from the balance of power in the Far East and the power vacuum that Russia's weakness creates in central Asia are much more important to the United States and dangerous to our interests than anything that could possibly happen in Eastern Europe.<p>Today the Russian military presence in eastern Siberia is a hollow shell. When I visited Vladivostok a couple of years ago, the fleet was rusting at the docks, and sailors told me that the ships could not sail for lack of fuel.<p>This amounts to a revolution in world affairs, one that has already produced unpleasant results for the United States. For the first time since the Opium War of the 1840s, China faces no superior forces anywhere on its frontiers. Since Russian power collapsed, China has become much more truculent in its dealings with the United States--and for good reason. With Russia out of the picture, China no longer has military reasons to cultivate good relations with the U.S.<p>That's not all. The enormous natural resources of Russia's thinly populated Far East are a constant temptation to militarists in China and Japan. During the civil war that followed the Bolshevik Revolution, Japan sent tens of thousands of troops into Siberia and, for a short time, occupied Siberia as far west as Lake Baikal. Control over the oil, gold, diamonds, timber, and other resources of eastern Russia would give Japan the self-confidence and strength it now lacks to become once again an independent and potentially dangerous Great Power in the Pacific. <p>Many Chinese, on the other hand, regard much of Russia's territory in the Far East as rightfully theirs. Russia gained Vladivostok and other strategic territories as a result of the treaties that Chinese leaders routinely denounce as "unequal." Chinese maps still show Chinese place names for the territories lost to the czars in the 19th century. Illegal immigrants from China are now entering lightly patrolled Russian territory along the 1,700-mile boundary between the two countries even as Russians retreat from Russian Asia to the European heartland, where economic conditions are better.<p>In central Asia a similar dynamic is at work. The central Asian countries are rich in oil and natural gas. Potentially, they are an alternative source to the Middle East for these strategic resources. Yet as Russian power receded in central Asia with the breakup of the Soviet Union, chaos broke out. Central Asia's governments are a long way from providing the legal and political stability that foreign investors need. Islamic fundamentalism poses a threat here and elsewhere in the region. In the longer term, Russia and China may compete for influence and control.<p>The United States needs Russia to be stronger than it is today. We do not want upheaval or change in Asia. This makes us, like it or not, allies of Russia in this part of the world. A Russian recovery will help us; Russia's continued weakness puts us in danger.<p>Current U.S. foreign policy, while waving a welcoming flag of rhetoric, continues to treat Russia as the enemy. We worry about containment when Russia is too weak to even subdue the rebels on its own border. Aid to Russia is stalled in Congress, held up by those who object to giving comfort to the enemy. Fifteen years after it could have ended, five years after it was proclaimed to have ended, the Cold War--as senseless and expensive as ever--continues.	<p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Experts  <p> GOODBYE, GLASS-STEAGALL  <p> By James K. Glassman  <p> During the stock market crash of 1929, 4,000 banks failed as depositors fought to reach teller windows before the money ran out and their savings disappeared forever. Four years later, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act to ensure that such a tragedy would never be repeated.  <p> In the belief that the untrammeled pursuit of profits had betrayed the trust of individual Americans, Congress forced bankers to choose between the distinct businesses of commercial banking and investment banking. Commercial banks, such as Bank of America, would take deposits and make personal and small-business loans. The government agreed to insure deposits up to $2,500 ($100,000 today). Investment banks, such as <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>, would underwrite and trade securities and issue large-scale corporate debt.  <p> A major goal of the legislation was that money placed with commercial banks would be invested conservatively, leaving investment banks to be more aggressive. And in fact, since the bill's passage, banking in the U.S. has been a relatively sound activity--despite inflation, oil embargoes, huge federal deficits, and poor oversight.Why then is Congress trying to repeal Glass-Steagall? After all,a rules change and lax regulation led to the savings & loan crisis.  <p> The reason is that most economists and much of the financial industry believe that the law raises consumers' costs, limits their returns, and puts the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage, since nearly all other nations permit commercial and investment banking under a single roof. In the words of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the banking system denies Americans "lower prices, increased access, and higher-quality services."  <p>    The Senate has voted to lift Glass-Steagall's restrictions twice before, in 1988 and 1991, but the House didn't go along--in part because of the opposition of Democrat John Dingell, then chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Dingell's father, elected to Congress in 1932, was a fervent New Dealer, and for Dingell, the devastation of the Depression remains a vivid memory.  <p>    But the Republicans are in power now, and they've shifted authority for Glass-Steagall to the Banking Committee, headed by Republican James Leach. Leach, along with many of his colleagues, quarrels with the view that banking practices caused the Depression. "Later historical review," Leach says, "has raised questions" as to whether the real problem in the 1930s was that banks bought and sold risky stocks.   <p>    George G. Benston's 1990 book, The Separation of Commercial and Investment Banking: The Glass-Steagall Act Revisited and Reconsidered, has changed a lot of minds on the Hill. Benston, a banking scholar at Emory University, studied the original congressional hearings and concluded: "The record does not support the belief that the pre-Glass-Steagall period was one of abuses and conflicts of interest on the part of banks involved with securities transactions." <p> Leach buys this analysis. "It's harder and harder to justify arbitrary barriers, and it's hard to deny the benefits that accrue from greater competition," he says. He has proposed a bill that would loosen Glass-Steagall's restrictions but impose a degree of separation between financial institutions. Anyone wishing to operate commercial and investment banks would have to do so through a holding company. The entities would be kept apart by legal fire walls and overseen by separate regulators. <p> Still, Leach does worry about financial institutions getting too powerful. This also worries Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of America, a group of 5,500 small banks who oppose the repeal of Glass-Steagall, but not the Leach compromise bill. Last year, Guenther points out, restrictions on interstate banking were lifted, and a series of mergers quickly ushered in an era of $300 billon banks. With the demise of Glass-Steagall, "we're looking at a world of half-trillion-dollarinstitutions," he says. And that means "systemic risk." The government can't let such institutions fail--the bailout would be enormous. Also, he says, "concentrated markets lead to higher prices and poorer service."  <p> Not all in Congress are content with Leach's moderate approach. Representative Richard Baker, who chairs a key banking subcommittee, believes a telecommunications revolution will soon transform banking, whether Congress likes it or not. "The trigger has been pulled," he says. "A bullet has been fired." Banking is coming to the Internet, he says, and companies like <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> and <a name="NASD:INTU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16001"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intuit</b></a>  will figure out a way to electronically capture deposits, make loans, and sell securities. Baker, who is sponsoring a more thorough going deregulatory bill than Leach's, notes that banks have lost market share and profits as investment firms and nonbanks have moved into corporate and consumer lending, credit cards, and money market funds.  <p>    In response, banks are forming alliances with rival institutions. Merrill Lynch, Dean Witter, and Prudential are affiliated with banks that sell stocks and bonds, and the American Bankers Association reports that 41 bank holding companies operate "subsidiaries which underwrite and deal in securities."  <p> The fact is that since Glass-Steagall, the position of banks has eroded. In 1933, banks and S&Ls held about 75 percent of all financial-sector assets. Today, that figure is less than 40 percent. Lending by banks accounted for 65 percent of all short-term borrowing by U.S. corporations in 1970, but by 1992, with the rise of commercial paper, the figure was 36 percent.  <p> Advocates of Glass-Steagall reform say this has forced banks into riskier ventures to maintain their profits. "Currency, derivatives, options, swaps--all that can be done by commercial banks," says Ralph C. Bryant, an economist with the Brookings Institution in Washington. "We constrained banks through a set of rules that forced them to take unwarranted risks," says Baker. "It is a terrible irony."   <p> The fiercest opponents to change aren't bankers or brokers but insurance agents, who fear that the demise of Glass-Steagall will ultimately allow banks to sell insurance. Currently, with minor exceptions, they can't. "The insurance agents are fighting the hardest because they have the most to lose--their entire livelihoods," says a securities-industry player.  <p> "With that FDIC logo in the window, banks would have a major marketing advantage," says Robert A. Rusbuldt, a lobbyist for the Independent Insurance Agents of America. The insurance industry has enormous clout in Congress and, as Baker puts it, "extreme political skills." Leach knows this, and so far at least, he's protected insurers from banking competition.   <p> The third key player in the Glass-Steagall legislative drama is Senator Alfonse D'Amato, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. D'Amato, whose state of New York is home to the nation's largest securities firms, is inclined toward reform, but Capitol Hill insiders say that the senator, who heads the 1996 campaign organization for Senate Republicans, is in no hurry, as banking reform is a golden goose of campaign donations from the three industries whose future is up in the air. D'Amato has said he won't schedule hearings on Glass-Steagall until the House passes its bill. That means repeal or reform won't occur before mid-1996, if then. <p> After that, a single, well-capitalized institution may handle your checking and savings accounts, mortgages, consumer loans, credit cards, stock trading, mutual funds, insurance, and retirement accounts. Reform may also lead to closer, more expert scrutiny of both banking and securities practices.   <p> Still, it's ominous that the issue of safety is being treated with such indifference. Has everyone forgotten why Representatives Carter Glass of Virginia and Henry Steagall of Alabama sponsored the law in the first place?   <p> James K. Glassman is a columnist for the Washington Post and the host of Capital Gang Sunday on CNN and Technopolitics on PBS.  <p>

						January 1996--Special Issue <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> HOW VOTES CAN STEER THE MARKET <p>Like it or not, your investments involve you in Presidential politics. Here's what history says this could mean in 1996. <p> By Pam Black   <p> Want to wager on the 1996 presidential election? You can phone a London bookie. Or you can purchase a Bill Clinton or Bob Dole futures contract on the Iowa Political Market an Internet trading arena operated by the University of Iowa. Contracts on a Dole victory at the Republican convention recently were trading onthe IPM at a price of 41.6 cents each. If Dole gets the nod, these contracts would each pay a dollar meaning a profit of $702 for someone   <p>who invests the maximum $500 that the IPM allows.   <p> The academics and traders who make up this market were better than the opinion polls at predicting the outcomes for the 1988 and 1992 elections. Right now, prices slightly favor a Republican victory in November. A Republican contract sells for 47 cents vs. a Clinton future priced at 44.3 cents.  <p> Of course, simply being in the stock and bond markets at all is another way that investors bet intentionally or not on the outcome of the election. November's results certainly will have an important impact, for better or worse, on the direction of the markets, and therefore on every investor's portfolio.  <p> In 1996, the state of the economy, the rightward shift of politicians and the electorate, the lack of a clear leader among the Republican presidential hopefuls, and President Clinton's strategy to win reelection by running against the Republican Congress will all help determine how the markets react. History reveals certain time-honored patterns: The market and asset classes perform differently depending on which party is in power.  <p> The old saw is true: The markets do like Republicans, with their penchant for fiscal restraint, more than Democrats. But this may not be as important as many investors believe. Since 1900, the market has risen 11 out of 13 times in the six months following a Republican victory. Over the same period it has risen 5 of11 times after Democrats won, says Jim Bianco, director of research at Arbor Trading Group, a brokerage firm in Barrington, Illinois. That adds up to a clear edge for Republicans in average performance the market climbed 7.64 percent on average in the six months following their victories and only 0.39 percent following Democratic wins. But while the market climbed less frequently following Democratic triumphs, when it did, it rose further. The average gain in the five positive Democratic years was 11.57 percent, compared with 9.97 percent on average for Republicans.  <p> With this in mind, Gerald Hobbs and William Riley, researchers at West Virginia University, looked for the best short-term strategies for investing in Republican and Democratic victories. Using data from 1900 through 1976, they found that for the ten elections won by Republicans, the best tactic was to buy stocks 39 days before the election then sell 27 days after, for an average return of 7.3 percent. When Democrats were victorious, the ideal approach combined buying stocks 49 days before the election, selling them two days after the polls closed, and then shorting the market. Selling the shorts after waiting another 42 days resulted in an average total return of 5 percent.   <p> Measured over a longer time horizon, the Democrats win. During the past 48 years that a Democrat has been in the White House, the stock market has logged an average annual return of 13.2 percent, versus only 7.6 percent annually during the 62 years of Republican presidents, according to the Institute for Econometric Research. The margin of victory results primarily from the Hoover years of the Great Depression. Adjusting to remove the Hoover effect and the strong rebound under Roosevelt (1933-1936) brings the two parties neck and neck. The average stock market returnis then 9.6 percent for Democrats versus 10.7 percent for the Republicans.   <p> The last half of the four-year presidential term regardless of the party in charge tends to be better for the stock market than the first half. On average, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index has been nearly flat during years one and two of the term, logging 4 percent and 0 percent, respectively. But the third year has produced an average gain of 15 percent and the fourth year again of 10 percent, according to Tom McClellan, editor of The McClellan Market Report in Glendale, California. Indeed, the market has never lost money during the last seven months of an election year by the measure of Yale Hirsch, editor of the Stock Market Almanac in Old Tappan, New Jersey.  <p> That actually shouldn't be much of a surprise. Presidents always attempt to dispense the bitter pills of rising taxes and interest-rate hikes early in their terms so that the economy is humming by reelection time. Almost no party has kept office when an election year has been accompanied by a recession. From June 1959 to February1960, for example, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to fight inflation. This helped drive the economy into recession in 1960. Eisenhower's designated heir, Vice President Richard Nixon, lost a tight race to John F. Kennedy. In 1980, double-digit inflation and a recession not to mention the Iranian hostage crisis knocked Jimmy Carter out of the White House. Although George Bush may have engineered a recovery for his last year in office, the public neither felt it nor believed it. "The economy had been growing since March of 1991, and yet surveys showed people thought we were in a recession or a depression," says Ray Worseck, chief economist at brokerage firm A.G. Edwards &Sons. Investors should assume Bill Clinton knows this history. Of course, so does the Republican Congress.  <p> This pattern doesn't play out in precisely the same way for Republican and Democratic administrations, or for the stock and bond markets. Fiscal restraint early in a presidential term often leads to a down market the following year and this rough patch is likely to be slightly earlier and worse under Republicans, possibly because the party of fiscal conservatism pulls in the economic reins a bit more tightly. That may also explain why the strongest market performances tend to arrive more quickly for Democratic administrations in the third year than for Republicans. The bond market, however, shows an entirely different cycle, thriving in the early belt-tightening years of the cycle and ailing in the growth-oriented second half, says Arbor Trading'sBianco.  <p> Distinctly different asset classes flourish under each party. Small-capitalization stocks tend to fare better under Democrats, while bonds and cash do better under Republicans, according to a study by Frank Russell Co., an investment-research firm in Tacoma, Washington. Although small-cap stocks follow the election-year cycle, returning more in the last two years of a term than the first two, their late-cycle performance soars during Democratic administrations. From 1929 to 1992, small-cap stocks returned an average of 24.9 percent in the last two years of a Democratic presidential cycle, versus 10.8 percent for Republicans. Fortuitous timing, rather than policy differences, may explain the gap."Democrats often come into office right about the time the economy is recovering from a downturn," says Claudia Mott, director ofsmall-cap research at Prudential Securities. "And small companies lead" the market into and out of recessions.  <p> Based on these findings, Frank Russell researchers tested an investment strategy of simultaneously switching asset classes with changes in party control of the White House. They invested a theoretical dollar in small-cap stocks during Democratic terms and switched to large-cap stocks when Republicans held office. The results: From 1942 to 1993, an investment of one dollar grew to $2,266. That compares with just $289 if the same dollar had been invested only in large caps or $1,066 if it had been invested only in small caps during the same time period. The study also measured what would have happened to a portfolio invested only in small-cap stocks during Democratic terms and only in bondsduring Republican administrations. Under this scenario, one dollar grew to $1,242, significantly more than the $103 return achieved with a standard balanced investment of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds.   <p> How likely is it that any of these patterns will hold true in1996? The odds differ for each trend. So far, Clinton's term fits the presidential election cycle to a tee, and there's no reason to think it won't continue to do so. He raised taxes inhis first year, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in his second year, and the market reacted by stalling for most of 1994. In Clinton's third year, the market took off like arocket propelled by spectacular earnings growth and a nudge from Fed rate cuts.  <p> If 1996 runs true to form, the stock market should deliver a less stunning but still impressive performance. "We won't have the type of appreciation we had in '95, which was way out of the ordinary," says Mickey Levy, chief economist for Nations BanK Capital Markets. "While I expect the market to go up, I urge investors to adjust their expectations and recognize that if the total return on the market is a third to a half of what it was, that's still very strong." That's a 10 to 15 percent return at or above the historic average for equities.   <p> The Federal Reserve probably won't push returns higher by making significant interest-rate cuts or stall the market by hiking them. It's virtually certain that Clinton will reappoint Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to another four-year term in March, leaving Greenspan free to be Greenspan by keeping a keen eye on inflation while attempting to maintain annual gross domestic product growth of 2.5 percent. That's a tough act. But Greenspan's Fed has proved to be cautious and reactive. So changes in course are likely to be gradual and to occur late in the year.  <p> The market may be less likely to react strongly to the party affiliation of the electoral victor because economic distinctions between the Republicans and Democrats are now so blurred. Clinton came to office bent on recasting the Democrats as fiscal watchdogs from "tax-and spenders," and the 1994 Republican congressional sweep has pushed him further toward such traditional GOP positions as a balanced budget and welfare reform.   <p> The policy debate now focuses on how soon to balance the budget and how deep to cut entitlements such as welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare. "In 1993, people were talking about a big expansion of the welfare state with universal health care, and now they're talking about cutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid," says David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers. "The initiative has switched to a Republican Congress, which is part of the reason for the market rally this year."   <p> The Republican majority in Congress is almost certain to grow in 1996, no matter who wins the White House. The political agenda,therefore, will be set by either a Republican Congress and a Democratic president or by a Republican Congress in cooperation with a president of its own party. "If the Republicans get a big enough majority, [they may] go after the rest of the social safety net," says Oppenheimer chief investment strategist Michael Metz. Millions of people might suddenly go hungry, Metz notes, but the market would likely reward that act of "fiscal responsibility" with lower interest rates and climbing stock prices.  <p> What could derail this market scenario? The unexpected. The market won't rejoice if a third, maybe even fourth, party emerges with a legitimate chance to win the White House. "The ultimate nightmare for the markets is that no one candidate gets enough votes to get elected, and the vote gets thrown into the House," says Stan Collender, director of federal budget policy for Price Waterhouse. "That's the kind of uncertainty the markets don't like." And of course such surprises as a worsening banking crisis in Japan, a coup in Russia, or a war in the Persian Gulf or the South China Sea could each send the market into a swoon. Domestically, consumers, especially retirement-conscious baby boomers, could court recession by paring down credit card debt and shopping less. Those are just some of the risks.   <p> Looking a little further out, domestic party politics, a relatively benign influence in 1996, could become dangerously partisan. The Democrats are clearly unable to propose and pass legislation capable of roiling the markets, but that's not true for a Republican party rife with radical economic ideas. Whether or not replacing the income tax with a flat tax, ending decades of U.S. commitment to free global trade, or eviscerating the Securities and Exchange Commission in a fit of deregulatory zeal is a good idea is almost beside the point. The financial markets hate revolutionaries.  <p> A second Clinton term could also unsettle the markets. Without the need to run for reelection, Clinton may finally stick to his guns rather than play the disinterested statesman who attempts to broker responsible deals with a Republican Congress. The congressional leadership is likely to be even more combative after the 1996 elections. A Bob Dole weakened by a failed presidential bid would have less control over the Gingrich-led House and less ability to control the younger troops in the Senate. Turning up the political heat so that the struggle on Capitol Hill turns from a game of chicken like that played recently over raising the debt ceiling in order to prevent a default by the government into deadlocked trench warfare would certainly send the dollar tumbling and undermine the bond market.   <p> Combine that possibility with what history says about the dismal prospects for the stock market in the first year of a presidential term as well as with the possibility that the Fed will start to increase rates late in 1996, and 1997 doesn't look too promising. The presidential tea leaves provide all the warnings investors need.   <p> Pam Black is the Investing Editor of Worth.  <p> THIRD PARTIES ARE NO PARTY  <p> By Pam Black  <p> The stock market hates third wheels in presidential politics, or so history would suggest. The three-party races of 1912 and 1948, in fact, brought on two of the worst six-month market performances of this century. Only in 1916 and 1940, when world war overwhelmed the effect of domestic politics, did the markets do worse following a presidential election. The confused political lineup for 1996 could produce another three-party race: Colin Powell is out of the picture and so, probably, is Ross Perot. Republican candidate Pat Buchanan may run with or without the party nomination, and Perot's followers have reserved ballot space for a third-party candidate, as of yet unnamed, in several key states.   <p> Back in 1912, onetime college president and New Jersey governor Woodrow Wilson rode to an overwhelming electoral college victory as a Democrat, although he failed to win a majority of the popular vote. Wilson benefited when civil war broke out among the Republicans, producing a three-way race. The conservative wing of the Republican party supported the reelection of William Howard Taft, whose 300-pound heft prompted one reporter to dub him a gentle bison. Liberal Republicans, meanwhile, had persuaded Theodore Roosevelt to run for a third term as the candidate of the newly formed Progressive Party (also called the Bull Moose Party). Both Taft and Roosevelt had credentials as "trust busters," but Wilson ranan even more antibusiness campaign. Predictably, Wilson's victory chagrined Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 11.5 percent during the six months following his election. It was Wilson who signed legislation that created the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Trade Commission.  <p> In 1948, incumbent Harry Truman's support in the polls was so low that some Democrats talked of drafting General Dwight D. Eisenhower as their party's candidate. Instead, the Democrats fragmented into three groups: The core of the party held on with Truman, the new Progressive Party nominated the liberal former vice president Henry Wallace, and Southern Democrats formed the States' Rights Party (popularly known as the Dixiecrats) and nominated Strom Thurmond, then governor of South Carolina. In a 31,000-mile, two-month, whistle-stop campaign, Truman attacked the intransigence of the Republicans, who had gained control of Congress in 1946. He also promised to continue Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. With the opinion polls putting Dewey firmly in the lead, many Dewey partisans failed to turn out to vote. This gave Truman the victory with less than 50 percent of the popular vote. Within six days of the November election, the Dow Jones industrials fell 8.6 percent.   <p><p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Experts  <p> THE RESTLESS FRESHMEN  <p> By James K. Glassman  <p> It's mid-july in Washington, when Congress decides how to spend a half-trillion dollars on "discretionary" programs for the fiscal year that starts in the fall. (That's compared with about a trillion dollars that goes to "mandatory" programs like Medicare.) Inside the Capitol building, the House Appropriations Committee is determining the fate of the U.S. Department of Commerce, which since 1913 has, at least in principle, zealously promoted the interests of American business.   <p> Outside the hearing room, a 53-year-old entrepreneur and former drag racer named Dick Chrysler to all appearances, just the sort of fellow who could reasonably be expected to appreciate the government's assistance is taking a break from the proceedings. But Chrysler is a Congressman himself these days, not a businessman, and he is eager to eliminate not just Commerce but also the departments of Energy, Education, and Housing and Urban Development. That's just for starters. When asked about the Small Business Administration, Chrysler, who sits on the House Small Business Committee, holds out his right hand, thumb down.  <p> The Constitution decrees that spending and taxing bills must start in the House, the federal body most directly representative of and responsive to the voters. Chrysler, from the central Michigan town of Brighton, was just one of 73 GOP Congressmen who swept into town on the conservative tidal wave last November, and if Republican promises of smaller government and lower taxes do get enacted (as appears likely), it will be in large measure because of pressure from these political neophytes.  <p> The newcomers, at least for now, are very different from veterans of either party. They're not particulary impressed with Washington; in fact, they don't like the place much. As Washington Post reporter Joel Achenbach recently wrote of Zach Wamp, a 38-year-old freshman from Chattanooga, Tennessee, "Washington is not his city. He has no hangouts here. This is a common theme with Republican congressmen. They are here but they are not really here." When Wamp ran for the House last year, one of his proposals was to pay members of Congress the same salary as a lieutenant colonel and to billet them in officer housing.  <p> Something else marks these neophytes as different: Before entering public service, many of them were working stiffs, not lawyers or former Hill staffers or college professors. Wamp, who never graduated from college, was a real estate broker. Richard "Doc" Hastings of Pasco, Washington, ran Columbia Basin Paper & Supply. John Ensign of Las Vegas is a veterinarian who also managed a hotel. Sue Kelly of Katonah, New York, renovated buildings and owned a florist shop. Gil Gutknect of Rochester, Minnesota, sold school supplies and auctioned real estate.  <p> Chrysler is a true rarity a manufacturer. In 1976, he started Cars & Concepts, which converts standard, unfinished automobiles into convertibles for companies like <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b> General Motors</b></a>. Ten years later, when he sold the firm in a leveraged buyout to his 1,200 employees, it was turning out 95,000 customized cars and grossing $158 million a year. Two years ago, he launched RCI, a successful firm that customizes cars and makes environmentally friendly metal hydride batteries.  <p> Chrysler enjoys telling people that he's no relation to the famous automobile family. In fact, he went straight from high school to the assembly line of GM's Willow Run plant, where he spent six years bolting steering wheels onto rolling Chevrolets. He left GM to work for Hurst Performance, which makes parts for high-performance cars. There he rose from floor sweeper to vice president and, in 1982, bought the company. (He later sold it.) <p> With some of the money he made from Cars & Concepts and Hurst, Chrysler spent $1.6 million to run for Congress in 1992 against Bob Carr, an eight-term Democrat who headed the Appropriations subcommittee on transportation. Chrysler promised voters in the 8th District that he would cut spending and taxes, but his main appeal was generalized change. Carr squeaked through by 3,600 votes. <p>Two years later, Carr ran for the Senate, giving Chrysler his opening. This time, using the same themes and enthusiastically supporting the Contract With America he won easily. Now he believes he can apply the lessons of business to governing.  <p> "I've never used budgets in my business," Chrysler says. "You decide on your mission first. What is it you need to accomplish? Then you apply the resources in the most efficient way, pushing decision-making down as far as possible. No one can tell you better how to do something than the person on the shop floor.They'll tell you,  'You know, if you put the glue on first....'" <p> A belief that decisions are best made by those affected by them virtually constitutes Chrysler's politics. Government has no business promoting business that's the job of the private sector. "I've done business in 52 countries," he says, "but I've never called the Commerce Department, and it's never called me. The department is the mother of all corporate welfare. It's just not the proper role of the federal government, picking winners and losers."   <p> Similarly, he thinks housing and education should be left to state and local governments. "Programs like drug-free schools shouldn't be run from Washington," he says. "That's just to make people here feel warm and fuzzy." Job training? "There are 163 programs! What we need is programs that help entrepreneurs succeed. "In other words, lower taxes and fewer regulations. He mentions the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, despised by manufacturers nationwide. "You could eat off the floor of my plant," Chrysler says of his Cars & Concepts days, but OSHA inspectors could always find something to correct.   <p> Soon, thanks to efforts by the freshmen, Congress itself will fall under OSHA's purview and will learn what it's like to live under the laws it imposes on others. Chrysler points to a tangle of wires below the desk of an Appropriations Committee receptionist. Gleefully, he says, "See that: OSHA violations. Fire-code violations." <p> From Chrysler's point of view, there aren't many things the federal government should do. Right now, he's leaning toward a complete restructuring of the tax code, probably including a national sales tax that would eliminate the IRS. To reform Medicare, he likes the idea of medical savings accounts. Seniors would buy high-deductible insurance policies with federal help, setting aside a special account to pay out-of-pocket health costs up to the limit of the deductible say, $2,000. Any money not spent from the account would be theirs to keep. Chrysler has started such a system for workers at his RCI plant in Michigan. <p> What's the difference between being a business owner and being a Congressman? "In business, you put your head down, do a task, finish it, and go on to the next one," he says. "But in Congress, as soon as you start, you have to pick your head up. You keep being interrupted." For example, Chrysler's pet project of eliminating the Commerce Department seemed a done deal until defenders on the subcommittee in charge of the department's spending saved it. However, Chrysler and other freshmen received a letter from Speaker Newt Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey promising that Chrysler's work on killing Commerce would be incorporated into the upcoming reconciliation bill the last word on the federal budget.  <p> There's no guarantee that Commerce will actually die, but Chrysler seems to be getting a handle on Washington, where the race is less often to the swift than to the persistent. "I look at this pragmatically," he says. "You have to eat the elephant one bite at a time. We're going to be back here in 1996."   <p> This flexibility is another way in which Chrysler is unusual. Norman J. Ornstein, a political scientist with the American Enterprise Institute, points out that while there is a long tradition of rich businessmen spending millions to get elected, there are still relatively few true entrepreneurs who have made it to Congress.  <p> "The idea of running for office is repugnant" to many of them, says Ornstein. "We set up our laws, rules, and culture so that people in the business world see no rewards in politics and potential devastation." Then, too, Ornstein says, the businessman-candidate has to live with the fact that "politicians are people you've vilified all your life, and you want to be one of them."  <p> Now, of course, Dick Chrysler is one of "them," and the big question is whether he and his classmates will become coopted by the Capitol Hill culture. The best guess is that the Republican freshmen, with their rough edges and their disdain for Washington, will resist assimilation at least for another three years. Time enough for some real changes?  <p>    <p>James K. Glassman writes a column on politics and finance for the Washington Post. He also hosts Techno Politics on PBS and Capital Gang Sunday on CNN. <p><p>

						Well, yes, the GOP tax bill helps the rich. But have you noticed what it offers the middle class?<p>By James K. Glassman<p>The republicans' contract with America zipped through the House of Representatives so quickly that the details of its most important bill, H.R. 1215, the Tax Relief Act of 1995, went largely unnoticed. The press focused on Democratic criticism that the bill benefits the rich. True enough, but it also provides spectacular tax savings for tens of millions of Americans. More important, it could induce us to invest at a rate that will help the country keep pace with our global competitors.<p>Let's start by considering a family of five (mother, father, three kids) with an annual adjusted gross income of $50,000. According to the accounting firm Price Waterhouse, this family currently pays federal income tax totaling $4,643. Under H.R. 1215, the family would receive a credit of $500 per child, reducing the amount owed to $3,143, a 32 percent cut. A family with two children would save $1,000, or 20 percent.<p>The bill, in fact, eases the tax burden on the middle and upper-middle class in a number of ways. It raises the estate-tax exemption from $600,000 to $750,000, makes the home-office deduction easier to claim, allows small businesses to expense $35,000 worth of capital equipment a year (up from $17,500), rolls back the tax increase on Social Security benefits enacted in 1993, and permits a tax deduction for those who sell their principal residence at a loss.<p>The Senate will undoubtedly alter the House version, and there's a chance President Clinton will veto the compromise bill. But if the major elements survive intact, H.R. 1215 will be the most influential tax bill at least since 1986. That law cut the top rate on income from 50 percent to 28 percent, but it raised the tax on capital gains (profits from the sale of assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate) from 20 percent to 28 percent, which may have reduced the incentive to invest. Since then, the top rate on income jumped back up__to 39.6 percent on income over $250,000 a year__but the top capital gains rate remains unchanged. The House bill lowers this rate while keeping the current rate on interest, dividend, and salary, thus reinstating a large differential between the two categories. In the past, a wide differential has raised long-term capital investing.<p>Currently, a couple earning $100,000 a year and filing jointly pays $3,100 in tax on $10,000 in interest from a certificate of deposit and $2,800 in tax on $10,000 in capital gains on the profitable sale of stock. Not much difference. But under H.R. 1215, this couple's capital gains levy would drop to no more than $1,550.<p>H.R. 1215 will affect what you pay on capital gains in two ways. First, your rate will be one half your current income tax rate. So, if you're in the 39.6 percent income bracket, your capital gains will be taxed at 19.8 percent. If you're in a 28 percent income bracket (in 1994, couples filing jointly earning from $38,000 to $91,850 in taxable income after deductions), your new capital gains rate will be 14 percent.<p>The second change is more complicated, and its significance appears to have registered with very few investors: If assets are held for at least three years, gains on their sale will be indexed to inflation. That is, you'll pay taxes only on the real increase in the shares' value, not on the increase caused by a cheapening dollar. Ending the tax on inflation is a big deal.<p>Say you buy 200 shares of <a name="NYSE:GE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Electric</b></a> at $50 a share, an outlay of $10,000. You hold on to the stock for five years and sell it at $100 a share__a profit of $10,000. Assume you're in a 28 percent bracket. Under today's tax law, you would pay 28 percent of $10,000, or $2,800, in capital gains taxes. But if the capital gains provisions of H.R. 1215 become law, the picture alters substantially.<p>First, you would calculate the effects of inflation, using what is called the GDP deflator (similar to the consumer price index). Let's assume the deflator indicates inflation has been running at a 4 percent annual clip. Over five years, thanks to compounding, that's a 22 percent overall increase in prices. Since the original cost of your GE stock was $10,000, you adjust it for inflation by adding 22 percent. Your new basis for computing gains, then, is $12,200 instead of $10,000__so your profit, for tax purposes, is $20,000 minus $12,200, or $7,800. <p>Now, apply your new capital gains rate__half of 28 percent, or 14 percent__to the $7,800 gain. Total tax due: $1,092, instead of $2,800. That's a reduction of 61 percent.<p>The bill's IRA provisions may be even more ambitious. IRAs, or individual retirement accounts, were popular in the early and mid-1980s, but the 1986 tax law got rid of their main attraction: No longer could a single taxpayer earning more than $35,000 a year who has a retirement plan at work deduct his or her annual $2,000 contribution to an IRA account. Moreover, IRA withdrawals are taxable income. If you're 30 years old and start an IRA today, who knows what the tax rate will be in 30 years? That uncertainty argues against opening the account in the first place. <p>The new bill erases that dilemma, creating so-called back-loaded IRAs. These retirement accounts, called American Dream Savings Accounts in H.R. 1215, allow you to withdraw accumulated funds at age 59 and a half__tax free. If you and your spouse each put $2,000 a year into a back-loaded IRA that returns 10 percent annually, you'll have $252,000 after 20 years and $724,000 after 30 years. And 10 percent is not an outlandish return for a good growth-stock fund. Fidelity Contrafund, for example, has returned an average of 17.7 percent over the past decade, and Mutual Beacon has returned 15.4 percent. The new American Dream Accounts also allow tax-free, penalty-free withdrawals before age 59 and a half to buy a first home or to pay higher education or medical expenses.<p>The reasoning behind the new IRAs and the capital gains rate reductions is succinctly explained in the report of the House Ways and Means Committee on H.R. 1215: "The Committee is concerned about the national savings rate, and believes that individuals should be encouraged to save." That concern is wholly appropriate, given that the net national savings rate in this country is dismally low__an average of 4.8 percent of GDP annually from 1973 to 1991, compared with 19.1 percent in Japan and 10.7 percent in Germany.<p>Will these changes actually boost saving? No one knows. Ronald Reagan's rate cuts in the 1980s were supposed to do the trick, but instead the savings rate fell and consumption rose. The difference this time is that the the House bill specifically targets long-term savings and investments with its tax benefits. <p>Even if the theory is correct, however, there remains a major problem with this legislation. Over the next five years, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that H.R. 1215 will deprive the U.S. Treasury of $189 billion of expected revenues. Absent new spending cuts, the federal deficit will rise to $356 billion in the year 2000, instead of the $284 billion that's now projected. What's more, the politically palatable features in the bill (those that push revenue loss into the future, such as inflation indexing and the back-loaded IRA) could begin adding an extra $100 billion a year to the deficit between 2001 and 2005, according to the Treasury Department. <p>Republicans in Congress say they'll offset those losses with spending cuts large enough to keep their pledge to balance the budget by 2002. Well, maybe. The cuts they envision will have to be large, in some cases Draconian, and politically very difficult to realize. The pity is that the greatest losses stem from a provision of little economic but large political weight: the $500-per-child tax credit for families making up to $200,000. By 1998, those credits will cost the Treasury $24 billion, compared with $10 billion for capital gains reform.<p>This is where the House-Senate compromise comes in. The betting in Washington is that by fall the president will sign a bill with child credits for families making up to, say, $70,000; that preserves the back-loaded IRAs (and expands the deductibility for existing front-loaded IRAs); and that retains capital gains indexing and probably the rate cuts, too. <p>It's ironic that this sweeping new tax bill may become merely a historical footnote soon after it becomes law. That's because Congress is already turning to the biggest tax reform of all__a single-rate flat tax or a national sales tax. Both have influential supporters on the Hill and among the 1996 Republican presidential candidates. In the meantime, enjoy H.R. 1215. For the sake of the economy (and perhaps partisan politics), the government may let you keep a little more of your own money.

						June 1995 <p>Worth Magazine/Advisor  <p> PRIVACY AND THE SELF-EMPLOYED   <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald  <p> If you earn self-employment income, as 21 million Americans do, the IRS may regard you as a tax cheat. The agency claims the self-employed underpay their taxes, costing perhaps $37 billion a year in lost revenue.  <p> The principal culprits, say the IRS, are lawyers, accountants, construction workers, hairdressers, day-care providers, and doctors.What the IRS won't tell you is that in pursuing lost revenue, it may compromise the privacy of some tax returns. Moreover, according to the Treasury Department, the lost-revenue estimate may not be accurate.  <p> Employers are required to withhold income, Medicare, and Social Security taxes from employees' wages and pay a matching Social Security and Medicare tax. The IRS believes employers, eager to reduce administrative and benefit costs, intentionally misclassify many employees as independent contractors. These workers pay their own payroll taxes, which the IRS says makes cheating easier. <p> Since 1988 the IRS has been cracking down on employers who misclassify their workers. It has hit millions of taxpayers with assessments of 100 percent on taxes owed, plus penalties and interest. "It's found money for the IRS," says Jim Weidman, spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business. "They've got withheld taxes for the future, plus tons of penalties."   <p> The problem is that the IRS, in its pursuit of revenue, is bending its privacy laws by releasing certain workers' tax returns to those who hire them. "Failure to safeguard taxpayer records is a major problem at the IRS," says Peter Sepp, spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union. "Everyone is at risk of having their return made public record. IRS information could ruin people's lives and put corporations out of business."  <p> A recent case first reported in The New York Times is illustrative. In 1993, the IRS reclassified 65 computer programmers as employees of JasTech, a Cleveland-based computer-consulting firm, and slapped JasTech with a $287,000 assessment for failing to send in payroll taxes for the programmers from 1987 through 1989. The IRS based its reclassification largely on 60 returns filed by the workers. <p> JasTech's attorneys, Craig E. Etter and Harvey Shulman, filed a Freedom of Information Act suit in federal district court to get the workers' returns. They used a loophole in the privacy law that said disclosure was allowable since the IRS had, ineffect, made the programmers' tax returns part of JasTech's filed return. By January 1995, the Justice Department had released information from 48 returns to the attorneys.  <p> This was the first reported instance of Shulman and Etter receiving confidential IRS material. However, in 1991, in a case involving a $200,000 payroll-tax dispute, the two persuaded an IRS district officer to give them income and tax payment amounts declared by about 20 programmers and analysts hired as independent contractors by a computer consulting firm. (Etter and Shulman declined to comment on the case.)  <p> Tax experts say the rules governing employee classification are the most subjective and arbitrary in the entire tax code. The IRS relies on a loose conglomeration of case law, workers' compensation law, and employer tort liability rules as well as its own 20 common-law rules (see "Proving You're an Employee").These 20 rules are used in a vague and unpredictable way: TheIRS looks for an overall pattern, weighting the first three rules most heavily. This complex method of classification results in a morphous tax-law categories such as "statutory employees" workers like truck drivers and life insurance salesmen who may operate as if self-employed.  <p> Furthermore, the pretext for this crackdown, billions in lost revenue, may be entirely unfounded. A 1991 Treasury study says that because independent contractors don't get the same fringe benefits and expense reimbursements as employees, they "tend to pay higher levels of taxes, especially Social Security and Medicare taxes, than employees and employers, provided the income and expenses are reported correctly."  <p> If you're hiring an independent contractor, keep in mind that a key IRS test is whether business owners have the right to control where, when, and how someone works. Spell out in writing the job to be performed, closely following the agency's 20 rules. And don't ask the IRS to help you figure out who is and who isn't an employee in most cases the agency will say workers are employees.  <p> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - -   <p> Proving You're an Employee  <p> The IRS might not consider you self-employed if you:  <p> *Work on the employer's premises <p>*Do not have a major investment in resources for providing <p>services <p>*Do not offer your services to the public <p>*Comply with employer's instructions about the work <p>*Receive training from or at the direction of an employer  <p>*Provide services integrated into the business operations <p>*Must render your services personally <p>*Hire, supervise, and pay assistants for the employer <p>*Have a continuing working relationship with an employer <p>*Work full time for an employer <p>*Follow set hours of work established by an employer <p>*Work for one employer at a time <p>*Work in an order or sequence set by an employer <p>*Submit regular reports to an employer <p>*Receive payments of regular amounts at set intervals <p>*Get reimbursed by an employer for business and travel expenses<p>*Rely on the employer to provide tools, materials, or other equipment to do the job <p>*Cannot make a profit or suffer a loss from the services <p>*Can be fired by the employer <p>*Can quit working without incurring liability  <p> Source: Internal Revenue Manual 4600  <p><p>

 BEYOND ECONOMICS, BEYOND POLITICS, BEYOND ACCOUNTABILITY  <p>
 By Michael Lewis  <p>
 It's hard to imagine anyone more unintentionally disruptivethan Alan Greenspan as he enters a crowded room.  From the momentthe chairman of the federal reserve bank walks through the doorand blinks into the television cameras, he looks less like apower broker than a clerk who's been dragged from some dingyvictorian counting house.  The closer he draws, the less plausiblehe seems as a center of attention - and yet the more clearlyhe is just that.  Never mind that his skin tone is a pale gray;that his bald spot resembles a prelate's cap; that he wears thesort of plain blue suit that anyone who has even the slightestflair knows to avoid.  Never mind the large, cartilaginous earsthat would suggest the possibility of human flight if only thebody beneath were not so unflappable.  When Alan Greenspan walksinto a room, the room changes.  <p>
 It's difficult to believe until you see it, but even U.S. senatorsare distracted by his presence.  When he shows up for a congressionalhearing, as I watched him do one morning this January, conversationsstop cold.  A newly elected Republican primps his hair and beatsa path from the dais, hoping to chat with a man who will likelybe the linchpin of our global economy as it enters the next millennium. The crowd cranes to see a man who, more than anyone but theirwon employers and spouses, has his hand in their wallets.  Allthis fawning merely makes Greenspan seem even less comfortable- which is saying something.  You get the feeling he wishes hecould be accounted for without having to be present.  <p>
 It is the first day in the reign of the new chairman of theSenate Banking Committee, Alfonse D'Amato of New York.  Greenspanhas been called upon to tell the senators how a small-time publicservant in Orange County, California, could have blown $2 billionin the spectacular collapse of the bond markets last year.  Atthe sound of the gavel the hearing begins and the Fed chairmanassumes his testimonial post: He slouches in hi chair and leanshis nose heavily on his left index finger, as if it were theonly thing preventing him from sliding to the floor.  I've leafedthrough perhaps 40 different photographs of Greenspan testifyingbefore the congressional committees.  In more than half of thesehe is propping himself up by the nose.    <p>
 For the next hour, Greenspan listens almost motionless as senatorsstake out a range of positions on the need for more regulationof the markets.  At last his own turn comes at the microphone. For a moment the chamber stops dead, as if someone is aboutto say something truly important.  <p>
 But then Alan Greenspan speaks.  <p>
 The typical Greenspan sentence runs on for a hundred words ormore, with three of four switchbacks, and ends up several milesfrom where it started.  You try to follow, but the words simplyvanish as soon as they are spoken.  All that sticks in you memoryare weird fragments filled with clauses, spoken in the raspytone of a Catskills comedian: "We will very importantly findthat we are not capturing the rapidity of change which is happening,which is a consequence...." That kind of thing.  Flashes of meaningare obscured by these giant multi-clause swells, like small boatsin high seas.  <p>
 The ability to talk forever without saying what's on you mindhas long been a job requirement for the Federal Reserve chairman,so no one pays this much heed.  Even Greenspan's friends willtell you his diction is merely a clever ruse.  They say thingslike "You know that funny way he talks, well, that's just a put-on,of course."  But it isn't.  Well before he arrived in Washington,Greenspan spoke in code.  "You had to listen to him really hardto figure out what the hell Alan was talking about,"  says NathanielBranden, a friend and intellectual sparring partner of Greenspan'sfrom the early 1950s.  "Instead of saying, 'I'm going to getthe keys in the car,' he'd say, 'One would think that inasmuchas the keys are located in the automotive device, perhaps itwould be advisable if one were to leave by the back door, findone's way to said device...' Compared to then, he is a modelof simplicity and clarity today."  <p>
 The effect of this impenetrable language on the Senate hearingis almost immediate.  You can see that the senators think theirinability to follow him is their fault - not his.  ChristopherDodd of Connecticut begins to squint.  D'Amato leans back andasks a pretty young woman to fetch him a cup of coffee.  PaulSarbanes of Maryland, who promised during his last campaign toend the Federal Reserve as we know it, slowly sinks into hischair.  Concentration flickers, then dies.  In less than halfan hour Greenspan has numbed any interest in Orange County rightout of the United States Senate.  <p>
 And so by the time the Fed chairman says something worth hearing,nobody much is listening.  Referring to the disastrous advicegiven by a Merrill Lynch broker who sucked nearly $100 millionin commissions from Orange County, Greenspan declares that bothbrokers and their customers should be "unburdened by any perceivedneed to take into consideration the interest of their counterparties."  It sounds dull enough - until you realize what he'sdriving at.  Greenspan expressed this same radical belief moreclearly during the 1960s in a book of essays assembled by hismentor, the novelist and free-market zealot Ayn Rand.  "It isprecisely the greed of the businessman, or, more appropriately,his profit-seeking, which is the unexcelled protector of theconsumer," wrote Greenspan.  Since greed is good, in short, let'snot worry too much about its uglier consequences.  <p>
 The senators, few of whom would endorse such a sentiment, nodright along - as does the chairman of the Securities and ExchangeCommission, whose very job it is to make sure that Merrill Lynchbrokers consider the interest of customers.  Alan Greenspan issubverting the hearing's mission without anyone noticing - andgiving everyone the impression that he had nothing to do withthe fallout from the first genuine hog-stomping financial panicsince the stock market crash of 1987.  <p>
 But in truth, the Orange County fiasco was partly Greenspan'sown doing.  In raising interest rates last year to fend off aninflationary bogeyman that may or may not have existed, his FederalReserve collapsed the bond market by mistake.  That's what madelife hell for the aptly named treasurer of Orange County, RobertCitron - and for a bunch of other bond junkies besides.  What'smore, Greenspan had predicted that no such disaster would happen. In a private meeting in January 1994, he told Senator Sarbanesthe bond market would fall maybe two or three percentage pointsif interest rates were raised but would recover within a fewweeks.  He had a highly complex Fed study to support it, he said. <p>
 But if such a study existed, Greenspan never handed it over- and he never mentioned it again.  (Greenspan declined to beinterviewed for this story.)  Two weeks later the Fed hit thebrakes and the bond market tanked.  It was a good, old-fashionedpanic:  First the hedge funds, then the Wall Street bond traders,then the mutual funds sold their bond positions.  The bond marketstill hasn't recovered.  Greenspan stuck a pin into the air topop a small balloon but sank a zeppelin instead, apparently withouteven knowing it had been up there.  A year later several thousandpeople on Wall Street are now literally on the street; some ofthe world's biggest investors have flirted with ruin; hot moneyhas flowed out of the U.S. bond market to wreak havoc in Mexico;and a formerly rich county in California faces bankruptcy.  <p>
 That no one has presented the Fed with a bill - or called onit to explain the miscalculation - is a tribute to Alan Greenspan'sgrowing freedom to make the world conform to his own peculiarsense of how it should be.  <p>
 There is a tendency in Washington for peoples' pasts to dryup and blow away.  The assumption is that once you've run theinitial gauntlet of electoral politics - or Senate confirmation- everything prior to your arrival ceases to matter:  You'vepassed inspection and are ready to play the Washington game. In many cases this may even be true, but not in Greenspan's. His ideas and beliefs have not been much shaped by his presentsurroundings.  Indeed, the events that molded the Fed chairmanoccurred before he ever thought of entering the government bureaucracy. If you wish to understand what's running through the brain ofthe most powerful man in America, you need to dig way back intothe past.  To 1952, to be precise, the year Greenspan met andmarried his first and only wife, a lithe blond painter namedJoni Mitchell.  <p>
 It was one of those whirlwind mistakes that you don't readilyassociate with the American 1950s.  It started when Mitchellgot a call from a friend asking her if she'd like to be fixedup.  "She said, 'I know an unusual man, and I wonder if you mightbe interested in meeting him.' 'Unusual how?' I said.  'He'svery, very intelligent,' she said. 'It's hard to find a girlfor him.'"  <p>
 A few days later Greenspan called Mitchell.  "He was unusual,"she recalls, laughing.  "First, he talked to me for about halfan hour before he asked me out.  Then, instead of just askingme out, he asked me which of three kinds of activities I wouldprefer."  She doesn't remember the two options she rejected,but a concert at Carnegie Hall was her choice - followed by marriage,followed by intense evening conversations with a group of Mitchell'sclose friends who had gathered as a fanatical salon around Russian-bornauthor Ayn Rand.  <p>
 The group, known to themselves as the Collective and to Randas the Class of '43 - after the year her breakthrough novel,"THE FOUNTAINHEAD," was published - consisted of Rand and herhusband Frank; Nathaniel Branden and his wife Barbara, who wasa childhood friend of Mitchell's; Leonard Peikoff, who now runssomething called the Ayn Rand Institute; Harry Kalberman whobecame Greenspan's broker, and his wife Elaine; and Allan Blumenthal,a psychiatrist who would marry Joan Mitchell after she and Greenspanagreed they had little in common and had their marriage annulledafter less than a year.  For more than a decade the Collectiveconvened every Saturday night in Rand's apartment on 36th Streetin New York City to discuss whichever novel Rand was workingon.  <p>
 This would appear to be the last time that Greenspan formeda circle of truly intimate friends.  More to the point, it wouldbe the last time he was persuaded that another way of lookingat the world was superior to his own.  The new worldview he adoptedwas that of Rand, who had cast herself not so much as a novelistbut as a thinker who proselytized her views through novels. Her philosophy, crudely put, made a kind of religion of self-interest. But Rand's message couldn't be boiled down completely to self-interest. It was more like: The self-interest of a handful of pure, productivespirits is good, while those who leech off them are repulsive. <p>
 The hero in an Ayn Rand novel - with whom all in the Collectiveidentified - was the embodiment of this philosophy.  He forsookordinary rewards such as degrees and money to follow the TruePath in an industry of their choosing.  The many evil characterswho opposed him did so in the name of a greater good, such asequality, but their sham altruism was a cover for barren inadequacy. Rand's villains included government officials, academics, civicleaders, writers, union bosses - a conspiracy of mediocre elites,united by their exploitation of Randian heroes such as engineers,inventors, railroad builders, and steel barons.  The masses,meanwhile, were little more than sheep to be led.  <p>
 What Rand had to say was interesting, but 40 years later itis not nearly so interesting as the group that sat at her knee.Greenspan had entered into "a very, very spiritual subculture,"says Nathaniel Branden.  "It was like sitting in on the dawnof time," recalls Harry Kalberman.  "We would take whatever Ms.Rand had written and read it.  And she would watch our faces- to see whether we got it."  They got it, all right.  Aftera few months, for example, it seemed logical for Rand and Brandento announce to their spouses that they planned to have an affair,just because it served their self-interests.  <p>
 But while he shared with the Randian an eagerness to subordinatehis life to an idea, Greenspan's ideas a the time were the antithesisof theirs.  When he joined the Collective, says Branden, Greenspan"announced that logic was empty, the senses were untrustworthy,and degrees of probability are all that is possible.  'I thinkI exist' he state, 'but I can't be certain.  In fact I can'tbe certain that anything exists.'"  He sounded just like a villainousacademic in one of Rand's books.  But bad as this was - "Howcan I talk to someone who doesn't know whether he exists?"  Randonce griped to Branden - Greenspan arrived with a corollary attachmentthat was even worse.  <p>
 He admired John Maynard Keynes.  <p>
 Greenspan had been born in the Washington Heights section ofManhattan in 1926, the year that a Yale economist named IrvingFisher first identified the trade-off between inflation and unemployment. When Greenspan was four, his father, an economist, divorcedhis mother, who raised him alone  in near-poverty that was heightenedby the most dramatic economic collapse in American history. Thus straitened,  Greenspan attended Washington Heights HighSchool, where he preceded Henry Kissinger by several years. He spent a year at the prestigious Juilliard School of Musicand briefly played the tenor saxophone in a jazz band.  He wasenough of a trained musician that when he whistled along witha tune, he could follow a minor theme rather than the main melody. But he was enough of a born economist that other members ofthe Henry Jerome Band remember him for preparing their tax returns. <p>
 When Greenspan folded his music tent - he'd decided he'd nevertruly excel as a musician - he went to study at New York University'sSchool of Commerce.  There commenced his formal education forhis current job.  And there, well before it was fashionable,he discovered Keynes, an economist who had come to prominencefor his analysis of what, for Greenspan, had been an intenselypersonal event: the Great Depression.  <p>
 Keynes's take on why Greenspan had grown up poor was, broadly,that free markets are unreliable.  Much as panic can feed onitself in a financial market, Keynes said, pessimism can feedon itself in an economy.  Some external shock causes people tofear a downturn; they respond by buying less than usual; thedecline in consumption causes a further slump; and this in turnleads people to buy even less.  Such a cycle caused the Depression,said Keynes - and the only way to kick the economy out of itsfunk was for the government to step in and stimulate it, withdeficit spending if necessary.  What the money was spent on didn'treally matter to Keynes.  He famously suggested that men mightbe paid to dig holes and fill them back up, or that the authoritiesmight hide bottles of cash to be found by young boys - for whomKeynes had a taste.  <p>
 After graduating from NYU in 1949, Greenspan started, then quit,Columbia University's Ph.D. economics program.  Although identifiedby his professors as a brilliant student, he was unable to affordthe tuition and instead took a dull job at the National IndustrialConference Board, a propaganda outlet for big business.  Aftertheir marriage in 1952, Greenspan and his wife began living ina small apartment in Forest Hill on $4,000 a year. He was bynow an ambitious young man with little prospect of success: The sought-after men of the era were well-rounded and sociableleaders of men; clearly that was not the antisocial, maladroitGreenspan.  "Alan did not have intimate relationships," saysNathaniel Branden.  "My feeling is that the personal realm probablyprovoked anxiety in him."  <p>
 Indeed, if you ask anyone who has known Alan Greenspan, theyall say the same thing: The man finds his deepest happiness innumbers.  The statistics of the immediate economic past resonatein his mind like the motif of some secret symphony - they constitutea truth he understands but others do not.  "Saturday morningshe loved to wake up and study numbers," says Joan Mitchell Blumenthal. "He loved being in control of all these numbers."  The youngman was plodding toward a reputation as an economic analyst,of the steel industry in particular.  <p>
 After an inauspicious first meeting, Rand referred to Greenspanas the Undertaker.  "That," says Barbara Branden, "was becauseof the gloom that emanated from him."  Branden's ex-husband,Nathaniel, recorded his own first impression as follows: "Hewas tall and solidly built, with black hair, dark horn-rim glasses,and a propensity for dark, funereal suits.  He was sombernessincarnate, looking chronically weary, resigned, and unhappy." But the Collective took a liking to Greenspan anyway and convincedhim that the world wasn't as ill-disposed to him as it seemed. <p>
 Rand's views redefined Greenspan's universe, painting him asa pure individual trying to stay afloat in a sea of mediocrity. In his memoir Nathaniel Branden recalls Greenspan's enthusiasmover "THE FOUNTAINHEAD" - and his thrill at being invited toread the mythic "ATLAS SHRUGGED" as it was being written.  "Hecame alive with excitement no one had every seen in him before. Shyly and reluctantly he began to yield to the romantic sideof his nature.... He rarely voiced his feelings about anythingof a personal nature, and his language tended to be detachedan passive.  Complimenting Ayn on some passage in the novel,he might say, 'On reading this ... one tends to feel ... exhilarated.'Or 'The reader is inspired here.'  But occasionally he wouldbreak down and exclaim, 'Ayn, this is incredible.  No one hasever dramatized what industrial achievement actually means asyou have.  What you've written is a hymn to human intelligence. This is fantastic.'"  <p>
 Greenspan quickly revised his Keynesian view of what the governmentshould do.  He adopted an objectivist (as Rand called her creed)love of free markets, a deep suspicion of do-gooders, and a righteoushatred of the state apparatus.  Greenspan has said that Rand"demonstrated to my satisfaction that [laissez-faire capitalism]was not only practical but moral."  This was his critical breakwith Keynes, who stressed the amoral nature of markets.  Randhad little truck with those who chose their economic views onpurely pragmatic grounds - in her view, laissez-faire was theonly morally acceptable system.  "I think Alan was searchingfor a total philosophy that would put a foundation under hisideas," says his ex-wife.  "That's what Ayn did for him."  <p>
 Nathaniel Branden published "THE OBJECTIVIST NEWSLETTER," towhich Greenspan contributed one article praising the gold standardand another attacking government regulation.  In the late 1950sthe Brandens founded an institute to spread Rand's ideas.  Bynight Greenspan lectured there; by day he generated economicforecasts for a consulting firm he had joined.  In early 1961Robert Bleiberg, then editor of "BARRON'S," attended a lectureby Greenspan.  He, too, was persuaded of Rand's rightness andreprinted some of Greenspan's writings in "BARRON'S."  but heresisted entreaties from members of the Collective to becomemore closely allied with them.  "It became evident to me thatthey were a cult," he now says, "or that there was a cultlikeatmosphere about them."  <p>
 One day in late 1967, or perhaps early 1968, while walking downBroad Street in lower Manhattan, Greenspan bumped into the managerof his old jazz band, Leonard Garment, who was now an advisorto the presidential campaign of Richard Nixon.  (Garment wouldbecome better known as Nixon's law partner and a star in theWatergate hearings.)  The two friends lunched at the Banker'sClub, and before long the self-certain Randian found himselfin an office with Nixon himself.  "I'm not sure I was even there,"says Garment, "and if I was, I wouldn't have understood whatAlan was saying to Nixon.  He talked Nepal Katmandu language. But after the meeting Nixon said to me, 'That fellow is a whiz. I want to see more of him.'"  <p>
 It was the first of Greenspan's many political conquests - andit illustrated the gap between what universities produced andwhat the world demanded of an economist.  His gift was an abilityto persuade politicians that he was so smart they couldn't livewithout the numbers in his head.  Says a person close to theNixon campaign, "Alan came in with the idea that you could havethis black box that explained it all - inflation, unemployment,GNP.  He'd sit around with guys like [Nixon advisor John] Ehlrichmanand say, 'I've got this black box....'"  <p>
 At Garment's behest Greenspan worked for Nixon's 1968 campaignas a part-time volunteer.  Most people throw themselves intopolitical campaigns with the vague hope that they will receivean important job in government.  Greenspan's interest in Nixonseems to have been more purely principled: After the victoriouscampaign, he turned down entreaties to work in the Nixon administration,including an offer to head the president's Council of EconomicAdvisors.  <p>
 Greenspan had been attracted, it seems, by Nixon's verbal commitmentsto fight inflation.  This devotion to the dollar's integrityhad a spiritual dimension that owed more to Greenspan's linkwith Rand than to any formal training as an economist.  As taughtin universities, inflation is a potentially meaningless event. As long as everyone expects it, everyone can adjust for it. In Rand's Saturday evening sessions, however, inflation wasas great a threat to freedom as alcohol was to virginity.  Itwas the mechanism by which the corrupt political class separatedthe pure from the product of their efforts, by debasing the moneythey had earned.  And deficit spending by the federal government- which floods the economy with unearned dollars - was the corrupts'Trojan Horse.  Pegging the value of the dollar to gold, the Randiansbelieved, was the only defense against political manipulation. <p>
 Nixon, however, became the first in a line of American presidentswhose commitment to fighting inflation was more rhetorical thanpractical.  The new president felt that the Federal Reserve'stight, anti-inflationary grip on the money supply had cost himthe 1960 presidential election, when he ran as the incumbentvice president against John Kennedy.  When at last Nixon gainedthe Oval Office, he came determined to install in the Fed someonemore responsive to his political needs.  That man was ArthurBurns.  <p>
 Burns had taught Greenspan at Columbia, where Greenspan madehis abortive run at a Ph.D.  The defining moment came when heasked Greenspan's class a simple question:  What causes inflation? The students took turns offering answers until they had provedthey didn't know much.  Finally the master boomed: "Excess governmentspending causes inflation!"  But as Nixon's Fed chairman, Burnsproved there was another cause.  At a crucial moment in the 1972presidential election cycle, he began predicting an economicslowdown that few other economists could see looming.  Over manyobjections, he insisted that the Fed ease the money supply toheat up the economy.  Money growth nearly quadrupled, makingan inflationary surge inevitable, but Burn's Fed rejected morethan 20 calls from member banks to slow down money growth.  <p>
 What happened next was delicious to all students of hypocrisyand politics.  By 1974, the price of green eyeshades and everythingelse was out of control, and Alan Greenspan must have been scratchinghis head in disbelief.  The he got a call.  It was Arthur Burns,telling his former student that this objection to becoming abureaucrat was all very sweet but that it was time for him toenter politics.  "Arthur not only asked him to go," says JudyMackey, one of the four women to whom Greenspan subsequentlyentrusted his economic consulting business.  "He told him thatit was his duty to go - that it was their last chance to fightinflation."  <p>
 And so, on the morning of Richard Nixon's resignation, AlanGreenspan left his Washington pied--tierre - at the Watergate- and came to testify before the Senate Banking Committee atconfirmation hearings to become chairman of the president's Councilof Economic Advisors.  Though he lacked a Ph.D. in economics,no one questioned his qualifications.  There is a tradition ofmen becoming experts simply by being put in positions that requireexpertise, and something like this eased Greenspan's anointmentas a Washington player.  He was, and remains, the second andlast economist without a doctorate to head the CEA since itscreation in 1946.  (A couple of years later Greenspan finallyreceived his Ph.D. from New York University.  His thesis wasa collection of articles the academic merit of which we can onlysurmise, since NYU has lost all three copies.)    <p>
 Sightly more at issue were his political beliefs.  Greenspanheld no only that government was more or less immoral but thatthe new inflation was almost entirely a result of Great Societyspending and other social programs.  As he explained that summer,"In the last 10 or 15 years there has been an extra-ordinarybuildup of ... special interests in our society who have ongoingcommitments from the federal budget [that are] running in excessof the revenue-raising capacity of our tax system.... I wouldsuspect that it may account for anywhere from 80 to 90 percentof the inflation in this country."  <p>
 Robert Kavesh, a former classmate and now a professor at NYU,recalls trying to dissuade him from coming on too strong.  "Isaid, 'Alan, you're going to get up there and start on all thatstuff you believe and they're not going to like you,'" he says. To his credit, Greenspan stood firmly by his beliefs.  But somehowon the way from Greenspan's brain to his mouth, his statementsgot so marvelously garbled that they were difficult for anyoneto understand - much less object to.  Nixon resigned that evening,and Greenspan had even more room to maneuver.  "When Ford becamepresident," says William Seidman, a close friend of Gerald Ford'swho subsequently headed the new president's Economic Policy Board,"one of the first things he did was ask me to decide whetherAlan was suited for the [CEA] job.  Alan was not well regardedby academic economists.  But we had enough problems without goingout and finding someone else."  <p>
 And so in September 1974 the man without a Ph.D. in economicswas sworn in as the nation's leading economist.  The man whodefined himself by a moral objection to bureaucracy went intogovernment service.  In the front row of Greenspan's swearing-inceremony at the White House sat Ayn Rand herself, who must havebeen amused by the sight of the ardent atheist placing his righthand on a Talmud held by his aged mother.  <p>
 But somehow Rand seemed sure that Greenspan wouldn't join thecorrupts.  Just a few days before, she had told a reporter: "Alanis my disciple."  <p>
 It is now more than 20 years since Alan Greenspan first cameto Washington and was stuck with his second unflattering nickname:The Creeper.  It could hardly have been a less accurate descriptionof his progress in politics, but it stuck for a while anyway. It had to do with his quixotic way of working a party.  Everynight Greenspan, who was then 48, would attend some fashionableevent with all the relish of a man being forced to eat a cockroach. <p>
 "He does not flow easily from one major conversational groupof celebrities to another," wrote a "WASHINGTON POST" reporter,"but walks through various rooms looking as if he is going somewherein particular - then you see him later heading back with thesame purposeful expression."  Greenspan quickly became the sortof person who knew everyone but whom no one really knew.  Hissocial ineptitude led his colleagues in the White House to wonderwhy on earth he bothered.  "He had such bad breath," recallsWilliam Seidman, "that what social life he had took place ata distance of ten feet."  <p>
 Before long, however, Greenspan was escorting Barbara Waltersaround town - but in such a detached way that rumors began thatthe economist was somehow different from the other policy hustlersin town.  His former wife recalls a visit she received in 1974from a pair of FBI agents.  "They were asking all sorts of vaguelypersonal questions about Alan," she says, "and I could tell theyweren't getting what they wanted.  They didn't seem satisfied. 'Oh, I get it,' I said.  'You want to know if Alan's homosexual.' They said, 'Well, his ex-wife usually knows these things, ifanyone does.' 'Well, he's definitely not,' I said. 'There havebeen a lot of women since me.' And there have!  It's just hewould never carry on with a woman in public.  He's incrediblydiscreet - the most discreet person I have ever known.  I toldthem that if they were worried about whether he would divulgesensitive information, they had lost their minds."  <p>
 An economist might call Greenspan's style niche marketing. In a city filled with charming men with mint on their breath,he stuck out like an oak in an evergreen forest.  And maybe becausehe was so different, he had a fantastic ability to seduce presidents. Just as he seduced Nixon with the numbers in his head, now heworked on Ford.  Scrap-metal prices! Steel inventories! "He hasthe greatest economic bedside manner of anyone in politics,"says Seidman.  "Extraordinary.  That was his favorite word. He'd go in to see Ford and say, 'Mr. President, this is an extraordinarilycomplex problem.'  And Ford's eyes would get big and round andstart to go around in circles."  <p>
 If there has been a theme to the dance between Rand's discipleand American presidents other than his ability to dazzle themwith numbers, it has been his talent for making their lives difficultwith his principles.  Greenspan's career as an advisor is a niceillustration of how unpopular - and how dangerous for a president-deeply held beliefs can be.  Back in 1968, for example, Greenspanhad landed Nixon in trouble when he masterminded a proposal toset Wall Street free from regulation.  It turned out that a lotof voters thought Wall Street needed as much watching as possible,and Nixon had to backpedal quickly.  <p>
 Now as Ford's economic advisor, Greenspan traveled the landpreaching the need to swallow the economic cost of disinflation,and his singular passion once again landed his boss in trouble. In response to a hostile question from a civil-rights leader,Greenspan explained how Wall Street brokers would suffer muchmore than poor people, as a percentage of their incomes, froma war on inflation.  The ensuing outrage prompted CongresswomanBarbara Jordan of Texas to suggest that Americans send Greenspantheir grocery receipts.  <p>
 For his next trick Greenspan helped conduct Ford's WIN ("WhipInflation Now") publicity campaign, which, in addition to beingan ineffectual stunt, very nearly led to another embarrassment. Leaving the White House with Seidman, Greenspan fainted deadaway.  "He was known to faint under pressure," says Seidman. "I had to drag him out of Pennsylvania Avenue and into the OldExecutive Office Building before the press got pictures of theleader of the war on inflation stretched out in the street." <p>
 Finally, Greenspan persuaded Ford to propose a reduction ingovernment spending for fiscal 1977 - election time.  His reasoningwas sound on paper: Any additional spending would fuel inflationaryexpectations, which in turn would raise long-term interest rates,which in turn would dampen the enthusiasm of businesses for investment. But it was kamikaze politics.  Unemployment already stood at8 percent, and lower inflation would mean higher unemployment- a trade-off Greenspan has always been willing to make, butwhich spells suicide for his political masters.  <p>
 To this day, many believe that Ford's budget helped lose himthe election in 1976.  If so, it also lost Greenspan his job. As he left office in January 1977, three things were clear. First, despite all his efforts, inflation was out of control. Second, to rein in inflation you had to control the FederalReserve Bank.  And third, to control the Fed you had to takeit out of the hands of politicians - and, by extension, the citizenry. The Randian view that the masses of men were being led by waywardelites had been proved to be true.  All that was needed now wasa hero to save them.  <p>
 South of Washington, D.C., in the Northern Virginia suburbs,you can find whole neighborhoods teeming with free-market ideologueswho have made their careers shuttling between jobs in governmentand sinecures in conservative think tanks where they attack peoplewho work in government until it is time to return to public servicethemselves.  Ayn Rand's disciples were mainly this brand of talkinghead.  Their certainty that the market was the only moral systemwas buttressed by a near-complete ignorance of how it felt tobe inside a market.  Among them Alan Greenspan was somethingof an exception, and luck for it.  <p>
 After hooking up with the Randians in the early 1950s, Greenspanhad left his job grinding numbers for the National IndustrialConference Board to join an economic consulting firm owned byan old Wall Street hand named William Townsend.  (Greenspan tookit over when he died.)  Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Townsend-Greenspanmet with modest success.  Along with the firm's half-dozen professionals,Greenspan provided a steady color commentary on U.S. economicdata - going so far as to recalculate the statistics generatedby the Commerce Department.  When the U.S. government was publishingquarterly estimates of GNP, Greenspan himself had generated monthlyestimates.  Now he returned to Townsend-Greenspan and positionedhimself as a forecaster.  <p>
 Despite his grasp of statistics and trends, however, Greenspannever had any talent for economic prediction - no one has.  Economicdata are descriptions of the immediate past.  At their best theytell you what was which isn't always a good guide to what is,and is often a terrible guide to what will be.  The tea-leafbusiness was harmless enough; it kept Greenspan's name in thepaper and enabled him to earn a living.  And no one seemed tomind that most of his predictions turned out to be wrong.  Butit's odd that a character so obsessed with objective facts woulddevote himself to divining the future, and the move suggestsa certain unreality at Greenspan's core.  The forecaster is toeconomics as Ricardo Montalban is to acting.  He lingers on thefigures and may be thought of as an important economist by peoplewho don't know better, but his credibility among knowledgeablepeople is zero.  He is merely a man of affairs.  <p>
 But what affairs!  Greenspan now occupied the great gold corridorbetween Washington and New York, in which financiers from NewYork pay for advice about Washington and politicians from Washingtonpay for advice about New York.  Greenspan ruffed the two citiesagainst each other like a bridge hand.  He was invited to jointhe board of J.P. Morgan, perhaps the bluest-chip posting onWall Street.  More poignantly, he built a business consultingfor the savings-and-loan industry.  And so in 1982, when CharlieKeating gave him a hefty fee and asked him to write a letter,it seemed only natural to accept.  <p>
 Three years before, Keating had bought Lincoln Savings & Loanin Phoenix.  There he dreamed of building golf courses and $500-a-nighthotel rooms in the dunes.  As we know now, Keating lost about$3 billion of other people's money on such schemes, all coveredby U.S. taxpayers.  But at the time, he seemed a free-markethero of the sort lionized by Ayn Rand.  His only problem wasthat some government bureaucrats wanted to block Lincoln fromdiversifying out of home-mortgage lending and into anything itwished to buy.  <p>
 At Keating's behest, Greenspan penned an impassioned pleas forsavings-and-loan freedom.  The letter concluded with an offerto lobby in person on Keating's behalf: "I am prepared to meetwith [regulators] in Washington at the earliest possible time." It was a beautiful thing, an act of stunning innocence, andmaybe that's why no one has every held it against him.  Greenspanbelieved what he said: Around the same time, he earnestly explainedto a congressional committee that "a time bomb is ticking awayin the financial system.... The whole thrift-institution systemwill undergo a massive crisis."  He was right, of course.  Whathe couldn't imagine was that freeing heroes such as Charles Keatingfrom the shackles of bureaucracy would only make matters worse. It was a prime example of how the Randian view can collide withreality.  <p>
 Greenspan was just as incapable of imagining the other big financialshift of the 1980s, Fed chairman Paul Volckner's successful attackon inflation.  Maybe he didn't believe that an honest war oninflation was politically possible, but he underestimated Volckner- and politics.  In August 1979, just two months before the Fedhiked interest rates and caused property prices to collapse,Greenspan told the American Statistical Association the oddsof such an event were "no more than one in four."  Then in April1981, he told the Electronics Industry Association of Japan thatinflation wouldn't drop soon.  Again in May 1983 he was quotedas saying that "the extraordinary price calm is over."  <p>
 But until Volckner's second term ended in the middle of 1987,the inflation rate held steady at around 4 percent - down frommore that 12 percent in 1979, a tremendous achievement.  Greenspanwatched in perpetual surprise as it became clear that inflationhad finally gotten so bad that the Fed chairman had been givena mandate, and a level of independence, that was previously unthinkable. <p>
 Now that was a job worth having.  <p>
 No one operating in a culture of manipulation wants to be thoughtnaive.  In Washington there is a tendency to believe that everyonewho clambers into some position of power is the beneficiary ofsome sinister strategy.  A senior advisor to Ronald Reagan hastold me that though he "never felt that Alan would backstab,there was one exception.  He engineered the demise of Paul Volckner. I don't know how.  But he did it.  There was no reason why PaulVolckner was not reappointed."  <p>
 But the truth is that people often land in very important jobsby default, and there was every reason why Paul Volckner wasnot reappointed.  In restoring the credibility of the FederalReserve, Volckner had begun to wrest control of the money supplyfrom politicians.  The process was not complete and could reverseitself at any moment.  But it was painfully clear to everyonein the Reagan White House that, while Volckner's goals were consistentwith the administration's, the lifelong Democrat wouldn't bebullied into ensuring the reelection of a Republican president. <p>
 According to journalist William Greider's best-selling account,"SECRETS OF THE TEMPLE," Volckner was already vulnerable whenhis first term expired in 1983, despite his popularity on WallStreet.  Half of Reagan's inner circle had grown to loathe theFed chairman's high-handedness; only intense pressure from theother half saved his job.  By 1987, however, control of appointmentswas drifting into the hands of George Bush loyalists.  They wantedsomeone they could count on to hit the economy's gas pedal beforepresidential elections - someone who made the right noises aboutinflation, so that the markets didn't go berserk, but who mightin a pinch compromise his principles for the sake of his politicalfriends.  <p>
 Astonishingly, their candidate was Alan Greenspan.  Greenspanhad two things going for him.  First, he wanted the job; indeed,his whole life seemed a preparation for it.  Once a week forthe previous 11 years he had made a trip to Washington, and oneach trip he made a point of massaging the people who mattered. "Alan kept up on his contacts with congresspeople in both partieswhen he would go to D.C.," recalls Judy Mackey of Townsend-Greenspan. "He had one life - and that was it," says former Reagan crony. "I don't think I was in the White House once where I didn'tsee him sitting in the lobby or working the offices.  I was absolutelyastounded by his omnipresence.  I was there once every few weeks. For eight years!  He was always huddling in the corner withsomeone.   <p>
 But more importantly, Greenspan seemed to the Bush camp thesort of character who could be molded by his superiors.  To allexternal appearances, they say now, he had been malleable foras long as they knew him.  "In the White House,"  says the seniorReagan advisor, "he never expressed any particular view strongly. In our meetings with the president he never, ever took a hardline on anything.  He wasn't moderate; he was average.  [That'show] he ingratiated himself with the Bush people.  They feltas if they were getting a friend.  <p>
 It was one of the most dramatic miscalculations in the historyof Fed appointments.  The Bush people put Greenspan into Volckner'soffice thinking they were getting an Arthur Burns-style chairmanwho would monkey with the money supply to help fiends win elections. Instead they got a fanatic whose entire adult life had beendedicated to the principle that inflation was evil.  In August1987 Alan Greenspan took over as chairman of the Federal Reserve. The past did not dry up and blow away.  <p>
 The standard evaluation of Greenspan's tenure as Fed chairmanruns something like this: Over the past seven and a half years,his gift for analyzing economic data and his talent for consensusbuilding have helped America to avert crisis.  Having expungedfrom his character any trace of imprudence, he now acts on financialmarkets as a sort of human stabilizer.  Perhaps his finest hourwas during the stock market crash that occurred just after hisascendancy in 1987, when the Fed flooded money into the bankingsystem and offset the effects of a growing panic.  <p>
 During Greenspan's tenure the Fed also has brought down theannual inflation rate from 4 percent, where it has been since1983, to 2 percent - the lowest level it has reached since ayoung Alan Greenspan first met Ayn Rand.  The economic cost ofthis continued war on inflation has bee substandard growth: Recessionshave been longer and recoveries have been briefer than wouldotherwise have been the case.  The political cost was the defeatof George Bush by Bill Clinton in 1992.  <p>
 On the surface, all of this is perfectly plausible.  Just below,it is not.  For a start, it is clear to insiders that Alan Greenspanis a consensus builder only in the sense that Napoleon was aconsensus builder, and that the Fed is less a republic than anempire.  Our nation's monetary policy is made by a body calledthe Federal Open Market Committee, which consists of Greenspan,six top Fed officials called governors, plus a rotating castof five regional Fed presidents.  The FOMC dictates a coupleof key interest rates - including mortgages and car loans - arebased.  This gives FOMC an enormous lever over the economy: Thehigher the cost of borrowing money, the less economic activitywill naturally occur, especially in credit-sensitive areas suchas housing.   <p>
 To a great extent, Greenspan can muscle the votes of his regionalpresidents, who ar elected by private bankers and work out ofgrand buildings in places like Dallas and Boston.  Regional Fedpresidents make the most important economic decisions in ourdemocracy, yet they are not democratically accountable.  Aboutonce every two years some politician point this out and threatensto introduce a bill that requires them to be appointed by thepresident and confirmed by the Senate, like other top Fed officials. About once every two years, Alan Greenspan stops that proposalin its tracks.  In exchange for protections of their clubby world,the presidents pretty much behave themselves.  <p>
 The six Fed governors, by contrast, are appointed by the presidentand, like Greenspan, work from offices along a corridor in abuilding in Washington.  But while the governors can count onlyon their secretaries for support, Greenspan has authority overa staff of 1,700 permanent Fed employees whose driving instinctis to protect their boss.  There is a long tradition of paddingthis staff with former military men, and the blind loyalty ofthese soldiers fits naturally with Greenspan's method of rule. The troops provide superior information, support Greenspan'severy position with statistics, and glare at recalcitrant governorsin the hallways.  <p>
 In short, any Fed consensus will always confirm Greenspan'sown position.  "Chairman Greenspan," says Walker Todd, a formercounsel for the regional Feds in New York and Cleveland, "hasgot his way on just about everything."  The transcripts of Fedmeetings bear Todd out, invariably showing that the regionalpresidents and Greenspan's fellow governors get dragged alongon whatever ride Greenspan wants to take.  To Mexico, for instance. <p>
 Around every Mexican national election since 1976, the Fed hasloaned dollars to the Bank of Mexico; it's an arrangement thatled naturally to the current $40 billion bailout.  The moneyis typically returned one month after the election.  Where itgoes in the meantime, no one says, but i's a fair guess it hassomething to do with ensuring the outcome of the election - amatter of interest to U.S. presidents.  Greenspan has escalatedthe sums involved in this little favor-granting game, over theobjections of his board.  "He would come to meetings," recallsTodd, "and say that he had promised his friends at the Treasurythat he would do this and that the reputation of the Fed wason the line.  Each time he did this the board would say, 'Okaythis time, but next time tell us before you do it - not after.'Next time he did exactly the same thing."  <p>
 The FOMC transcripts that describe the load of 1988 illustratethe point nicely.  In a conference call that October, Greenspanexplains that "it's important that Mexico be supported throughthis period to whatever extent is reasonable." The committeeresponds skeptically, and governor Robert Heller finally cutsto the nub of the matter.  "Mr. Chairman," he says, "I thinkit's very difficult to make a judgment on the appropriatenessof the program in the absence of a briefing on what's going onin Mexico.  I for one would have very much appreciated eitherto have a briefing  like that or to have a background paper sowe can form some considered judgement.... As it is now, I'm happyto go along with it, but it's blind faith."  <p>
 Two weeks later, on November 1, the subject rises again - afterthe loan has been made.  This time governor Martha Seger expressesher concern.  "The day that this bridge loan was announced inthe newspaper, I happened to have breakfast with a congressmanfrom the House Banking Committee," she says.  "He said, 'Whatin the world is the Federal Reserve doing in that?  Why wouldthey be involved with the bridge loan?' And I didn't know howto answer, I'll be honest with you."  Cleveland regional presidentLee Hoskins chimes in.  "The concern is that we would be subjectto being viewed as perhaps circumventing Congress" by doing favorsfor the White House, he says.  "In that sense, I don't thinkit's appropriate to continue those kinds of relationships." <p>
 Although these are serious concerns, Chairman Greenspan isn'tinterested.  "Any further questions for Mr. Truman [the Fed functionaryresponsible for Mexico]? If not, let's move on to the domesticdesk.  Mr. Sternlight?"  <p>
 That's the sound of a consensus being reached in Alan Greenspan'sFederal Reserve Bank.  <p>
 The main flaw in most appraisals of Alan Greenspan is the focusthey place on his economic skills.  Even the management of the1987 stock market crash - supposedly his greatest achievement- required little in the way of his finesse.  Ever since MiltonFriedman and Anna Schwartz demonstrated that the correct responseto a market crash was to flood the banking system with money,the Fed has been poised to respond to a crisis by throwing cashat it.  Similarly, the market has been poised to believe thatthe Fed could offset the effects of a crisis by throwing cashat it.  These twin beliefs were self-fulfilling.  Put anotherway, the reason the financial world was stabilized so quicklyby the Fed in October 1987 was that everyone believed it couldbe stabilized by the Fed.  And of that belief we have to thankFriedman and Schwartz.  <p>
 More generally, monetary policy in the Greenspan years had beenlargely a matter of erring on the side of tight money.  That'swhy inflation has fallen, and it's not especially notable.  Whatis notable is that Greenspan has pretty much singlehandedly beefedup the power of the Fed and removed it further than ever fromanyone's control but his own.  That's a political achievement- a huge one.  <p>
 Studies have shown that, under different administrations, thesame Fed chairman acts differently.  In other words, the nation'smonetary policy is pretty much democratically controlled; itscourse usually has more to do with who is president than whois chairman of the Fed.  The single exception to the rule hasbeen Alan Greenspan.  This is his real achievement, from whicheverything else follows.  It amounts to a shift in power fromelected officials to unelected ones, and it has a self-propellingmechanism.  In the same way that "Hollywood Squares" celebritieswere famous for being famous, our Fed chairman now is respectedfor being respected.  Liberated from having to pander to merevoters, he is a stable currency surrounded by debased alternatives- he's above the trash-talking of daily politics, willing tomake hard choices.  This has given Greenspan an almost mysticalpower over those who might remove him form office.  <p>
 In August 1994, Alan Blinder learned this the hard way.  Newlyappointed as vice chairman of the Fed, Blinder had been widelyviewed as a possible rival to Greenspan.  (Bill Clinton chooseshis own Fed chairman early in 1996.)  Then the former Princetonprofessor gave a speech to fellow central bankers in JacksonHole, Wyoming.  Blinder argued that, in the short run, one mighteasily purchase a few years of more jobs with just a little bitmore inflation - precisely the belief of his fellow FOMC members,including Greenspan.  <p>
 Blinder's crime was to speak reasonably about inflation.  Inparticular, he had suggested that, at its current low levels,inflation was unworthy of the hysteria that attends it at thetop of the Fed.  As a result, he found himself painted as aninflation lover by an amazing flurry of unattributed quotes frominside the Fed.  He isn't, of course.  But Fed politics aren'tabout reality.  They're about perception: the perception of theFed by financial markets, and the perception of that perceptionby politicians.  <p>
 In the political imagination, the financial markets are a suicidewaiting to happen.  From the moment Alan Blinder tried to speakas thought they were a well-adjusted adult, he was accused ofpushing Wall Street onto a ledge - and discredited as a possiblesuccessor to Greenspan.  The more extreme a Fed chairman is aboutinflation, the more reassuring he is to the markets.  And sinceno one is more extreme about inflation that Greenspan, no oneis better suited to head the Fed.  Fusion of man and institutionhas never been so complete.  In protecting the Fed, Greenspanprotects himself.  In advancing himself he advances the Fed. The end result is single-mindedness unmatched in our government. <p>
 Take, for example, a Clinton administration proposal to consolidateall bank regulation into a single new agency.  Four agenciescurrently handle the task; the Fed is one of them.  Forwardedin early 1994, the idea would have reduced the size of governmentand eliminated some arbitrary differences in how banks are regulated. It enjoyed enthusiastic backing from Democrats and Republicansalike.  The proposal had only one flaw: Alan Greenspan was againstit.  It would strip the Federal Reserve of authority over manyof the nation's banks - and in losing control of these banks,Fed official feared, they would lose their best tool for strong-armingCongress. Bankers are large campaign contributors and powerfullobbyists.  <p>
 This threat galvanized the Fed chairman and within a coupleof months a worthy reform had vanished.  A senior Clinton administrationofficial explained the process to me:  "Here is what happenswhen you get into a fight with the Fed on an issue it reallycares about.  First, Alan Greenspan personally visits about halfthe Senate Banking Committee.  The he contacts the board of directorsat his member banks.  These boards consist of leaders of Americanbusiness.  The leaders of American business then call their membersof Congress, who all of a sudden start to waver in their support. <p>
 "If this doesn't suffice, the Fed then contacts foreign centralbanks, who let it be known in various ways that the new ideaisn't such a good one.  If that doesn't work, you find that allof a sudden the finance ministers of G-7 countries are callingthe White House.  Before you know it the president gets callsfrom the British prime minister, the French president, and otherforeign heads of state. And all of a sudden everyone you thoughtwas on your side is questioning your judgement.  <p>
 "By virtue of its contacts and interrelationships, the Fed hasa public-affairs apparatus that is simply unrivaled by any organization,public or private, in the country.  This has enabled [Greenspan's]Fed to pursue a policy of incremental acquisition of authority. Their objective is the control of everything, for all time,through undemocratic processes."  <p>
 Putting a democracy's most important economic decisions beyonddemocratic control isn't easy - or pretty.  In October 1993 theHouse Banking Committee, chaired by Henry Gonzalez of Texas,invited Alan Greenspan to testify.  The sole purpose of thishearing was for Fed officials to tell Congress, under oath, whatrecords they kept of their eight meetings each year.  Under oath,Greenspan said that those meetings were taped - but that thetapes were erased immediately after a loose description of eventswas typed up.  <p>
 This in itself was revealing:  Some of Greenspan's fellow boardmembers had been unaware they were being taped; he told themabout it in a conference call only a few days before the hearing. But the more important implication of Greenspan's testimonywas that there were no precise records of Fed meetings.  Thiswasn't true.  As it turned out, a verbatim transcript of eachmeeting was kept in a drawer down the hall form Greenspan's office. In a letter to Gonzalez a week after he testified, Greenspanadmitted he had misspoken: He knew about these transcripts buthad forgotten.  <p>
 It was, according to a top congressional staffer who subsequentlyvisited the Fed and examined the documents, hard to interpretas anything but "a very conscious strategy to mislead."  EconomistAnna Schwartz agrees that "it was not Alan Greenspan's finesthour.  when that whole crowd form the [Clinton] White House wassummoned and asked if they had any knowledge of interferencein savings-and-loan investigations, it reminded me of all theFed people lined up before the House committee saying that theyhad no idea they kept records."  <p>
 Underlying the incident was Greenspan's apparent convictionthat the mechanics of his fight against inflation are in somesense private.  The Randian view - that it's perfectly moralfor a pure-intentioned hero to outflank an elected elite - hasseldom been so clearly articulated in our public policy.  Butwhile America in the 1990s finds itself in a different position. It's not at all clear that anyone wants to reduce inflationto zero from today's meager levels: The costs might well outweighthe benefits.  If put to a vote it's unlikely the Fed chairman'spolicy would every be implemented - and not because the massesare being duped.  <p>
 What's odd about Greenspan's reluctance to let anyone know whathe's doing inside the Fed is that it magnifies his power to stripwealth arbitrarily from its rightful owners - just what he hassaid he hates about government.  As the Fed chairman forms sentencesdesigned not to be understood, he can't possibly make himselfclear to the markets that depend on his signals.  The inherentcontradiction leads to absurd situations such as that in Februaryof 1994, when the Fed raised interest rates to preempt inflationbut caused inflationary expectations in the process.  <p>
 If the markets surprised Greenspan by collapsing and devastatingthe nation's bond portfolios, it was only because no one hadany idea what was inside his head.  <p>
 The day after his hearings on Orange Count, Alan Greenspan returnsto Capitol Hill and seems, for once, to be playing the Washingtongame. Everyone takes it for granted that he appears in the samenavy-blue suit of the day before: When he testifies before Congress,Greenspan seldom wears anything but a navy-blue suit, for thevery good reason that it's pretty much the only type of suithe owns.  His ex-wife Joan Mitchell Blumenthal, with whom he'sstill close, recalls helping clean out his closet several yearsago.  "I found a long row of identical navy suits," she says. "I said, 'I want to get rid of ten of these.  Which ones shouldI take?' He said, 'You choose.' And so I did.  It didn't matter!They were all the same."  <p>
 Leaning heavily upon his nose, Greenspan now offers the Republicanparty a plum: The new Congress might cut $50 billion a year fromthe deficit, he says, simply by instituting a more accurate cost-of-livingindex for Social Security payments.  The idea gets front-pageattention - and it's a measure of Greenspan's credibility thatno one asks the obvious question:  Why now?  Greenspan has beenadvising the Clinton administration on deficit reduction fromthe start.  As former chairman of Reagan' Commission on SocialSecurity, he certainly knew the facts all along.  <p>
 One thing can explain it: The Republicans now control Congress. Treated nicely, they're more likely to act on his proposal torequire the Fed by law to reduce the inflation rate to zero. What's more, they're more likely to insist that Clinton appointGreenspan to a third term at the Federal Reserve.  "People insidethe Fed," says former Fed staffer Walker Todd, "assume that beingrenominated for a third term is the driving goal of Alan's life- and that everything he does now is to that end."  <p>
 Most people in Washington will tell you that Alan Greenspanis just another player.  The system has worked Greenspan morethan Greenspan as worked the system, they'll say.  After all,he came to Washington  opposing regulation, and he's now themost powerful regulator in town.  He's picked up a tennis gameso he can schmooze on the court - occasionally in black socks. He's even found himself another powerful newswoman, Andrea Mitchellof NBC.  <p>
 But to me a more persuasive view is that Greenspan has builta better Randian mousetrap.  He has preserved a hard core offanaticism y encasing it in a shell of pragmatism.  No more waitingfor everyone to realize that extreme laissez-faire capitalismis the best system: He's taking control of the process himself,every so quietly.  "Alan believes that there needs to be a transitionperiod," Joan Mitchell Blumenthal told me.  "He thinks we willget to where he wants to go - but that it will take time."  <p>
 Still, not long ago his former wife suggested to Greenspan thathe might be growing soft in his old age - that politics mighthave compromised him more than he thought.  "I haven't changedmy mind," he said. "About anything."  <p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Experts  <p> <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>WAL-MART</b></a> GOVERNMENT <p>Yes, government has to become smaller. So that it can later become bigger and more powerful than ever.  <p> By Walter Mead  <p> As the exhilarated Republican majority filed into Congress last January, it had one overriding goal: to shrink the federal government. Some functions would be turned back to state and local governments, some would be abolished altogether, and some would be placed in private hands. Anguished Democrats howled in pain; the sacred cows of the New Deal state were destined for the butcher's block. Much of this Democratic breast-beating, as well as much Republican rectitude, was simply political posturing, of course. Not all the sacred cows will end up as hamburger. Republicans have special interests, just as Democrats do; hardly anybody really wants to get rid of all government waste.  <p> Like most U.S. taxpayers, I'm accustomed to studied rhetorical poses followed by carefully contrived votes, so the current congressional debate doesn't offend me on the grounds of either morality or good taste. But I am deeply worried by what I've heard so far. I'm increasingly convinced that both the triumphant Republicans and the shattered Democrats badly misunderstand the crisis of government that the nation faces as it heads into the 21st century. <p> Many readers of this column probably expect me to side with the Democrats, so let me begin by saying that Newt Gingrich and his allies are right: Government has got to go under the knife. We can no longer tolerate either the bureaucratic inefficiencies of the New Deal state or the economic waste that results from the tangled and irrational system of subsidies and regulations that proceed from it. We need to stop warehousing surplus corn in Iowa and "surplus" people in public-housing projects.  <p> But the new Republican majority in the U.S. Congress is wrong to think that we will need less government in the future than we have had in the past. Actually, the opposite is true. We will need even more government in the 21st century than we do today. We need government reform so urgently because the explosive, inevitable growth in government that is rapidly approaching could bankrupt our country.  <p> Let me suggest a way to think about this crisis. The U.S. government is a giant service company. Over the years, as its customers asked it to deliver more and more services--adding Social Security in the 1930s and environmental protection in the 1970s, for example--the expense of government climbed. Now, there's nothing wrong with expenses going up in a situation like that--in most businesses selling more products or providing a greater volume of service costs more. But in successful businesses, as volume increases, unit costs go down. Overhead--rent, utilities, and such--gets amortized over a larger customer base; managers discover ways to serve 11 customers well with the staff that once served 10; assembly lines steadily run at top speed so that each widget costs less to produce. Companies that grow revenues but that allow their cost per unit produced to climb also eventually become high-cost producers. And they either go out of business, savaged by more efficient competitors, or reorganize themselves.  <p> How has the government done in these terms? In constant 1987 dollars, the federal budget has grown to $1.121 trillion in 1993 from $832 billion in 1980. At the same time, the country's population has climbed to 258 million from 227 million. On a unit-cost basis--dollars of spending per capita-- the cost of government went up to $4,345 in 1993 from $3,665, almost a 20 percent increase after correcting for inflation. To judge from the last election, very few taxpayers feel that the quality and quantity of services the government delivers justify that kind of price increase.  <p> Anybody who believes that we can reduce the unit cost by providingless government in the future is swimming against the tide of history. Survey the reasons we have government at all--to ensure national security, to preserve public order, to defend the political, religious, and property rights of individuals, and to provide "common goods" such as universal education and a healthful environment. Providing each of these services is more complicated and expensive in the 20th century than it was in the 19th, and it will be more expensive still in the 21st.  <p> Two basic forces drive this process: demographics and technology. The American population is getting larger and older, and American society is getting more complex. It all adds up to a demand for more of what government provides.   <p> A larger population, obviously enough, needs more government than a smaller one, just as it needs more homes and more food. But the population won't just be larger. It will also be older--and old people need more protection and care than young ones. Unless we plan to put the old folks on ice floes, we are somehow going to have to find a way to feed, clothe, protect, and offer medical services to a much larger elderly population. Some of their needs will breed profit-making companies in the private sector. But some of the increased services that this aging population needs will be provided by the government--or by no one at all. And the voting power of this age group guarantees that their needs will be met.  <p> The growing technological complexity of modern life will also create new demands for expensive government services across the board. Just look at education, for example. As recently as 1960 only about 40 percent of Americans over 25 years old had finished four years of high school; in 1993 more than 80 percent did. While the percentage of Americans who had finished high school was doubling, the percentage of Americans finishing college quadrupled. In 1960, American junior colleges, colleges, and universities awarded a total of 477,000 degrees; they are projected to award 2,355,000 in 2003.  <p> Tomorrow's economy will require an even better-trained work force--one in which workers will have to be taught new skills several times during their working lives. Private institutions will not be able to handle the numbers of students who will need advanced education in the United States, and most students will not be able to afford the tuition charged by private institutions. Our society could, of course, decide that it won't pay the bills for educating these citizens. But a country that won't pay to train its future wage earners faces a dark future in a globally competitive economy.   <p> But no matter how many billions our children and grandchildren spend on education, they are likely to find that the problem of welfare refuses to go away and that the portion of the population needing at least temporary aid is, in fact, growing. As machines take over more low-productivity work, what will today's low-wage workers do? The answer is certain to involve more government money.  <p> At the same time as technological progress makes it harder for some people to compete in the job market, it also increases the minimum level of goods and services that poor people need, if they or their children are to have any chance of participating in our economy. A century ago nobody thought of electricity and central heating as necessities; today, telephones and sophisticated medical care figure into our calculations of how to care for the poor. In 2010 the right of all school children to have access to computers will be as important as their right to textbooks is today; only government can pay for these new necessities for those unable to afford them.   <p> We might as well face it: The electronic revolution and the third wave aren't going to abolish our dependence on government. Our grandchildren will consume more government than we do. There is nothing new in that; we use more government than our grandparents did. Progress defers death at the cost of higher taxes; it's a good bargain, all things considered.  <p> The Republican task today is not so much to shrink the amount of government we consume as to cut the unit cost of government. This effort to reform our government is part of the broader restructuring of the economy. In a postindustrial society productivity grow thin services increasingly determines a country's overall growth in living standards. Government--state, federal, and local--is the largest employer in the country; changing it from a sclerotic bureaucracy to something leaner and meaner--from a tortoise into a velociraptor--won't make it weaker or smaller but will enable it and us to survive in the 21st century.   <p> There is no escaping the irony. In bringing down the unit cost of government, in stripping it to its essential functions, in restoring its legitimacy by bringing it closer to the people, the Republicans in Congress are not, as some of them think, permanently reducing the size of the federal government. Instead, they are preparing the way for the government of the future: bigger and more powerful than anything Americans have ever seen. Whether he knows it or not, Newt Gingrich is the servant of generations of bureaucrats yet to be born.  <p>Walter Mead is the Presidential Fellow at the World Policy Institute at the New School.

Worth magazine/Features<p>LOOSENING THE PURSE STRINGS
Emily's List founder Ellen Malcolm wants other women to realize their financial power -- and use it to change politics.<p>By Maureen Down<p>Next month, Ellen Malcolm faces the first major election cycle since her nine-year-old fund-raising group, Emily's List, helped define 1992 as the media-friendly Year of the Woman. In that year, Emily's List became the largest contributor to congressional campaigns via its innovative strategy of collecting members' donation checks and presenting them en masse to candidates early in a campaign. ("Emily" isn't a person; it's an acronym that stands for "Early money is like yeast.") <p>Malcolm's group had a huge effect on the Washington landscape in 1992; its policy of supporting only pro-choice woman Democrats helped swell that group's representation in Congress -- threefold in the House. For the 47-year-old heiress to an <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> fortune, the intervening years haven't been trouble-free. Campaign-finance reforms have threatened the loophole that allows Emily's List members to make checks out to specific candidates so they're counted as individual donations, avoiding the $10,000 lid on PAC donations. Malcolm also has been tagged as the queen of a new machine -- substituting another exclusive network for the old-boy's club she set out to smash. <p>To explore the new financial heft of women in politics and its effect in 1994 and beyond, Maureen Dowd visited Malcolm at her elegant home on a leafy street in northwest Washington, D.C.<p>Q: Emily's List supplies a kind of backing no power broker can dismiss -- cold cash and plenty of it. How did you kick start giving to women candidates?<p>A: We began with a lot of assumptions about how women had changed. One was that we had outgrown the bake-sale mentality of the 1970s -- that there were many women out there who, with a little encouragement, would write a $100 check rather than a $10 one. Our entire effort was to get women to write $100 checks. Now that amount is almost the coin of the realm.<p>Q: Why hadn't women added zeros before?<p>A: I think there are two parts to it. One is that women didn't have economic power until the late 1970s and 1980s, when they began to make their own money. But they also had to make a psychological shift -- to understand that they had the resources and they could do what they wanted with them.<p>Q: Does this have a parallel in your own life? It wasn't until ten years ago that you came to terms with your own money. You kept your wealth a secret, fearing people would dislike you if you used it publicly.<p>A: Well, I did come out of the philanthropic closet, as I put it, in the early 1980s. I finally told people I was the one making all those anonymous contributions. And when I could see the usefulness of my money, I became much more comfortable doing things with it that I thought were important.<p>Q: But why did it take so long to see the link between your money and your goals?<p>A: I think part of it was growing up and maturing, understanding that I didn't have to be concerned about people's stereotypes. In a lot of ways, Emily's List has empowered me just as much as it has helped our members and the candidates we support.<p>Q: Perhaps you hesitated to use your wealth because society trains women to spend money, not to use it.<p>A: Certainly women are not taught to wield financial power -- or political power. It's something we have to learn and teach ourselves. And we have to do it in a way that's comfortable for us.<p>Q: So what's a comfortable style for women when it comes to political giving?<p>A: I think women find ways to do things collectively. That's certainly what Emily's List has done. It's not about having three people writing $100,000 checks; it's having a collection of people writing their small checks, all of us doing it together, making a difference. Women candidates rely on small contributors, people writing $25, $35, $50 checks. What we need is for women to write larger checks -- to seize their economic power and write the checks they can afford. So now we're seeing $100 checks and $1,000 checks.<p>Q: But it takes a lot of those to add up to one $100,000 check. How can this kind of giving ever be efficient?<p>A: Suppose you're a schoolteacher in Omaha and you want to be represented in Congress by women. You may not have a woman running in Omaha -- but you know about a Lynn Rivers running for the House in Michigan or an Ann Wynia running for the Senate in Minnesota. Emily's List lets you support these women effectively. We empower our members by combining all their small contributions to build a powerful resource. That's grass-roots participation.<p>Q: It's also threatening, apparently. What do you say to people who want to ban your "bundling" of checks as an end run around the rules on special-interest giving?<p>A: I don't think they look at the differences between how men and women raise money. They think anyone who can figure out how to get money flowing into the political system must be doing something wrong and should be stopped. I disagree.<p>Q: It's funny this issue should arise just as money is being used to gain power -- not just to preserve power via the fund-raising prowess of incumbents.<p>A: I was surprised, too. We came out of the 1992 elections showing we could bring women into the process. And all of a sudden we were decried by so-called reformers.<p>Q: Emily's List now has a big pot of cash; that means everyone is your friend. For a woman who grew up not wanting to be treated differently because of her money, all this sucking up must be bothersome.<p>A: Yeah, I don't care for it much. I don't like being schmoozed or having people be nice to me because they want something. But it's the way the game is played, and you identify it for what it is. I spend my private life separating myself from that world.<p>Q: But if women gain power just because they now have money to spend, is there any real moral victory?<p>A: I think what we're doing gives women a lot of power, and I think that's a very good thing. Ultimately I think it means women everywhere will be treated more seriously. We're building a very visual, visible picture of women with power. That's a healthy thing for this country.<p>Q: Does it matter that the most visible woman in Washington right now derives her power from being a wife?<p>A: She also derives her power from being very smart and very effective.<p>Q: Okay, but when will we have a woman as president? Is there enough money in the world to pull that off?<p>A: I think we're closer than we may realize. As we begin to get women into top office, we're building a field team for the presidency. I wouldn't be surprised in the next eight years to see a woman as a major contender for president.<p>Q: Is raising money harder now that you have more friends in Washington? Do women respond better when they're fighting a villain, as in the aftermath of the Anita Hill controversy?<p>A: I think some issue groups are having a harder time. But we're now about 34,000 members, compared with 24,000 in 1992, the so-called Year of the Woman. We've just broken the $5 million mark for money to candidates, so we'll certainly raise more money in 1994 than we did in 1992. I think women are sticking with it.

They make lawyers rich, but investors get a pittance.<p>By Bruce Upbin<p>Settlements in securities class-action suits topped $1.4 billion last year, just shy of the $1.5 billion record set in 1992. With all that cash being wrung from alleged wrongdoers, you might think that shareholders, the victims in these cases, are being compensated for their troubles. <p>Guess again.<p>A little investigation shows that class-action suits almost always result in a settlement so small as to be a fraction of the shareholders' total financial loss. After the court determines what fees it will be deducting -- for plaintiffs' attorneys, the claims administrator, and the costs of serving notice -- investors split what remains, which is not a lot. According to a study conducted last year by National Economic Research Associates, a consulting firm in White Plains, New York, shareholders receive an average of 7 cents on the dollar when they sue.<p>When negotiations for settlements in a case begin, defendants and plaintiffs must agree on how much money shareholders actually lost to fraud versus how much was lost because of volatility in the stock or the overall market. This agreement is usually a compromise, struck after vehement arguments from both sides. Expert witnesses are called in to study stock-price patterns and trading volume for the period involved, and they come up with the amount of losses shareholders can legally claim.<p>"What you have to look at is the recoverable damages, which can be much less than what you lost in the market," says William Lerach, a plaintiff's lawyer with Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach in New York City and California.<p>Once losses are determined, plaintiffs' attorneys begin negotiating for the class award. In theory, they're dealing on behalf of the shareholders, but in truth, having a horde of clients is like having no true client. <p>In the case of a company that has little to offer the plaintiffs, lawyers may negotiate an award of stock. If this happens, defrauded investors and their lawyers are both paid in stock rather than cash.<p>"The plaintiff bar is experienced in what kinds of moves would find a better audience, they know what people are willing to agree to, and then they get their fees," says Roberta Romano, a professor at Yale University's law school. <p>In isolated cases, attorneys have earned bonanza settlements for defrauded clients; in S&L crook Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings case, investors received close to 100 cents on the dollar. But that, says Lerach, was a "remarkable recovery because we were able to sue the accountants and lawyers, too."<p>Such stellar recoveries now may be a thing of the past. A U.S. Supreme Court decision last spring restricted the plaintiff bar's ability to go after deep-pocketed law and accounting firms associated with fraudulent companies.<p>A catch-22 of class-action suits is this: If you have any qualms with the settlement and want to hire your own lawyer to negotiate, you must opt out of the plaintiff class before you know what your share of the settlement would be. If you stay in to find out, you must abide by the judge's decision and the approved settlement. <p>"Bringing your own case would only be beneficial if you can convince the defendants in negotiation that you'll be willing to go all the way to trial," says Boston class-action attorney Glen DeValerio. His firm, Berman, DeValerio & Pease, has represented shareholders with substantial individual holdings who broke off from the larger class and, in some cases, extracted a higher per-share recovery. <p>The key to success in a class-action suit is to get in early. If your broker is forthright, he or she should tell you if a company in which you own stock is being sued. Newspapers and financial documents, such as annual reports or quarterly statements, are two other places to look for notice of pending litigation. Once you know the story, get in touch with the plaintiff attorneys and stay in touch with them. Ask questions about what they're negotiating for. What kind of inquiries are they making? Are they doing anything at all? After all, they're supposed to be representing you.<p>If they don't give you straight answers, feel free to write the judge presiding over the case. "If a lawyer is unresponsive, the judge will consider that in his fee decisions and the next time around when that lawyer asks to represent a class," says DeValerio.<p>Because you'll need to prove that you were a shareholder of record during the time of alleged fraud as designated by the court, good record keeping is a must. Occasionally plaintiff classes are divided into separate time periods, and one class may be entitled to a larger recovery. You'll have to submit copies of your trade confirmation slips or account statements, which could be two or three years old. <p>Given the minuscule amounts typically won by shareholders in these suits, it's obvious that the only folks getting rich off class-action suits are the litigators. And considering the not insignificant amount of energy that participants need to expend to get what's coming to them in a claim, you're probably better off taking your losses and moving on. Winning a case against a fraudulent management may satisfy your sense of justice, but it will do very little for your net worth.<p><p>

						July/August 1994 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> TO GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE THEY GO <p>Lyndon LaRouche is out of prison. As he prepares to reenter politics,his fund-raisers are accused of pressuring the elderly -- again.Is your parents' nest egg at risk?  <p> By Christopher Byron  <p> Follow Route 7 west as it meanders out of Alexandria, Virginia,and eventually you'll arrive at a wide spot in the road calledRound Hill. The village lies at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains,about 12 miles west of Leesburg, the Loudoun County seat. There'sa post office, an Amoco station, a coffee shop. And that's aboutit for this rusting and run-down embodiment of every backwateron every two-lane country road that time has passed by.  <p> Make a few turns, however, and soon you'll lurch down a stone-stubbleddirt lane and into today's headlines. At the end of this roughroad dwells Lyndon LaRouche, 71, the first man since legendarylabor leader Eugene Debs to run a semicredible presidential campaignfrom a federal penitentiary. Recently released on parole afterserving five years on charges of conspiracy, tax fraud, and mailfraud, the charismatic LaRouche is now gathering federal fundsto match donations he amassed during his last run for the presidency.As the tax dollars start flowing toward his little-known retreat,LaRouche prepares for a sixth assault on the White House -- andhis cultlike organization shows signs of blossoming once more.On a recent spring day, this rebirth seems a grim counterpointto the crocuses and daffodils that swell with life in hedgerowsacross the Loudoun County countryside.  <p> LaRouche is unrepentant for his crimes, believing he was railroadedbecause of his political agenda. And what an agenda it is: Thoughhe sometimes sounds thoughtful, as with his calls for an investmenttax credit and a 1 percent tax on certain Wall Street trades,many more of his pronouncements verge on lunacy. Most famously,he has tarred Queen Elizabeth II as a drug dealer.  <p> But to focus on LaRouche's curious politics is to miss the point.The crimes that landed him in prison with disgraced televangelistJim Bakker were altogether mundane -- a perfect case study ofan increasingly common fraud: sucking the wealth from lonely,vulnerable old people. According to court records, LaRouche directedhis followers in a systematic and illegal effort to bamboozleelderly folk into giving large "loans" to his cause.  <p> As a result, LaRouche is now a felon who won't be allowed tovote for himself in the 1996 election. Most law-enforcement authoritiesconsider his case to be closed. But a three-month Worth investigationindicates that LaRouche's followers never stopped pressuringold people for cash even while their leader was behind bars.Indeed, an emerging pattern of lawsuits and investigations showsthat, at least until last winter, the LaRouchies continued toraise money using methods only slightly different from the schemethat put LaRouche himself away.  <p> This time, however, old people are largely being left to fendfor themselves. Why? In part because the LaRouchies have droppedthe illegal pretense that contributors would get their moneyback. Meanwhile, strained by drugs and violent crime, the criminal-justicesystem has little time for folks who get talked into giving alltheir money away. Only one criminal investigation, in New Mexico,is known to be underway against LaRouche fund-raisers.  <p> As a result, civil suits against the LaRouchies have been sproutingacross the country. Court documents allege that LaRouche followershave improperly taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from elderlycontributors -- in extreme cases, hitting up mentally impairedpeople and even a patient in a nursing home. LaRouche refusesto be interviewed by Worth. A spokeswoman says he has never beeninvolved in any illegal or improper fund-raising tactics, includingthose for which he served time.  <p> But it's clear that LaRouche draws heavily on elderly peoplefor his financial support. Consider this fact: LaRouche receivedless than 1 percent of the votes in the 1992 presidential election.Yet from a prison cell he gathered more than $1 million in contributionsfrom people listing their occupation as "retiree." That's almostas much as George Bush and Bill Clinton combined. LaRouche officialssay this is because older people love LaRouche's politics. Maybe.But in court documents more evocative of the telemarketing industrythan of mainstream politics, a number of elderly contributorssay they were simply flustered out of their money by fast-talkingLaRouchies.  <p>   <p> Not so long ago, middle-aged parents feared that their teenagechildren would fall into the clutches of a mind-grabbing cultsuch as the Moonies. Today, it's their elderly parents who areat risk. The reason is simple: money.  <p> Three decades ago, the plight of America's elderly was the shameof the world's wealthiest nation. In their landmark study Generations:The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069, William Straussand Neil Howe describe old age in the 1950s and 1960s as "America'sunhappiest, loneliest, and poorest age bracket." But thanks tothe indexing of Social Security benefits and the welfare activismof the 1970s and 1980s, the elderly poverty rate "has fallenfrom the highest of any age bracket to well below the rate forchildren and young adults," write Strauss and Howe. Accordingto U.S. census data, the median net worth of households headedby people 65 or older was $73,500 in 1992 -- more than twicethe national average.  <p> As a result of their remarkable progress, the elderly are nowprime targets for aggressive fund-raisers of all stripes. A recentstudy by Princeton Survey Research Associates found that people75 or older are nearly five times as likely to be victims offraud as are people ages 18 to 64. At congressional hearingslast year, Kenneth Eikenberry, former attorney general of Washingtonstate, testified that the elderly are the biggest target of the$40-billion-a-year business of telemarketing fraud. And thisisn't likely to abate anytime soon. Thanks to advances in medicine,the elderly are also the fastest-growing segment of the population. <p> Elderly women are particularly susceptible to financial scams.Margaret Singer of the University of California at Berkeley,a well-known authority on pressure tactics, notes that many womennow in their 70s or 80s have gone through life with little orno exposure to financial decision making. Because women livesix years longer than men on average, many elderly women inheritlarge estates but have no idea what to do with the money. Oftensuggestible and sometimes not of completely sound mind, suchwidows are uniquely vulnerable to smooth talkers who ask formoney.  <p> By coincidence or design, these individuals are a favorite fundingsource of the LaRouche organization.  <p>   <p> LaRouche doesn't welcome visitors to his bucolic Round Hillcompound. An electrically operated gate bars the driveway; asurveillance camera scans from the trunk of a tree. On a postby the gate sits a metal box with a telephone linked to the housebeyond, a large but seemingly neglected fieldstone affair that'sbarely visible amid a stand of trees. Ask for admittance, butdon't expect much sympathy from the young man at the other end.Mr. LaRouche, it seems, is not receiving. In a farmhouse acrossthe lane, an elderly woman peers from behind lace curtains, thencautiously cracks the door to confirm her neighbor's identity."I don't pay him no mind," she declares as a chicken cackleson her front stoop. Out in the driveway, a dog crawls from undera dilapidated old car that's filled with cardboard and rags. <p> Not long ago, LaRouche lived in far lusher surroundings. Hecounted Saudi Arabian royalty among his neighbors and held forthfor the U.S. presidency from a luxurious 170-acre estate in Leesburg,Virginia. According to court testimony, he used plentiful fund-raisingproceeds to feed prime cuts of meat to his dog; donations werealso used to construct a swimming pool and to buy china and silverware.The property itself was bought, with LaRouche organization money,in the name of a right-wing Oklahoma oilman. But when LaRouchestarted tangling with the feds, his organization fell behindon payments and ultimately abandoned the lush property. Todaythe house lies empty, its grounds growing over with vines andweeds.  <p> Despite its diminished circumstances, the LaRouche organizationisn't nearly as dormant as its former HQ. High-profile prosecutionshave made it hard for LaRouche to attract new recruits. But still,even after four years on hiatus, as they say in Hollywood, he'sstarting to draw attention once more. For one thing, there'shis apparent resolve to start a sixth consecutive presidentialcampaign. That's business as usual. LaRouche supporters alsoplan to run in state and local elections across the country thisautumn, says LaRouche spokeswoman Dana Scanlon. The candidates'theme: "Lyndon was right," a blow-by-blow accounting of all theLaRouche positions that have been borne out by events. The groupcould make itself a pest in Virginia's senate race, where disenchantmentwith Democratic incumbent Charles Robb and his Republican challengerOliver North runs high.  <p> Meanwhile, the LaRouche organization continues to put its stampon the issues of the day. A recent example: LaRouchies believethe Whitewater scandal is a fabrication of British intelligence,in league with Wall Street, the Zionist conspiracy, and the Anti-DefamationLeague of B'nai B'rith. Also high on the current LaRouche hitparade: The activities of international business figures suchas George Soros and Edgar Bronfman, who have been attacked asLaRouche enemies. And in recent months, LaRouche supporters haveformed an ominous alliance with Louis Farrakhan's fiery Nationof Islam, jointly picketing the ADL's offices in Washington,D.C.  <p> With such feverish activity, it's easy to miss the real LaRouchenews: a largely unreported but growing number of allegationsthat LaRouche operatives have again been raising money unethically.A search of courthouse and media records, along with interviewsof contributors and their families, reveals a discernible pattern.Claims range from the Pacific Northwest to New York's Long Island,but they share a common theme: the befriending of elderly peoplewho are alone and looking for comfort. Says Singer, the Berkeleyexpert on pressure tactics: "In America more than in any othercountry, the elderly are isolated and cut off from their ownchildren. They're lonely and vulnerable. That's when you getNew Age groups, scam artists, cults, and opportunists movingin."  <p> All the following cases, which span a period from 1989 to lastautumn, arose after LaRouche was convicted of fund-raising fraud: <p> -> In Pennsylvania, an ailing 86-year-old named Herbert Royergave away virtually all his life savings of $80,000 after a fund-raiserbegan visiting him in a nursing home and showed him a LaRouchevideo. Royer's daughter, Ann Coleman, didn't figure out whatwas happening until, on a visit from Connecticut, she saw a thank-younote from a LaRouchie. Realizing his mistake, former accountantRoyer sank into depression and died soon afterward. Coleman suedthe LaRouchies and won an out-of-court settlement.  <p> -> In Illinois, an 86-year-old widow named Harriet Driver waspersuaded by LaRouchies to hand over $70,000. A criminal prosecutionfollowed, but on her first day of testimony Driver, who livedalone, keeled over in the witness stand from a stroke. A mistrialwas declared, and the prosecutor dropped the charges rather thansubject Driver to another trial. The LaRouchies promptly suedthe prosecutor for $30 million, claiming he was part of a conspiracy,but the suit was thrown out.  <p> -> In Oregon, an 81-year-old widow, Vida Trout, was talked outof nearly $80,000 by two young LaRouche fund-raisers from LosAngeles. They began by taking her shopping and out to lunch --activities her own children no longer had time for. The moneystopped flowing only when Trout's son Bill kicked the LaRouchiesout of his mother's house. The case was investigated by the Oregonattorney general, but no charges were filed.  <p> -> In Minnesota, Jane Young, an 86-year-old widow sufferingfrom dementia, wound up giving a fortune to LaRouchies. Courtdocuments allege that fund-raisers approached Young for a $35donation and within six weeks had talked her out of 1,400 sharesof CPC International and 600 shares of Exxon -- a total takeof about $117,000. Young sued to recover the money and settledout of court.  <p> -> In New York, 79-year-old retired telephone operator LydiaBaldasar forked over $70,000 to LaRouchies, then suffered a pangof remorse and told her son-in-law, a lawyer. He froze her assets,fired writs in all directions, then sued and recovered a settlementfor almost 95 percent of what had been taken.  <p> There are more stories. Perhaps most startling is the well-publicizedcase of Helen Overington, an 86-year-old widow from Baltimorewho, according to a lawsuit filed in late March, was targetedin 1989 by a star LaRouche fund-raiser named Rochelle Ascher.At the time, Ascher was free on bail, pending appeal of an 86-yearsentence for fund-raising fraud. By the time Ascher was done,Overington had become the LaRouchies' very own sugar grandma,handing over three quarters of a million dollars in all. As describedin court records and interviews, Ascher's work was an objectlesson in exploiting the elderly.  <p>   <p> Helen and Bruce Overington were the perfect Currier & Ives couple:hardworking, God-fearing Republicans who raised five childrenon their Pennsylvania farm near the Maryland border. When Brucedied in 1970, his family was amazed to find just how much hehad salted away -- a portfolio worth almost $1 million in thebest bonds and blue-chip stocks. He left it all to Helen, thena spry 63.  <p> Overington showered her children and grandchildren with giftsand gave grants to worthy causes. In 1974, seeking perhaps torecapture her youth in Baltimore, she bought an apartment thereand returned to her college town. Overington enjoyed life asan independent woman of means, and the bull market of the 1980sensured that her wealth kept swelling no matter how generousshe was. Until the LaRouchies came to visit, that is.  <p> "Even to this day we don't know how they got Mom's name," saysher daughter, Margaret Weller. "But we're fairly certain it wasbecause of all these mailing lists she was on. She would givemoney to almost anything -- $10 to this, $20 to that." In fact,say law-enforcement officials, mailing lists for conservativecauses are a classic starting point for LaRouche fund-raisers.(Senator Jesse Helms's contributor list is a particular favorite.)And the successful sale of a subscription to a LaRouche-affiliatedpublication is a classic tip-off that there's more money to behad.  <p> This is exactly what happened to Overington. The telephone rangat her Baltimore apartment one day in January 1989, and a mantold her about a LaRouche magazine called Executive IntelligenceReview. The price, Overington learned, was "two-fifty," whichshe took to mean $2.50. Overington offered to mail a check, butthe man wanted the money that afternoon -- and he was willingto send a messenger around to collect the payment. Overingtonleft a check with her doorman and departed for some errands. <p> When Overington returned, the man phoned her again. There wasa misunderstanding, he said: The price wasn't $2.50 -- it was$250. Could he send someone around to collect the correct amount?In about, say, an hour? Uncertainty gave way to embarrassment,and she agreed. In the following weeks, LaRouchies called onher often. Overington says they reminded her of her own children,whom she didn't see much anymore. They'd talk for hours on eachvisit, railing sympathetically about drugs and Communism, twoof her greatest fears.  <p> "They gave me a book on the German philosopher Schiller," Overingtonrecalls in a voice that's sweet but bone tired. "They were sointelligent and well-versed. They flattered me and made me feelsmart. They knew just what buttons to push." She wrote more checks.For $1,000. For $6,000. For $10,000. Before long, the LaRouchieshad convinced Overington to give them an accounting of everythingshe had in her portfolio -- a veritable gold mine. At that, theybrought in one of the organization's heaviest hitters, convictedfelon Rochelle Ascher.  <p> "The first time I met her she didn't even ask for any money,"Overington remembers. But on her second visit Ascher asked Overingtonto drive to Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, where Overington kept mostof her stocks and bonds in a safe-deposit box. Overington tookout 500 shares of Atlantic Richfield and sold them, later handingmore than $45,000 to Ascher. "It made me feel good to give sucha big amount," Overington says now. And so it went for months:the CSX stock, the Colgate, the General Motors, the IBM, untilmore than $740,000 had slipped through Overington's fingers andinto LaRouche operations.  <p> Overington says Ascher and the other LaRouchies always visitedin the late afternoons and evenings. That's when old people areless alert and more easily confused. "They would stay for hoursand hours, sometimes until after midnight," Overington says."It was as if I had to pay them to leave. They constantly askedme about my children and grandchildren. But they also asked menot to tell my family because they wouldn't understand."  <p> Small wonder: Within nine months, Overington had given awayalmost all of the nest egg that she and her children had expectedwould put the grandchildren through college. The crisis camewhen Overington couldn't afford Christmas presents -- or herhealth insurance, or her apartment, or anything else in her life."I just didn't realize what I was doing until it was too late,"she says sheepishly. Overington decided to sue, but not untila few months ago could her family find a lawyer willing to tanglewith LaRouche and Ascher on a contingency basis -- the LaRouchiesplay hardball and they keep little wealth in seizable assets. <p> Ascher hasn't filed a response to Overington's lawsuit; shedidn't reply to messages left with her attorney and probationofficer. According to news reports, however, she has defendedher fund-raising tactics in court, saying she would "only solicitfrom people who express sympathy for [LaRouche's] politics andgive willingly."  <p> If Helen Overington is an instance of the LaRouchies' prowessat big-ticket fund-raising, Nora Keith appears to be an exampleof their shamelessness. Keith, 87, lives alone on a meager fixedincome in the Oregon logging town of Vernonia, population 1,700.About the same time fellow Oregonian Vida Trout was being relievedof $75,000, two LaRouche fund-raisers from Los Angeles paid Keitha visit in her modest home, apparently drawn by her history ofgiving to just about every charity or political group that senther a letter.  <p> According to her companion Patricia Schmidlin, Keith had beenscraping by on $600 a month from Social Security and a retirementpension. But it wasn't quite enough to live on, so she had recentlysold off the wooded front yard of her house for $25,000. Accordingto Schmidlin, no sooner did Keith get the money than she begangiving it away. Before long there was only about $5,000 left.That's when the LaRouchies arrived.  <p> "Nora has had many strokes, and her mind is going," says Schmidlin."These two people came and got her to donate $65 to publish politicalpamphlets. Then they came back a couple of weeks later and talkedher out of $500 more. They told her it was to help get LyndonLaRouche out of prison. Then they came back the next day andfixed her lunch, and buttered her up, and found out she stillhad some money in an insurance annuity -- $4,823.99 to be precise.So they got her to cash that out and give it to them too. Thenthey left."  <p> The Oregon attorney general's office looked into the case butdecided not to file charges. "Nora hadn't been forced to handover the money," explains Schmidlin.  <p>   <p> Who is Lyndon LaRouche, anyway? Like the unsavory details ofthe LaRouchies' money-raising tactics, it's a question that getslost amid his constant stream of quotable paranoia. But ridiculeof LaRouche's theories doesn't begin to address the phenomenonof a man who has tapped extremist views -- from Marxism in the'50s to ultra-rightism from the '70s on -- to gain the platformfrom which he heads a cadre of the nation's most aggressive politicalfund-raisers.  <p> One person who admits puzzlement is LaRouche's first wife, Janice,who met him through socialist friends in 1954 after he movedto New York from his hometown of Lynn, Massachusetts. Trackeddown in her new life as a career consultant, Janice LaRouchesays she knows little of the man she was married to for eightyears, saying they didn't live together for much of that time.But press her on the matter and she haltingly presents an imageof a man drawn to Marxism out of genuine concern for the troubledand downtrodden. "He was from a Quaker family," she says. "Hewas very nice, very kind. He spent astonishing amounts of timebeing helpful to people -- people with problems." She says she'samazed at the transformation of her ex-husband from far-leftistto far-rightist in the years after their 1962 divorce.  <p> Others say they aren't surprised at all. Christian Curtis, aformer longtime LaRouchie who was a star witness against LaRoucheat one of his trials, says his old boss is motivated by nothingbut a lust for power and influence. When the country swung awayfrom liberalism in the 1970s, says Curtis, LaRouche found theeasiest way to remain in the game: "He simply changed sides andbegan rationalizing it."  <p> Whatever his motivation, the constant in LaRouche's life hasbeen a need for political involvement. As with so many politicianstoday, his defining time was the late 1960s. It was a time ofupheaval: The Berkeley free-speech movement had sparked campusturmoil nationwide. The civil-rights movement, Students for aDemocratic Society, the Vietnam protests  -- all were symptomsof the most dramatic social convulsion in generations. And LyndonLaRouche, a gentle-souled Marxist who was older than most ofthe era's activists, desperately wanted to be part of the action. <p> Freed of his marriage, LaRouche became a university hanger-on.A college dropout himself, he served without pay as a self-described"professor of physical economics" for a leftist group in NewYork City, attracting several students from elite Columbia University."We started out in 1966 with less than a dozen people, meetingin a living room of about 10-by-14 dimensions," he recalled ina courtroom more than 20 years later. LaRouche cozied up to theColumbia students and used them in his first grab at nationalattention. Playing wise elder to his living-room clique, LaRoucheurged the youngsters to foment a student strike at Columbia in1968 -- remaining out of the spotlight himself should thingsgo wrong. He never quite got control of the political firestormthat followed. But as he would later acknowledge under oath,"Friends of mine actually started the Columbia strike."  <p> Starting around then, LaRouche's followers somehow became convincedtheir leader was an intellectual giant, possessed of a vast andunified vision of economic history from Babylonian times onward.Students from some of the best colleges -- Columbia, Harvard,Williams, Swarthmore -- began clamoring to do "research" forhim. On the cusp of adulthood, these favored few saw in radicalLaRouche, as others saw in the Black Panthers, a thrilling rejectionof America's diseased social order. "When you're 22 years old,that kind of stuff is so impressive it can blow your mind," saysChristian Curtis. "When you're 42, you see it for what it is-- a lot of crap."  <p> Many of LaRouche's original followers left in disgust and aretrying to blot the past from their resumes. Some of the brightestwent on to work at Polyconomics, think-tank home of Jude Wanniski,a darling of the Reagan era. One former early LaRouchie, DavidGoldman, now works as chief of fixed-income research for BearStearns on Wall Street. Another is a civil engineer in California. <p> But LaRouche attracted new recruits and signs of cultdom beganto appear. Former insiders say LaRouche activists were allowedno private property and no money beyond a stipend for rent andfood. Nothing was to detract from loyalty to LaRouche -- noteven children. LaRouche's embrace of Marxism began skidding towardan authoritarian, paranoiac ultra-rightism. Suddenly, it seemed,demons were everywhere. Once, says a former follower, LaRouchebecame convinced that armed Cuban frogmen had jumped off a freighterin New York harbor and were swimming up the Hudson River to gethim. The group became almost paramilitary: Surrounding himselfwith armed bodyguards, LaRouche organized hoodlums to break upCommunist rallies. Some LaRouchies were encouraged to carry nunchakus-- weapons used in martial arts -- and to attend counterterrorismschools. Says Curtis: "I suppose we were all insane."  <p>   <p> By the start of the 1980s, LaRouche had settled his group intothe effective agitprop operation it remains today. Located onseveral floors of a warehouse in Manhattan's fur district, andlater further uptown at Columbus Circle, the operation involvedmore than 100 young activists and organizers. With the ascensionof Ronald Reagan to the presidency, the LaRouchies would reachthe pinnacle of their political influence.  <p> The LaRouche organization had tried for years to cultivate friendsin the Reagan camp. When the new administration opened shop,therefore, LaRouchies suddenly had access to all sorts of informationthey had never seen before. They became a kind of Reagan administrationgrapevine, trading rumors for yet more rumors. The group lovedboasting of its links to schmoozers like Bobby Inman of the CentralIntelligence Agency, who had a meeting with LaRouche himself,and Secretary of the Interior James Watt, who attended a breakfastwith LaRouche operatives. But the exaggeration-prone LaRouchieswere overstating matters, as usual.  <p> All this new activity required more money than ever before.And in 1984 LaRouche launched a major bid for the presidency,forcing his organization to push fund-raising even harder. Soon,abuses were occurring as overaggressive LaRouchies scrambledto meet their leader's goal -- raising enough money to denounceDemocratic candidate Walter Mondale as a Soviet agent on nationaltelevision. The LaRouchies started to catch the eye of the law:The Justice Department received complaints from hundreds of peoplewho claimed they were charged $1,000 each after making credit-carddonations of only $10 or $20 to LaRouche. A federal grand jurybegan hearing evidence.  <p> Around this time, LaRouche decided to move his entire operationcloser to Washington, where he apparently felt destiny was callinghim. The chosen retreat was Leesburg, in the foothills of theBlue Ridge Mountains. The place was tranquil and rural, yet amere 40-minute drive away from the seat of world power and influence. <p> Leesburgers didn't hew to New York's "don't ask, don't tell"approach to neighbors. Through an agent, the LaRouchies had renteda pristine mansion with manicured lawns from ballet legend RudolfNureyev. The first thing they did was put an ugly row of electricallyactivated spikes in the sweeping driveway -- to defend againstunwelcome vehicles. Then the LaRouchies surrounded the groundswith chain-link fencing and surveillance cameras. The groundswent to seed as jeep-loads of armed LaRouchies rumbled to andfrom an office in the town center. LaRouche was photographedwith a pistol strapped to his hip.  <p> Eventually the LaRouchies moved to even grander quarters, a170-acre spread overlooking all of Leesburg. That didn't impressthe peeved locals, including Don Moore, the town's deputy sheriff.The more Moore heard about the new arrivals, the less he likedthem. A quick check told him the LaRouchies were under federalinvestigation; soon he was feeding information to the feds andto a separate state investigation of LaRouche-related frauds.Then the IRS got involved, and LaRouche became the target ofa joint task force based in nearby Alexandria.  <p> The authorities finally moved in on a Monday morning in October1986. About 400 officers cordoned off downtown Leesburg and raidedthe LaRouche offices. Luckily, there was no violent confrontation.The next 36 hours were spent lugging box after box of recordsfrom the building -- the detritus of nearly a decade's worthof LaRouche fund-raising. Two years later LaRouche and six ofhis top aides were indicted on federal charges of conspiracy,mail fraud, and tax fraud. The goverment claimed they had bilkedsupporters out of more than $30 million. The basic swindle involvedborrowing money from contributors -- many of them elderly --on a false promise to repay the funds later. The documents seizedin Leesburg helped prove that the fund-raisers knew they couldn'trepay the loans, yet kept soliciting them anyway.  <p> In fact, the LaRouchies' own records supported the feds' contentionthat for all LaRouche's bluster, his group was little more thana huge, rather paranoid boiler-room operation. field operativesgathered leads at shopping malls and airports across the country,funneling data on good prospects to offices in New York, Baltimore,Houston, Los Angeles, and Leesburg. In Leesburg alone, up to20 LaRouchies worked the phones daily, trying to push the politicalhot buttons of potential donors. If they sensed a likely mark,the prospect's card would get red-flagged and sent to the "starroom," where LaRouche's top fund-raisers would take over.  <p> Convictions on all counts followed, and in early 1989, aftertheir various appeals were exhausted, LaRouche and the otherswent to prison -- in LaRouche's case, on a 15-year sentence.Meanwhile, the companion state-level case in Virginia broughtconvictions for 15 more individuals in the scheme. They too woundup being sent to prison, with sentences ranging from 60 daysto 77 years.  <p>   <p> "Who will support us? Who will rally to us?" The question wasposed by Lyndon LaRouche, as memorialized in notes taken by CritonZoakos at a 1987 rally in Leesburg. Now an analyst for the Polyconomicsthink tank, Zoakos served as a top LaRouchie from the late 1960suntil the late 1980s, when he grew disenchanted with his leader. <p> "We were all in this big barn," says Zoakos. "It was one ofLaRouche's typically mesmerizing two-hour speeches, and I wastaking notes as best I could. Then he veered off into somethingI'll never forget. It was really frightening, a man in the gripof his own messiah complex. He said, 'Only we can save the world!Nobody else even knows what the job is! I was chosen ... youwere chosen ... not with fanfare, not with the blaring trumpetsof the Archangel Gabriel. It doesn't happen that way. It happensas you walk down the street thinking of the problems of the world,and you realize that only you can do the job.'"  <p> Then LaRouche gave explicit instructions on who his followersshould tap for help in this vital mission: "The emotionally crippled,the gray-faced, the neurologically impaired -- those who, rallyingto us, will do the only worthy thing to give meaning to theirlives. Thus they will be able to say: 'I was not important, butI contributed to victory!'"  <p> At his trial, LaRouche insisted he had no involvement in, orresponsibility for, the fund-raising tactics of his followers.But his own previous testimony hurt him: In an earlier case,he testified that nothing happened in the organization withouthis knowledge and approval. And it was certainly no secret thatold folks were being hassled to fill the LaRouchies' coffers."There is no doubt about it, we specifically targeted the elderly,"says Christian Curtis. "We were all given briefings on exactlyhow to rip them off."  <p> It's possible that LaRouche doesn't know anything about thefund-raising tactics that have continued in his name since hewent to prison. Possible -- but unlikely. Former LaRouchies saythe organization's officials reported to him throughout his imprisonment.And on August 5, 1990, LaRouche issued a 3,000-word message viahis group's Leesburg headquarters. In this "morning briefing,"LaRouche urged followers to remember that he was still very muchin charge -- and that anyone who believed otherwise was "sick"and suffering from "cultural pessimism." (The message went onto rail against "Episcopalian animal-rights cults," among otherthings.)  <p> Despite a reluctance to begin any criminal investigation, somelaw officials don't hesitate to warn against LaRouche and hisfollowers. "Whether or not what the LaRouche people have beendoing is technically illegal, they certainly remain a major andcontinuing threat to the financial well-being of the elderly,"says John Russell, who was chief prosecutor in the Virginia casesagainst LaRouche fund-raisers.  <p> Meanwhile, LaRouche remains ensconced in rustic Round Hill.When he ventures forth, it's not to kiss babies but to checkin with his parole officer. Still, he keeps chasing his darkdreams -- dreams that are on display weekly, via satellite, on57 cable channels in 21 states. Spreading this message of hateand foreboding takes a lot money, to be sure. But the LaRouchieshave proved time and again that they're nothing if not dedicatedfund-raisers -- especially when they can find a lonely, neglected,elderly donor.  <p> So with LaRouche free and his organization gearing up for anotherpresidential campaign, ask yourself this: When's the last timeyou called your mother? <p>--------------- <p>Christopher Byron is a contributing editor of Worth.

Can an ordinary citizen understand the president's reform package in a 40-hour workweek? Not if the president has his way.<p>By Richard Todd<p>I had been following the health care "crisis" for several months before it occurred to me that my ignorance on the subject was almost complete. The president's speech in the fall had stirred me, and I supported his goals as I understood them. Nothing in my experience justified calling the situation a crisis, but the problems the president pledged to solve did seem a kind of national shame, which may be worse. Surely, I figured, universal coverage would rectify a bad situation. But as to how the proposed reforms would actually work ... I had only the vaguest understanding. This was disconcerting. Those of us who read more than we watch television are in the habit of thinking ourselves well informed. Of course, it is just as easy to watch the news in the newspapers as on TV, and that's what I was doing with the health care issue -- watching. I knew where the plan stood in Congress at any given moment. I knew that Dan Rostenkowski's reelection loomed large in the president's efforts, and how exasperated the Clintons were at the insurance lobby's clever ads, and what an astounding polymath Ira Magaziner was. In short, I knew the score. I just didn't know the game.<p>So one long winter night I decided to bear down. I started reading newspaper features detailing the Clinton proposals. Invariably I got lost. Somewhere in the middle -- often at the place where they described the "health alliances" -- a little dizzy feeling would happen at the center of my forehead, and I would dutifully start again at the beginning.<p>It was some comfort to know that I was not alone. I took to quizzing my friends and tried in vain to find someone who could talk me through this thing. I asked my dentist just at the moment when novocaine and his handiwork would make it impossible for me to talk -- I thought this would be a fine way to spend the next, otherwise silent, half-hour. He started in but discovered he had to gesture with his hands to say anything (not ordinarily a problem of his), and the oral surgery stopped, and he looked more and more perplexed until he admitted he really didn't understand the Clinton plan. Everyone's ignorance seemed as abysmal as mine, as they all candidly and cheerfully admitted. Most people, to be sure, held positions. Even among the doctors in this liberal neck of the woods -- the college-infested hills of western Massachusetts -- the consensus was that the Clinton plan didn't go far enough, that a single-payer scheme would be much preferred. No matter that no one understood the scheme on the table.<p>That's all I wanted to do: understand it. My frustration gave birth to a strange interlude in my life I now think of as Health Care Week. It began with a simple question: How long would it take to understand health care reform? Suppose you took a whole week and did nothing but read, take notes, really go to school on this. What would you learn? I decided to find out.<p>From the moment of my decision I was infused with great purpose. I had ground rules: no interviews, no efforts to get privileged information. I wanted to read, not report. I would limit myself further to the administration proposal, the Health Security Act, which I suppose made my effort seem all the more quixotic. Were we not being told by everyone that the plan was dead on arrival? Indeed, during my Health Care Week, the plan was bottled up in a House Ways and Means subcommittee, while a Republican counterattack known as the Stark alternative was being negotiated. But have you tried to understand the Stark alternative? How can you, without understanding what it proposes to alter? And how was I going to understand any of the myriad twists and turns the legislation would take during the summer and into the fall without knowing what was at the heart of the matter? That was where I hoped I was headed. <p>By Monday morning I had cleaned out my office (I work at home) and assembled in the dining room a harvest table full of literature. (In honesty, the literature had been assembled by the research department of this magazine; had I done it myself, Health Care Week would have lasted at least a fortnight). My reading included all of the administration's official publications on the subject; the administration's draft reports on the subject, not originally meant for publication but now available at local bookstores; and the report of the Congressional Budget Office. I supplemented these basic materials with a syllabus of secondary sources. That list included a packet of Republican party fusillades entitled X-raying the Clinton Plan, a raft of interest-group PR material, miscellaneous newspaper and magazine clips, and an inch-thick Nexis file, just in case. <p>In the center of this ragged landscape stood the imposing mesa of the plan itself, the Health Security Act Senate Bill 1757. At 1,364 pages it is a rather co-opting presence. Confronted with the prospect of actually reading it, I felt a sudden wave of partisanship; if I were to go to all that trouble, the least Congress could do was pass the thing.<p><p>MONDAY. I cannot describe the exhilaration I feel. Cannot and will not try to, either, because when I spoke of the upcoming adventure over the weekend, people looked at me as if I had announced plans to become a Franciscan friar. There is something monkish about this endeavor, and you must grant that monks have their own single-minded joy.<p>I begin just as the administration would have me begin, with its own literature designed for the citizenry -- two publications, one a brochure, the other a little book of about 100 pages called Health Security: The President's Report to the American People. (Note to youth: Here I violate a basic law of studying -- skim everything first. But I'd been skimming for months.)<p>The first thing that strikes me is how the drafters of this plan really want to please. The administration's work shines with an eagerness to make things simple. In chapter 1 we learn: "Today tens of thousands of dedicated health professionals apply their unmatched skills to the world's most advanced technologies and procedures." The voice owes a great deal to the narrators of grade-school documentary films. The authors (who are supposedly the White House Domestic Policy Council, but I don't think so) seem determined not to confuse us. <p>This leads to some odd moments: "While the American health care system features some of the world's best quality care, the constant improvements in quality are now threatened. Today, we have no clear sense of what treatments work best, and which treatments should be used in different situations." We don't? What about those medical professionals with unmatched skills? What's going on here? It's as if the guy doing the voice has lost his script and is now just kind of making it up.<p>Despite that slur at the profession, doctors come off rather well in the report. Not so with the insurance companies (and their brothers and sisters in pharmaceuticals). These louts really take it on the chin: "Irresponsible behavior in our current system begins with those who profit the most: insurance companies that search for the healthiest people to cover while excluding the sick and elderly."<p>Attacks against the current system alternate with visions of the world to come after the benefits of the Health Security Act are enumerated. Soon I know by heart the major principles of the plan: Security! Simplicity! Savings! Quality! Choice! Responsibility! More specifically I hear -- not for the first time, but it's welcome information -- that insurance will no longer be terminated, new applicants will no longer be denied coverage, and there will be a standard package of benefits -- dental care and eyeglasses for children, hospice care, prescription drugs -- that will exceed many current insurance programs. And of course, the most important point: This coverage will be universal, mandatory for employers to provide, available to the self-employed for a fee, subsidized by the government for the poor and unemployed.<p>But the mechanics of the plan remain frustratingly vague. The book is rather like a Buddhist koan, smooth and unyielding as the river-washed pebble: "For the first time, consumers will be in the driver's seat when it comes to finding quality health care." What can this mean?<p>Savings will be achieved because waste will be reduced and fraud will be punished, but most importantly because "the Health Security Act increases competition," the President's Report notes bitterly, "providing health plans the incentive to compete on price and quality instead of on who does the best job excluding sick or old people."<p>How is this competition achieved? Through health alliances. What are health alliances? Well, they are "groups of individual families and local businesses who use their combined purchasing power to negotiate for high quality affordable health care."<p>How will they do this? Well, that isn't spelled out, but then it may not be necessary, because the government is going to put caps on insurance-company premiums. If the insurance companies are going to take on all applicants and limit their premium costs, couldn't we quickly get to a situation in which there is less money available to pay for more care?<p>(What about these insurance companies? They sit in the middle of this discussion like a big dumb beast. Safe to make fun of him, even to poke him, but watch out. All the book's arguments suggest he should be killed, but instead they seem to be draping a big net over him.)<p>This little book is only about100 pages long. Embarrassingly enough, I have spent most of the day reading it, sentence by sentence, listening to its sonorous prose, thinking that if I concentrate a little harder, I will see what after all sounds so simple. Is there something these people don't want to tell me?<p>Before the close of business I am determined to open a new book, the next on my list: The President's Health Security Plan. This is the real, not the pretend, report of the White House Domestic Policy Council, prepared for internal use, then leaked and published by Times Books. The people of the Domestic Policy Council do not, it turns out, write reader-friendly prose. They are patronizing in an entirely different way: "If an alliance's anticipated weighted-average premium exceeds its per capita budget target, an assessment is imposed on each plan whose premium increase (adjusted upward to reflect the previous year's assessment) exceeds the alliance's premium inflation factor."<p>Let's knock off, shall we? The news is on soon, and maybe it will be about something simple, like Whitewater.<p><p>TUESDAY. That sentence I noted yesterday may not be perfectly clear (thanks to the bureaucrat's friend, the passive voice, you can't tell who's doing what to whom). But it's helpful nonetheless. Like a lot of others in the same mode, it lets you know through its mimesis of organizational tangle that life in the alliances will not be as simple as one might have imagined. It's a little thing, but I wish the people behind these proposals could have simply said that X will be in charge of regulating Y. At any rate, it seems that the alliances will not be utterly in control of their own destinies. <p>Who is in control? Suppose that health reform has happened -- how then does the new system operate? Who's in charge here? I decide to organize the next few hours around that basic question. <p>Chapter 5 of the Domestic Policy Council report introduces the National Health Board. A not insignificant creation, it seems. According to the draft report, the board will consist of "seven members appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate." The board in turn appoints "an executive director, additional officers and employees...and hires sufficient staff to carry out the functions described above." One trusts the staff will be large, since the "functions described above" include overseeing "the comprehensive benefit package," "the state system," "the national budget for health care spending," and "the national quality management system," among other obligations. I strongly doubt that the National Health Board will get by with just hiring a few temps.<p>I read this section with mixed feelings. There's something ominous about the National Health Board, constituted as it is like the Supreme Court -- I imagine myself standing cap in hand before the board trying to explain why I haven't eaten more fiber -- but something wholly logical about it, too. Based on what I've read so far, all these proposals unmistakably imply a need for some direction from above. <p>I don't know how I feel about the National Health Board just yet, but my pique at the administration is beginning to build. I spent an entire day poring over the president's report. I pardoned its patronizing tone, I maintained my faith, and now I realize that the administration has gone out of its way not to mention this board. I find myself getting very impatient with the administration's not-in-front-of-the-children approach to the issue. Had the gentle art of pamphleteering been as subtle in 1789, citizens would have read about the virtues of republican democracy without ever learning about the executive branch. ("Your local representative, chosen from your village or a village near you, will help assure that you have the whip hand in Congress.")<p>Still trying to find my way up and down the organization chart, I turn to the Domestic Policy Group's chapter on alliances. It defines their function as follows: "Representing the interests of consumers and purchasers of health care services...structuring the market for health care to encourage the delivery of high quality care...and assuring that all residents in a state are enrolled in health plans."<p>Again -- thanks to another of the bureaucrat's friends, the expansive gerund -- we have a lot of action without any visible actors. I am confused about the relationship between federal and state governments and ordinary citizens within an alliance (if that usage is idiomatic, which I doubt). Now I notice in the litter of my desk a torn-off corner of yellow note paper with this pathetic note to myself written yesterday, re alliances: "What is an a. really? How you start one? Who runs?"<p>I still don't know the answer, and this moves me now to make my first foray into scripture, S. 1757. It's been a long time since I've read a piece of legislation, and it takes a while to get used to that curious convention under which everything always seems to get explained in terms of other subsections, all of which seem to come later in the bill, so that you half think the authors were writing from right to left as if in Arabic. Nonetheless, it feels good to have reached the source. Let's see how the act defines an alliance: "A nonprofit organization, or an independent state agency, or an agency of the state...." Hmm. Its general function is defined a few pages later: "In order to assure the availability of the comprehensive benefit package to eligible individuals residing in the alliance area in a cost-effective manner...each regional alliance shall negotiate with any willing State-certified health plan to enter into a contract with the alliance for the enrollment under the plan of eligible individuals in the alliance area."<p>Let's give this a rest. <p><p>WEDNESDAY. I awake with one of those disconcerting cases of anxiety in which you know you are worried but for a moment can't remember why. Then it all comes back. I am worried about not understanding S. 1757! Relax. There have been worse mornings in my life. But this subject has gotten to me, and the fresh-faced eagerness I brought to the project has long since fled.<p>This morning, after a restorative breakfast, I make a good, if lucky, decision. I will move outside the self-defined world of the administration and read a secondary source. My logical choice is a report called An Analysis of the Administration's Health Proposal, published in February by the Congressional Budget Office. I am not far into this when I feel the stirrings of comprehension. <p>The CBO reminds me of a remark of Einstein's: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler." The CBO analysis is clear in part because it is sufficiently complicated. It provides an overview of the plan's objectives and methods without invoking the evils of the present system or promoting the balms that await us. Also, it explains health reform functionally. It traces the lines of authority, follows the flow of money. Significantly, its first paragraph points out that the reform would "fundamentally restructure the current health care system." This is a welcome acknowledgment that the wand of reform will produce not just benefits but change of all sorts.<p>In the tiresome mystery of alliances, the CBO leads me to the dawn of understanding. It actually confronts my biggest question -- how will the alliances' spending be accounted for? And it argues persuasively that the money the alliances spend will probably come out of the federal budget. "On balance, the new program seems to represent an activity of the federal government that relies on the exercise of sovereign power.... CBO's analysis has concluded that the health alliances would be more like federal agencies than state or private agencies."<p>With this perception, much falls into place. I realize to my chagrin that since that crisp autumn evening when the president first lulled me with his health care promises, I have been allowing myself to be fooled by a word: alliance. Every time I heard the word mentioned in connection with the health care issue, some preverbal -- indeed previsual -- part of my brain conjured up a parade of diverse folks. They'd be carrying lunch pails and briefcases, pushing baby carriages, banding together for their common good.<p>Doublespeak has been with us as a concept for 50 years, and yet how heroically the mind resists seeing it. No, the Domestic Policy Council was never talking about voluntary alliances. These alliances will be an arm of the federal government. They are meant to administer a program, to regulate an industry. They could just as easily have been called commissions, bureaus, regional offices, or some other innocuous, stuffy name, and we'd all be better off if they had been. <p>The CBO -- its task after all is budgetary analysis -- is helpful in pointing one toward (I speak with deliberate caution) an understanding of the savings side of health reform. It defines the objective of the plan with far more precision than the administration could muster on its own behalf: "to provide a universal entitlement to health insurance...and to slow the growth of spending for health care." The analysis points out that the entitlement will obligate the government to an estimated $173 billion in subsidies in 2004. This figure will be reduced considerably by the absorption of much of the current Medicaid program into the new system. But the largest single item of projected savings (some $57 billion) comes from reduced Medicare costs, which will not be part of the new system. These will result from new caps on allowable charges by hospitals and doctors. <p>Although this has been a day that has actually answered some questions, I am left with a fresh one: Are these reductions practicable? And what happens to the plan if they're not? In any case, it's interesting that these reductions were mentioned nowhere in the President's Report to the People. Like the National Health Board, the issue of Medicaid reductions seems to be an item with which they simply chose not to trouble us.<p>Wednesday evening: Up till now, I have tried to leave my subject behind at the table, but tonight I fail. Students of conversation know that you can count on certain topics to bore your listener. These include exotic places you have been and the listener has not, books you have read and the listener has not, lovers you have had and the listener has not, etc. To this list I can add with confidence the Congressional Budget Office. As I praise my new heroes at the CBO, my wife gives me a smile of paralyzing politeness. <p><p>THURSDAY. Feeling some marginal confidence about the way health reform might be organized -- it has taken me only about 30 hours -- I am bold enough to ask how it might affect my life. My tracks into the woods up till now have been straightforward if plodding, but now I start to double over my trail and dart from government documents to lobbyists' tracts, from the turgidity of S. 1757 to the truculence of the Republican party (whose substantive points seem more cogent when detached from their tone -- how often it is thus with the GOP and me).<p>To help order my thoughts, I turn to a landmark piece of journalism from this season, Elizabeth McCaughey's broadside against the administration proposal in The New Republic. (I had "read" it at the time, i.e., spent an agreeable half-hour with it, delighting in the magazine's contrarian excursion, noting that the author raised some troubling points.)<p>As with everything else concerning this infernal bill, the only real way to read the article is to have a copy of S. 1757 at your side. McCaughey is a sort of Beelzebub of health care reform. Her argument directly inverts the what's-in-it-for-you approach of the administration. Her point is that it will be a bad deal for you. For instance: "The bill guarantees you a package of medical services but you can't have them unless they are deemed 'necessary' and 'appropriate.'...That decision will be made by the government, not by you and your doctor."<p>McCaughey writes with a certain suspect vengeance, but her arguments, when examined against the actual bill, continue to give pause. On the one hand, her contention that the government will decide what treatment is appropriate and necessary in each case is a vast overstatement. On the other hand, she rightly points out that Clinton's bill provides the National Health Board with some pretty heavy artillery. This board would have the authority to issue guidelines about specific procedures in specific situations. This makes me think that although certain procedures or tests might be covered under the benefits package, your doctor, or mine, might not always be authorized to do them. On you. Or me.<p>McCaughey makes bitter sport of the administration's claim that the federal government would not impose price controls on doctors' fees. And it does seem that this claim was, if not outright deception, a case of epic weaseling on the part of the administration. The act requires the alliances to establish a fee schedule for physicians. These controls on private doctor's lives and incomes combined with high premiums for fee-for-service plans will, McCaughey points out, have the effect of driving patients and doctors alike into HMOs, to the detriment of quality care.<p>Of course, there is something skewed about this whole argument. Whether or not you will be worse off under the reform plans depends on who you are. For those of us who enjoy private health insurance, though, it's hard to resist the idea that Health Security will represent compromised medical care.<p>So I seem, late in the day, to have reached another of those hard-won revelations that appear obvious once stated. Nonetheless, I think it's an essential premise for thinking about reform: The plan is not about extending benefits so much as it is about redistributing them. In this, the reform plan differs greatly from Medicare or Social Security, to both of which it is often compared. The plan attempts not to shelter a vulnerable group, but to rationalize an entire system. It proceeds from the never-stated assumption that not only are some people underinsured but that others are in effect overinsured. This may, at least in some Benthamite greatest-good sense, be true. But it would be hard to find anyone who would consider himself in the overinsured category. <p><p>FRIDAY. Forty hours isn't enough. I realize this morning that there are scores of things I don't yet understand. There is the plan for enhancing preventive medicine. Who could oppose it? But the scheme calls for unprecedented control over the number of medical students who are allowed to enter specialties, and I do worry about that. There is the national data bank, another good idea: Wherever you go, your medical records can be summoned by computer. But every doctor must record every visit: Is there any possibility of a private visit with a doctor? And above all there is the black hole of Medicare reform. <p>I perhaps have accomplished my most modest goal. True, I could not go toe to toe with Ira Magaziner or survive on The McLaughlin Group, though I could explain the administration's plan to a docile audience. After acknowledging that it subsidizes universal coverage, that it is organized around the workplace with employers picking up at least 80 percent of the bill, and that it makes important provisions prohibiting discrimination against individuals because of their health history, I would probably not speak in terms the administration -- or even my dentist -- would approve. I would point out that two of the virtues most touted by supporters of the plan -- choice and quality -- are the two things most threatened. That competition will be largely illusory. (Fine with me: I'm not sure I want my providers working all night to save money on my care.) Prices will be controlled by government guidelines, and one can be confident that prices will rise to meet the ceilings. Finally, despite local figureheads, control over the system will rest firmly with the federal government. This -- the centralizing of power -- and universal coverage are the two bedrock accomplishments of the plan. In a word, we will buy security and pay for it with freedom, not exactly an unprecedented transaction. <p>I think I've also learned something about why this program is so hard to understand. It's complicated, true, perhaps fatally complicated, but that's not the only or even the main reason why we've had such a hard time getting it. I'm afraid they haven't entirely wanted us to get it. In presenting their plan to us, the president and Mrs. Clinton and their fellows have veered between patronizing simplicity and pointless obfuscation. Thanks to euphemism, parental prose, hidden agendas, doublespeak, and commonplace deceit, they have managed to cast doubt on even the truly admirable parts of the plan. It would of course have been too much to ask for candor. But think what a candid description of the plan's rationale could have accomplished. The framers of this contraption know where the weak spots are -- their frank account of the compromises that went into its making would have made the whole thing clear in about ten minutes. Impossible, I know. But then couldn't they simply have laid it out for us, and let us make our own judgments? Instead, the administration has spent months trying to sell us something, when all they had to do was explain it.

						To large employers and the uninsured, the Clinton health-care package looks like progress.  But to someone who owes his doctors his life, it looks fatally flawed.<p>By Jonathan Kwitny <p>In a country where the most common medical problem is getting and paying for medical insurance, the health care package offered by Bill Clinton last fall can look promising. Most people are well most of the time, so the issues of cost and coverage have dominated discussion of the package.<p>Less attention has been focused on the price the plan carries in times of serious illness--which none of us really expects but which is the reason we need health insurance. For all the debate about what the plan will do to insurance premiums and taxes, the real price won't emerge until patients and their families confront a health crisis and learn that opportunities for quality care have been reduced in ways that will cost lives. The shock will be particularly great if the crisis involves one of the many conditions for which medical science hasn't yet settled on a single answer.<p>A growing number of patients and their families have already paid this hidden price, because employers and health insurers long ago sensed what was happening and began positioning themselves for the new world of medicine the Clinton administration's plan promises them. The plan's basic idea, known as managed care or managed competition, is to strongly encourage most patients and doctors to join large groups. Each group of patients comes under exclusive contract for treatment to a group of physicians and one or more hospitals. <p>Doctors in these group practices may be employees of a health-maintenance organization or may work from private offices in a network known as a preferred-provider organization. Ten years ago, these group practices were contracted to treat only about 1 in 20 Americans. Now it's 16 percent and rising. The aim of the Clinton plan is to drive it toward 100 percent. <p>"A managed-care operation is terrific if you're slightly sick, and awful if you're very sick," says Dr. Burton J. Lee III, George Bush's former White House physician and now medical director of the Cancer Treatment Center at Greenville Memorial Hospital in South Carolina. "Even in the Kaiser plan," he says, referring to Kaiser Permanente, which many consider the standard-setter in the relatively new managed-care industry, "you get up to a certain level of problem, and they're not going to have that many experts. If you've got something serious, you want to go to the best." (A Kaiser spokesperson says Kaiser has "some of the top-notch people in the country.")<p>I know Lee because in 1972, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York, he successfully treated me for Hodgkin's disease, a lymph cancer. He made me healthy again by prescribing radiotherapy, one of several treatment options available. <p>Not many years before I was treated, Hodgkin's was usually fatal. Even now, it kills many of those who are treated. Different doctors will provide a different mix of treatments, sometimes adding the more toxic chemotherapy to radiation and altering the amounts of each. Studies don't yet show why some people are cured and others die, but the factors involved are obvious. Some, like the makeup of the particular cancer cells and the genes and health of the patient, are for now uncontrollable. But other factors include the skill and judgment of the doctors on the treatment team and the equipment and experience of the treatment center. Until managed care came along, that was in the control of patients, who could pick their doctors and hospitals.<p>In 1972, my longtime family doctor in Indiana, suspecting but not knowing that I had Hodgkin's, sent me to Memorial before a biopsy was even done. My doctor--who was, in fact, my father--thought it was the best hospital in the country for Hodgkin's and that I ought to be diagnosed there. I saw Lee, head of the Memorial Hodgkin's team, merely by calling and requesting an appointment. The United States has long offered probably the world's best medical care for the greatest number of people. It saved my life. I got it with what was at the time ordinary insurance coverage.<p>If managed care had been around in 1972, I probably couldn't have done this. I might be dead from the disease or disabled from excessive treatment now.<p>The administration says 37 million Americans, roughly 15 percent of the population, are uninsured at any given time. Some are between jobs and health plans. Others have been cut loose by the insurance industry because they developed an expensive health condition--the very thing they thought they were insured against. Covering these uninsured people is a serious problem. Making medical coverage available to the uninsured and uninsurable is a task the country is properly ready to own up to. But changing the way the other 85 percent of the country gets its medical care, in most cases with success, is a drastic and unnecessary solution. That is what managed care does.<p>Dr. Joseph Simone, the physician in chief at Memorial Hospital today, is, like Burton Lee, angry about the restrictions placed on a patient's choice of doctor under managed care. "Just this week," Simone told me recently, "an orthopedic surgeon here saw three bone-cancer patients, rendered an opinion, suggested a line of treatment, and then was told the patients would not be treated here." The patients had been sent to Memorial for consultation by local managed-care organizations. Now, for treatment, they would be sent back to their community hospitals, where the managed-care contracts were. "I don't know about the community hospitals," Simone said, "and it may not sound good for me to say, 'We can do it better than those guys out there,' but that's just the way it is. We are experts in cancer care."<p>Most is the driving force behind the managed-care movement. Managed care is in large part the brainchild of big corporations that aren't in the health-care field but that pay much of America's health-care bill as a fringe benefit to their employees. In photographs of the Jackson Hole Group, one of the most important of the skull sessions at which the Clinton administration's plan was hammered out last winter, executives from General Electric and Pepsico work alongside executives from Prudential, Cigna, and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association and White House aides. <p>American corporations are worried that the rising expense of health insurance for their employees hampers their competitiveness in selling cars, food, computers, industrial hardware, and other products in international markets. They're right. Health-care expenditures are the fastest-growing component of employee compensation, going from 15 percent of corporate after-tax profits in 1960 to 48 percent in 1980 to 107 percent in 1991. That means American corporations now spend more on just the health care of their employees than they earn as profit, with the bulk of the expense incurred by the largest, most heavily unionized companies. Perhaps the best-known statistic in this area, because former Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca bellyaches about it in speeches, is that $1,100 of the price of every Chrysler car goes to pay employee health-insurance premiums. Not surprisingly, Chrysler is a big backer of managed care.<p>As are most large employers, for reasons made clear by some simple numbers: The traditional system of reimbursing employees for medical expenses cost companies $4,080 for each employee in 1992. Preferred-provider plans cost only $3,708. HMOs cost only $3,313. And that's just the beginning. Although the new minimum-care standards of the Clinton plan are still being tinkered with, suggestions to date require significantly less care than is offered by most major corporate plans, even HMO plans. When less care becomes a government standard, it's safe to assume less will be provided. The kicker is that under the administration's plan, corporations will be relieved of their obligations to fund the health care of many early retirees. A government program will take up the slack.<p>It's a serious problem that American corporate competitiveness is suffering because of the high cost of employee health care. But that doesn't mean that the simplest solution for the corporations--reducing the quality of the health care they pay for in order to lower the cost--is necessarily the best solution for the country.<p>Alternative plans are on the drawing board. Some of them look very good. But the managed-care idea is moving swiftly to co-opt the field, and doctors are already being coerced into joining the big group practices of managed care. "We're being kind of herded into these," says Dr. David Senechek, a veteran HIV/AIDS specialist in San Francisco. Similarly, he says, "Patients are being herded into insurance groups. What we're seeing on the horizon is a mass of conglomerating insurance companies who are tightening their control over the medical system to where they are basically going to dictate to patients and doctors and work in conjunction with the pharmaceutical companies to control medicine. We're kind of pawns in this massive corporate movement."<p>That is a severe assessment but an educated one. AIDS, Senechek's specialty, offers an excellent window into the downside of managed care. I learned this while researching my most recent book, Acceptable Risks, which tells how unorthodox medicine benefited a group of patients infected by HIV, the AIDS virus. Unfettered by managed care and guided by maverick doctors, these patients greatly extended their healthy lives by using promising treatments that weren't yet considered "proven" by the medical establishment. <p>Now that AIDS seems less a threat to most Americans, there's a danger of dismissing too quickly the powerful message that the AIDS epidemic carried for the health-care system. New diseases or conditions have always come along. Next time the spread may be traced to hot dogs or cellular telephones instead of unsafe sex and intravenous drug use. The radiation that was used in the 1950s to shrink swollen adenoids and measure shoe sizes now causes increases in leukemia and thyroid cancer. When it was less understood, AIDS was a valid metaphor for the great unknown health condition that none of us expects to suffer but that many of us invariably will, which is what health insurance is needed for.<p>A recent study discussed at the Ninth International Conference on AIDS in Berlin in June showed that the most significant characteristic shared by HIV patients who survive long-term is not any blood marker or infection pattern; rather, it is the patient's active participation in choosing his physicians and treatments. As Martin Delaney, founding director of Project Inform, a San Francisco AIDS treatment organization, puts it, the patients who live longest "are the ones who fired their doctors." (And found new ones, of course.)<p>Under managed competition, a patient's ability to pick doctors will be severely curtailed. New York AIDS specialist Dr. Howard Grossman says he's already "lost 10 or 15 patients this year, easy, who have had to change doctors because their employers went into HMOs or preferred-provider organizations. I don't know anybody who's had a positive experience. Lots of them come back to me at their own expense to look over their [test results] or just talk to me on the phone. When you look at the lists of doctors [in managed-care organizations], it's rare to find anybody with a big HIV practice. You certainly don't find anybody who's expert in the field, at least in New York."<p>In Los Angeles, Michael Gottlieb, one of the country's best-known AIDS doctors, says that when his patients are forced to change doctors they often come to him with a list of other doctors provided by a managed-care organization. "Sometimes you look at the book and there is literally no one you recognize with expertise," he says.<p>That is no accident, either, he adds. Since the object of managed care is to save money, and since everyone knows that HIV patients often need expensive care, the large health-care corporations don't want to be associated with HIV specialists. "Under managed care," says Gottlieb, "if a physician wanted to express an interest in HIV, it's unlikely he would be allowed to."<p>In fact, another California AIDS specialist says he lost so many patients to managed-care plans that he tried to join a managed-care group to reestablish his relationship with them. Yet despite a stellar career including high honors from Harvard Medical School, he was rejected by the group. (He is still trying to get into the group, this time with a lawyer's help, and asked not to be identified.)<p>This has implications for all of us. "The doctor-patient relationship is the critical piece in health care," says Dr. Sharon Lee, an AIDS specialist in Kansas City, Kansas. "It's not something people should be forced to leave on the whim of whatever insurance company the workplace chooses to go with. There are many instances where people go into an emergency room and, because they don't have an ongoing relationship with the physician, very important pieces of information are overlooked." <p>The result can be tragic. One AIDS patient of David Senechek's, after suffering dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, went to an HMO emergency room because it was paid for under his new group insurance plan. Four times he was diagnosed with a routine stomach disorder and sent home; the emergency-room doctors knew he was an AIDS patient but apparently weren't widely experienced with the disease. Finally, returning to Senechek's office in desperation and paying his own money, the patient was quickly diagnosed as having adrenal failure, an occasional AIDS complication that would soon have killed him. "It's completely treatable," says Dr. Senechek. "We just put him on replacement adrenal hormones; he gained his weight back and went back to work." <p>The measurable effectiveness of medical treatment is not the only issue. There is a value on the feelings of patients and their families in a crisis. When the Hodgkin's sword hung over me, my wife and family and friends, and even Jerry Bishop, the science reporter at the Wall Street Journal, where I worked, scanned popular and professional journals for the latest information. We knew I was stage A (without fever and other symptoms) rather than stage B (with symptoms), and that was good; but it wasn't clear whether I was stage II (only above the diaphragm) or stage III (spread below the diaphragm). That made a big difference in how much toxic medicine I would be given--medicine that might wreck me later in order to save me now. As test after test failed to resolve my staging, and eventually major surgery was needed to determine that I was in stage II, it meant a lot to us to know that the best authorities in the country would make the determination.<p>The ability to choose and trust one's doctor can have a profound effect on the quality of life, and on life itself, far beyond facing down the threat of fatal disease. Back when I was being treated for Hodgkin's, my first wife was battling the kidney disease that would later kill her. Her first attempt at pregnancy led to a term stillbirth and predictions by doctors that she would be childless, which left her despondent. But she researched the issue and found a nephrologist in Brooklyn experienced at kidney-problem motherhood. With a Manhattan obstetrician he often worked with, the nephrologist guided her through a pregnancy and induced premature labor at the right time. The result was my daughter. Under managed care, my first wife would not likely have been able to go to either of the doctors who produced our daughter, let alone both.<p>I recently called Jerome Porush, the nephrologist who helped my first wife. Porush is now chief of nephrology at Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn and a consultant for the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, or HIP, the largest HMO in the metropolitan area. I asked him about his experience with managed care. "HMOs stink," he said.<p>What makes him say that? The plan refers kidney patients to his team for consultations, he says. "We can only recommend lab work. If we want to use a hospital lab, the patient has to pay. So things don't get done, we don't get feedback, we don't see the patient in a year, and they didn't do anything in the interim. The blood pressure isn't monitored. The creatinine has gone from two to six, and they didn't do anything." A rise in creatinine shows that the kidneys aren't getting rid of poisonous substances that healthy kidneys eliminate. When the kidneys weaken, diet and medication can help slow the deterioration. When creatinine shoots up, the patient requires costly blood dialysis to live. "Sometimes patients don't come back to us at all, because HIP doesn't send them back," Porush says. <p>(A spokesman for HIP says the organization does follow through with patients and monitor blood pressure where warranted. HIP's medical director, Dr. Jesse Jampol, says that in many years of dealing with HIP, Porush has never complained to him about such problems, or "they would have been taken care of." The spokesman says HIP does its own lab work because it costs less. And he praises Porush's "high reputation," which he says is typical of the quality of doctors HIP works with. He says, however, that Brookdale Hospital, where Porush works, "is being phased out of the HIP system because we don't feel that the quality they provide is up to our standards.")<p>Porush is the kind of doctor who cares enough that 20 years later he remembers my first wife's case well. Like other superspecialists I talked to, he told of trying unsuccessfully to get on the rolls of an HMO recently in order to care for a patient in crisis. The patient had been referred to him by a physician who worked for the plan. But when Porush called the plan he was simply told that the rolls were closed. The patient reluctantly went to a nephrologist already on the plan.<p>Not only does managed care threaten patient access to the doctors they need most when their lives are on the line, but many doctors I talked to worry about the dampening effect such a system would have on medical research. Perhaps the most important such research takes place not in drug-company laboratories but in patient care, especially at major research hospitals.<p>When we hear on television about a daring operation that costs many hundreds of thousands of dollars, and we wonder whether a single life justifies such expense, we usually don't hear about the experimental value of the procedure. If it works, it will become more routine and the price may come down considerably. When my first wife received her two kidney transplants in the mid-1970s, she was assured that the surgery was safe and routine. Looking back on it now and at the failure rate of the operations then, I can see that her operations were really experimental. <p>But largely because of those expensive, experimental operations back then (our insurance company did argue with the surgeon and persuade him to drop his price), the procedure is now almost truly routine. The lawyer who just handled my house sale popped into the hospital for a kidney transplant while the papers were still being shuffled and was back in his office in a couple of weeks. <p>Existing managed-care institutions generally won't pay for experimental medicine--which is what worries the research-oriented doctors I talked to. Many don't want to talk on the record about it because their institutions are now lobbying in Washington for a way to maintain their research abilities if a new managed-care system is adopted.<p>But the treatment policies of most managed-care institutions are set by administrative boards that don't meet patients face to face. Business considerations, including the desirability of uniform handling of similarly diagnosed cases, often predominate over the professional interest that many physicians have in meeting the needs of individual patients and perfecting their craft.<p>And the truth is that most experimental medicine has nothing to do with the complicated surgery and the eye-popping bills of the most publicized cases. Rather, it involves experimental medicine with drugs that often don't cost much more than accepted drugs of limited effectiveness. Independent physicians will try them out when it seems appropriate and the standard therapy doesn't seem to be working. But managed-care concerns are designed to save money and work uniformly; if the Food and Drug Administration hasn't approved a treatment yet, that provides a good excuse not to pay for the cost of a drug and of a physician to monitor its use.<p>By many estimates, about half the prescription drugs sold in the United States today are used for what's known as "off-label" application. That means the doctor, knowing the drug and the patient, has prescribed the drug for a different use than the one the FDA has approved it for. FDA standards for drug approval are extremely rigorous: Typical drugs require ten years of testing, costing several hundred million dollars. Much of this testing isn't for safety, which can be established relatively quickly and cheaply; it is to prove, to a high scientific standard, that the drug works on a very specifically defined condition.<p>Once a drug passes that standard, doctors can use it to treat slightly different conditions, and this is how a great deal of medical progress occurs. A few doctors who use a drug successfully in a new way write a letter to a medical journal, it gets published, and word spreads. The White House says plenty of money will still be available for medical research if its new plan passes. But the doctors I spoke to, most of whom work on the advance edge of medicine, fear that the cost-cutting, minimal-treatment orientation of managed-care institutions will pose a barrier to the everyday experimentation through which medical science advances. <p>Here, too, the beginning of the AIDS epidemic offers a clear glimpse into how the system works successfully now and how managed care could obstruct it. For most of the 1980s the medical establishment--the big teaching hospitals, the big drug companies, and the FDA--offered AIDS patients nothing but hopelessness. By their standards, no treatment had proved itself beneficial. Patients and their families, however, did research on their own. They came up with a stream of promising remedies, often medicines sold abroad but not approved here. Underground networks sprang up to smuggle in these drugs from Mexico, Europe, and China. <p>Some of the drugs were later shown in FDA-approved clinical trials in the U.S. and abroad to slow the progress of the AIDS virus and significantly extend the good health of patients who took them. Some effectively stopped various illnesses that attack HIV-infected people and are now approved by the FDA for use against these illnesses.<p>Other drugs, of course, were worthless--and, worse yet, dangerous. To halt toxic side effects and measure the benefits, patients needed the supervision of doctors. Most doctors weren't experienced in AIDS and knew nothing of these drugs. But, as with most diseases, certain doctors, because of the nature or location of their practice, encountered the disease unusually often. <p>And as with most diseases, some doctors saw a challenge. Those who were so inclined acquainted themselves with various under-the-table remedies (most of which weren't very expensive) and monitored the patients who took them. The office visits, blood work, and other tests were covered by patients' insurance even though the experimental drugs weren't. As word spread, these doctors became magnets for new patients with HIV. If a patient was uninsured, it was not uncommon for a doctor to waive or reduce the fee. If insurance was there and it became necessary, such a cooperative doctor could admit a patient to the hospital where he or she practiced, sometimes continuing the unorthodox therapy there. Every one of these doctors, of course, was an independent practitioner.<p>Though the FDA didn't approve the drugs for sale, neither did it interfere with what the doctors were doing. Under the law and FDA regulations, doctors may treat patients in their offices as doctor and patient see fit, so long as the doctor doesn't sell unapproved drugs or engage in practices considered blatantly dangerous. Privately, many FDA and other government officials expressed thanks for what these doctors were doing--providing medical and psychological benefit where the official system offered none.<p>Under managed competition, however, such doctors would mostly be driven out of business. The day of the pioneer physician, offering patients the option to fight back with specialized information against a disease most doctors are powerless to challenge, would be over.<p>The Clinton Administration says there will be freedom of choice under its plan. By that, it means that an individual will be able to choose which patient group he or she joins, and the patient group (or employer) can choose which provider company it signs up with. One trouble with these choices is that if, say, your allergist is in one group, your spouse's gynecologist or urologist is in another, and the only dentist your child will sit still for is in a third, two of these three trusted doctors will have to go. Still more important, however, is that the individual or his employer must make the choice before illness strikes, after which there would be little choice at all. Choosing a provider company will be quite a commitment. When you're well, managed care may seem like a life preserver. But when you suddenly face AIDS, kidney failure, or another life-threatening illness, it can turn out to be a cinder block chained to your ankle.<p>Would you be free to go see the independent doctor of your choice if you were willing to pay the bills on your own? Legally, yes, if you were rich enough. Problem is, they probably won't be there. Doctors, no matter how independent of mind, will face enormous pressure to join a group, as has happened already to some of the doctors mentioned above.<p> Medicine is not a mere craft, subject to procedures taught from a manual. Patients, even those infected by the same virus, bring radically different genes and psychological dispositions to the examining room. To tell doctors that they themselves are to adopt identical personalities and follow uniform recipes set by an administrative board is to discard a fundamental of good medicine. <p>Two years after my successful treatment for Hodgkin's disease, I came down with fever and other Hodgkin's-like symptoms and had a marginal lymphangiogram, a test for swelling of the lymph nodes. Burton Lee, head of the Memorial Hodgkin's team, sized up all the evidence and concluded I'd had a probable relapse. He suggested a course of chemotherapy. My Indiana physician, my father, suggested second opinions, particularly because an antibiotic had cleared up the fever and other symptoms. I consulted experts he located at two other renowned cancer centers, Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford. Scrutinizing my case, those doctors advised standing pat and avoiding the life-shortening effects of chemotherapy unless further regression proved I needed it. I took that advice. It was a close call, and either way was a gamble. As it turned out, I won, but I respect each of the doctors who weighed that decision. <p>Just as a personal physician can come up with an occasional wrong answer, managed-care organizations can come up with many right ones. Philip Madvig, physician in chief at Kaiser in San Francisco, is proud that his hospitals have the fewest deaths of any hospital group in California both among newborns and among open-heart-surgery patients. "There is absolutely no question in my mind that we are capable of and do provide the highest-quality medical care within our organization," he says. <p>Others caution that Kaiser is a dangerous example because its relatively long record of care under the old environment isn't being matched by other organizations in the new environment. Madvig doesn't really dispute this. "There are many organizations where you are told by bureaucrats you need to justify that test or you need to justify that admission to the hospital," he says. "That is not the case within our organization." He also says he disagrees with other managed-care organizations that allow nonmedical officials to set medical policy, which he says also isn't the case with Kaiser. <p>Madvig says organizations like Kaiser improve on traditional medicine because they make sure that members' money is spent cost-effectively so as to keep rates down. That means keeping a check on what treatments get administered. But should a patient be irrevocably subject to one board that decides which treatments get administered, even if the board is made up of medical personnel? That question is easier to answer in the abstract than it is in the case of oneself or one's child.<p>What I have seen, both personally and professionally as a journalist, is overwhelming evidence that rule-book medicine set by administrators costs lives. It would have cost my daughter hers and many of the patients I wrote about in my book theirs and probably would have cost me mine. What's that worth? The taxes I've paid since 1972 have dwarfed that old hospital bill, big as it seemed then, and through her volunteer work my daughter may already have paid back what was invested in her, with the prime of her life still to come. And what is the value of love, joy, and feeling secure?<p>Americans do need protection against the growing power of insurance companies to cut off benefits when confronted with illness. One thing that helps the companies get away with this is the growing anachronism of tying one's medical insurance to one's place of employment. We now lose or change jobs much more often than the previous generation of Americans did. Each time we do, or our employers decide to switch insurance plans, companies that insured against an illness are allowed to escape its continuing costs. And new companies are allowed to exclude it from coverage. <p>But a law could require insurers to live up to their contracts and continue to pay the costs of illnesses they have insured against, regardless of where the patient chooses to work. Fixing this problem does not require dismantling the private-practice medical system that many patients, and former and future patients, would like to have around, just in case their lives depend on it. <p>Jonathan Kwitny's most recent book is Acceptable Risks (Simon & Schuster,  1992). He is working on a book about  Pope John Paul II.<p><p>

Another reason to hate the new tax bill: It slams an already sickly Social Security<p>By Robert N. Veres<p>In its zeal to lessen the budget crisis, Congress has quietly broken two longstanding covenants with American taxpayers. Under the new tax law, a growing number of people who receive Social Security benefits will be taxed twice on the income they receive. And thanks to government-mandated increases in the amounts that employees must contribute to Social Security today--what you see in your paycheck as Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes--future returns on those contributions will drop steadily and continue to decline well into the next century. <p>Lawmakers are justifying their new tax tyranny this way: They're only taking away tax benefits from people who don't need them in the first place.<p>So far, nobody seems too worried about these changes. Many taxpayers are likely to shrug their shoulders in indifference. Isn't Social Security a joke anyway? "Most people don't understand the numbers," says Barbara Raasch, a partner and director of financial counseling in the Dallas office of accounting firm Ernst & Young, "so there won't be much of a protest."<p>Social Security is no joke to millions of current retirees, who have a pretty good deal going. Consider this: A taxpayer who started working in 1944 and made the maximum contributions to Social Security every year before retiring in 1992 would have put a total of $36,881 into the Social Security system. During those 49 years, the taxpayer's employer would have been matching his contributions dollar for dollar, as required by law, so the worker's real "account" with Social Security would have amassed a $73,762 stake. Today, our 66-year-old retiree gets monthly checks equaling $13,056 a year, paid out for the rest of his life, after being periodically adjusted for inflation.<p>So what's the return on his "investment" in Social Security? Assuming that he lives to age 80, and that the benefits go up 3 percent a year to keep pace with inflation, he's made roughly 6.5 percent a year. Not very close to the 10.3 percent that stocks have earned over the same period, but better than the historical return on Treasury bonds. In fact, it's surprisingly comparable to what private insurance companies have offered on retirement annuities in recent years.<p>But while Social Security is a pretty good deal for today's retired population, it's much less of a good deal for tomorrow's. Why? To keep Social Security financially afloat, Congress keeps raising the amount that working people have to kick in. From 1937 to 1949, FICA taxes were only 1 percent of the first $3,000 (a $30 maximum). As late as 1965, the maximum paid in taxes was only $174 a year. But since 1973, FICA taxes have been rising annually, sometimes as much as 29.3 percent in one year. That's pushed up the maximum contribution to $5,528.70 this year, and the end is nowhere in sight.<p>All this means that although the benefits Social Security pays out are guaranteed to keep pace with inflation, the contributions workers pay in have gone up much faster. And that means the return on our "investment" is getting lower every year.<p>A taxpayer born in 1946 who retires in 2011--the year he gets full benefits--would have contributed $141,213. Assuming he lives to age 80, his benefits will represent a return of about 1.78 percent a year. This rate is so lamentably low that no insurance company would dare offer it on the open market. And the rate of return goes from lamentable to worse for people retiring in later years. Folks retiring in 2023 won't even get all of their own money back.<p>Now along comes Congress and its second bit of taxation tyranny to sour the present setup and worsen the future's. The trick involves taxing retirees on the money they put into the system when it's paid back out to them. <p>About 25 percent of today's retirees' $13,000 annual benefits consists of their own money returning to them. The other 75 percent is the interest their money earned. Since the interest has never been taxed, it seems fair to tax it as income when people finally receive it. <p>Under the old system, at most 50 percent of a retiree's benefits were taxed. Fair enough. But under the new tax law, a stunning 85 percent is taxed. As a result, upper-income taxpayers will be taxed twice on about 10 percent of their Social Security income.<p>This double taxation will be much worse for future retirees than it is today. That's because employee contributions are increasing much faster than the inflation-indexed benefits that are paid out. Therefore, an increasingly large percentage of the benefits paid to retirees in the future will be their own money returning to them. <p>Example: For people born in 1946 who retire in 2012, 40 percent of their monthly checks will be their own money coming back to them. For those born in 1957, retiring in 2023, it will be more than 50 percent. Under the new tax law, these people will pay double taxes on 25 percent and 35 percent of their "benefits," respectively.<p>What to do about this? Here's a suggestion: Why not let taxpayers put their FICA contributions into an annuity or into an IRA or a company-sponsored 401(K) plan?They'd make a lot more money that way. But Washington doesn't appear interested in reducing tax revenues.<p>Once again, the message to taxpayers is this: If you're not going to retire for another ten years or more, don't count on getting anything of value out of Social Security. Think of Social Security as an inheritance: a pleasant surprise if you get it, no surprise if you don't.

The new IRS is shrewder, sharper, and a little bit scarier than ever before<p>By Joseph B. Darby III<p>Tanned, rested and ready.That's what the Internal Revenue Service is today. No longer the butt of bumbler jokes or the focus of congressional wrath for its ineptitude, the IRS has entered the age of efficiency in total quality management. <p>Do we really want the best-run agency in the federal government to be--gulp--the IRS? You have to think that most taxpayers would prefer inefficiency to reign at the agency charged with collecting taxes. But these days anyone asking themselves "How will they catch me?" had better think twice.<p>The IRS is not yet the well-oiled enforcement machine that it hopes to be. For example, the Service still has difficulty communicating with itself. One former commissioner, who requested anonymity, acknowledges that, even today, if an IRS agent wants a copy of a past return for an audit, he has to wait for a response from the IRS Service Center, just like a taxpayer would. "And that," says the former commissioner, "is assuming the service center can even find a copy of it." <p>Slowly, though, the IRS is becoming more efficient, particularly in the way it uses the reams of taxpayer information it has in its files. For example, the Service is much better these days at cross-checking W-2 forms and 1099s against individual tax returns, a simple but effective test of the accuracy of tax returns. The IRS is also getting better at using computers to screen tax returns, scanning them for characteristics that might flag a cheater. Thanks to this program, the IRS now collects additional taxes on 80 percent of the returns it audits. <p>Another IRS change: A modification in the 1040 asking taxpayers to supply Social Security numbers for each dependent claimed. As if by magic, 7 million dependents disappeared from tax returns the year this change was made. <p>Many taxpayers are finding out--the hard way--how much more efficient the IRS has become. Owners of cash businesses, who can hide income more easily than wage earners, often find themselves targeted. When auditing coin-operated car washes, for example, IRS agents have been known to pull several years' worth of water bills and compare water usage with reported income. If the water consumption doesn't add up, penalties can flow.<p>Restaurant owners are also feeling the IRS's heat. Agents today routinely check inventory and food orders against reported income and interrogate employees. In one case, an IRS agent suspected that the proprietor of a pizza shop was padding deductions for pizza dough, tomato sauce, and cheese. The agent simply did not believe that the pizza tasted as expensive as its ingredients cost. How did he prove it? He bought a pizza and had it tested in a laboratory to determine the amount and the quality of the ingredients used.<p>The new IRS thinks nothing of checking the veracity of a taxpayer's returns against phone records or credit card bills. For instance, a taxpayer tried to claim his vacation home was a rental property, arguing that he had used it less than 10 percent of the year. The IRS obtained the telephone records for the residence and found that phone calls had been placed from the home on approximately 150 days out of the year and that almost all of those calls could be traced to family members or friends of the taxpayer. The IRS also found that the taxpayer had used his Visa and Mastercard to charge meals at restaurants near the vacation home throughout the year. Gotcha!<p>The IRS also loves to look over your shoulder when you're applying for car loans, credit cards, and mortgages. Taxpayers usually fill out these applications quickly, and the Service has found that even a conscientious taxpayer will frequently show a different income number on a loan application--when a larger income is advantageous--than he will on his tax returns. Lesson here:Be consistent.<p>Taxpayers aren't the only targets in IRS crosshairs. Rogue tax preparers, when identified and prosecuted, give the IRS a big bang for its enforcement buck. In one case of particularly profitable sleuthing, agents caught a tax preparer who was working on a commission basis. Because his fee consisted of a percentage of the refund owed the client, he had an incentive to be aggressive in his accounting. Although the IRS did not prosecute the clients criminally in this case, it did collect the tax, interest, and penalties owed by each. Clients of other aggressive tax preparers may not be so fortunate.<p>Another common method of catching tax offenders is working from tips. The IRS offers rewards, depending on the value of the lead. Information resulting in a recovery can be worth 10 percent of the first $75,000 recovered, 5 percent of the next $25,000, and 1 percent of any additional recovery. Last year the IRS recovered almost $84 million this way, at a cost of $1.7 million in rewards. But even without rewards, people are often willing to turn in others for a variety of reasons, including jealousy and revenge. <p>More than one case has been generated by a tip from a secretary or a disgruntled employee. Customers, neighbors, and friends have been known to take action when another taxpayer seems not to have been paying his share. One IRS staffer recalls a bookkeeper who turned in a boss who was keeping two sets of books. <p>Paying your taxes needn't be frightening. There are plenty of situations where the law is gray, and it is permissible, and even appropriate, for taxpayers to take an aggressive reporting position. But if you find yourself asking, "How will they catch me?" you're better off to just pay the tax.<p>

Will politicians of the future actually know something about managing money? Bret Schundler made millions on Wall Street. Now he's mayor of one of America's most beleaguered cities. <p>By Suzanne Costas<p>It is a picture-perfect morning on the banks of the Hudson River, a tableau of civic hope and pride__blue sky, no clouds, just a couple of days shy of the Fourth of July, the Statue of Liberty off in the middle distance. The audience is studded with police cadets and firemen in dress uniforms. Flags fly, and at the center of it all an earnest young man stands at a podium and talks about his plans for changing society.<p>The only thing wrong with this picture is what lies beyond it. Past the Boy Scouts and the children's choir is Jersey City, New Jersey, a blighted metropolis of 230,000 just across the river from the gleaming towers of Wall Street. Were one cataloging the social ills that plague America, Jersey City might be a good place to start. Were one a 34-year-old Harvard graduate with heavy Republican connections, burning political ambitions, and Ken-doll looks, Jersey City would be a good place to run away from.<p>And yet here is Bret Schundler, just starting what many think may be a long political career, the first GOP mayor of Jersey City since the Democratic machine first gained a foothold 75 years ago, addressing a jubilant inaugural crowd. No, it's not an exalted office, but this is, after all, an age of symbols, and Schundler is as compelling a symbol for "change" as anyone out there in the political firmament. The editorial page of the Wall Street Journal has all but predicted that one day he'll be president. (Then again, one of the paper's editorial writers, John Fund, lives in Jersey City and is a good friend of Schundler's.) Schundler is a millionaire Republican who renounces greed, a deeply religious man with an expansive social vision, a conservative intellectual trying to reach across class, racial, and party bounds. But most significantly, perhaps, he is a politician who understands finance. And that is something Jersey City's poor, largely minority voters responded to: The centerpiece of Schundler's campaign was an innovative plan to lower property taxes by bundling liens and selling them to institutional investors. <p>Accordingly, bigfoot pols from across the political spectrum stand behind Schundler on the podium on this day, hoping to soak up a little of the rookie glow. Former HUD chief and perpetual conservative-in-waiting Jack Kemp gets things going with an effusive keynote address. Both New Jersey's unapologetically liberal Democratic governor, Jim Florio, and Christine Todd Whitman, Florio's Republican opponent this fall, face each other on opposite sides of the podium. <p>"History is being made here," Schundler begins, with the ingrained earnestness of a strict Presbyterian who was "evangelicalized," as a teenager. "In this 'city of nations,' we have united our people across lines of ethnicity, class, and religion, and even across the great divide of party"<p>The sun is brutal. <p>"People don't dream partisan dreams, they dream human dreams. You are tired of crime and drugs ruling the streets. Your spirits are weighed down by litter and graffiti. You've had enough of loud radios and car horns piercing the night<p>"You want jobs, not welfare. You believe that those who receive governmental assistance should be required to work in exchange for support" <p>People are holding their programs over their heads. <p>"Entitlement thinking led our cultural elites to expound on the Age of Aquarius, sanctioning the sexual revolution and experimentation with drugs, while de-emphasizing respect for law and established values How can we determine what our basic values should be? The wise psychologist Abraham Maslow said if you want to know what leads to self-actualization, study self-actualized people."<p>By the time eight clergymen representing different faiths have blessed Jersey City and its mayor, the audience, which has dwindled to a hardy, wilting few, can barely stand through a chorus of "God Bless America." As people run for their air-conditioned cars, Schundler, who has kept his jacket on, smiles and waves. <p>
When Bret Schundler moved to Jersey City eight years ago, he wasn't thinking in terms of saving the city; he wasn't even a Republican yet. After graduating from Harvard in 1981, he considered going into the ministry but instead applied his idealism to a more perishable mission, bouncing around the country as a campaign coordinator for Gary Hart's first presidential run. Along the way, he met his future wife, Lynn Greenfield, a law student from Seton Hall University, and by the time the campaign fizzled, he was $8,000 in debt. <p>So Schundler took a job in the municipal finance department at Salomon Brothers and moved to Jersey City, where the cost of living was low and the commute to Wall Street was easy. Salomon, the epicenter of Wall Street greed, was a long way from the seminary. But rather than acknowledge any of the apparent contradictions, Schundler spits out a five-point rationalization for Wall Street. "First, I needed money. Second, I wanted to be in a business where I needed to know what was going on in the world. Third, I wanted to use my salesmanship, a skill I'd learned working for the Hart campaign. Fourth, I wanted to work with sharp people. Fifth, I wanted an entrepreneurial environment."<p>Rudeness was a fact of life at Salomon, but Schundler didn't mind. In fact, he was kind of turned on by the atmosphere. It may have been brutal, but it was egalitarian. "I thought it was the quintessential American firm," Schundler says. "It didn't matter if anyone liked you or what your surface characteristics were. What mattered was your value to the bottom line." <p>By 1987, Schundler was bored with the fixed-income business and decided to move on to something a little sexier. He took a job at C.J. Lawrence, an economic-research firm. As the new kid, he was stuck with the dregs accounts. His territory was New England, but it didn't include Boston.<p>"I can't think of one decent account the poor guy covered the whole time he was here," says Ed Sonderling, one of Schundler's former colleagues at Lawrence. <p>The trading day ended at 4 p.m., and most traders were out the door by 5:00. "Nine times out of ten, Bret was still at his desk long after the other salesmen went home," recalls an equity analyst who worked with Schundler. Under his own initiative, Schundler spent these long hours analyzing the savings and loan crisis. He saw that big money was to be made cleaning up the debacle by investing in the thrift disaster's biggest beneficiary, the Federal National Mortgage Association. He started buying Fannie Mae warrants after the '87 crash with an exercise price of $7 per share.<p>"I've never seen a guy who acted on his convictions like Bret did," says Sonderling. "He put every dime he had into Fannie Mae, and then he leveraged it. It was like putting 200 percent of your eggs in one basket."<p>His boss and colleagues thought he was nuts. Fannie Mae was a complicated company that few took time to understand, but Schundler had it all figured out. By 1989, it was one of the top-performing stocks on the Big Board. In February of 1991, when Schundler converted his warrants into stock worth $30 a share, he was $4 million richer.<p>"It was time for a change," Schundler says, picking up the story in the living room of his comfortable, though hardly opulent, brownstone in Jersey City's historic Van Vorst district. "As much as I liked my job, I felt it wasn't what I was called to do. I wanted the freedom to do something that didn't pay a lot of money. My goal was liberation." Even though it is early evening, Schundler's tie is still tightly knotted. Neither he nor his wife drink anything, though their guest is offered a solitary glass of apple juice.<p>Once he had enough money to live like he didn't have a lot, he took what amounted to a rich man's vow of poverty: he invested most of the money in stocks and mutual funds and put the rest in the bank. He spurned the traditional accoutrements of wealth__the palatial suburban home, golf on the weekends, the fancy car. "Our commercial culture requires all of that stuff, because that's how you sell things," he says, hardly the creed of the Reagan-Bush Republicans. <p>In the time that Schundler started amassing his fortune, he also started leaning to the right. He'd become involved with some neighborhood organizations soon after moving to Jersey City and in 1988 helped co-found the Coalition for Fair Taxation, a group that opposed a tax re-evaluation done under then-mayor Anthony Cucci, a Democrat. After Michael Dukakis won the Democratic nomination in 1988, Schundler switched parties. The Democrats, he reasoned, had entered into an unholy alliance with Hollywood, Hyannis, and the unions. The GOP was the party looking out for "the bourgeois middle class."<p>In 1989 Schundler left C.J. Lawrence, and he and Lynn embarked on a round-the-world trip. It was not a vacation; it was more like an exploratory mission. "He went to places most people don't go to, China, Bangladesh," recalls Jack Murphy, a vice- president of sales at C.J. Lawrence. "I think he found God on the trip."<p>Not surprisingly for a man who experienced his religious conversion when he was hardly out of puberty, there were no dramatic Saul-on-the-road-to-Damascus moments. To hear him talk about it, he could have spent those ten months staying up late poring over back issues of the Economist. "I'd go to a place like Thailand," Schundler says. "Not very industrialized until recently, you know, though they do allow foreign investment. There is tremendous economic development there. But in India, which has a tremendous educational system, the economy is hurting due to protectionism. That led me to believe that policies that don't allow people to do things are destructive. Why is Jersey City so poor? Because the Democratic machine didn't bequeath prosperity." <p>By the time Schundler returned from the trip he had made up his mind: He would leave Wall Street and go into politics. In 1991, he mounted an unsuccessful bid for the New Jersey state senate, spending $150,000 in the process.<p>At his old firm, no one was surprised that their intense, opinionated colleague was seeking a broader platform. "We had a lot of political discussions," says Sonderling. "He'd weave these rather elaborate political theories and philosophies into almost any conversation. Most of us couldn't understand half of what he said. He's very persuasive, because he doesn't stop. You either end up agreeing with him or you faint."<p>
Bret Schundler's missionary zeal may have gotten him into politics, but he got to the Jersey City mayor's office through the back door. His predecessor, Gerald McCann, was convicted of bank fraud, mail fraud, and tax evasion and is now in jail. The reeling machine couldn't produce a credible candidate. Schundler snuck into office in a special election last November, one of two Republicans on a ballot crowded with 17 featureless Democrats. Six months later, in May, he handily won a four-year term against a weak, disorganized Democratic ticket. <p>About a week before the inaugural ceremonies, he is sitting behind the big desk in the mayor's office, ostensibly talking about his plans for Jersey City. But even a simple conversation with Schundler can turn into a rambling soliloquy. Here is a typical Schundler soundbite: "I think society is an anthropomorphized world, to use a Marxian term. It is something we have largely constructed. Using reductionist theory, there are some basic principles that drive everything else. Everything becomes epiphenomenal. We have gone astray in some severe ways in this country, and it is causing great suffering and pain. And even the most well-intentioned are making things worse, because they have fundamentally missed the boat with regard to the nature of human beings."<p>He is just warming up.<p>"The Democrats' fundamental thesis that the elimination of deprivation through entitlement programs would bring about the millennium was wrong. And the Republicans who refused to pay for anything failed to accept the fact that we are social beings. Do you know the story of the Buddha?" <p>Uh-oh.<p>"The Buddha was born the son of a wealthy king, and a seer told the king that your son will be the greatest political leader that ever lived, if you don't allow him to see sickness, suffering, and death. If he sees those things, he'll be moved by those things and become a great religious leader. The king tried to isolate his son from all those things. But the Buddha went walking one day and saw a sick person. Then one day he walked out and saw poverty. And one day he saw a dead person. He left the palace and became the Buddha."<p>Schundler is on auto-pilot, seemingly unaware that he is talking at, not with, someone. <p>"Ronald Reagan, I would argue, was a reaction to the Democratic thesis. His whole thesis was that government was bad; get rid of it. But there are people born ten yards behind the starting line."<p>Schundler wasn't one of them, which may help explain what has brought him to gritty Jersey City. In Victorian England they had a phrase for it: the white man's burden. "When I think about my upbringing, I think about my father talking about our being responsible to make the world a better place," he says "God gave me a heaven first, and now I owe him one. "<p>He was raised in the quiet suburb of Westfield, New Jersey, the youngest of nine children. His father operated a plant nursery, now run by five of his siblings. His mother was a refugee from Nazi Germany. It was a very serious household. At dinner the family might discuss such topics as the Khmer Rouge's routing of the Cambodian middle class. As a teenager, while his peers ran around drinking beer and smoking pot, he kept to the straight and narrow. "My father always challenged us," he says. "'What should you do to make the street clean? What should we do to provide for the poor?' He suggested very strongly that it was our responsibility to accept these challenges. When I was at Harvard, I remember feeling that that was a burden. But I couldn't shake the fact that these problems were my responsibility. I almost wished that I didn't have a father who brought me up with that sense of responsibility, because it was so burdensome."<p>
Understandably, Schundler's intimacy with philosophy, scripture, Buddhism, and finance made Jersey City's Democratic opposition nervous. During the campaign the Democrats railed against Schundler's Harvard education, but that only made them look like they thought Jersey City deserved less. They attacked his financial background, characterizing the plan to bundle tax liens as a "scheme" cooked up by a "Wall Street shark." They brought Jesse Jackson to town so he could imply that Schundler was a racist because his family's nursery sells a fertilizer imported from South Africa. <p>For his part, Schundler just charged ahead and did what he does best: talk. During the campaign he pushed school vouchers and property-tax cuts. He noted that although the city spends $9,200 on each pupil, a majority do not graduate, and he vowed to take on the teachers' union. He said he'd try to reduce taxes by 33 percent over his four-year term.<p>The linchpin of Schundler's economic plan was the tax lien sale. The scheme was actually quite simple. More than 20 percent of the city's property owners didn't bother to pay their taxes, and with a $40 million budget deficit, Jersey City lacked the wherewithal to go after these tax cheats. Crediting his experience at Salomon Brothers, Schundler proposed that the city deal with these IOU's the same way Wall Street would: sell them. <p>He suggested bundling the liens on the most attractive properties and peddling them at a discount to an institutional investor as a collateralized security. The investor, he reasoned, would throw more resources toward a tax collection effort than the city could afford to. The city would make 57 cents on the dollar, a $25.5 million windfall to its $290 million budget.<p>There was only one problem with the plan. It was illegal to collect tax liens for less than 100 percent of their cash value. So Schundler used his first six months in office, the time between the special election in November and the real one in May, to get the law changed. It didn't hurt that the senate president, Donald DiFrancesco, was not only a Republican but was also a good friend of Schundler's; he had even employed Lynn Schundler in his law office.<p>The First Boston Corporation, initially the adviser to the city on the sale, was the sole bidder on the package of 2,900 liens attached to commercial, industrial, and residential properties. (Neither the company nor the mayor would characterize it as such, but essentially it was a backroom deal.) In July, a trust established by First Boston paid $25.5 million in cash and put up the remainder of the $45 million purchase price in the form of a promissory note. The city expects to begin receiving payment on the note between 1996 and 1998. Between now and then, it should receive net interest totaling $6 million.<p>Fred Terrell, managing director at First Boston, says the company is starting to get calls from other municipalities. Alas, things aren't likely to go as smoothly next time around. "The number of mayors who can talk about interest rates, the yield curve, and capital markets in this country is small," says Terrell. "You can count 'em on your hand. Bret talks the language of Wall Street." <p>
Does Schundler, a man with an uncanny knack for quitting while he's ahead, have ambitions beyond city hall? He won't exactly say yes, but that's not just because he's being sly and evasive, like most politicians. Rather, he seems incapable of giving a succinct, simple answer to any question. "I have more power today to change America than Bill Clinton," he says. "Bill Clinton can't effect school vouchers; that's not a federal issue. But it is more important for America than whatever he's doing with the deficit. If I can get school vouchers in Jersey City, it will change the face of American education and establish a paradigm for government which will change how we provide governmental services."<p>As Schundler continues his monologue, it becomes clear that his ambitions are more extravagant than school vouchers__or even the presidency. "The great core tenets of all religions," he says, "are: Affirm life in spite of circumstances and love your neighbor as yourself. If you create a society based on those premises what you're creating is a society where people feel fulfillment in the mutual well-being of one another. To the degree you focus on that you make progress. If I can make Jersey City into heaven, everything else is a layup."<p>Schundler's opponents in Jersey City, who seemed to treat him with a mixture of contempt and confusion before he became mayor, now speak of Schundler as if their chief fear is that he will lose interest in the plight of the city. After all, it would be easy to plant a few trees in the park, cut taxes modestly, blitz the city's budget deficit with a lot of fancy-sounding financial tricks, and then claim to have turned the city around. By this reasoning, Jersey City could be to Schundler what Arkansas was to Bill Clinton__an economic and political backwater where good intentions and policy wonking can create a modest success that is easily exaggerated.<p>People in Jersey City are already bracing for disappointment. "Being an urban mayor is the most difficult job in the country," says Paul Swibinski, president of Vision Media, a New Jersey public-relations and advertising firm specializing in campaign consulting. "It's a test that breaks a lot of good people. Now if he can deliver on his promises and make dramatic changes, then I wish him luck. But if he makes the mistake of running for higher office before the task at hand is done"<p>Take the controversy Schundler stepped into just the day before his inaugural ceremonies, testing last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision regarding prayer in school by offering a prayer during graduation ceremonies for Jersey City's Academic High School. He didn't let the school know of this plan, but he did notify the media in advance. "I don't believe I broke the law," he said a few days later. "The ACLU has been trying to bully people. They want zero religion expressed in the school. Well, children shouldn't be raised as house plants. Schools shouldn't teach religion, but they can expose children to different religions.<p>"You know, a lot of people believed what Martin Luther King was doing was wrong. But you know what the scripture says, 'Act upon what you believe.' "<p>Paul Swibinski sees it differently. "He projected himself into an issue that has almost nothing to do with Jersey City. I mean, is he running already?" <p>

 LOOK BEFORE LEAVING 
<p>
Don't be surprised by the rights that the new Family Leave Bill
doesn't give employees  
<p>
 By Virginia Applegarth  
<p>
 Scene 1: The obstetrician's office. Due date is oneweek away.
An expectant mother has planned to return to work full-time two
months after the baby is born. Now she has to make that plural;
her sonogram shows two babies, both underweight. On the way home,
she and her husband agree that they will each need to take a
two-month leave of absence, as they think they are entitled to
under the new Family Leave Bill. The next day, however, reality
hits: It turns out he has no right to any unpaid leave, and his
boss says the company can't spare him for more than a week, maybe
two, because production is behind schedule.   
<p>
 Scene 2: A managers' meeting to assign duties for a major new
project. An assistant appears at the door looking anxious, and
delivers the bad news: The father of one of the managers has
fallen and broken his hip. The hip must be surgically repaired,
and a long recuperation will follow. The manager is the only
relative close by. A leave of absence is quickly arranged, thanks
to the Family Leave Bill, and she instantly feels relieved. Then,
on the way to the hospital, financial reality hits: She will
have no salary for the next two months. After-tax cost at her
$120,000 a year salary: $12,000. Hidden cost: By the time she
gets back, she'll have been left out of the biggest project of
the year.   
<p><p>
<p>
Welcome to the reality of the family leave bill, which took effect
on August 5. Widely touted as a giant step forward for working
families, it's far from a panacea for people who have to take
time off. Employees who need a leave of absence had better figure
out their rights and their finances in advance, or they can be
in for some expensive and long-reaching surprises.  
<p>
 The Family Leave Bill presents employees with two basic problems.
First, although the bill has been portrayed as "universal," the
Clinton administration estimates that fewer than half of American
workers are covered by it. Indeed, 95 percent of American businesses
do not have to comply, although many offer some time off to their
employees during a family crisis or transition.  
<p>
 Second, employees who are covered by the bill still have to
pay for it. For an executive earning $100,000 a year, a 12-week
unpaid leave can cost as much as $16,800 after taxes. And, of
course, lost wages aren't the only costs; employees, especially
executives, can end up paying for a leave of absence for the
rest of their careers.   
<p>
 Studies quantifying these hidden costs have focused primarily
on women, because women more often leave work and come back.
According to one recent study, women who temporarily leave the
work force average a one-third drop in wages when they return,
and their pay never catches up with that of women who do not
interrupt their careers.  
<p>
 But it's not only a women's issue. According to Fran Rodgers,
founder of Work/Family Directions, a leading dependent-care consulting
firm in Boston, "A man's career is even more dead than a woman's
if he takes family leave or wants to back off a bit at work."
Rodgers's studies show that 50 percent of managers say they view
an employee who asks for flexible hours or family leave as someone
who is "not serious about their career." Even workers who take
time off to be with a seriously ill child or care for a dying
parent often return to find they can come back to the same job
title, but their power has been subtly reduced or anticipated
promotions don't materialize.   
<p>
 When a leave of absence is necessary in spite of the tangible
and intangible costs, it's important to know the law. Fortunately,
as laws go, the mechanics of the Family Leave Bill are relatively
straightforward. Every employer that has 50 or more employees
who work within a 75-mile radius must offer 12 weeks unpaid leave
each year to any employee going through adoption, birth, or care
of a seriously ill family member. During the leave of absence,
the company must continue health-care coverage, although the
employee must continue to pay his or her share, if any, of the
premium. When the employee returns, the same or a comparable
job must be waiting with no loss of seniority. To be eligible,
an employee must only have worked for the employer for at least
a year, and for at least 1,250 hours (25 hours a week) during
the previous 12 months.  
<p>
 Because of the media attention surrounding the Family Leave
Bill, most people are probably under the impression that they
are covered by it. They may not be. Employees may work for a
company that is large but has fewer than 50 employees working
within 75 miles of one another, or for a firm that formerly had
50 employees but just fired one person so it wouldn't have to
comply. (According to the Wall Street Journal, Senator Bob Dole
suggested this tactic for the 70-odd companies with exactly 50
employees in his home state of Kansas.)   
<p>
 And there are a host of other exceptions. A "key" employee,
defined by Congress as one who is among the highest 10 percent
of a company's wage earners and whose leaving would cause substantial
economic disruption to the company, can be denied leave. Teachers
aren't guaranteed immediate leave. And if both spouses work for
the same employer, their combined leave can be only 12 weeks,
unless a member of their immediate family is seriously ill, in
which case they each get up to the full 12 weeks.  
<p>
 And, of course, the people who do qualify for leave still have
to figure out how to finance the time off. For many people, finding
out that they qualify for leave time is like having a kid get
into Yale: It's great, but who's going to pay for it? Relying
on savings for the duration is difficult or impossible for most.
But there are ways that families can finance these leaves, both
indirectly and directly.  
<p>
 Indirect financing can be as basic as having the spouse with
the lower income take the leave. Another method is to arrange
a shorter full-time leave with additional part-time leave. A
little-publicized but creative way to finance a leave is to work
reduced hours for 12 weeks. This could mean working a few hours
during the day, two or three days a week, or whatever schedule
suits your needs. The period allowed depends on the reason for
the leave. If it's for birth or adoption, the total leave period
is 12 weeks, so an employee cannot stretch it to 24 weeks by
working two-and-a-half days a week. For medical emergencies,
however, the total time off allowed is 12 weeks, even if it stretches
over many months. Many employers are not aware of this difference.
Chances are, an employer will prefer to have someone in the office
part of each week rather than not at all for an extended period.<p>
<p>
 Employers can require employees to use up paid leave (accrued
vacations, personal days, sick days, and comp time) before starting
their unpaid leave, but most employees do this anyway, to help
with cash flow. Employees should be careful about documenting
overtime and other work for which they could get comp time, because
it will provide income if leave is needed.  
<p>
 When care of an aging parent is the reason for leave, it may
be possible for siblings who are not providing care to provide
a "substitute salary" to the one who is. This can also do wonders
to reduce resentment by the child actually providing the care.
Another option for financing family leave is to borrow from retirement
plans, such as 401(k)s. Plans vary, so employees should check
to make sure what they offer before taking leave. People can
also temporarily withdraw money from an IRA without penalty as
long as they repay it within 60 days. And if the reason for the
leave is important enough, it may even be worth taking money
from the retirement plans as an outright distribution and paying
the tax and penalty (10 percent).  
<p>
 Another financing technique families are using if they have
advance notice for a leave is to draw against a home equity line
of credit, although most advisors discourage this. People who
need to take this route should apply for the loan before they
take leave, if possible. At the same time, employees who are
planning to quit should be careful about taking family leave
just to extend medical insurance for a few more months. If an
employee quits after taking a leave, in most cases he or she
must repay the company for any premiums it paid.  
<p>
 For all its flaws, the Family Leave Bill is a step forward.
But as Fran Rodgers says, we need to dispense with the political
rhetoric and move on to the real issue of the '90s긍ork flexibility,
not "accommodation." Americans work an average of one month more
per year than they did 20 years ago, and families are paying
the price. Perhaps in the future more companies will join Xerox
Corporation, which recently announced a subsidy program that
offers employees up to $10,000 in additional income over the
course of their employment for family and personal expenses.
In the meantime, most families can protect themselves best by
coming up with a plan that allows them to finance "doing the
right thing" for themselves, their parents, siblings, and children.<p>
<p>

<p>
who isn't covered?  
<p>
 The Family Leave Bill applies to everybody except:  
<p>
 Teachers  
<p>
 Employees who work for companies that employ fewer than 50 people<p>
<p>
 Employees who work for companies (no matter how large) that
employ fewer than 50 people within a 75 mile radius  
<p>
 People deemed "key" employees.

					<font size=4>
						By Scott Burns<p>
It's been an amazing run. Since October 11, 1990, the Dow Jones Industrials have climbed from 2365 to the 6400 level. Too bad so few 401(k) participants went along for the ride.<p>
For years, employee-benefits consultants have preached that more people should participate in 401(k) plans, that participants should save more, and that they should take more risk to get a higher return. According to an annual study by Foster Higgins, a benefits-consulting firm, employees directed only 40 percent of plan assets into equities in 1995. That's up from 31 percent in 1993, but it's still far less of a commitment to stocks than investors need to replace current income at retirement.<p>
To many investors, the market's current lofty level is just one more reason to delay putting their 401(k) money into stocks. It's too late and too risky to start investing in the stock market now, they think; new players will be greeted with a crash.<p>
So let's ask a rude question: Should you be afraid of a crash?<p>
Absolutely not -- provided that you are investing in stocks through a typical 401(k) plan. The employer's matching contribution to the average 401(k) works to protect investors from real losses even during a major market decline.<p>
Consider how you would have fared in two of the worst market declines in history if you had been investing in stocks through a 401(k) plan.<p>
Suppose it's December 31, 1930, and you, poor soul, are trying to make an investment decision: You can put $1,000 of pre-tax income into stocks through an investment plan in which your employer matches your contribution dollar for dollar. Or you can put the after-tax equivalent -- $720 -- in crisp new bills into a vault.<p>
Unlike everyone else alive in 1930, you know that 1931 will turn out to be the worst year in the history of the stock market. Prices will plummet 43.3 percent.<p>
What do you do? Even knowing what you know, you put your money in the plan. You do this convinced that even as others jump from high places your account will do better than plain cash. Indeed, despite the crash you will earn more than the average historic pre-tax return on common stocks.<p>
Why? Because of the massive buffer provided by tax dollars and your employer's contribution. During the year, your $1,000 -- $720 of after-tax savings plus $280 in deferred taxes -- and your employer's $1,000 contribution decline in value to a miserable $1,134. If you closed the account (to, say, take up your new career selling apples) and paid taxes at 28 percent, you would be left with just $816. <p>
But that's still a profit. Since you invested just $720 of real after-tax income, your books actually show a gain of $96, a 13 percent return on the only money that was really yours, the after-tax $720. Because you are in a 401(k), your personal return during the worst year in market history was better than what most investors reap in an average year.<p>
While the example is extreme, what you've just seen is the mathematics behind the current Great No-Fear Market. It's not that we all believe that stocks are better than bonds and that bonds are better than cash, as countless charts tell us. It's this buffer thing. Now that 401(k) plans have superseded defined-benefit pension plans to become the investment vehicle of choice for working Americans, the equity market is much less risky.<p>
The math works even when the employer's contribution is reduced to 50 percent -- the most common match, according to Buck Consultants, a New York됵ased employee-benefits consulting firm. Let's say you had the choice of putting cash into a vault before the dismal year of 1974 or investing in stocks through a 401(k) plan with a 50 percent employer match. An investor in stocks would have seen a nest egg of $1,500 -- $720 of his own money, $280 of deferred taxes, and $500 of employer match -- decline to $1,103 before taxes. If you cashed out and paid 28 percent in taxes, the account's value would have fallen to $794 -- still better than simply holding $720 in cash. Your return would have been 10.3 percent -- an after-tax return similar to the long-term pre-tax return on common stocks.<p>
With just a 50 percent employer match, an investor would have to experience a withering 33 percent market decline before he or she would be better off socking away after-tax income as cash than investing in equities through a 401(k). <p>
How many times has the market declined 33 percent or more? Twice in 70 years, according to data from Ibbotson Associates in Chicago: 43.3 percent in 1931 and 35 percent in 1937. Every other decline was less, usually a lot less. The worst performance in the postwar period is the 26.5 percent drop of 1974.<p>
Still worried? Let's see what happens if we get one of those infrequent long periods of sagging prices -- the kind of market that scores the soul and that can keep an investor out of equities for decades. According to Ibbotson Associates, the worst long-term periods in history all began in the late 1920s: In the 5 years from 1928 to 1932, large stocks lost ground at an annual rate of 12.47 percent; in the 10 years from 1929 to 1938, they lost 0.89 percent a year; in the 15 years from 1929 to 1943, they returned only 0.64 percent a year.<p>
If we were about to start one of those periods today, would you be better off stuffing your cash into a mattress?<p>
Again, the answer is no. As long as you've got the money you would have paid in taxes and your employer's 50 percent match, the best choice is to push ahead in stocks. Suppose the next ten years duplicates the misery of 1929 to 1938. On after-tax contributions of $7,200, your after-tax net for the entire period would accumulate to $10,331. Your effective return would be 7.8 percent a year.<p>
During the same historical ten-year period, the return on T-bills was only 1 percent, pre-tax. The return on intermediate government bonds was 4.7 percent pre-tax and 3.38 percent after-tax.<p>
What happens if disaster doesn't strike and the market just matches its long-term average performance? An investor's annual after-tax contribution of $720 a year will grow to $404,209 over 40 years at a return of 10.5 percent, or 14 times the total investment of $28,800. The same money invested in intermediate government bonds at 5.3 percent will grow only to $96,511. Note that this doesn't count the additional accumulations from the $280 annual deferred-tax contribution or the $500 annual employer's match.<p>
Can a 401(k) investor carry his enthusiasm for equities too far? Certainly. The buffer provided by employer contributions isn't an excuse for blindly investing in bad equities or in equity funds that underperform the market even in good years. (The <a name="FUND:SOCNX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SOCNX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Steadman Technology Growth Fund</b></a>, for example, has managed to lose a little more than 22 percent a year every year for the past five years.) Nor will this buffer protect the investor who has built up a big position in cash or bonds inside a 401(k) and now wants to invest that money in equities. That transition still needs to be carried out with attention to the riskiness of the equity markets at the moment.<p>
Just remember that for your regular contributions to a 401(k) plan it's best to stop worrying about the market.<p>

						Eight acclaimed mutual-fund managers tell Worth readers about their current favorite stocks. Assume that the manager has bought the stock for his fund at a price lower than the one mentioned here -- the maximum at which he considers it attractive. The manager also may have sold the stock after October 25, the publishing deadline. The approaches of these managers are meant to illustrate a range of successful investing styles. Before readers buy stock, Worth recommends they conduct their own due diligence.<p>
Preston Athey
T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value
Invests in value stocks with market capitalizations under $250 million.
<a name="NASD:RAUT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14566"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Republic Automotive Parts</b></a>  (NASD: RAUT)  Up to $22
Republic Automotive Parts (Brentwood, Tennessee) distributes replacement auto parts and accessories such as spark plugs and windshield wipers through its 16 distribution centers and 94 stores located in 16 states. Through expansion and acquisitions, Republic has recently moved into automotive crash parts -- such vital items as bumpers, fenders, and taillights. Republic is one of only two publicly traded companies in the crash-parts industry, and this move should increase Republic's corporate growth rate and raise its return on equity into the low teens. The stock is still a bargain at 1.3 times book value and 11 times my 1997 earnings estimate of $1.65 a share. <p>
James P. Craig
<A HREF="http://www.janusfunds.com">Janus Fund</A>
Invests primarily in large growth companies with the idea of preserving capital over the long term.
<a name="NYSE:HTG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Heritage Media</b></a>  (NYSE: HTG)  Up to $17
Heritage Media (Dallas) is the national leader in what's called targeted marketing: in-store advertising and promotional services. The stock recently took a tumble because of news that a competitor will begin pushing in-store coupon machines. Even if Heritage should lose its share of the coupon market, the company's ownership of six network-affiliated television stations and 23 radio stations in major markets makes this stock highly attractive. Recently, Heritage announced the re-purchase of five million, or 14 percent, of its shares. I expect the stock to earn 65 cents a share in 1996, 95 cents a share in 1997, and $1.20 in 1998. My 12-month target for Heritage is $23.<p>
Shelby M. C. Davis
New York Venture Fund
Invests in large companies using a value-oriented style.
<a name="NYSE:MLM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41940"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Martin Marietta Materials</b></a>  (NYSE: MLM)  Up to $24
Martin Marietta Materials (Raleigh, North Carolina) is the second-biggest producer of materials called aggregates -- the sand, granite, crushed stone, and such used in large construction projects. Lockheed Martin has just spun off its 80 percent interest in Martin Marietta to Lockheed Martin shareholders in an exchange offer. Martin Marietta has little competition from imports -- these aggregates are too hard to move, literally. I expect the company to earn $1.60 a share in 1996 and $1.90 a share in 1997. The company has strong cash flow and a clean balance sheet, so investments in Martin Marietta should be rock solid. My target price for the stock is $30.<p>
Daniel B. Leonard
Invesco Strategic Portfolios Technology
Seeks growth stocks in technology and related fields.
<a name="NYSE:ECI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=48058"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Excel Communications</b></a>  (NYSE: ECI)  Up to $40
Excel Communications (Dallas) is the fourth-largest provider of domestic long-distance service and is growing faster than AT&T, MCI, or Sprint. The company, which went public last May, markets its service through an enormous pool of network marketers -- estimated at over 900,000 strong. Currently, 4.1 million subscribers use Excel's service. The company earned 37 cents a share for the third quarter of 1996, a 208 percent increase over  third-quarter earnings in 1995. Excel should earn $1.50 a share in 1996 and $2.05 in 1997. With its new pager services coming on the market and revenues on track to cross $1 billion this year, Excel is an attractive buy. <p>

WinsLoew Furniture (Pelham, Alabama) designs, manufactures, and sells casual furniture for the residential and institutional markets. The company was formed at the end of 1994 as the result of a merger between Loewenstein Furniture Group and Winston Furniture Company. Earnings growth at WinsLoew is strong: The company should earn 80 cents a share in 1996, twice 1995 earnings. The company recently bought back a million of its own shares and approved the re-purchase of another million. The stock is currently trading at $8.50 a share, just above its book value of $7. This is a well-run company; I agree with the many insiders who think it's undervalued.<p>

Northeast Utilities System (Hartford), the largest utility in New England, provides electric service through its subsidiaries in Connecticut, New Hampshire, and western Massachusetts. The company suffered from the shutdown of three of its four nuclear facilities in 1995 and 1996, but those operations should be back on line soon. The current stock price of $10 a share reflects the possibility of a dividend reduction, but risk-tolerant investors should recognize this as a classic value-investing scenario: Northeast Utilities System trades at about 50 to 55 percent of book value and two and a half times cash flow. My 12- to 18-month target price for the stock is $20. <p>

Activision (Los Angeles) develops and markets interactive software for personal computers and for video-game systems such as Nintendo, Sony PlayStation, and Sega. With the consumer-software industry growing at better than 25 percent a year and the holiday season upon us, Activision should continue to benefit from a strong tailwind. Intel's MMX chip and new technologies like 3-D graphics and multiplayer interactive capabilities should drive growth and earnings. I'm looking for Activision to earn 50 cents a share in the fiscal year ending March 1997 and 80 cents a share in 1998. Activision could put a smile on both your face and your children's faces. <p>

Philip Morris (New York) isn't just the world's largest cigarette company. It's also a major food producer, with such household names as Kraft (the largest American processor and marketer of food) and Miller Brewing (the second-largest brewer in the U.S.). If you combine a 72-cents-a-share goodwill charge on the income statement and earnings estimates of $8.95 a share for 1997, investors in Philip Morris will actually earn $9.67 a share next year. Also, the stock pays a generous dividend: $4.80 a share for 1996, a yield of roughly 5 percent at the current price. The stock is down from around $104 in March; it's a cheap buy. <p>

						With so many closed-end funds selling at deep discounts, investors can afford to be extremely choosy<p>
By Joanmarie Kalter<p>
To create a shortlist of closed-end funds that are selling at rock-bottom discounts and that qualify as good investments now, we subjected the 567 funds in Morningstar's closed-end-fund universe to several tests. <p>
First, we identified funds that are selling at wide discounts to their net asset value: more than a 20 percent discount for equity funds and more than 14 percent for bond funds. Second, we compared the current discount to the average discount that prevailed during 1994 and 1995 and, for each asset class, picked the one fund from each sector that currently sells for the largest discount relative to historical levels. Finally, we screened out any fund that compromised on investment quality -- why settle for second-rate? <p>
An investor can use this list either to pinpoint the best play in an asset class or as the basis of a diversified closed-end portfolio. <p>
One thing to keep in mind, however, is how difficult it is to buy a fund at a discount once the transaction fees are taken into account. That's why experienced closed-end investors use discount-brokerage services whenever possible and try to purchase funds with an NAV of $10 a share or more -- to limit the bite taken out by bid됴sk spreads.<p>
But even so, investors who purchase these funds shouldn't expect a quick bounce. "Be patient," cautions Chris Grant of Grant Strudwick, an investment advisory firm in Baltimore. "That's what value investing is all about."<p>
Nowhere is that value more striking than in closed-end bond funds. The most profitable strategy for investing in any bond fund is to buy when interest rates peak and reap the capital appreciation as rates fall. But who can pick rate peaks?<p>
Buying a closed-end bond fund at a discount is a way around this dilemma. A fund that has a yield of 7 percent and sells at a discount of 13 percent -- or at 87 cents on the dollar -- actually yields 8 percent. <p>
Robert Gavrich, an investment adviser at Seasonal Strategy in San Francisco, explains, "You can wait a long time [for rates to turn or a discount to narrow] with that kind of income coming in."<p>

Returns from Brady bonds, which package emerging-market debt, have been good this year: Many of the funds that invest in these bonds are up more than 33 percent since January 1. But investors should think twice before they buy into this sector in the hope of earning those kinds of returns in the future. A volatile asset like emerging-market debt gyrates wildly between extremes of undervaluation and overvaluation. The best time to buy is at the low point in the cycle. Investors must now ask if these funds -- which reaped their returns from investments in such risky issues as Russian export-import bank loans, Peruvian bonds, and other exotica -- can continue to perform. Russian debt holdings are a big concern.<p>
Two years ago was the time to buy emerging-market debt, says Jean-Marie Eveillard, manager of the SoGen International Fund. "In early 1995, we were being paid very nicely to bear the risks," he says. "Today, we're not." And Ken Gregory, editor of No-Load Fund Analyst, based in Orinda, California, advises selling emerging-market-debt funds. While they could still deliver low-double-digit returns, he says, "the potential for big downward spikes remains." Eveillard, who is holding his positions, doesn't go that far. But he says, "It is a good time to get out of the weaker credits."<p>

						It's no easy task finding solid opportunities in today's volatile market. Here's what the experts are buying for 1997.<p>
By John Fried<p>
Among the most popular regular columns in Worth are "What They're Buying Now" and "What They're Recommending," in which 12 acclaimed investment professionals discuss their favorite stocks. For this special outlook issue, we have asked our investment pros to be more expansive and offer not just their two favorite stocks of the moment but also their thoughts and insights on the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits for the upcoming year. The results cover 24 carefully argued stock picks and many nuances of opinion.<p>
Don't be surprised at the lack of agreement: We weren't interested in a consensus. We were interested in thought-provoking views and companies that deserve consideration regardless of the direction of the market, the economy, or interest rates.<p>
These professionals are worth listening to not only because of their track records but also for another reason: Each of the eight mutual-fund managers and four newsletter writers follows a carefully honed investing style. To understand each of these styles is to appreciate the breadth of successful stock-picking techniques. There are many ways to pick stocks well, none of them easy.<p>
Some caveats and explanations: It should be assumed in each case that the manager or writer picking a stock has bought it for his fund or portfolio. He may, however, have sold all or some of his shares after the publishing deadline of November 22, 1996. Worth always recommends that readers conduct their own due diligence before investing. Below each stock name is the maximum price at which the stock picker considers it attractive.<p>
PRESTON ATHEY
Athey, who manages the <a name="FUND:PRSVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value Fund</b></a>, looks for reasonably priced stocks with market capitalizations under $500 million. His fund received a $$$$$ rating in Worth's November 1996 survey of mutual funds. <p>
Outlook: The economy will grow slowly in 1997, with corporate profits hard-pressed to match those of 1996. The stock market should be fine in the first half of the year but could fade in the second. I doubt full-year returns will surpass 8 percent. After the major gains of 1995 and 1996, 1997 may be a year in which we re-balance the scales. <p>
<a name="NYSE:CSS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11790"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CSS Industries</b></a> 
Up to $26
Philadelphia-based CSS Industries (NYSE: CSS) is a leading producer of Halloween masks, holiday gift cards, ribbons, and bows. In late 1995, CSS acquired gift-wrap manufacturer Cleo from <a name="NASD:GIBG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13571"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gibson Greetings</b></a>. Cleo lost money for Gibson, but CSS has made it solidly profitable. With abundant cash flow of about $2.50 a share, CSS can continue to reduce debt and make additional acquisitions in the years ahead to boost earnings. The stock has little Wall Street sponsorship and currently trades at an attractive 11 times estimated 1997 earnings of $2.20 a share.<p>
<a name="NASD:POBR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17055"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Poe & Brown</b></a>
Up to $30
Poe & Brown (Nasdaq: POBR) is a rapidly growing insurance broker focused on providing property and casualty insurance directly to commercial and professional customers. Headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida, Poe & Brown has the largest share of Florida's insurance market and is expanding in other Sun Belt markets, such as Atlanta and Phoenix. The company has a return on equity of over 25 percent and is rapidly gaining market share against its rivals. Nevertheless, the stock sells for only 11 times 1997 earnings estimates of $2.20 a share. Chief executive officer J. Hyatt Brown is one of the most impressive managers I have ever met, and his single-minded focus on building a profitable business bodes well for Poe & Brown in 1997.<p>
JAMES P. CRAIG
Craig manages the Janus Fund, which earned a $$$$ rating from Worth in 1996. Craig seeks capital gains from large companies with outstanding growth prospects.<p>
Outlook: The market is walking a tightrope. If the economy continues to grow at around 2 percent or less, interest rates should remain stable and the market will be robust. If the economy accelerates, rates will rise and there will be downside risk for stocks. With almost full employment and low interest rates, there is little room for improvement and tremendous potential for volatility in the market. <p>
<a name="NYSE:WFC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11619"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wells Fargo</b></a> 
Up to $300
Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) is way ahead of its peers as it moves its banking business toward lower-cost forms of distribution. This has allowed the company to free up a great deal of capital, which it returns to stockholders through substantial stock repurchases: The company has authorized the repurchase of up to 10 percent of its shares. I'm expecting the April 1996 merger with First Interstate Bancorp to add to earnings within 18 months, and yet the stock still looks cheap at its current price of around $275 a share. The only worry for this company is a significant recession in California, which would bring credit issues to the fore. Barring this, Wells Fargo should trade in the low to mid $300s in 1997.<p>
<a name="NYSE:HTG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Heritage Media</b></a> 
Up to $18
Shares of Heritage Media (NYSE: HTG), the Dallas-based leader of in-store advertising and promotional services, have been pummeled recently (down to around $14 from $22) because of the entry of a competitor into the in-store couponing market. Yet this business makes up only 20 percent of Heritage's cash flow, while the rest of the business -- including Actmedia in-store marketing, direct mail, TV, and radio -- is posting consistently strong growth. Earnings and cash flow remain high, and the company recently announced the buyback of 14 percent of its shares. I've known management since the 1980s; with such capable people behind Heritage, its stock should shoot right back into the $20s in 1997.<p>
SHELBY M. C. DAVIS
Davis is the manager of the New York Venture Fund, which earned a $$$$$ rating from Worth in 1996. He invests in large companies whose earnings are growing faster than those of the average company but that are selling at below-average multiples of earnings or book values. <p>
Outlook: It all hinges on corporate profits. If we head into a recession because we run out of steam, or the Fed wants it, then all bets are off. It won't be the end of the world -- just a traditional bear market. But I'm betting the good news will continue. <p>
<a name="NYSE:AXP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10085"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Express</b></a> 
Up to $50
This New York됵ased financial-services giant (NYSE: AXP) is in the midst of a determined turnaround of its credit-card business. It has plans to offer more co-branded cards with other companies, expand its frequent-usage rewards, and more. I remain impressed with CEO Harvey Golub, who has taken strides to expand the acceptance of the American Express card and is determined to double card usage by the year 2000. With the stock currently trading at only 12 times 1997 earnings, it's a good value in today's market. <p>
<a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>International Business Machines</b></a> 
Up to $137
After disappointing earnings in the first two quarters of 1996, IBM (NYSE: IBM), based in Armonk, New York, delivered an impressive third-quarter earnings performance that has revived investors' interest. Moreover, Big Blue announced a focus on selling "solutions" -- services designed to help customers in every aspect of the tech world, from buying a computer to saving a document. Computer services industry-wide are estimated to grow 25 percent a year for several years, so this strategy seems right on target. What's more, IBM has a strong balance sheet and an active stock-repurchase plan.<p>
AL FRANK
Frank's Prudent Speculator is the top-performing newsletter for the past 5 years and the past 15 years, according to The Hulbert Financial Digest. Frank looks for deeply undervalued stocks that sell at a fraction of their intrinsic value.<p>
Outlook: I expect 1997 to be about half as good as 1996, producing overall returns around 10 percent. Historically, the year after a president's reelection is rarely as good as the following three. While it's almost unheard of to have seven straight years of rising stock prices, the stock market is unlikely to drop unless the Federal Reserve raises rates at least twice.<p>
<a name="NASD:BELF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12760"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bel Fuse</b></a> 
Up to $11.88
The shares of Bel Fuse (Nasdaq: BELF), a Jersey City manufacturer of low-end electronic components -- such as fuses, filters, and transformers for computer networks and other high-technology products -- are a bargain. Low demand in the second and third quarters of 1996 produced disappointing earnings, driving the stock down 50 percent from its April high of over $22 a share. The stock is now priced at only seven times Bel Fuse's temporarily depressed earnings and below net asset value of $12.08 a share. The company has no long-term debt and more than four dollars a share in cash and marketable securities. Our three- to five-year target is $24. <p>
<a name="NYSE:SCR.A"></a><b>Sea Containers</b> 
Up to $21
Bermuda-based Sea Containers (NYSE: SCR.A) has recently come down into the value basement. The company owns and operates ferries, trains, and ports; leases cargo containers; and owns hotels and resorts worldwide. It recently secured a seven-year franchise to provide high-speed rail service between Scotland and London. The deal is valued at $450 million a year, which will more than double the company's current annual sales. Yet the stock has since drifted down because of weakness in the marine-container business, leaving the stock valued at only two times cash flow and less than its net asset value of $20 a share. Yet it pays a dividend yield near 5 percent. My three- to five-year target is $40.<p>
DANIEL B. LEONARD
Leonard manages the Invesco Strategic Portfolios Technology Fund, rated $$$$$ by Worth when we last rated sector funds in 1995. He currently favors established technology leaders and service firms that use technology to gain a competitive edge. <p>
Outlook: I think profit margins have plateaued, so it's going to be tough for companies to increase earnings in 1997. If the economy grows at its current rate of 2 to 2.5 percent and keeps producing relatively full employment, the market will remain in a growth mode. If growth accelerates beyond that, you'll see wage pressure, inflation, and the threat of rising interest rates. <p>
<a name="NYSE:CNC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10391"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Conseco</b></a> 
Up to $55
Conseco (NYSE: CNC), based in Carmel, Indiana, is an aggressive acquirer and operator of life-insurance companies throughout the U.S. It is renowned for buying lackluster companies at low prices, cutting costs aggressively, and ditching underperforming businesses in order to quickly boost return on equity. Conseco made six acquisitions in 1996, focusing on life insurance, annuities, and health insurance. I expect these to add to earnings this year. I'm forecasting earnings growth of 19 percent in 1996 and 33 percent in 1997. My 12-month target for the stock is $75.<p>
<a name="NYSE:STT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14795"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>State Street Boston</b></a> 
Up to $65
This Boston-based bank-and-trust operation (NYSE: STT) acts as custodian and provider of security-transaction services to mutual funds, annuities, and money managers. With $2.7 trillion of assets in custody and $280 billion under management, it is one of the largest and most profitable companies in the bank-and-trust industry. The recent acquisition of Princeton Financial Systems, which provides management software for the insurance and investment industries, should enable the company to continue to produce earnings growth in excess of 16 percent in both 1996 and 1997. The stock should go to $90 a share by year-end. <p>
JIM McCAMANT
McCamant has extensive experience in the fields of biotechnology and venture capital and focuses on biotechnology investments in his Medical Technology Stock Letter.<p>
Outlook: I'm looking for a favorable environment for stocks in 1997 -- further slow growth with continuing low inflation. The big winners should be smaller-company growth stocks, particularly those biotech companies that are just starting to show profits. After a mid-1996 correction, many of the group's stocks have been brought back down to bargain levels.<p>
<a name="NASD:CHIR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12972"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chiron</b></a> 
Up to $30
Chiron (Nasdaq: CHIR), based in Emeryville, California, is our favorite among the large and profitable biotechs. The company is skilled in four promising new-product areas -- diagnostics, ophthalmics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Heavy research expenses and the cost of filing five new-product applications with the Food and Drug Administration penalized earnings in 1996. In 1997, most of these products should get the green light, fueling a sharp increase in net income. With over $1 billion in current revenues, an outstanding research team, and a large number of new products in development, Chiron is one of the best and least risky ways to participate in the growth of this industry. Our 18- to 24-month target is $50. <p>
<a name="NASD:XOMA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15185"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Xoma</b></a> 
Up to $8
Previous product disappointments have left this biotech (Nasdaq: XOMA), based in Berkeley, California, undervalued and out of favor. But 1997 should be a breakthrough year. I anticipate positive news coming out of the testing of Neuprex, a promising new drug for treating trauma associated with major blood loss and for fighting antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The company also expects to get approval in Japan for E5, a drug that treats severe bacterial infection. Our 18- to 24-month target price for the stock is $16.<p>
MICHAEL MURPHY
Murphy is editor of California  Technology Stock Letter, one of the top five newsletters of the past ten years, according to The Hulbert Financial Digest. <p>
Outlook: I don't see any big problems in the U.S. economy in 1997 in terms of either inflation or recession. Any pullback in the U.S. stock markets will likely fall on cyclical or domestic consumer stocks like restaurants and retail. With the Far East and Europe bouncing back from a flat 1996, companies that sell technology products or that have a high export component are going to do especially well in 1997.<p>
<a name="NASD:PMAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=47170"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Plasma & Materials Technology</b></a>
Up to $16
Plasma & Materials Technology (Nasdaq: PMAT), based in Chatsworth, California, produces semiconductor equipment for a process called high density/low pressure. The process is used to etch semiconductor chips with the microcircuit lines that carry electronic currents. As chips get smaller, making this process more delicate and difficult, this technology is becoming necessary for most chip manufacturers. The company is already strong in the U.S. and Far East and is in the process of extending its reach throughout Europe by acquiring British-based Electrotech. If the technology sector picks up in 1997, Plasma & Materials will be on the cutting edge.<p>
<a name="NASD:INSV"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16596"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>InSite Vision</b></a> 
Up to $7
This Alameda, California됵ased pharmaceutical company (Nasdaq: INSV) has developed a time-release delivery system to feed drugs directly into the human eye to fight glaucoma. Clinical trials on this system, in which drugs are placed inside the eyelid and released during the day, are already complete. InSite has entered into a marketing partnership with <a name="NYSE:BOL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10187"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bausch & Lomb</b></a> and Ciba-Geigy. If all goes well, the company could have two products, BetaSite and PilaSite, on the market by year-end 1997. Although I expect losses through 1996 and 1997, this kind of stock trades on new-product news. Currently down from a 12-month high of $8.25 a share to just above $4, the stock is cheap. My 18-month target is $20.<p>
WILLIAM NASGOVITZ 
Nasgovitz, manager of Heartland Value Fund, which earned a $$$$$ rating in our 1996 mutual-fund survey, primarily buys very small companies selling at low multiples of their earnings or book value. <p>
Outlook: Overall, the stock market may be a bit feeble in 1997. With many investors buying large global stocks, the small-company market has been left at the gate for some time. We think this trend is close to turning, and we note that long periods of lagging performance by very small companies are historically followed by long periods of above-average returns.<p>
<a name="NYSE:ICN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10763"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ICN Pharmaceuticals</b></a> 
Up to $22
ICN (NYSE: ICN), based in Costa Mesa, California, makes a broad range of prescription and over-the-counter drugs and markets them in more than 60 countries, particularly in the emerging markets of Eastern Europe and Latin America. While I expect revenues and earnings to continue growing at 25 percent a year or better, the stock remains remarkably cheap. Major drug companies trade at an average of 20 times 1997 earnings, but ICN sells for only 7.5 times my forecasted 1997 earnings of $2.75 a share. Also, ICN hopes to get FDA approval for a drug to treat hepatitis C, developed in a joint project with <a name="NYSE:SGP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11326"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Schering-Plough</b></a>. My 12-month target is $30.<p>

Up to $5 
Allwaste (NYSE: ALW), based in Houston, provides industrial-waste handling, processing, and transportation as well as container-cleaning services for major industrial facilities. After several troubled years, new management has successfully introduced programs aimed at improving profitability. I expect Allwaste to earn 40 cents a share in 1997 -- which would value the shares at a reasonable 11 times 1997 earnings. The company currently services 12,000 facilities and has a large share-buyback program under way. Our 12-month target is seven dollars.<p>
LOUIS NAVELLIER
Navellier, editor of MPT Review, uses modern portfolio theory to identify high-return, low-volatility stocks. According to The Hulbert Financial Digest, Navellier's model portfolios had the highest return among all newsletter portfolios for the past ten years. <p>
Outlook: I don't think the Federal Reserve will tighten rates in the next few months, so we should have a solid earnings-driven market. But with expectations down, it's not going to be a rip-roarer. I expect only a few areas to do well: the oil-service and -drilling sectors and consumer stocks.<p>
<a name="NYSE:NKE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14254"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>NIKE class B</b></a> 
Up to $68
Athletic-shoe and -apparel maker Nike (NYSE: NKE) has been living up to its slogan: "Just do it." The Beaverton, Oregon됵ased company ended its May 1996 fiscal year with earnings up 39 percent from 1995; sales for the domestic apparel division were up 99 percent. The company is at the head of the class in the fast-growing retail sector. With earnings forecasts of $5.11 a share for 1997 and $6.07 for 1998, I believe Nike is ready for another banner year. <p>
<a name="NYSE:RIG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10082"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Transocean Offshore</b></a> 
Up to $78
This Houston-based company (NYSE: RIG) provides contract drilling of oil and gas in offshore areas worldwide. Transocean operates 27 offshore drilling units, including 18 submersibles (drilling vessels that float below the water's surface and operate in rough water), 6 jack-up rigs, and 3 ships designed to drill in deep water. The drilling boom will continue in 1997, so I'm looking for earnings of $2.50 a share in 1996 and $3.77 in 1997.<p>
ERIC E. RYBACK
Manager of the Lindner Dividend Fund for over a decade, Ryback has been earning solid returns while assuming little risk. His strategy emphasizes current income first and capital appreciation second. The fund earned a $$$ rating in 1996. <p>
Outlook: I'm not positive on the outlook for 1997 -- the market is trading at particularly high levels, and I'm not sure they can be sustained. Rates could rise and slow down the economy and depress earnings. Investors should err on the side of caution, putting money into defensive funds. <p>
<a name="NYSE:KNE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10829"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>KN Energy</b></a> 
Up to $40
KN Energy (NYSE: KNE), based in Lakewood, Colorado, is a fully integrated natural-gas company that transports gas from the field to consumers in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming. While much of the industry still sells gas at regulated rates, approximately 60 percent of KN's operations are unregulated, allowing the company to earn heftier profit margins. I look for annual earnings growth of 15 percent, which will raise profits from 1996's $2.15 a share to $3 as early as 1998. <p>
<a name="NYSE:EEX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10522"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Enserch Exploration</b></a> 
Up to $12
Dallas-based Enserch Exploration (NYSE: EEX) is one of the major players in the potentially huge exploration effort in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The shares trade at a discount to the value of the company's current reserves, to say nothing of the potential from new exploratory wells. The shares are worth at least $13 to $14, and the company makes an attractive acquisition candidate -- which could place an even higher value on the stock.<p>
RALPH WANGER & CHUCK McQUAID
Wanger and McQuaid, along with Terence Hogan, manage the acclaimed Acorn Fund, which received a $$$$$ rating from Worth in November 1996. They look for small-company stocks that will benefit from favorable economic and business trends. 
Outlook: We think there are three trends to watch in 1997: Video programmers will benefit from the increase in specialized programming; the move toward home health care will gather momentum; and there will be a continued push toward outsourcing computer services.<p>
<a name="NYSE:LBTYA"></a><b>Tele-Communications Liberty Media Group</b>
Up to $32
With interests in more than 90 fast-growing cable-TV and satellite channels, Liberty Media Group (Nasdaq: LBTYA), based in Englewood, Colorado, is one of the most promising companies we own. Over the past 12 months, the value of Liberty's investments in other companies has grown substantially. The Learning Channel has become profitable after years of losses. The Discovery Channel, whose cash flow is up more than 15 percent, will benefit from the newly launched channel Animal Planet and the to-be-launched Kids. Regional Sports Channel's cash flows have grown more than 50 percent, and QVC's cash flows have increased more than 15 percent. Liberty holds interests in <a name="NYSE:TWX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11482"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Time Warner</b></a> (worth about $10 a share of Liberty stock), <a name="NYSE:HSN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12024"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Shopping Network</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:SKTV"></a><b>Silver King</b>, International Family, and BET Holdings. While Liberty's underlying value has grown from $36.50 a share to over $40 in 1996, the stock has risen just $1, making it an even better buy.<p>
<a name="AMEX:TDS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12376"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Telephone and Data Systems</b></a>
Up to $40
Chicago-based TDS (ASE: TDS) has a hand in almost every aspect of the telecommunications business: a thriving rural telephone service in 37 states and ownership stakes in three hot wireless markets, including an 82 percent stake in United States Cellular, an 80 percent interest in American Paging, and an 83 percent interest in the new wireless personal-communications-service company American Portable Telecommunications. Cash flow for TDS's cellular service grew more than 50 percent in 1996. We believe the stock's total underlying value is at least $70 a share, making TDS one of the cheapest stocks we own.<p>
DONALD A. YACKTMAN
Yacktman runs the acclaimed Yacktman Fund, which seeks long-term growth from companies with market capitalizations of at least $1 billion. Worth hasn't rated the fund, because its track record goes back only three years.<p>
Outlook: Rising credit-card delinquencies and approximately a million bankruptcies filed last year are the economy's Achilles' heel. If banks start to tighten their credit standards, consumer spending and the economy will slow. Whatever happens to the economy, the investor should remain focused on one quest: looking for great companies at great prices. <p>
<a name="NYSE:FNQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15674"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Franklin Quest</b></a>
Up to $24
This Salt Lake City됵ased company (NYSE: FNQ) provides highly effective time-management products and seminars for businesses, government agencies, and the public. Earnings for the company, whose trademark product is the Franklin Day Planner, grew nearly 30 percent a year but had a poor 1996. Franklin should earn about $2.15 a share in calendar year 1997, and cash earnings are close to $2.50 a share after write-offs for goodwill are added. The market is undervaluing the company's enviable market niche and strong balance sheet.<p>
<a name="NASD:BARE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15449"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Barefoot</b></a> 
Up to $12
With more than 400,000 customers in the central and eastern United States, lawn-care provider Barefoot (Nasdaq: BARE), based in Worthington, Ohio, is prospering by bringing professional management to what has traditionally been a mom-and-pop business. While weather-influenced sales fluctuate widely, the company always manages to generate a lot of free cash, which it consistently uses to buy back shares. Adding goodwill charges to Barefoot's 1997 estimated earnings produces cash earnings of $1.20 a share and one of the market's lowest valuations for a steadily growing company.<p>

						You didn't give up hope, did you? Thanks to the overall strength of the economy and the trends in demographics and real estate, home prices are climbing again.<p>
By Nick Ravo<p>
Have you hugged a baby boomer lately? After years of sluggish sales and falling or flat prices, the residential real-estate market is finally moving upward. And it's boomer behavior, fueled in large part by a healthier economy, that's nudging the value of houses across the country. <p>
Almost every homeowner stands to benefit from the upcoming market trends. Sales in starter homes are taking off, more people are trading up to better houses, and the demand for second homes is strong. The outlook is so rosy, in fact, that many folks are even starting to abandon the fixation with remodeling that they picked up in the recession-hammered early 1990s. <p>
"It has been a banner time for home sales all over," says John Tuccillo, chief economist with the National Association of Realtors, a trade group in Washington, D.C. "Even the Northeast is doing better." Don't think this is a replay of the cash-bloated mid-1980s; a cookie-cutter condo behind a strip mall isn't going to appreciate by 30 percent over the next 12 months. But you will be able to have some confidence -- and be a little aggressive -- as you put your house on the market.<p>
In fact, in 1996 the rise in median prices for existing homes (as opposed to newly constructed homes) bested the national inflation rate of 2.7 percent in every state except California, Hawaii (the only state in which prices fell, by 3 percent), New York, and Rhode Island, plus the District of Columbia, according to Regional Financial Associates, a Pennsylvania-based economic forecasting service.<p>
It may not sound like great news that price increases are staying ahead of inflation, but don't underestimate the wonders of leverage, which makes even a smidgen of an increase meaningful. For example, if you have 25 percent equity in a home, a 4 percent rise in value produces a 16 percent gain on the money you have invested. Moreover, the mortgage interest is tax deductible. Even better, if President Clinton's campaign promise becomes law (and in this case the GOP has no reason to oppose him), most capital gains on home sales will be eliminated. <p>
"After years of worrying about declining prices, people were put off about buying a home," says Mark M. Zandi, chief economist with Regional Financial Associates. "Now people are feeling better about the housing market." Zandi credits low unemployment and low interest rates for the surge in consumer confidence. The federal government's aggressive promotion of affordable-housing programs, particularly those that have eased restrictions on loan qualifications, has helped, too. <p>
Even real estate in Southern California, which alone represents 5 percent of the nation's housing, has begun to pull out of a devastating five-year slump. Median sale prices there posted a 0.7 percent gain in 1996 over 1995. The future looks even better: Prices are expected to rise by 4.6 percent in 1997.<p>
That slow but steady improvement in Southern California, however, will be a drag on home prices in other regions. Price growth in the mountain states, which had been rocketing because of refugees from California, has already started to plateau. So don't expect prices to increase as quickly as they did in 1996 -- don't, that is, expect another year of 12.3 percent growth in Utah (the national leader for the year) and 8.8 percent growth in Arizona. "Those states are still building, but the California influx has about stopped," cautions Zandi. <p>
It has also slowed in the northern part of California -- another place Southern Californians have been congregating. But in this case the outlook is bright. In the San Francisco Bay area, recession-stung developers are chary about building, even though housing demand is on the rise. In effect, there's a shortage of housing in that region, and prices reflect that. <p>
Overall, 1997 will be a little less inspiring than 1996. Zandi projects that prices nationwide for existing homes will jump 3 percent in 1997 versus 5.3 percent in 1996. Still, new-home prices may inch up more than those of existing homes, in part because of quotas on Canadian lumber imports. <p>
A sector not to be overlooked is the second-home market. In New York's coastal Hamptons area, prices have already surpassed the levels they hit in the gilded 1980s. "There is an abundance of buyers and a lack of product," says Gary DePersia, a real-estate agent with the East Hampton firm Allan M. Schneider Associates. "And the higher the price, the less there is."<p>
DePersia notes that only at the bottom of the market -- the $300,000 to $400,000 price range -- are homes available in any significant quantity. He also points out that today's buyers are steering away from the stark, angular contemporary designs that sprouted like postmodern weeds in many second-home communities, particularly in beach areas, a decade or two ago. "People want something more traditional," says DePersia.<p>
But it's not just weekenders who are behind the rising second-home market. Those in search of a faraway vacation home, most often in a warm climate and possibly in a future retirement area, are snapping up bargain homes. This is especially true in Florida (with the northwest part of the state leading the way). That's because real-estate prices there still pale in comparison with those in Arizona and California. Again, Florida can salute the boomers for this boon. The state will see a real-estate explosion once the generation takes up shuffleboard in a decade or so. Historically, about 25 percent of all retirees who move to the Sun Belt have headed to Florida. And that may mean huge demand and translate to even huger profits if you beat the crowd.<p>
But you needn't be on the cusp of retirement to profit from Florida's growth. Here's a suggestion some financial advisers are making to northern homeowners who have big, valuable houses and are at least 55 years old (and thus able to exempt $125,000 in capital gains from their federal income taxes, as current law allows; the expected capital-gains change would open this up to younger people, too): Sell your house now, and buy a smaller one in Florida. Rent out the Florida house. Invest the money left over from selling the house and use the income, along with income from the Florida rental property, to rent yourself a northern home. When you're ready to retire, move into the Florida house.<p>
This slightly offbeat strategy not only positions you well for the impending migration but also takes you out of the northern housing market when the baby boomers in the north will be trying to sell their homes en masse. As they say in the business, there is one rule for making money in real estate: Get in front of the baby boomers' demand. <p>
Oh, and the clamor for housing those boomers will make. About 70 million Americans will celebrate birthdays number 33 through 51 in 1997.<p>
With all the boomer-led good news in one part of the economy, you had to figure there would be boomer-led bad news elsewhere, and there is: Home improvement is on the decline. Americans spent $97.5 billion on home upkeep and improvements in 1991. The figure reached $115 billion in 1994, but it fell to $112.6 billion in 1995, the last year for which figures are available from the National Association of Home Builders.<p>
One reason for this declining interest in renovations may be that in many cases homeowners don't recoup their improvement expense when they sell. Swimming pools, for example, don't increase a home's sale price. Nor do skylights, which are bad news for energy bills.<p>
That's not to say that the right improvement won't pay off. Home offices, media rooms, and mini-gyms top the list of must-haves for many homeowners. Creating a larger kitchen, often by combining it with a living room into something we're all being encouraged to call a "great room," is the renovation du jour. <p>
If there's any room more deserving of attention than the kitchen, it's the bathroom, which has increased in size and splendidness. Few things, apparently, beat a double-sized Jacuzzi or a sexy all-glass shower with twin showerheads. "Bathrooms have become the place to retreat to," explains Gopal Ahluwalia, an economist at the National Home Builders Association. "They make or break the sale of a home."<p>
Then again, there's something to be said for doing what you want. Your house is your kingdom, that BarcaLounger your throne. "The concept of 'home' is changing," says Peter Miller, author of How to Sell Your Home in Any Market. "More and more of us work from home, we shop from home, and a growing number of us seem to vacation at home. So why shouldn't home have more amenities and luxuries?"<p>
So give a boomer a hug. After all the recent years of no or low returns, your patience is finally being rewarded.<p>

 -- sometimes it seems every mutual-fund family has launched its own site on the Internet. Any investor who doesn't make a regular habit of buying magic beans and bridges to Brooklyn knows these are marketing vehicles. But some fund companies have realized that they need to do more than just promote their funds if they want anyone to read their pages. This means that many of these pages now offer a surprising array of free tools and information.<p>
The World Wide Web site of Twentieth Century Mutual Funds and the Benham Group (<a HREF="http://www.twentieth-century.com">www.twentieth-century.com</A>) is one of the best -- and a sign of things to come. As you might expect, you can sign on to order a prospectus for any one of the company's funds, review your account, or move money from one fund in the family to another. You can click on a menu of funds to get a brief profile of a specific fund -- with return numbers for the year to date and 1, 3, 5, 10, even 20 years, as well as similar numbers for a benchmark index. You can also get data on the fund's top ten holdings and five most heavily weighted industries and receive rankings of the fund against its peers.<p>
All that is a pretty straightforward, but informative and accurate, marketing pitch. The site offers more. There's a free portfolio tracker that can update the prices, volume, and market value of up to ten portfolios of 30 stocks, mutual funds, and options each. The tracker will even let an investor set alerts to ring when a stock or fund crosses a price threshold. (Unfortunately, the tracker won't calculate returns on an investment.)<p>
The site also has sections on setting goals and calculating how much you'll need to invest to reach them. It's standard financial-planning advice, and there aren't any spreadsheets that do the calculations for you after you've filled in the data. But this is a solid reference.<p>
Other fund companies have equally strong offerings, with the specific strengths and weaknesses of each reflecting the personality of the family. For example, Fidelity Investments (<a HREF="http://www.fid-inv.com">www.fid-inv.com</A>) piles information on top of information -- planners, prospectuses, even news with market commentary. Janus (<a HREF="http://www.janusfunds.com">www.janusfunds.com</A>) opens with a photo of a skier and asks an investor to navigate the slopes to find information in "Buzz" sections. For a thorough list of the fund families on the Net, search "Mutual Funds" with the search engine Yahoo! (<a HREF="http://www.Yahoo.com">www.Yahoo.com</A>).

						Hey, my six-month CD just got its own show!<p>
By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>
Here's one way to get your kids to stop watching Pinky and the Brain -- call up your dull old checking account on TV. <p>
This fall <a name="NYSE:BBI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10183"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Barnett Bank</b></a> in Orlando, Florida, will let its customers do just that, through its new TV banking service. Customers must subscribe to Time Warner's interactive cable network, a pilot project that lets viewers get movies and pizzas delivered to their doorstep. Consumers click their remote controls, enter a PIN, and direct cartoon tellers to pay bills, transfer money between accounts, or check ATM withdrawals.<p>
Sounds smart -- home banking has been notoriously expensive, with consumers shelling out hundreds of dollars for PCs and modems to get services that are free in bank branches. Less than 1 percent of U.S. households became PC bankers in the first 15 years of home banking; maybe paying credit-card bills during commercials will be an easier sell.<p>

						"Mean Business"
By Albert J. Dunlap 
(Times Business, $25)<p>
"An Eye for Winners"
By Lillian Vernon
(HarperCollins, $23)<p>
By Greg Critser<p>
Business biography is a uniquely American art form. Confessional, quirky, often full of bluster, it is a literature with its own distinct narrative beats. Inspiration and will are inevitably followed by trouble and temptation; next comes the crashing in of a cruel, Schumpeterian world and the reign of chaos; finally, renewal and redemption triumph. You don't have to listen too hard to hear the Puritan overtones.<p>
True, some stories are more redemptive than others: The humorously self-effacing David Ogilvy's Ogilvy on Advertising, for example, will do more for the soul than Lee Iacocca's shameless self-hagiography. Yet good or bad, these books are all exhortations -- or cowboy jeremiads, in some cases -- and many of us can't seem to get enough of them. That's because we want to believe in them, of course, and that's why, predictably, so many of them fail to live up to our expectations. <p>
Certainly this is the case with <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a> CEO Andrew S. Grove's Only the Paranoid Survive. Grove details how Intel, the world's leading producer of semiconductors, was forced into what he calls a "10X" change. A "10X" change occurs, we learn, when the very fundamentals of a business are challenged. In Intel's case this happened in late 1994, when relatively minor flaws were discovered in the company's newest product, the Pentium processor. So vociferously did Intel's customers protest that Grove reversed long-standing Intel policy and gave every customer a new chip. (Past exchanges had depended on Intel evaluations.) As a result, Intel, once driven purely by technology, became a customer-driven business and therefore more responsive to the fast changes shaping the ever evolving technology business.<p>
Grove's account of how the Intel staff met this challenge will come as an encouraging read for executives and middle managers: Rapid change can be attained, Grove is saying. But his book fails miserably in its greater ambition, at least as expressed in its subtitle, How to Exploit the Crisis Points That Challenge Every Company and Career. This suggests that Grove can teach readers to intuit such changes, yet the best he can muster are chestnuts on the order of "Look for changes in the power, vigor, and competence of customers." Grove's reliance on this kind of business mumbo jumbo seems to express a belief that merely repeating buzzwords elevates them to the status of Eternal Truth. "Before the strategic inflection point, the industry simply was more like the old," he reveals at one point. "After it, it is more like the new."<p>
Oh.<p>
Readers won't have to endure any such icky nostrums in Mean Business, by turnaround artist and former Scott Paper CEO Albert J. "Chainsaw Al" Dunlap (ably assisted by co-writer Bob Andelman). For those who've been vacationing on the planet Pluto (or contemplating strategic inflection points), Dunlap is the Hoboken-born ex-paratrooper that Wall Street loves (because he is single-mindedly dedicated to increasing shareholder value) and management hates (because he is always firing them). He's not interested in some mysterious carpe diem or weird "10X" factor; he just wants to get the maximum bang for every invested dollar -- even if that means making life hell for everyone around him.<p>
Consider Dunlap's most acclaimed and controversial achievement, the turnaround of Scott Paper. In 1994, when Dunlap was brought in to save the 115-year-old firm, Scott had just registered a stunning $300 million loss. Its stock was in the can. Dunlap applied his vinegar, laying off 11,200 "unproductive" workers -- 35 percent of the company's payroll -- and selling off unrelated assets. The result: By 1995, Scott had experienced record earnings and a 163 percent jump in its stock price. Eventually, <a name="NYSE:KMB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10856"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kimberly-Clark Corp</b></a>. bought it for $7 billion. For his trouble -- and there was a lot of it -- Dunlap pocketed $100 million.<p>
Color abounds in Mean Business. Red, mainly. Dunlap's response to learning that Scott has a corporate-morale officer? "Get rid of her!" The fate of a narcoleptic in-house lawyer? "A few days later, he was memory." Charitable donations? "They should also be history." There's a certain visceral glee in Dunlap's story, particularly for anyone who's tried to change a corporate dinosaur. This book makes you feel like swearing a whole bunch -- proudly.<p>
Still, most contemporary discussions of Dunlap pivot on one point: Did he deserve $100 million when, at the same time, so many loyal Scott workers were...history? To that Dunlap has offered the irrefutable logic that without his cutting there would be no jobs. But that's the great dodge in this book; he fails to answer the question of how long these short-term solutions can keep a company afloat. A better question concerning the futures of the companies he rescues might be "What hath Al wrought?" Dunlap tells of goading purchasing agents to "practice brinkmanship" with vendors, to "narrow suppliers to a handful," and to "leverage volume." All seemingly good advice in the short term, but what happens when, perhaps during a paper shortage, vendors again hold the upper hand? Reading all this in the light of Dunlap's credo -- "I think of every dollar as a brother" -- one wonders if that isn't because the dollar is the only thing that will have him.<p>
After all this heavy stuff, <a name="AMEX:LVC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12111"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lillian Vernon</b></a>'s somewhat haimish An Eye for Winners comes at just the right moment. Vernon, who built a $220 million mail-order business from the simple idea of selling monogrammed purses and belts, offers her own, rather humble advice to the budding entrepreneur (get a good accountant, watch cash flow, etc.). But it's her heartfelt personal story that really carries the book and that reminds us that lives -- not businesses -- have narratives we care about. Vernon and family fled the Nazis in the early 1930s, and the tale of how these expatriate, upper-class German Jews re-established themselves in the New World in New York never flags in communicating the joys of running an enterprise -- something a few other CEOs seem to have forgotten about entirely.<p>

Market makers put buyers and sellers together -- but certainly not for free.<p>By Jonathan Butler<p>Imagine if getting rid of shares of stock was as difficult as 
selling a used car: classified ads, phone calls, in-person meetings. Luckily for investors, all it takes to buy or sell stock is a call to a broker, who, in most cases, calls in the order to a "market maker." <p>"The market maker is really just a meeting point between the buyer and seller," says Art Bonnel, manager of the <a name="FUND:ACBGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACBGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bonnel Growth Fund</b></a>. Using a brokerage firm's capital, a market maker buys securities from sellers and then resells them to buyers. To compensate the firm for risking its own capital, a market-making dealer will sell a stock at a higher price (the asking price) than he paid for it (the bid). 
Although orders for a specific stock on the New York Stock Exchange 
are handled and matched by a single assigned "specialist" on the floor of the exchange, over-the-counter stocks have multiple dealers (the average Nasdaq stock has 11).<p>In theory, that competition should keep the spreads relatively small, but a study conducted at Vanderbilt University in July 1995 that compared more than 5.4 million transactions on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange in 1991 found the average spread for Nasdaq trades was almost double that for exchange trades__49.2 cents versus 25.8 cents. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been investigating the National Association of Securities Dealers for a variety of unfair practices, ranging from price-fixing to backing away from posted prices. Says Brian Berris of Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, "There's a built-in divergence of interest: The client wants the best price, and the market maker wants to maximize the profit."<p>The Small Order Execution System adopted by Nasdaq in 1984 was supposed to address some of these problems. It allows brokers to enter small retail trades (up to 1,000 shares) electronically and requires market makers to honor their quoted prices. But the system hasn't done much to help small investors trade inside the spread. NAqcess, a new system currently under consideration, would allow small investors to automatically post limit orders -- that is, orders to buy or sell at a set price -- on 300,000 terminals worldwide. Orders would then be matched by computer. But NAqcess certainly won't be up and running this year.<p>Meanwhile, investors who want to get the best price on a trade need to find a broker who will shop around to get the smallest spread on each transaction. Don't assume that only a high-commission broker will do this hard work either. Discount brokerage firm <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab</b></a> (800-435-4000) promises that its Schwab Assurance Trading program will search the log of 3,600 Nasdaq stocks traded by Schwab's own market maker to find the best price on orders of 100 to 5,000 shares. If the system fails to find a way to improve the price internally, it will scan the National Market System for a better deal.<p><p><p>

						Everything about the current stock market is unprecendcented,and that's cause for both anxiety and hope  <p>
 By Jim Jubak  <p>
Anxiety is as commonplace on the New York Stock Exchange as the torn order slips that litter the trading floor.  Monday, March 11, the atmospheric angst was even thicker than usual among the brokers and specialists who make their living trading stocks.<p>
Throughout the day, the scurrying and gesticulating market professionals kept nervously glancing up at the overhead electronic scoreboards to see if the longest stock-market rally in U.S. financial history was about to come to an end.  <p>
 The previous Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had plummeted 171.24 points to 5470.45, a sign to many that the end was at hand. As if by way of confirmation, the market opened 14 points down on Monday. Then the Dow began to climb. It was up 39 points at noon, then faltered, then appeared to rally again late in the session.  <p>
 By 3:42 -- 18 minutes before the close -- the eyes on the scoreboards saw a Dow up 93.93, then, a minute later, up 95.38. Would it stick? Or would a wave of computer-generated selling swamp the gains of the last half hour?  <p>
 At 3:45, a cheer went up from the floor as the Dow broke 100 points for the day. One broker shook his fist in the air, as if in defiance of the fickle market gods. Another flashed a thumbs-up sign at the CNN and CNBC cameras in the gallery. As the exchange's clocks counted down the seconds to closing, brokers and specialists applauded and whistled. At the bell, the Dow stood at 5581, up 110.55.  <p>
 The rally was still on.  <p>
 Wall street, of course, has always worshiped the market. To the rest of us, however, the Dow's gyrations used to be more like a spectator sport. That's no longer true. Today, the retirement dreams of millions of Americans ride on stocks. In 1992, the New York Stock Exchange estimated that 51 million individuals owned equities, up from 30 million in 1980, and the number of share owners is undoubtedly much higher in 1996. The Federal Reserve Board estimates that individuals own $3.7 trillion in stocks directly and, as of December 1995, another $1.3 trillion worth through mutual funds -- $400 billion more than a year earlier, according to the Investment Company Institute.  <p>
 For many, the stock market has become the only game in town. Bonds paying 6.7 percent and certificates of deposit yielding even less won't provide for a comfortable retirement or foot the bill for college. Stocks are riskier but not terribly so, according to conventional wisdom, which rests on stocks' having returned an average of 10.5 percent annually from 1926 through 1995. In this view, downturns and corrections are nothing more than pesky short-term annoyances. The market will always bounce back -- just as it did after the crash of October 1987.  <p>
 Will it? Can the market really be trusted to behave in this way? Will it continue to deliver lofty annual returns? Or have investors become too complacent?  <p>
 A dark undercurrent of opinion, most of it coming from authorities well off  Wall Street, says that the current stock market issubstantially overvalued and needs a correction of at least 10 percent -- or 560 points on the Dow from its current level of around 5600. Otherwise, the market might climb so high that a disastrous crash will become inevitable.  <p>
 Louder still, however, are the optimists at the big Wall Street investment houses, among the thousands of retail brokers, and in the financial press. Look at the cash flooding in from baby boomers finally starting to save for retirement, they say. It's all going into equities. This rally could continue for the rest of the decade and beyond.  <p>
 Who's right? with so much riding on the answer, it's critical to understand the character of this market -- its soul, if you will. <p>
Statistically, there has never been a stock market like this one. On October 11, 1990, often cited as the starting date for the current rally, the Dow stood at 2365 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index at 295.46. Since then, the market has climbed for five years and five months without even one 10 percent correction.The previous record was the three-year-three-month-long rally that ended with the crash of 1987. Also, during the past 12 years,the Dow has never dipped below the previous year's low. That, too, is unprecedented.  <p>
 Meanwhile, the relationship between the market and the economy has grown bizarre. The two other longest sustained rallies --between 1922 and 1929 and between 1983 and 1987 -- occurred amid economic booms. The current market, however, has galloped ahead while the economy proceeds at a sedate trot. Between October 1990 and the end of 1995, the gross domestic product rose (in current dollars) from $5.782 trillion to $7.248 trillion, an increase of 25 percent. During the same period, the S&P 500 rose from 295 to 615, an increase of 108 percent.  <p>
 The result is that "the size of the stock market in relationship to the size of the economy has never been larger," says James Bianco, director of research for Arbor Trading Group in Barrington, Illinois. During the past 70 years, Bianco notes, the capitalization of the equity markets averaged 48 percent of U.S. GDP. By the end of 1995, the ratio had risen to 87.5 percent -- higher than it was in 1929, 1968, or 1983.  <p>
 This suggests that the strength of the current market is based far less on the wealth of the nation than on the expectations and behavior of investors themselves.  <p>
 The lunch time crowd at <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab & Co.'s</b></a> World Trade Center office in Manhattan often includes a wide cross section of investors. On Monday, March 11, Richard Mautner, 62, is here to monitor the market with much the same emotion as the traders at the Big Board a few blocks away. Wearing a tweed jacket and graying at the temples, Mautner, a computer consultant, could easily be mistaken for a college professor. "The market's been good. How can anyone complain?" he asks. "I've been in for 39 years, and Friday's dip didn't rattle me at all. It would have to drop 15 to 20 percent to do that."  <p>
 Not that Mautner is expecting that kind of drop. "I feel good about the economy," he says. "America's genius is in coming up with ultimate applications for computer and telecommunications equipment. It's phenomenal." Mautner now has about 75 to 80 percent of his portfolio in stocks -- "an aggressive strategy for someone my age," he admits. But he figures the risk is well worth it:He anticipates earning a 10 to 12 percent annual return.  <p>
 Lily Gong is also watching the tape at the Schwab office. The 45-year-old computer programmer has been investing for about five years. She figures she suffered a paper loss of about $2,000 to $3,000 on Friday. No problem, though, she says. "Three years ago I switched $20,000 in my IRA from CDs to stocks. It's worth more than $50,000 now, so I can't complain. I'm planning for my retirement. I buy options and occasionally an individual stock. No bonds of any kind."  <p>
 Novice investor Michelle Lin bought her first mutual fund last year on the advice of a colleague. "Money in the bank or CDs is like nothing after taxes," says the 41-year-old researcher, who works at City University of New York. If the market dropped 20 percent tomorrow, she says, "I'd stay with it, and I might even purchase more. I have confidence in the market." She expects to earn 15 percent a year.  <p>
 And then there's Chris Centrella, a 36-year-old motion-picture cameraman from Santa Barbara, who says he put $50,000 into one mutual fund ten years ago and lost. "I wasn't knowledgeable about funds in general, so I didn't realize they could go down. Basically, I bought high and sold low," he says. Now he owns two funds and about a dozen stocks. "Over the long run, I'd like to make 20 percent a year."  <p>
 Are these folks kidding themselves? Perhaps, but the hopes expressedby the Schwab investors are also grounded in an appreciation of the financial realities they face as they plan for retirement. In fact, the psychology of investors like these may be the key to understanding the likely performance of the market over the next two decades.  <p>
 Millions of Americans are confronted with a choice between two types of risk -- market and lifetime. Yes, there is a possibility the stock market will perform below expectations, perhaps even well below expectations. At the same time, more and more people, especially baby boomers, are becoming aware of the risk that low-returning investments pose to their goals in life. These goals may include putting their children through college, paying off  the mortgage, and retiring comfortably. As threats to these goals come into focus and the chances of failure appear to mount, the comparative risk associated with owning stocks seems to diminish. <p>
 "There's the risk that you can lose your money," says Nancy Teeven, a vice president at Scudder Stevens & Clark, who directs the mutual-fund company's efforts to educate 401(k)-plan participants at client companies. "But there's also the risk that you can't get from point A to point B."  <p>
 According to Teeven, investors who are more educated about risk and their financial futures are more likely to put their money into the stock market. She notes that 56 percent of the $3 billion that Scudder handles in 401(k) plans is in equities, significantly above the national average of 43 percent, according to Access Research.  <p>
 Whether baby boomers are saving enough for retirement is one of the hottest topics of debate in retirement-planning and financial circles. A recent study by the Congressional Budget Office found that most baby boomers are likely to enjoy higher real incomes in retirement than their parents. (This isn't a very compelling piece of data, however; in 1992 the average income for an individual in the U.S. 65 years or older was just $14,899, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.) But the CBO's conclusions were based on the highly questionable assumptions that real wages will continue to grow, that Social Security and private pensions will remain intact, and that health-care costs will not climb faster than the rate of wage increases.  <p>
 Since boomers probably won't be able to count on Social Security and Medicare, let alone the above-average appreciation in housing prices that helped previous generations, pursuing higher returns in the stock market may be a rational adaptation to a changed financial landscape. We asked Michael Chasnoff , a financial planner at Advanced Capital Strategies in Cincinnati, to do a quick back-of-the-envelope savings plan for a couple, ages 45 and 42, with $100,000 in income. "They'll be able to retire at their current lifestyle level if they save $15,000 a year toward retirement in tax-deferred accounts and another $10,000 in taxable savings," said Chasnoff.  <p>
 But saving $25,000 a year on a pretax income of $100,000 is a tough task. Saving for retirement gets a lot easier if a couple assumes a higher rate of return. For example, if a couple saves $25,000 annually and puts the money into a portfolio of stocks and bonds that earns 8.5 percent, they'll have $1.21 million in 20 years. If they put that money into a portfolio consisting solely of stocks and assume the 10.5 percent return that has been the annual average since 1926, they need to save only $20,000 a year to accumulate the same nest egg.  <p>
All of this is important because the strength of investors' hopeshas become the defining characteristic of the stock market. <p>
 Looked at in any other way, by any measure, this market is highly overvalued. The price-to-book ratio for the stocks on the S&P 400 Industrials -- a measure of what investors are willing topay for the assets of these 400 companies -- isn't just at anall-time high; it's 50 percent higher than it was at the market peaks in 1929 and 1987. The ratio of the prices of the stocks in the S&P 500 to their dividend payouts is also "by far the highest in history," says James Stack of InvesTech in Whitefish, Montana. This ratio, which peaked at 33 in 1929 and 35 in 1987, stood at 45 in early March 1996, calculates Stack. The yield on the S&P 500 is also at a record low.  <p>
 "We're in uncharted waters," says Stack. "Each investor has to sit down and ask, Are we in a new era of unprecedented opportunity with a new paradigm [for the market and the economy], or are we in an era of unprecedented risk?"  <p>
 The 14.5 percent average annual return earned by the S&P 500 over the past 10 years is well above the 10.5 percent average annual return of the past 70 years. But the higher return of the past ten years is partly the result of a historic decline in interest rates that is now drawing to a close. Like a mountain climber who abandons his support team for a solo assault on the peak, this market is now climbing without the aid and comfort of its longtime companion.  <p>
 In 1981, the yield on long Treasury bonds hit 14.14 percent. On January 18, 1996, according to Ryan Labs Inc., the yield fell to just 5.52 percent. Notwithstanding some temporary blips, rates have fallen steadily for more than 14 years. That adds up tothe fourth major interest-rate wave to roll through the market this century. From 1900 to 1920, interest rates rose steadily.From 1920 to 1946, they declined, with the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds sliding from 5.32 percent in 1920 to 2.19 in 1946. From 1946 to  <p>
1981, bond investors suffered a steady erosion of the price of their bonds as rates rose steadily toward that 1981 high of 14.14. <p>
 As a result, the past decade has been extremely kind to equity investors. But bond investors haven't done too shabbily, either, since bonds have far outperformed their long-term track record of 5.17 percent average annual total return since 1926. For the past ten years, ten-year Treasury bonds have returned 8.49 percent annually -- not that far below the long-term historic returns on stocks.  <p>
 The problem is that this trend just cannot continue. If interest rates on the ten-year bond slide from their current level of about 6.5 percent to 5 percent by year-end, investors will reap a total return of about 15 percent, says Chip Norton, managing editor of IBC's Bond Fund Report. And that could happen if Congress and the president reward the bond market with a budget deal that really cuts the deficit.  <p>
 But, after that, what would the bond market do for an encore? Just to keep rates steady at 5 percent, history suggests, the Federal Reserve would have to hold inflation to no more than 3 percent a year. Nothing in the experience of the current generation of investors, who can easily remember the double-digit inflation of the late 1970s and early 1980s, shows that the Fed will be able to keep inflation on that tight a leash -- let alone drive it downward to the levels necessary to bring interest rates onthe ten-year bond significantly below 5 percent  <p>
 The outlook for corporate earnings (the other driving force behind the current market rally) is also beginning to blur. Earnings on the S&P 500 exploded out of the blocks at the end of 1991, climbing from $3.74 in the third quarter and $2.55 in the fourth quarter to $5.36 in the first quarter of 1992 -- more than justifying the expectations that had started the rally a year earlier. Earnings climbed again in 1993 (by almost 15 percent), 1994 (by 40 percent),and 1995 (by 11 percent).  <p>
 How much will earnings rise in 1996? Investors may be overestimating the pace of real growth. The profits that companies report publicly get a boost from different sources as a market and economic cycleages, according to Kurt Walters, vice president of research at Safian Investment Research in White Plains, New York. As an economic cycle reaches its later stages -- and growth begins to slow --companies start doing things to keep their earnings moving forward.They buy back stock, make acquisitions, and reshu쎤 their balance sheets. These and other activities give the impression that acompany's core business is doing better than it is. Walters believesthis is what's happening right now.   <p>
 The Bureau of Economic Analysis publishes numbers that attempt to factor out some of this static. For the second quarter of1995, the figures show a difference of 40.4 percent between reportedand real profits. This divergence is second only to the 49.1 percent recorded in the third quarter of 1974. For the third quarter of 1995, the most recent period available, the differenceis still 22.12 percent. Earnings will grow at just 7 to 9 percent this year, Walters believes.  <p>
 Few investors are focusing on this potential earnings problem. In fact, the market has pretty much decided to ignore such short-term calculations and instead place its faith in the presumed increased productivity and global competitiveness of U.S. business. Unfortunately,these qualities are remarkably hard to document.   <p>
 Manufacturing productivity did increase 4 percent in the U.S.in 1994, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But ofthe ten foreign economies the bureau tracks, seven matched or beat the U.S., and four -- Denmark, France, Germany, and the Netherlands -- had productivity gains of above 7 percent. There cord on unit labor costs isn't much better -- or much more definitive. Manufacturing labor costs in the U.S. decreased by 2.3 percent in 1994. The biggest increase in costs among U.S.competitors came in Japan at 7.5 percent, but that was clearly a result of the 9 percent rise in the value of the yen. In fact,only 3 of the 12 foreign economies the bureau tracks for this statistic showed increases after the data was corrected for currency fluctuations. Long-term investors should be asking how much of the vaunted U.S. competitive edge is due to the weak dollar and how much to changes within U.S. corporations.  <p>
 Right now, the liquidity factor -- the sheer volume of money chasing stocks -- has rendered many traditional ways of valuing equities virtually irrelevant. Or so many investors insist. They trust that the vast amount of money baby boomers are putting into the market will, in and of itself, drive stock prices up. It's a pure supply-and-demand equation.  <p>
 Certainly, the figures are impressive. In January 1996 alone,$29 billion in new money flowed into equity mutual funds. For all of 1995, the total was $123 billion. That's a net figure:the amount of money going into funds minus the amount withdrawn.To put this in perspective, the assets invested in all equity mutual funds in 1985 -- the total amount -- equaled $117 billion.  <p>
 This green tide seems practically assured to keep rising for some time. "For the average client, equities are pretty much the only game in town," says Ron Rog, a financial planner in Centereach, New York. Investors have gotten religion about this market, says Michael Chasnoff . "A lot of my clients believe there really is not as much risk to stocks and the economy as I perceive there to be."   <p>
 Giles Almond, a financial planner in Charlotte, North Carolina, shows what this means in day-to-day life: "Every payday here, we're a buyer [of equities] because we're investing our 401(k) and pension money. That's going on all over the country. And until that changes, there will always be buyers."  <p>
 The demand for stocks keeps growing. But what about the supply side -- the number of shares available to buy?  <p>
 Last year, according to Securities Data, companies issued $29 billion in new stock in initial public offerings, plus an additional $52 billion in secondary offerings (sales of new stock by existing public companies). But corporations announced 1,108 stock buy backs worth $99 billion over the same period. Net the two out, and you'll discover that the supply of stock potentially shrank --if companies actually complete their buybacks -- by about $18 billion.  <p>
 Granted, there isn't much historic evidence showing a true relationship between cash flow and rising markets. Net cash flows into equity mutual funds, for example, were positive all through 1987 up until the October crash. Equity-fund cash flows turned negative in 1971, long before the major market correction of 1973 to 1974. And at $6.4 trillion the total value of the stock market dwarfs all these numbers.  <p>
 So it's really the mood, or psychological state of the investing public, that's the true force driving this market.  <p>
 Investors today believe in the stock market in much the sameway Dutch investors in the 17th century believed in tulip bulbsor English investors in the 18th century believed trading companies would reap the riches of the South Seas. In those markets, prices lost all connection to value. "Once you've lost that anchor, any price-to-earnings ratio is justified," says Paul Samuelson, winner of the Nobel Prize for economics in 1970 and a professor emeritus of economics at MIT. "You're in a financial bubble." <p>
 Very few of today's investors in the U.S. have first hand experience with a bubble. Japan's bubble, which broke in 1989, was far away geographically. The collapse of the go-go funds and the Nifty Fifty stocks of the late 1960s and early 1970s is no more than a childhood memory for many baby boomers. Also, many investors who pooh-pooh the possibility that the current market could burst don't understand what a financial bubble really is.  <p>
 Bubbles have some surprising characteristics, according to Vernon Smith, director of the economics science laboratory at the University of Arizona, who has created more than a hundred financial bubbles in model stock markets.  <p>
 In one of his experiments, Smith issues his students shares and cash. The students can do nothing and simply collect the dividends on their shares: an average of 24 cents at the end of each of 15 periods (though some shares, selected randomly, pay as little as nothing and others as much as 60 cents). Or they can trade each share once each period, either buying or selling, at prices asked by the other student traders. These ground rules should make it easy for a student to calculate the fundamental value of a share. To make certain they know how, Smith explains the fundamental value at the end of each period. The fair price of a share is simply the average dividend timesthe number of remaining trading periods (15 times 24 cents, or $3.60, in the first period, $3.36 in the second, and so on). <p>
 Students who take part in the experiment for the first time almost always begin bidding for shares below their fundamental  value -- hoping for bargains -- during the early rounds. As the periods go by, however, they raise their bids, having been shut out on dividends in earlier rounds because their low ball tactics failed to get them the shares they wanted. So at this point,they bid what the stock is really worth -- only to discover that other students, also shut out, have raised the price. Eventually,the students produce a market bubble that finally bursts. "There's no misunderstanding about the fundamental value of a stock,"says Smith. "They just don't pay attention."  <p>
 Curiously, the same group of students typically does worse on a second run through the experiment. They produce a bubble more quickly, and it breaks more abruptly. (By the third time through, they've usually learned their lesson and trade at fundamental value throughout the experiment.)   <p>
 From post-experiment interviews, Smith reconstructs the students'reasoning. As the game progresses, the students begin to realize that "the market is overvalued, but there's no reason in their minds to get out. They're collecting dividends. They've seen  that stocks can trade above fundamental value," Smith says. The stock is worth what they can get for it, they tell Smith, sowhy would they sell? "All that theory about what it should beworth makes no difference." This, of course, is why the bursting bubble always comes as such a surprise. (Something to keep in mind the next time someone tells you that today's investors are too sophisticated to create a bubble.)  <p>
 Bubbles, however, can also remain inflated for a long time, which is precisely the problem investors face today. We know the bubble will burst eventually, but when? Should we just sit out the action in the meantime?  <p>
 From speculative boom to frenzied bust, the Florida real-estate bubble lasted two years. Investing in tulips reached full-fledged frenzy in the Netherlands in 1634. The bubble burst two years later when bulbs that had sold for 4,600 florins, a new carriage, two horses, and a harness just a short time before couldn't find a buyer -- the market's excesses had gradually built up in the years since the bulbs first became fashionable in the 1560s. The Japanese financial bubble ran for a decade. "My suspicionis that we're early in this game and not late," says Samuelson, pointing out that price-to-earnings ratios are not that far out of line yet.   <p>
 Any projections about what year the baby boomers will stop being a net source of liquidity to the stock market and start making net withdrawals are almost total conjecture at this point. Such forecasts depend heavily on assumptions about the rate of corporate downsizing, the average retirement age, the future of Social Security and Medicare, and the level of inflation in general and in college and health-care costs in particular. Current estimates point as far ahead as 2025 before stock-market cash flows begin to reverse direction.  <p>
 The trouble is that it's impossible to predict the end of a pyramid scheme. Logic doesn't help. If you rationally decide to get out in two years, then it makes sense that an equally rational investor might decide to get out in two years less one day. Follow that logic to its conclusion, and the only safe choiceis to get out tomorrow (or yesterday, if we're too late to the news stands with this issue). That's why bubbles collapse so quickly.(For strategies on investing in a long bubble, see the side bar below.)  <p>
 Fundamentals won't help predict the end, either, since the issue isn't real earnings or the ratio of yield on the S&P to the yield on the three-month Treasury bill. As long as people have faith, all will be well. But the instant they cease to believe in themarket, their apostasy will prick the bubble.  <p>
 What makes this bubble especially hard to figure out is the peculiar psychology of the baby-boom generation itself. This group is used to being the demographic tail that wags the dog, having turned its issues -- the Vietnam War, feminism, late child bearing, the need to care for elderly parents, environmentalism -- into the nation's issues.  <p>
 So far, the boomers appear to have convinced themselves that the financial world will be the way they wish it to be until the moment when the last among them has pulled his money out of the market and tucked it away in a Swiss bank.   <p>
 But that's almost guaranteed not to happen. At the moment this cynical scenario starts to gain credence, the bubble itself is doomed. At that point, a smart boomer who doesn't want to be the last one out of the pool will realize the time to pull out of the market is next year at the latest. A friend or competitor knowing that will decide to get out one day less than a year from now. And the rout will be on -- like the real-estate boom and bust of the late 1980s.  <p>
 Until then, here are three axioms to live by: All bubbles burst. No one can predict when, except by chance. And the door is neverwide enough to let all those who want to get out rush through at once.  <p>

<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>HOW TO BEAT A BUBBLE</font></b><p> <p>
The key is discipline -- buying only when the numbers look good, selling as soon as they look bad  <p>
 By Jim Jubak  <p>
 The standard financial advice -- ignore market cycles, and buy and hold for the long term, and if you can't do that, then get out and sit on your cash until the dust clears -- isn't well suited to the market that seems to be unfolding now. If we are indeed in the early stages of a serious bubble, investors could wind up parked on the sidelines for years. On the other hand, ignoring the way a bubble distorts valuations is just asking to be blindsided.  <p>
 Fortunately, even in this kind of market, basic investing principles will serve an investor well. Equity investors who tightly discipline their buying and stick to tough guidelines for deciding when to sell should be able to weather a bubble. They'll automatically move out of the market as valuations get increasingly out of line in the bubble's later stages.  <p>
 A market like this changes the ratio between risks and rewards. For example, because of price appreciation, equities are now showing historically low dividend yields, and that makes equities more risky for the long-term investor. Investors in large-cap stocks who suffered through the 1929 crash had to wait until 1943 to see the value of their assets recover to the level of 1928. If those stocks hadn't paid dividends and investors had been forced to rely on capital gains alone to make them whole, they would have been in the red until 1952.  <p>
 The best way to manage equity risk in a market like this is to avoid over paying for a stock. But that's a hard discipline to maintain as a bubble develops and stocks that are overpriced on their fundamentals keep going up and up. <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a>, for example,is without doubt one of the great growth companies in the world, exactly the kind of safe stock many investors want for their retirement portfolio. But it recently traded at a price-to-earnings ratio of 35, perhaps a bit pricey for a company that just projected unit sales growth for the long term at 7 to 8 percent. That's a higher p/e ratio than the company received on average for any year as far back as 1979. Yet this hasn't stopped 13 of the 27 analysts that follow the company from giving the stock a buy or strong-buy rating, according to Zacks Investment Research. <p>
 Historic price-to-earnings ratios are a good starting place for valuing stocks in this market. One simple rule might be not to buy any stock trading at a p/e above the stock's highest average annual p/e dating back through 1979. That covers a number of economic and market cycles.  <p>
 An investor who sets out to follow this rule (you'll find historic p/e ratios in Value Line) will uncover lots of surprises. <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>, for example, trades at a p/e of 15. Its p/e was, on average, 29 in 1987. <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a> trades at a p/e of 19. You'd have to go back to 1991 to find a year when, on average, the stock was cheaper.(For more ways to think about the price of growth stocks, see the "Investing" section in this issue and the February issue, as well as Peter Lynch's February column.)  <p>
 But valuations based on historic p/e's -- and any other earnings-based formula -- will work in this market only for investors who dig into financial statements deeply enough to distinguish between companies that are showing real earnings growth in their continuing operations and those that have used accounting rules to change reported earnings. For example, for the fourth quarter of 1995, PepsiCo took a $520 million pretax write-off -- what it called a charge against impaired assets. The company decided to write off the restaurants in its Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Kentucky Fried Chicken chains that weren't doing well. The charge lowered earnings for the quarter, but it will also appear to increase earnings in the future, since the company won't have to depreciate these restaurants year to year against earnings.   <p>
 Puzzles like this are why some analysts are looking at cashflow to judge the real earnings of a company. Look for cash-flow growth at the rate of 12 percent, advises Kurt Walters of Safian Investment Research. "If cash flow is growing at that rate,"he says, "earnings should be growing at a similar rate." (Value Line and Standard & Poor's report annual cash flow per share. Investors can calculate a growth rate from those figures.)  <p>
 As for the other side of prospering in this market, timely selling, it's relatively simple to set a target selling price for a stock. Estimate an annual growth rate for earnings over the next five years, using sources such as Value Line, Standard & Poor's, and company reports. Compound current earnings per share at that rate to calculate earnings per share five years from now. Looking at historic price-to-earnings ratios, pick a high p/e that the market might award the stock five years hence. Multiply thatp/e by earnings to determine a target price for five years out.Keep the target updated as the company reports new earnings.If the company hits the target or shows signs of faltering, sell. <p>
 Investors who maintain strict buying and selling disciplines will have a harder time finding stocks to buy and reasons notto sell as a bubble develops. They will actually be forced to the sidelines without ever having to make a market call. And that's the point.    <p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> THE LOWDOWN ON DRIPS   <p> By Doug Garr  <p> Q: What is a DRIP?  <p> A: In the investment world, a DRIP can certainly be a whiny, annoying person, but the initials are more likely to refer to a dividend-reinvestment plan. A DRIP lets individuals buy shares in a company directly from that company without a brokerage fee. <p>  <p>Do all companies offer DRIPs?  <p> No. But since the Securities and Exchange Commission relaxed filing regulations, making it easier to set up these plans, more companies have begun offering them to attract long-terminvestors. Currently, about 1,000 companies, including <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a>,<a name="NYSE:XON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10537"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Exxon</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a>, and Procter & Gamble, offer DRIPs.  <p>  <p>What is a no-load DRIP?  <p> In the past, investors had to buy the initial shares in a company through a broker and pay a commission before they could sign up for more shares directly. But companies have begun offering DRIPs that enable investors to buy even the first shares directly. About 80 companies, including Exxon and McDonald's, now offer no-load DRIPs. (Some impose restrictions such as requiring an investor to be a customer of the company.)  <p>  <p>Discount brokers are starting to offer DRIPs that provide a consolidated statement. How do they work?   <p> The DRIP plans set up by brokerages work differently from company plans. An investor can automatically reinvest dividends through the brokerage plans without commissions, but those who use cash to buy more shares will be charged the usual fees.   <p>  <p>What are the disadvantages of DRIPs?  <p> DRIPs can create a lot of paperwork because investors must keep track of the statements and stock certificates sent out by each company. Some companies also charge a small annual fee.  <p>  <p>How do I get a list of companies offering DRIPs?  <p> Contact Evergreen Enterprises, P.O. Box 763, Laurel, Maryland, <p>20725, (301) 549-3939. Its directory costs $29.95.  <p><p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> BEER BLAST <p>Investors are drinking up these IPO's here that stands for Initial Pub Offering   <p> By Doug Garr  <p> Wall Street is having a keg party. in the past year, at least a dozen beer companies have gone public, many selling small blocks of stock directly to investors. <a name="NASD:HOOK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=44090"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Redhook</b></a> of Seattle;  <a name="NASD:WIKD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41353"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pete's Brewing</b></a> of Palo Alto, California;<a name="NYSE:SAM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=40674"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b> Boston Beer</b></a> (the maker of Samuel Adams);and others have investors in a froth.   <p> The offerings are tapping into the national enthusiasm for microbreweries, small regional companies that market their lagers, ales, porters, and stouts as distinctive alternatives to mass-market national brands. Boston Beer, the nation's largest microbrewery,  first priced its shares at $10 to $15 each but, sensing huge demand, upped the offering price to $20 when the stock  first traded in November. The stock surged $8 a share on day one, closing at $32 by the end of the week. It has since settled into the $26-to-$27-a-share range. Redhook and Pete's experienced similar first-day frenzies.   <p> Boston Beer sold part of its offering directly to beer drinkers by inserting a coupon into a six-pack of Samuel Adams, earning goodwill from investors who might otherwise have been unable to buy shares. Boston Beer's stock was quickly oversubscribed: Some 60,000 investors had their checks returned.   <p> Microbreweries are hot now, but how long will they keep rewarding investors? "You'll see the end of it when some companies reportless than stellar earnings," says Tricia Reebs, portfolio manager for Sea first Investment Counselors in Seattle. Many of these stocks have been bid up out of proportion to earnings, she says,and current growth is probably not sustainable. She compares the microbrewery phenomenon to the coffee fad sparked by the success of <a name="NASD:SBUX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15745"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Starbucks</b></a>.

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> CLUB NASDAQ--SPECIAL REPORT <p>It calls itself the "stock market for the next 100 years." Butin the here and now, it operates more like a clip joint. Thechief regulator is a big part of the problem.  <p> By Gretchen Morgenson  <p> The National Association of Securities Dealers spends millionsof dollars on sleek-looking, fast-paced ads touting its computerizedNasdaq system as "the stock market for the next 100 years." Andperhaps it is. <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>, <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>, <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI Communications</b></a>, and otherleaders in cutting-edge industries list on Nasdaq. NASD's revenuein 1993, the most recent year for which data is available, was$332 million, more than double its revenue in 1988. In the lastfive years alone, the number of securities traded on Nasdaq,once home to only the most obscure companies, grew by over 22percent to 5,761 issues.   <p> This burgeoning operation would certainly astonish the NASDfounders, who decided in 1938 to "promote the investment bankingand securities business" by creating a corporation to run whatbecame the over-the-counter trading system. Two thirds of thecorporation's revenues come from market-information and transactionservice fees, issuer fees, and member assessments. In additionto Nasdaq, the NASD today oversees the operations of 5,300 memberbrokerage firms, with 46,000 branch offices and almost half amillion registered employees.  <p> The NASD's achievements are certainly noteworthy. But only inpart. Hidden behind the glossy public image is another NASD,one that uses its growing wealth and reach to shield the intimidationand overcharging of individual investors while zealously pursuingthe interests of its powerful members, such as Merrill Lynchand Morgan Stanley. Indeed, despite its privileged status asthe nation's largest self-regulated organization, the NASD sofar has shown little inclination to act in anyone's interestbut its own.  <p> The NASD's mandate states that the organization should promote"high standards of commercial honor and observance of federaland state securities laws among its members." But it is in thisvenue that the NASD now finds itself under assault. Ongoing investigationsmounted last year by the Justice Department and the Securitiesand Exchange Commission are exploring whether the NASD may havehelped nurture an insider-oriented market that condones pricefixing and other techniques for separating customers from theirmoney.  <p> Much of the problem springs from the NASD's lax self-regulatoryactivities. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas wrote thatindustries could police themselves effectively only if the governmentkept a "shotgun ... behind the door, well-oiled, cleaned, readyfor use."In this case, there isn't one핦nly the amiable and understaffedSEC. When it comes to the NASD, the SEC is more like a popgun. <p> Ever since the fox and the henhouse, self-regulation has beena dangerous proposition. But it has worked in some cases. TheNYSE, for example, policed itself quite closely during the late1980s, according to a study published last year in Administration& Society, an academic journal. By contrast, the NASD often doeslittle to address problems that are brought to its attention,many sources say.  <p> "Working with the NASD on enforcement matters was not satisfactory,"says Stephan Hodge, who served as head of the Indiana State SecuritiesCommission until last December. "They were not aggressive withenforcement actions even when regulators presented them withstrong evidence against one of their members. They're a membershiporganization, and they're controlled by their members. They onlygo after the worst actors하nd even then, not aggressively." <p> Faced with such a track record, smart investors won't be reassuredby some recent noises the NASD has been making about internalreform. And the SEC may not be mollified, either. In any self-regulatedorganization, "there is an inherent tension between members'self-interest and the public interest," says Brandon Becker,the SEC's director of market regulation. "We share the concernthat an SRO not allow its structure to disadvantage the public." <p> As a result, the individual investors who trade on Nasdaq arelargely at the mercy of the NASD. And despite its rhetoric, theNASD doesn't often go out of its way to police members. The organization'strue constituency is found in big and midsize brokerage firms.Executives at these firms fill the NASD's board of governorsand its 29 committees. They run the show.  <p> Predictably, the NASD has been good to these folks. Take theexample of The Sherwood Group, a brokerage that trades approximately4,200 Nasdaq stocks in New York City, Denver, Minneapolis, Chicago,and Los Angeles. Sherwood's narrow focus on Nasdaq issues providesa telling window on that market's economics. The company's revenueballooned almost 50 percent last year, to $85 million. Even morenotable was Sherwood's 20 percent net profit margin합ignificantlyhigher than the margin at brokerage houses that trade securitiesin other markets as well. Clearly, the NASD's system rewardsits member firms abundantly.  <p> These are the same people who now claim the organization willreform itself without outside intervention. Doubtless, othertelevision ads will hail such efforts. But investors should bewary.  <p> David Whitcomb, a finance professor at Rutgers University andexpert on the microstructure of markets, has made a study ofNasdaq and has been critical of its recent attempts at reform.Whitcomb is not surprised that Nasdaq hasn't come up with much."NASD has no incentive to do anything," he says, "because asan SRO it is first and foremost respecting the interest of thedealer firms핪hey are very satisfied with the status quo."  <p> The NASD undoubtedly would take issue with much of the contentof this story. It's unlikely, for instance, the organizationwould admit publicly that it operates more like a club for insidersthan a guardian of public trust. Yet despite repeated requestsfor interviews핪he first made more than a month before this story'sdeadline핦fficials at the NASD elected to remain mum about thespecific issues raised here. Twice, the NASD also was providedwith a list of questions핦ne of these was given ten days beforethe due date; the other gave the NASD a full business day tooffer even a general response. Yet throughout this back-and-forth,the only comments forthcoming from NASD officials were complaintsthat the organization wasn't being given enough time to respond.(The SEC, by comparison, took only a few days to respond to ourquestions.) At one point, an NASD official offered to schedulean interview, but not until after the magazine was scheduledto go to press. In the absence of any substantive comments, certainopinions expressed by the NASD and its officials in the pasthave been inserted below in an effort to reflect the organization'spublic views.  <p>  <p>yesterday and today: The spread  <p> John Brooks, author of The Go-Go Years, a study of the marketsof the 1960s and 1970s, describes the over-the-counter marketof that era as a "thicket of rumor, confusion and secrecy." There,writes Brooks, "the opportunities for manipulation were endless."Brooks describes deals "conducted in windowless back rooms byexcitable hagglers, many with a full measure of larceny in theirblood, and policed only negligently by the overworked and understaffedSEC..." Although technology brought a modicum of order to thisunruly scene, Brooks would find much to recognize in Nasdaq tothis day.  <p> The NASD's trading system is an amorphous creature. Unlike theNew York and American stock exchanges, it doesn't have a tradingfloor핦r any easily observable, centralized location where ordersare paired off. Instead, price quotes are transmitted via phonelines and flashed on the computer screens of brokers around thenation. To trade the stocks, Nasdaq relies largely on a hostof brokerage firms to carry out the buying and selling of individualissues. The NYSE and AMEX use an auction method. Each assignsa single specialist working on the floor of the exchange to eachstock. The specialists match up orders from buyers and sellers,and step in to make up the difference when demand on one sideis exceeded on the other.  <p> Nasdaq's cybersystem, however, allows for multiple market makers하naverage of 11 for each stock학ased in more than 500 locationsaround the country. This diffuse, hard-to-monitor web resultsin a market that's lucrative for the NASD's member brokerages학utnot so rich for their clients. To understand why this is so,it's helpful to explain the concept of spreads.  <p> Rather than match up similarly priced buy and sell orders, Nasdaqmarket makers quote two prices for every stock: The "bid," orwhat a buyer is willing to pay, and the "asked," or what a selleris willing to accept. The difference between the prices is calledthe spread핪he territory where these middlemen make money frominvestors. If you sell to them, they pay the lower price. Ifyou buy from them, you pay the higher one. What's important hereis that the Nasdaq system has consistently wide spreads, makingit by far the most expensive exchange on which to buy and sellstocks. One way to put those higher costs in perspective is tocompare Nasdaq's biggest, most liquid stocks핪hose found on itsNational Market System list핪o shares in identical price categorieson the AMEX. In February, stocks trading for under $10 a shareon the NMS list carried an average spread of 8.2 percent, versus6.1 percent on the AMEX. NMS shares priced between $10 and $20carried average spreads of almost 4 percent, compared with 1.7percent on the AMEX. And NMS shares at $40 and up carried anaverage spread of 1.6 percent, versus 0.9 percent on the AMEX.The Nasdaq market makers take a bigger cut at every level.  <p> Another way to measure the same thing: Trading costs for institutionalinvestors were two and a half times greater on Nasdaq than onother listed markets between 1991 and 1993, according to a studypublished in February by the Rodney L. White Center for FinancialResearch at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.And institutions don't often trade in obscure, thinly tradedstocksNasdaq's usual scapegoat for its wider-than-average spreads. <p> As an illustration of the phenomenon, consider Semtech, a semiconductorcompany based in Newbury Park, California. Trading in Semtech'sshares moved to the Nasdaq market from the AMEX earlier thisyear. Before the move, the stock usually carried a spread ofone quarter of a point. Once Semtech was on Nasdaq, however,the spread in the stock jumped to a full point$1 a share. InMarch, this was equivalent to 7.5 percent of the stock's price,meaning that investors who purchased Semtech shares would lose7.5 percent if they sold immediately, not even counting commissions.In most Nasdaq stocks, investors start out deep in the hole whenthey buy.  <p> The issue of why companies want to have their shares listedon Nasdaq is an interesting one, particularly given the highcosts of trading there. (See "Forward Thinking" on page 11.)MCI Communications has long been on Nasdaq and plans to stay.MCI spokesman Kevin Inda says: "We're pleased with Nasdaq; theservices they provide us parallel our technology." Inda rejectsthe notion that MCI's continuing support of Nasdaq has anythingto do with a recent $150 million contract the company won torun Nasdaq's phone operations.  <p> Not everyone pays huge premiums to trade on Nasdaq, mind you.Spreads in the Nasdaq insiders' market핪rading among market makersthemselves하re much more favorable than in the outsiders' market.And since each stock has numerous market makers, active "discounted"trading is possible, and Nasdaq insiders can flourish at theexpense of outside investors they're supposed to serve.  <p> Nasdaq's public customers can't really avoid giving these middlemena piece of the action, either. On the NYSE and AMEX, investorsoften meet and complete trades without paying anything at allto a middleman. The specialist system facilitates this action,known as a cross. Crosses happen about 90 percent of the timeon the two exchanges. But on Nasdaq, crosses happen in only 1.8percent of trades, according to an article published last yearin the Stanford Journal of Law, Business & Finance. That meansthat in 98.2 percent of Nasdaq trades, someone is skimming offcream.  <p> The money made off investors in this little game is enormous.Exactly how enormous is hard to quantify: NASD members' profitsfrom market making are not publicly available하nd big, publicbrokerage firms don't break down their results that way. TheSherwood Group's 20 percent margin provides a clue.  <p> Wide Nasdaq spreads aren't just harmful to investors' profits;they go to the heart of the Justice Department's ongoing investigationof possible collusion among market makers. The inquiry boilsdown to this: Is Nasdaq actually a competitive market, as itclaims? And if so, how come different market makers' quotes fora particular stock tend to mirror each other all day long, everyday? Why, when one market maker moves his bid up, does the packtend to follow suit? Some of the possible answers to these questionsare worrisome.  <p>  <p>old cowboys never die  <p> Like other big stock markets, Nasdaq requires its market makersto report their trades within 90 seconds of execution. Peoplemiss deadlines in any helter-skelter business, of course. Buta pattern of systematic lateness is troubling because it providesa golden opportunity for cheating. To understand this, imaginea market maker with "a full measure of larceny," as John Brooksmight say.  <p> When a market maker fulfills a customer's buy order학y sellinghim the stock핪he market maker should report the transactionimmediately. But suppose the stock is going up. The market makermight wait a short while and execute a new trade at a higherprice. He could then report the second trade as a late executionof the customer's order하nd keep the lower-priced shares, onwhich there is already a paper profit, for his own account. There'sno risk in this strategy: If the stock's price falls insteadof rising, the market maker simply sticks the customer with theinitial trade and doesn't make a second trade. This scenario,known in industry parlance as "painting the tape," is whollyunprofessional. But because the NASD has policed its membersso loosely, the temptation to fudge is huge. In January alone,more than 11 percent of Nasdaq trades came in late. Measuredunder identical standards, just 0.22 percent of the AMEX's tradeswere late. The NYSE reported that 0.6 percent of its trades camein after the deadline. It's impossible to determine what percentageof the late trades on Nasdaq, if any, involve painting the tape.But from a customer's point of view, what's important is thatit is impossible to know that it is not happening with greatfrequency.  <p> Another of the Wild West practices from the old OTC market iscalled "backing away"항hen market makers refuse to honor theirown quotes (because doing so would result in a loss). On theNYSE or AMEX, this can't happen: Specialists are obligated tolive up to their bids and offers. The NASD supposedly prohibitsbacking away, too, but it doesn't always act firmly when a firmbreaks the rules.  <p> On January 31, 1994, Datek Securities, a small but aggressiveNew York City brokerage, called huge Morgan Stanley on the carpetfor backing away from quotes on six occasions. After a year ofinvestigation, the NASD sided with Datek. Yet even though theNASD's own guidelines called for a $5,000 penalty for five suchviolations, Morgan Stanley's six violations earned it only a$1,000 slap핟ardly a sign of strong self-regulation. Executivesfrom Morgan Stanley sit on 7 of the NASD's 29 committees, notesAnthony Sanzio, an official at Datek. Datek isn't representedon any NASD committee.  <p> None of the NASD's recently proposed changes specifically addresseither painting the tape or backing away.  <p>  <p>big problems, half solutions  <p> By allowing for multiple market makers, the NASD encouragesits members to buy and sell customer orders as well as stocks.Nasdaq participants routinely pay to be allowed to execute eachothers' trades. "Payment for order flow," as this practice iscalled, has distinct advantages for Nasdaq market makers: Inessence, it guarantees them a steady volume of business. Andthe price for this predictability is low핫sually a few centsper order.  <p> But payment for order flow adds disproportionately to investors'trading costs on Nasdaq. Why? Because market makers don't competeas strongly against one another. Once a firm has lined up a steadyflow of trades학y paying for them할t loses the strongest incentiveto execute every trade at the best possible price핪he need toensure repeat business.  <p> Joseph Hardiman, the NASD's chief executive officer, has saidthat payment for order flow doesn't hurt individual investors.As evidence, he has cited an NASD study concluding that suchpayments "actually encourage lower execution costs and enhanceservices to investors." But Marshall Blume and Michael Goldsteinfound just the opposite in a 1992 study published by the WhartonSchool's Rodney L. White Center. The study said that brokerswho receive payments for order flow "have an incentive to sendorders to that market even when another market might on averageprovide better prices." And executives from the NYSE and AMEXhave testified against the practice on Capitol Hill. In May 1993,Richard Grasso, then president of the NYSE, urged that paymentfor order flow be banned entirely because it "harms the marketas a whole."  <p> The SEC doesn't go this far; it recently floated the idea ofrequiring brokerage firms to inform their clients about paymentsfor order flow, without changing the practice itself. The NASDwill have to go along, if grudgingly. But even this half-measurehas now been postponed by at least six months. It is set to beunveiled in October; the SEC's Brandon Becker says the delaywill allow for more discussion of improvements to the plan. <p> Meanwhile, have you ever heard of something called a 19c-3 security?Most investors haven't. It's a stock that was first listed onthe NYSE or AMEX after April 26, 1979. The SEC's rule 19c-3 allowsmarket makers to trade these shares on Nasdaq학ypassing the moreprice-efficient stock exchanges. And this happens more oftenthan most investors realize, because the incentives for brokeragesto do it are huge.  <p> The brokers themselves benefit as well. Take, for instance,a Smith Barney customer who wants to buy an NYSE-listed stocksuch as RJR Nabisco. Justifiably, he might imagine that his tradewill occur on the NYSE. But if that happens, his broker willget just 33 percent of the gross commission. If the broker directsthe RJR trade to his firm's 19c-3 desk, by contrast, he keeps40 percent. And he's free to do that as long as the customer항houltimately pays the freight핛oesn't specify otherwise.  <p> Earlier this year, the NASD responded to SEC concerns aboutits members' 19c-3 practices. Indeed, according to NYSE and AMEXsources, Nasdaq market makers who trade in listed stocks oftendo so at a price outside the proper bid-asked range핞iving customerswoefully bad executions. The NASD's solution? Not to ban such"trade-throughs," certainly. Instead, it would continue 19c-3trading under more limited circumstances.  <p> In return for this modest gesture, the NASD wants a big favor:It wants no restrictions on the number of NYSE and AMEX stocksit is allowed to trade. As a self-policing measure, this amountsto promising to take less from more people.  <p>  <p>the watchdog that doesn't bark  <p> Making sure brokers follow the rules is a crucial part of NASD'sjob as a self-regulated organization. Yet according to stateregulators, securities lawyers and even executives at some ofits member firms, the NASD is alarmingly lax in this regard.In Indiana last summer, regulators got so mad at the NASD thatWoody Burton, a member of the state's House of Representatives,tried to scupper Nasdaq by introducing legislation that wouldhave required all companies trading on Nasdaq to register theirfinancial filings with the state securities commission. The ideawas to create a blizzard of red tape.  <p> This may have been an extreme move, but Burton says he was simplyfed up with the NASD's do-nothing approach. "Brokers sell securitieshere that are close to being a scam하nd when the heat turns on,they shut shop, move, and start up again in another state," hecomplains. "The NASD won't supply us with information about thesepeople. When asked, they said it wasn't proper. I wrote the NASDa letter, and they didn't even reply."  <p> Ultimately, Burton withdrew his bill, feeling he had made hispoint. But state regulators such as Stephen Diamond, securitiescommissioner for Maine, have similar complaints. "Cooperationfrom the NASD has been mixed," he says. "We license people andthey license people. We have about 300 people annually whoseapplications are withdrawn because of our questions. But theNASD has issued licenses to them."  <p> Before 1991, state regulators provided the public with whatamounted to background checks on brokers. Investors could learnabout a broker's employment history, all adjudicated or settledlawsuits, and any run-ins with regulators. Today, the NASD runsa hot line that is supposed to provide the same service. Butit is not nearly as educational. "Disciplinary information abouta broker is sometimes not being made available," CongressmanEdward Markey of Massachusetts wrote in a letter last Septemberto the General Accounting Office, a sort of government auditor.Markey asked the GAO to investigate the hot line last September,citing cases involving brokers in Massachusetts and in Michigan. <p> In the Massachusetts case, state regulators had taken swipesat broker Gerald Swirsky. According to correspondence betweenMarkey and regulators, these included a 1993 action barring Swirskyfor two years from discretionary trading in customer accountsand from acting as principal, officer, director, supervisor,or manager of any securities firm that employed him. Massachusettsofficials had also suspended Swirsky from selling securitiesthere at all for two months as punishment for having sold securitieswhile he wasn't registered. Swirsky had similar restrictionsplaced on him by the state of Florida. Yet none of this appearedon records the NASD made available to investors who called itshot line. Asked why, the NASD replied: "The Florida and Massachusettsrecords are not 녃isciplinary actions' covered by the NASD'sdisclosure policy. Rather, they are informal restrictive agreementsnegotiated between the state and the individual."  <p> The case of Thomas Bandyk was even more alarming to Markey.Although the hot line report on Bandyk mentioned three pendingor completed disciplinary actions, it failed to disclose morethan a dozen financial settlements involving the broker. Thesesettlements had resulted from arbitration initiated by disgruntledcustomers and amounted to nearly $750,000 in total. Accordingto the Markey correspondence, Bandyk had a pattern of behaviorthat any prospective investor would want to know about. But theNASD says that "such disclosures could inhibit the ability orwillingness of parties to reach a settlement."It also says itspolicy "recognizes that there many be many valid business reasons,other than an admission of wrongdoing, to settle a dispute." <p> In a letter to Markey, the NASD did concede that Bandyk's casewas "especially disturbing" because of the large number of settleddisputes하nd the big money involved. But, perhaps in the beliefthat the Bandyk case was an aberration, the NASD's letter concluded:"We continue to believe ... that the answer to the problem-brokerissue is not making the entire [disciplinary] record availableto the public." The NASD wants to continue limiting the informationit reports to investors.  <p>  <p>rough justice, nasd-style  <p> Thanks to a landmark 1987 Supreme Court case, Shearson v. McMahon,arbitration is virtually the only game in town for customerswho want justice from NASD member firms and their brokers. Doinvestors get a fair shake from this self-regulated organization?Wayne Klein, Idaho's securities regulator, doesn't think so.Neither do lawyers who have seen the NASD's arbitration fees핧ayableeven if the NASD member is found liable합kyrocket in recent years. <p> Not long after the Shearson decision, the NASD revised its feestructure upward. Since 1990 the organization's revenue fromarbitration fees has more than doubled, rising to $7.5 millionin 1993. Aggrieved investors also must pay costs of duplicatingtranscripts and tapes, expenses for any experts who may testify,and lawyers' fees.  <p> These costs might not matter so much if justice seemed to beserved. But NASD arbitration isn't exactly a balanced process.Investors must take their gripes before a panel of arbitratorsselected for each case. According to the NASD Manual, these judgesshould be "impartial persons knowledgeable in the areas of controversy."Sources familiar with the panels, however, say the same groupof arbitrators are used time and again.   <p> Keeping arbitrators in line may not be as hard as it might seem.Arthur Schwartzstein, a Washington, D.C., securities lawyer,says that during training sessions he attended, potential arbitratorswere not encouraged to be impartial. Instead, they were indoctrinatedinto the industry mindset. For instance, trainers said that bigpunitive damage awards aren't in the industry's interest. Trainersalso stated that investors ought not be allowed to recoup commissionsin cases where a broker is found to have "churned" an account,or made an excessive number of trades.   <p> The dice may be loaded in the NASD's internal proceedings핪heSEC found that  in at least one case. In 1992, the NASD chargedmember firm Datek Securities with splitting large orders intoparts before entering them on an automated trading system calledthe Small Order Execution System. A disciplinary panel foundthat Datek had split the orders to circumvent order-size limitson SOES. It suspended Datek's head trader, Sheldon Maschler,and disconnected the firm from SOES for three months.  <p> Datek appealed the NASD's finding to the SEC, claiming therehad been a conflict of interest on the disciplinary panel. Twoof the three panelists were from Smith Barney and Shearson LehmanBrothers, which had participated in almost 20 percent of thetransactions in the case. This in spite of the fact that theNASD Manual states: "No member of the Board of Governors or ofany committee of the Corporation shall directly or indirectlyparticipate in any adjudication ... which would ... substantiallyaffect ... the interests of any person in whom he is directlyor indirectly interested."  <p> The NASD told the SEC that the panelists had acted fairly despitetheir obvious conflict. But the SEC ruled that the NASD "failedto confront directly the issue of bias." It reversed the NASD'sfindings and overturned the sanctions against Datek.  <p> The NASD, meanwhile, doesn't propose any changes in either itsarbitration or disciplinary proceedings. Furthermore, it's backon Datek's trail. It recently reopened the case핪his time witha new, conflict-free set of panelists.  <p>  <p>protecting the guilty  <p> In another instance of siding with brokers over the public,the NASD last year submitted a proposal to eliminate punitivedamages in arbitration cases brought against brokers.   <p> Wayne Klein, Idaho's state securities regulator, calls the NASDproposal an example of the organization's brokerage-industrybias. In a letter to the NASD, Klein wrote: "If the NASD is goingto make a proposal that would so favor its members and so disadvantageindividual investors who are victimized, I think the Associationshould make it clear that it is acting as a trade associationand is not acting in its capacity as a regulator."  <p> Klein believes investors should be able to seek punitive damagesagainst brokerage firms because arbitration is now the mandatoryroute to redress for wronged investors. Remedies under that systemshould not be limited, he says, adding: "Having made arbitrationmandatory, the firms항ith the assistance of the NASD핟ave thetemerity to seek to limit the remedies of investors in that forum." <p> Problem brokers and securities-firm employees would seem tobe an issue that the NASD should pursue with alacrity and a vengeance.But two very different situations illustrate that such is notalways the case.  <p> One pertains to a smallish firm whose principal, when relayingthe story, asked for anonymity out of fear of retribution bythe NASD. Last year, this person's firm fired several high-levelemployees after learning that they had broken securities regulations.Among other things, they had arranged side deals for themselves,hidden documents from management, and stolen management feesdue the firm. The firm reported the details to the NASD.  <p> Later, however, our source learned that the dismissed employeeshad simply set up a new brokerage firm down the street, registeringas a member with the NASD. Baffled, the principal telephonedthe NASD to ask how it could let such people loose on the public,knowing what it did about their recent behavior. According tothis person, the NASD responded: "We can't stand in the way ofpeople making a living."  <p> The second example involves an arbitration case brought successfullyby investor Susan S. Erb against Oscar J. Leon, a broker formerlyemployed by Legg Mason in McLean, Virginia. According to thecase summary, Leon forged his client's name on checks, whichhe then cashed himself. He also prepared a false portfolio reportto deceive Erb about the value of her holdings, all the whilechurning her account. Erb suffered $164,000 in trading losses,$20,000 in margin expenses, and $83,000 in losses from forgedchecks and wire transfers.  <p> After seven hearings in the NASD district office in Washington,D.C., NASD arbitrators awarded Erb $420,000, plus interest. Nevertheless,Arthur M. Schwartzstein, Erb's attorney, was outraged by theproceedings. First, he says, the investigator initially assignedto the case하n aggressive, professional individual in Schwartzstein'sview항as pulled off the case by the NASD. Why? According to Schwartzstein,someone objected to this investigator and persuaded the NASDto come up with a replacement.   <p> Then, after the arbitration proceedings were concluded, in theface of evidence of forgeries and churning, the NASD closed itsown disciplinary case against Leon, taking no action whatsoeveragainst him. Says Schwartzstein: "Once you've reported forgeries,the NASD has an obligation to look into it." According to courtdocuments,  Leon had also forged checks and stolen money fromthree other clients' accounts in addition to Erb in 1993.   <p>  <p>What's in store for the NASD?   <p> With the Justice Department on its trail, the NASD of tomorrowcould look very different from that of today. A complete overhaulof the Nasdaq dealer system could be in order. In a 1975 amendmentto the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Congress essentiallyordered the SEC to find a way to make public orders meet withoutthe intervention of a dealer. Section 11A states: "It is in thepublic interest and appropriate for the protection of investorsand the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to assure ...an opportunity ... for investors' orders to be executed withoutthe participation of a dealer." To the detriment of the public,this mandate has not been achieved at Nasdaq. Dealer intervention항ithall its attending problems핟as continued, full force.   <p> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - -   <p>   <p> Trade NASDAQ Like a Pro  <p> By Gretchen Morgenson  <p> Trading in Nasdaq stocks can be a costly proposition할n moreways than one. Nevertheless, shunning all Nasdaq stocks isn'trealistic for most investors, either. Here are some ways to makesure your interests come first when trading on the Nasdaq:  <p>  <p>Don't buy or sell Nasdaq shares "at the market."   <p> This effectively gives your broker a license to execute yourorder in the worst way possible (for you). Market orders makesense only if you want to get in or out of a stock at any price.  <p>  <p>Do use limit orders.  <p> If you trade through a full-service broker, ask him or her to"work" your trade핧utting it in at a price between the bid andasked. If your broker values your business, chances are goodthat you'll get your price. Some patience may be required.  <p> Discount brokers are less likely to help with this. Most smalldiscounters aren't market makers, so they have to send tradesto other firms for execution. Also, since discounters chargereduced commissions, they have less incentive to help investorscut costs in other ways. Discount houses with market-making subsidiaries,like Charles Schwab and Olde Discount, don't like to work tradeseither, because that means giving up a portion of the money theyearn on the spread. People who trade Nasdaq stocks in large amountseasily can save money using full-service brokers even thoughtheir commissions are higher.  <p>  <p>Ask your broker to send your trades to the Chicago Stock Exchange.  <p> This exchange now trades 100 top Nasdaq stocks. By matchinginvestors' orders, the Chicago exchange can get you a betterprice. Not all firms will let you send your shares to Chicago,but some discount firms will.  <p>  <p>Specify that your trades for stocks listed on the NYSE and Amexactually go to these exchanges.   <p> This way, you can ensure that you won't be victimized by thehigh costs associated with 19c-3 trading practices.<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>DERIVATIVES AND THE BOGEY MONSTER
Ignore the hype: Derivatives aren't always disastrous.<p>By Liliana Nealon<p>Derivatives are being vilified as investments from hell, much like program trading was in the '80s. Problems that crop up in money market funds, international and domestic bond funds, pension funds, and staid and conservative corporate treasuries are often blamed on derivatives. <p>As with many trends in the investment world, this is overdone. Derivatives have pros and cons, as do all investments. And remember, the same investment strategies that caused portfolio losses in 1994 created millions of dollars in gains in recent years. <p>A derivative, in general, is a contract that derives its value from another financial instrument. In most cases, derivatives are agreements that give the buyer a future claim on an underlying asset (or the cash value of an underlying asset) and the seller an obligation to meet a corresponding liability, also in the future. There are no orphans in the world of derivatives -- every instrument has a parent. For example, the popular TIGRs, or deeply discounted Treasury strips favored by investors in retirement accounts, are derived from U.S. Treasury bonds. When you pay a $250 charge to lock in a mortgage rate, you're really buying a call option on that interest rate, banking on it rising rather than falling. <p>In fact, there's hardly a financial instrument around that is not a derivative. Says Varick Martin, senior vice president at NatWest Markets in New York: "In my opinion, there is only one financial transaction that is not a derivative -- when you stick $100,000 in cash in a bank account."<p>According to a May 1994 report by the General Accounting Office, between 1989 and 1992 the dollar amount of the derivatives market skyrocketed 145 percent. Today, the worldwide volume of outstanding derivatives amounts to $17.6 trillion. The GAO also says 14 major U.S. banks and securities firms faced $114 billion in gross credit risk because of their derivatives portfolios as of year-end 1992.<p>Derivatives can certainly be labyrinthine. Consider one of the more common derivatives trades: selling a naked call option. Say IBM is trading at 60.63, and you think the company's prospects are dimming. To act on your hunch, you sell ten call options with a strike price of 60 and a two-month maturity. You borrow on margin, meaning you borrow money from your broker to execute your transaction. The buyer of the options pays you a total of $2,875. <p>Effectively, you have just promised to sell over the next two months 1,000 shares of <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> that you do not own, at $60 each, or $60,000. If IBM's stock price steadily rises over the next two months, you will be forced to sell 1,000 shares of IBM worth $60 each at a loss. Since you do not own the stock, you'd have to go into the open market and buy the shares at a higher price. One good earnings announcement could wipe out the money you put up on margin. <p>Since it's impossible to pinpoint the downside risk of this simple IBM transaction, imagine how difficult it is to measure the potential losses related to the highly sophisticated derivatives transactions whirling through thousands of computer banks daily. The GAO study splits derivative risks into four categories: credit or counterparty risk, market risk, legal risk, and operational risk. Of these, market risk is responsible for most of the losses suffered by investors this year -- when it bites, it bites hard. This is the risk that the market, as in the IBM example, moves against you. <p>Given this piling on of risks, you may be tempted to cast aside anything that remotely resembles a derivative in your portfolio. Should you abandon your holdings in a corporation because its treasurer is investing in derivatives?Should you automatically sell out of any mutual fund that uses derivatives?<p>The answer to both questions is a firm no. Instead of panicking, do a little investigative work to find out whether the derivatives in your portfolio are likely to harm you: <p>-> Watch out for neophyte risk managers. You must be confident that the people managing your investments know what they're doing. The GAO report states, "No comprehensive industry or Federal Regulatory requirements exist to ensure that U.S. derivatives dealers follow good risk management practices." Mutual fund investors in particular should be concerned about novice managers. Unlike corporate treasurers, many funds only recently began dabbling in derivatives. If your fund's money manager has less than two years of experience trading derivatives, head for the door.<p>However, even the pros can lose; many of the corporations reporting losses this year were known for their savvy and expertise in the field of risk management. Markets give and markets take away. Just because derivative trading is generating losses now doesn't mean it will forever. Although numbers are difficult to get, most observers believe the losses generated this year don't begin to negate the gains made trading derivatives in the past.<p>-> Check your fund's liquidity. Ask your fund manager about the liquidity of the instruments in which your fund invests, especially derivatives. Lack of liquidity is a major factor in derivatives losses. If any more than 5 percent of your fund is invested in derivatives, question it. If derivatives are used solely as hedging vehicles, such as to hedge against currency risks associated with holding foreign stocks or bonds, you can breathe more easily. Such techniques actually reduce a portfolio's risk and are commonplace. If your fund is using derivatives as a way to bet on market moves, stay away. One way to identify a gambler: Fund returns that are much higher than average. Outsized gains, though appealing, should raise a red flag. <p>-> Stick to big institutional names in money market funds. Until the Securities and Exchange Commission takes regulatory action to protect investors, venerable firms are better able to absorb or even pay back losses. <a name="NYSE:PWJ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11148"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PaineWebber</b></a>, First Boston, and BankAmerica made refunds to shareholders who suffered losses because of derivatives trades in their short-term funds. While it's not guaranteed that refunds will continue, big funds are more likely to do this than smaller ones. <p>In spite of the hoopla surrounding derivatives, remember that these vehicles have been around for a long time, with little incident. When investors find a new investment to fear and loathe, the dread that is derivatives may be forgotten.<p><p>

						September 1994 <p>Worth magzine/Features  <p> THE SHORTS REEL ONE IN <p>What happens when short-sellers bet that a stock like Media Visionwill tumble? First come rumors,  then private campaigning, thenpublic, pitched battle. Ultimately, stockholders can profit from<p>the brawl -- or they can lose everything.  <p> By Herb Greenberg and David Dietz  <p> James Chanos was first on the battle line. The gutsy money managerhad tagged Media Vision Technology as a loser almost from themoment the stock hit the ticker in late 1992. Chanos figuredMedia Vision was in a lousy business, plain and simple: Its add-incircuit boards for computers might be hot sellers, but eventuallythey'd fizzle out.  <p> And then Media Vision would come crashing down.  <p> Other investors disagreed -- strongly. In fact, Media Vision'sstock posted a stellar 53 percent gain on its first day of trading,as securities analysts rejoiced over its prospects. Still, Chanos'sdownbeat assessment would eventually come to be shared by a numberof fellow skeptics. Key among these was Jeff Matthews, an analystat Rocker Partners, an investment firm based not far from Chanos'sown Kynikos Associates in New York City.  <p> Like Chanos, Matthews believes he can make money by sellingshort. That means he often gambles that a stock will fall ratherthan rise. Also like Chanos, Matthews thought Media Vision wasin a fundamentally lousy industry. But Matthews didn't believe1992 was a good time to bet against the new company -- a bigMedia Vision rival was late with a new product, and Media Visionwould benefit from its rival's troubles. He sat tight throughearly 1993 and watched as James Chanos got humbled in the marketplace. <p> In July, however, Matthews started to sense opportunity. Lookingover Media Vision's latest earnings report, he saw a build-upof products that hadn't been shipped yet. Intrigued, Matthewsbegan calling computer stores to see how Media Vision was doing.Everywhere he heard the same thing  -- the company was now stumblingwhile its rival was coming on strong.  <p> Matthews became convinced that Media Vision was headed for afall, so he walked into the office of his boss, David Rocker,to make the case. Matthews is a number cruncher by nature, butas always his argument went beyond math and appealed to Rocker'sgut instinct.  <p> "Now is the time," the analyst said.  <p> Rocker agreed, and the bet was placed -- a bet that ultimatelywould grow to about $10 million. Before long, other short-sellershad reached the same conclusions as Chanos and Rocker. All werechallenging the conventional wisdom. All were rooting for MediaVision, a company with soaring sales and a soaring stock price,to crash-land.  <p> The battle was on.  <p>   <p> Short sellers such as Chanos and Rocker are Wall Street's cynics,members of a secret society that thrives on finding holes inother people's stories. It's no wonder these investors shun publicity:Whenever shorts start betting against a stock, someone is sureto lose money. Maybe it'll be short-sellers themselves; sometargets turn out to be stronger than the shorts expect. Justas often, however, vulnerable stocks will succumb to the pressure-- and the shorts will get blamed for all manner of evil, fromunethically causing a stock's collapse to being so nihilisticthat they endanger American enterprise.  <p> But short-sellers aren't nihilists. They're contrarians, sure.By nature, they take the minority view. What really wins themenemies, however, is that they're not content just to avoid badstocks. Instead, they feel compelled to bet against such stocks,then do everything in their power to make the bet stick. In thegame of investing, where everyone else wants stocks to rise,short-selling is seen as bad karma -- like an albatross at seaor the wail of a banshee in an Irish home.  <p> In theory, of course, short-sellers can't affect a company'sfortunes just by making a bet. In reality, though, they can makeother investors so skittish that any bad news will cause a floodof sell orders from bulls who suddenly fear the shorts may beright. Such selling sprees depress a stock's price and make theshorts' bet a self-fulfilling prophecy. Short-sellers have also,on occasion, been accused of questionable moves such as spreadingfalse rumors or bad-mouthing a company to its suppliers or creditors. <p> Respectable shorts, like Matthews and Rocker, say they neverdo such things. In other ways, however, these men are great examplesof the archetypal short -- tireless, fanatic, detail-orientedinvestigators. Shorts are like pit bulls. Once they've latchedon to a target, they won't let go until the stock collapses orthey've lost a fortune. Convinced their stand is correct, they'llmagnify even the tiniest flaws in a company to prove a point.But an important fact leavens this fanaticism: Unlike many investors,shorts do their homework extremely well. And as a result, theyare often dead-on in their judgments.  <p> That was the case with Rocker Partners and Media Vision. Ofcourse, investors in the computer add-in company aren't thankingRocker for making money off their misery. And as with many shortvictories, the story of how Rocker was proved right is not pretty. <p>   <p> Arrayed against Rocker and the rest of the shorts in the MediaVision fight were the vast majority of more typical "long" investors,who bought the stock hoping it would rise in price. Such long-shortbattles go on all the time, although small investors may notrealize their stock has been targeted by short-sellers untilit collapses -- or beats off the attack in what's known as ashort squeeze. Short-sellers keep a low profile, but they oftenwork feverishly behind the scenes to convince bankers, analysts,big institutions, and journalists that a particular company isabout to hit the skids. As the shorts build a doomsday case,aiming to touch off a stock slide, the company and its supportersmarshall evidence to prove that all is well. Disagreements betweenlongs and shorts are usually pretty mundane -- whether an industry'sfundamentals are deteriorating, for example -- but have beenknown to escalate to charges of misrepresentation, even fraud. <p> When it came to Media Vision, the shorts faced some seriousfirepower. For one thing, Media Vision's public offering hadbeen co-underwritten by Montgomery Securities, a brash West Coastinvestment firm with plenty of powerful allies, and Cowen & Co.,a New York firm with a specialty in technology issues. Montgomeryand Cowen could be expected to fight hard to avoid the embarrassmentof seeing a client get slaughtered in the marketplace. If sucha humiliation occurred, the firms' reputation for sponsoringquality stocks would be tarnished. That could scare away futureclients and the fees and commissions they would bring.  <p> Another snag for Rocker and its fellow shorts: Media Vision'sbiggest institutional shareholder was the mutual fund giant FidelityInvestments, which at one point held about 12 percent of thecompany's publicly traded shares through eight different funds.(Fidelity also owns Capital Publishing, the company that publishesWorth.) Fidelity is a huge force in stock buying, and its confidencein an issue does much to reassure investors who might otherwisebe spooked by shorts.  <p> Add to this the securities analysts who were recommending thattheir clients purchase Media Vision shares, and the battle lineswere drawn.  <p> A highflier in the hot computer field known as multimedia, MediaVision was perfect fodder for a showdown between shorts and longs-- a much-hyped player in a turbulent industry. The company hadbeen founded in 1990 by Paul Jain, an Indian immigrant born inNew Delhi. Jain (pronounced "Jan") was a high-tech veteran whotraced his interest in multimedia, which spices up computingwith audio and video elements, to a boyhood fascination withthe bustle and color of Indian open-air bazaars.  <p> Smooth, well dressed, and charming, Jain was a colorful figurehimself. As he told it, he had grown up in a wealthy Indian familywith divided political loyalties. His father ran a string ofsteel plants handed down from the days the family obeyed colonialrule. From his mother's side, meanwhile, came an insurgent streak:His maternal grandfather, a supporter of Mohandas Gandhi, hadbeen jailed for protesting the British presence in India.  <p> In 1962, at the age of 17, Jain left India for Austria. He remainedthere for a decade, earning an engineering degree from the Universityof Vienna along the way. But eventually he got tired of Austrianhostility toward foreigners and headed for a friendlier clime:California. Jain enrolled in a graduate program at the Universityof California at Berkeley, where he received a master's degreein bioelectronics.  <p> From Berkeley Jain gravitated toward nearby Silicon Valley,where he worked and invested in a series of technology companies.He also founded two of his own companies -- Universal Supply,which sold components to big computer makers, and Video 7, whichmade computer-graphics circuit boards. Media Vision was his thirdcreation and appeared successful from its earliest days: In 1992,its second full year in business, Media Vision had revenue of$68.9 million, mostly from selling sound cards that enabled computersto produce good-quality audio.  <p> Indeed, Jain had picked an industry where it was hard not todo well. Driven by ever-improving computer games, multimediaadd-ins for computers were on a monumental roll in the early1990s. "No matter what you made, you would have sold it all,"recalls Chip Lacy, chief executive officer of Ingram Micro, aleading distributor of computers, software, and accessories. <p> Media Vision's chief rival, from which it had licensed somekey technology, was Creative Technology, patent holder for theproduct that had launched the sound-card boom -- a popular circuitboard known as Sound Blaster. Media Vision and Creative Technologyvied to outdo each other in the fast-changing field, racing tobring out bigger, better, and faster products. To hook consumerson multimedia, they began bundling sound cards into $600 "multimediaupgrade kits" that included speakers, a device that played specialcomputer compact discs, and an array of fancy software. Salessoared.  <p> With a superhot industry and a stock market that was snappingup initial public offerings, it wasn't long before the rivalsound-card companies caught the eye of investment bankers. GoldmanSachs snared Creative Technology, taking it public in August1992. It was an instant hit and set the stage nicely for Jain'scompany. Media Vision made its stock market debut only threemonths later, courtesy of Montgomery and Cowen. It raised animpressive $51.8 million before commissions and fees  -- thenreturned to the capital markets just five months later, boastingof unusually strong sales growth. This time it raised another$52 million from institutional investors. The offerings helpedmake Jain a rich man: As part of the deals, he sold shares worthmore than $1.5 million.  <p> Entering 1993, Media Vision was almost the definition of a WallStreet darling. In the first month of the year alone, its stockrose almost 44 percent. By the contrarian standards of short-sellers,that alone might serve as a warning flag: There's a thin linebetween a hot stock and an overheated one.  <p> At Rocker Partners, however, Jeff Matthews would find even moreto worry about.  <p>   <p> Short-sellers aren't like other investors. For one thing, theytend to believe in fundamental research on companies and industries-- and nothing else. That means they don't care what the analystsare saying or how strong a stock's momentum is or even what thecompany itself is forecasting. If their research shows that acompany's stock price isn't merited by the company's fundamentals,they're interested in betting against it. Due diligence is everything. <p> Matthews, now 38, had gained his reputation as a formidableshort-side analyst in 1987 by calling the fall of Regina, a vacuum-cleanercompany that eventually filed for bankruptcy protection. At thatpoint, the Waspy, auburn-haired Matthews was shorting for hisown account only, as he had since 1983. For his full-time jobas an investment analyst, meanwhile, he recommended buys on otherstocks for employer Warburg Pincus. But as Matthews became theWall Street expert on Regina, the young Lehigh University graduatemade some important contacts. At a conference at the IntercontinentalHotel in New York, he deliberately sat next to David Rocker,a well-established money manager, and talked up his Regina findings.By 1989, Rocker had enticed Matthews to join his firm.  <p> Unlike many of his brethren, including James Chanos, David Rockerisn't purely a short-seller -- indeed, he's just as proud ofhis smart longs, such as Canandaigua Wine, as he is of his spectacularshorts, such as TCBY and U.S. Surgical. Born in Elizabeth, NewJersey, Rocker is a 51-year-old navy veteran and double Harvardgrad (college and business school) who's active in charitableorganizations such as the United Jewish Appeal. His biggest charge,however, comes from deflating false claims. And for the past25 years, that has made him a short at heart.  <p> "Dispassionate research against hype" is how the well-groomed,intense Rocker frames his calling. And in the case of Media Vision,that's exactly what he saw from Jeff Matthews. In July 1993,for example, Media Vision had issued a press release claimingit had an 85 percent share of the market for a particular typeof sound card. But Matthews figured that the true Media Visionshare was more like 30 percent. "That was a tip-off," says Rocker."When you see that, you start looking for other things that don'tadd up."  <p> Preparing for the short bet, Rocker and Matthews checked outMedia Vision as many different ways as they could. Along withpartner Marc Cohodes, who is based in Larkspur, California, theyworked the phones furiously, calling computer-store companiesand competitive manufacturers. As research progressed, Rockerwas convinced that Matthews's initial insight had been correct:This had all the signs of a major short-selling opportunity.Besides its inventory problems, Media Vision was bleeding cashand was trapped in an industry that wouldn't be able to sustainits high margins. Matthews believed that competition would soontransform sound cards into just another factory-installed commodity,much as disk drives had turned into a cutthroat business.  <p> But Paul Jain was making rosy assumptions that projected highprofits for years to come -- and the stock market, led by breathlessrecommendations from Montgomery, Cowen, and credulous securitiesanalysts, seemed to be valuing Media Vision on that basis. Suchmisplaced optimism is just what Rocker looks for: Reality usuallyintervenes, sending an overvalued stock crashing down. Rockerdescribes the classic short as "a wide discrepancy between thefacts and what a company claims, and a refusal of a broad numberof analysts to deal with that." He believed he had found it inMedia Vision.  <p> That month, Rocker started placing big bets by borrowing MediaVision shares and selling them. He was gambling that the pricewould fall, allowing him to replace the borrowed stock with cheapershares. As with any short bet, the potential loss was enormous-- theoretically limitless, in fact. As Media Vision's stockrose above the level at which Rocker had sold it, his positionwas in the red. If Jain and the longs were right, and the stockkept rising, Rocker would just keep getting in deeper and deeper.In such a situation, Rocker's only decision would be how muchmoney his firm could lose before bailing out.  <p> Still, Rocker had the courage of his convictions. Rocker Partnersmanages about $200 million for wealthy individuals and institutions.Like any money manager, Rocker isn't supposed to risk too muchof his clients' money on any single investment. Ultimately, though,the Media Vision short would become one of Rocker's biggest positions,accounting for about 5 percent of his firm's investments. Takinga hit on a bet that size wouldn't just hurt his performance --it could cost him clients.  <p>   <p> Meanwhile, Media Vision seemed unstoppable. In September 1993,Paul Jain was asked to step before a packed gathering of thecountry's most powerful money managers. The market was expectinggood news: Media Vision's stock jumped 10 percent in the weekbefore his appearance. And Jain delivered. His message was justwhat Rocker didn't want to hear. For Media Vision, said Jain,the best was yet to come.  <p> Jain was addressing the annual Montgomery Securities investmentconference in San Francisco, the largest event of its kind. Heretop executives parade before the Wall Street community, tryingto persuade huge pension funds, mutual funds, and other institutionsto buy into their companies. If Jain's pitch went well, he couldexpect a flood of money that would fund an upcoming bond offeringand help drive Media Vision's shares higher. That wouldn't justaid the company; it would make Jain even richer. Every pointthat Media Vision stock rose added about $134,000 to his networth.  <p> The September 1993 bash -- Montgomery's 23rd such confab --was bigger and flashier than ever, a full-throated toast to abull market that had heaped riches on the San Francisco- basedfirm. Attendees sipped $30-a-bottle Kistler chardonnay and weretreated to an entertainment lineup that included a debate betweenjournalists Robert Novak and Michael Kinsley and tunes from countrysinger Waylon Jennings and pop crooner Bruce Hornsby.  <p> But there was also plenty of business to be done, and over fourdays execs from myriad public companies -- from Microsoft toBed, Bath & Beyond -- took their turns at the podium. Jain matchedthe best of them with his compelling growth-stock story. Notonly was his fledgling company solidly in the black, he said,but analysts were expecting annual sales to triple in 1993, toa robust $200 million.  <p> And that was only the beginning. Jain had dreams of buildinga multimedia colossus with $1 billion in sales and a market valueto match. He captivated the audience with rhapsodies of MediaVision expanding beyond sound cards and multimedia upgrades intohigh-margin software -- specifically, the same type of compact-discgames that were driving demand for Media Vision's hardware. Itwas already September, but Jain promised that Media Vision woulddrop ten titles down retailers' chimneys in time for the Christmasrush. "You could see people's emotions wanting to believe this,"remembers Cohodes.  <p> And sure enough, within a month Media Vision stock had risenanother 44 percent. The shorts were taking a drubbing, but theyremained unbowed: Short interest in Media Vision, a measure ofhow many bets had been placed against the stock, had risen to14.1 percent of the company's outstanding shares, up from 8.7percent only three months earlier.  <p> Bolstered by the enthusiasm of the Montgomery conference, Jaindismissed as nonsense the balance-sheet concerns raised by short-sellers.High inventories and unpaid bills were one-time problems thatwere already being fixed, he insisted. On the inventory side,Jain simply said Media Vision had turned things around and was"sold out" for Christmas. The higher receivables, he claimed,were just the result of granting generous credit terms to bigretailers such as Wal-Mart, which had never before carried soundcards. "It was a new category, and they didn't know whether theycould sell it," Jain said. Anyone shorting Media Vision wouldbe sorely disappointed, he told a reporter.  <p> Jain's confidence seemed well placed. Investors continued tocrave multimedia, and a convertible debt offering by Media Vision,underwritten by Montgomery and Cowen, went off without a hitchin October. Demand for the bonds was so high, in fact, that thevalue of the deal was ultimately raised from $75 million to $115million. The very day of the offering, Montgomery analyst PaulFox added to the excitement level by hiking his estimate of MediaVision's 1994 revenue by 26 percent. The stock could jump from$27 to $40 a share, he said, describing Media Vision as "oneof the best pure-play current investment ideas in multimedia."Cowen was equally enthusiastic; its analyst Steven Ossad madeMedia Vision his number-one technology pick. "Significant upsidepotential looms as we enter 1994," he wrote. Facing millionsof dollars in potential losses, the shorts were under huge pressure. <p>   <p> Inside Media Vision, pressure was building too. There was pressureto keep the stock soaring, pressure to meet Wall Street's optimisticestimates, pressure to fulfill Jain's ambitious promises. Whatmuch of Wall Street didn't know -- and didn't want to know --was that Jain didn't always react well to pressure.  <p> Amid all the enthusiasm over Media Vision, few investors hadbothered to check out Paul Jain's track record. If they had doneso, they would have discovered a pattern of questionable practicesthat should have raised red flags. For example, Universal Supply,the first company Jain founded, filed for bankruptcy and wasliquidated in 1984 amid creditor complaints of lax management. <p> Then came Video 7, the maker of computer-graphics boards. Jainseemed to have scored a success there in 1989 when he sold thecompany to LSI Logic, a large and reputable computer-chip manufacturer.That wasn't the end of the tale, however. LSI won't comment onthe matter, but a high-ranking executive who worked for LSI atthe time says the company felt misled by Jain when it discovered"tens of millions of dollars" in unsold Video 7 products thatLSI had never been told about.  <p> In fact, says this executive, LSI was "appalled" at how Jaindid business and quickly fired its new employee after the acquisition.The executive concedes that LSI may have been naive, but thecompany was shocked by Jain's embrace of an aggressive practiceknown as "channel stuffing" -- offering whatever is necessaryfor distributors to accept large shipments at the end of a quarter,just so that sales numbers will hit their targets. Stuffing oftenbackfires when unsold goods are returned. At its worst it canlead to kickbacks, although no such accusation has been madeagainst Jain.  <p> Through his attorney, Jain declines to comment on events atVideo 7 or Universal Supply.  <p> More troubling information about Jain could have been uncoveredin court records. During divorce proceedings, for example, histhen wife Kathleen alleged that Jain had hidden money in overseasbank accounts managed by relatives. Court documents also indicatedthat he had given a block of Video 7 stock to a woman with whomhe was having an extramarital affair. The woman later sold itfor $47,000, according to court records. Jain and his wife alsohad troubles with the Internal Revenue Service -- legal paperstalk of a "filing problem." Neither Jain nor his ex-wife willcomment on the nature or outcome of these tax disputes.  <p> Even diligent short-sellers didn't know many of these facts.But other danger signs were in plainer view. Insiders were sellingthe stock heavily, for instance. And at Rocker, Matthews wasbecoming intrigued by a new Media Vision sales tactic, a toll-freetelephone number for selling products directly to consumers.Media Vision claimed its direct-sales push was to sell outdatedsound cards that couldn't be sold at original retail prices.But Matthews discovered that Media Vision was also selling somecurrent software programs over the phone -- at a discount. Whydo such a thing if the products were selling so well in the stores? <p> As Christmas approached, Matthews took to wandering from hisoffice in Rockefeller Center "to see what was going on" at nearbycomputer stores. His conclusion: Media Vision products weren'tselling -- and Jain's promised software titles were nowhere insight. Once again Rocker, Matthews, and Cohodes began workingthe phones. Their contacts at computer stores told them the samething. "The purchasing guy at one chain told us that the MediaVision salesmen didn't even try to sell to them," Rocker says. <p> Word began to spread, and short interest in Media Vision keptrising to reach 17.7 percent of outstanding shares by mid-December.Jain began bombarding analysts with wild projections for MediaVision's new line of software, which he still swore would reachstores by Christmas. Of the titles Jain promised, the best appearedto be a compact-disc game called Critical Path, which combinedtraditional video-game graphics with actual movie footage. Inearly December, Jain said the game would be a failure if it didn'tsell 100,000 units by the end of March. "I'd be surprised ifit doesn't sell 200,000 titles," he added.  <p> The hottest such game at the time, 7th Guest, had sold 200,000copies in eight months; unsurprisingly, Critical Path sales wouldnever approach that figure, let alone Jain's hyperbolic three-monthestimates. But Jain couldn't be stopped by such technicalities-- he followed up by saying Media Vision would soon start buildingleading-edge game machines of the type then being touted by ahot company called 3DO. His dazzling projections helped MediaVision stock reach $40 a share.  <p> The shorts were absolutely convinced the stock was being heldup only by hot air from Jain and Wall Street analysts. But suchconvictions were hurting no one but the shorts themselves. Atthis stage, Rocker's Media Vision position was in the red bymillions of dollars. "We were getting killed," he admits. Still,he held to his belief that Jain's public optimism didn't reflectthe true Media Vision story.  <p> Jain was unimpressed with Rocker and his gallery of skeptics."I hope [the shorts] rot in hell," he told a reporter at thetime. "I hope they go home and beat their wives."  <p> Says Rocker, "People who have something to hide don't like detectives." <p>   <p> Media Vision kept Jain's promise about software -- but onlyjust. Nine of its compact-disc titles arrived in stores by Christmasweek. Caught by the delay, Jain changed his story slightly. Whileacknowledging that Christmas was important, he now said the "realmoney" would be made after Christmas, when owners of new multimediasystems went shopping for software. Investors bought his reasoning:As the winter wore on, Media Vision's stock marched even higher,peaking at $46.50.   <p> Now everyone, long and short alike, was waiting for Media Vision'slatest results to come in.  <p> On February 18, Media Vision reported that its fourth-quartersales had almost tripled from the previous year. But its per-shareearnings came in slightly below several analysts' estimates --and in the volatile, high-expectations world of hot technologystocks, that was almost as bad as an unexpected loss. What'smore, Media Vision's inventories and receivables had shot upagain, suggesting that maybe the shorts were on to something.Within two days, the stock shed roughly 18 percent of its value,ending at $35 a share.  <p> Clearly agitated, Jain blamed the slide on "manipulation" bythe shorts. In fact, he argued, the stock had been undervaluedbefore it tumbled. The inventory buildup was the result of stockpilingmaterials for a hot new multimedia kit that Media Vision wouldsoon introduce, Jain said, while receivables were high becausesome retailers were having trouble moving older Media Visionproducts. Again, the glitches were temporary. "The shorts haveto understand that they'll be burned by me!" Jain railed.  <p> And indeed, most of the securities analysts who followed MediaVision reiterated their buy recommendations after the slide,downplaying the company's balance-sheet woes. Media Vision'spatrons at Montgomery Securities set the tone: Analyst Paul Foxcalled the figures "disappointing but explainable." This wasn'tjust a regurgitation of Jain's party line -- Fox says he didindependent research to reassure himself Media Vision was solid."All my contacts across the board were saying things were amazinglystrong," he says.  <p> All the same, several brokerage houses lowered their earningsestimates for Media Vision, and the stock continued to languish,hitting $21.50 by late March. For much of Wall Street, however,that just made Media Vision look even more like a bargain. Buy,urged the analysts.  <p> The shorts weren't buying yet, however. They had seen a signthat further collapse was imminent. As Jain kept touting MediaVision's strength, the company had quietly taken out a $3,500classified ad in Electronic Buyers News, a trade paper. "SiliconValley-based company has the following list of excess componentinventory for sale," it read. The ad didn't identify the company,but short-sellers are canny about such things. Matthews calledthe number listed in the ad. He got Media Vision.  <p> By this point, Matthews had left Rocker to strike out on hisown as a money manager in Greenwich, Connecticut. He had departed,ironically, on the very day in February that Media Vision beganto disappoint Wall Street. Still, the loyal Matthews called hisold boss to pass along the information. The list of items MediaVision was offering for sale included millions of componentsused for building sound cards. Selling such stuff via a classifiedad is unusual in the electronics industry. Rocker and Matthewsfigured Media Vision was taking desperate measures to disguiseyet another inventory buildup -- this time, before it showedup in an earnings report. Was the company in even worse shapethan they imagined?  <p> The answer came soon enough. On the night of Wednesday, March23, 1994, the three outside directors of Media Vision were summonedto an emergency board meeting in the conference room at MediaVision headquarters in Fremont, California. There they were toldthat the company would report a "significant" first-quarter loss.Jain blamed the trouble on price cuts and shipment delays.  <p> News of the loss hit the tape the following morning, slicingMedia Vision's already- battered stock almost in half, to $11.50a share. Jain put on a brave face, dismissing the revelationas little more than a bump in the road. In a hastily organizedconference call with analysts, the somber-sounding executivetried to avoid reality by talking about the company's new lineof children's software. The stock drifted lower.  <p> Only six weeks later, another bombshell: The company said itwould be restating its fourth-quarter results. Instead of a profit,Media Vision now expected a significant loss. The next day MediaVision's stock closed below $6. The battle was effectively over;the short-sellers had won. As the cynics popped champagne corks,long investors started toting up their losses.  <p> What happened? Media Vision has yet to give an adequate explanation-- and Jain insists the company mostly fell afoul of "untruthfuland unfair allegations." But according to internal documentsand interviews with former Media Vision executives and employees,the truth of the situation is much less flattering.  <p>   <p> Despite Jain's constant assurances to the contrary, the short-sellersappear to have been right about Media Vision. In a long, damningstory published in the San Francisco Chronicle, numerous formeremployees painted a picture of a company so obsessed with meetingJain's wild forecasts -- and Wall Street's overheated estimates-- that it had slipped into some dubious habits.  <p> Media Vision regularly shipped defective products, these peoplesay. At the end of most quarters, white-collar employees wouldpitch in to pack as many boxes as possible. Jain prowled thefloor, providing motivation and orders. People who were theresay that anyone who pointed out a defect got the same response:"Ship it!" Says one former employee, "Analysts expected him tohit his numbers, and he hit them. No matter what."  <p> Jain also appears to have overseen the same kind of "stuffing"practices at Media Vision that apparently prompted his departurefrom Video 7. According to distributors and retailers, MediaVision frequently asked them to take more sound cards and multimediaupgrade kits than they could possibly sell. On one occasion latein 1993, says a distributor, "they asked us to buy more thanwe ever took in an entire year."   <p> Even more troubling is evidence that the company knowingly falsifiedsales figures by claiming to have shipped thousands of productsthat weren't even made yet. Late in 1993, as Jain was makingpromises about future sales, Media Vision found itself short15,000 speakers it needed to complete some multimedia upgradekits. On December 2, the company ordered the speakers from LabtecElectronics in Hong Kong, to be shipped on the freighter EverGarland. On December 30, the company's internal inventory logshowed the speakers "received," and a work order was issued toan outside contractor for completion of the upgrade kits.  <p> According to a packing slip, 10,000 of the kits were shippedback to Media Vision the very same day. The following day, accordingto inventory logs, these kits were accepted into Media Vision'sinventory and quickly released to salespeople. The salespeoplethen assigned the kits, valued at more than $3 million, to variouscustomers. Once that happened, according to former employees,the products were said to be shipped -- just in time to be recordedas sales for the fourth quarter.  <p> The only problem: The Ever Garland didn't even arrive in theU.S. until January 8 -- more than a week after the speakers itcarried were supposedly used in Media Vision kits. The saleswere a fabrication.  <p> There's also a suggestion that Media Vision rented "phantom"warehouses to hide stuffed inventory that had been returned unsold-- and would otherwise have to be deducted from sales. SandyPfister is Jain's former secretary and at one point served asMedia Vision's facilities manager. At that time, Pfister says,she received bills for warehouse rentals about which she knewnothing. When she confronted a Jain deputy with suspicions aboutwhat was in the warehouses, she says she was told, "It's noneof your business."  <p> Pfister, who has since left Media Vision, also accuses Jainof trying to use company funds to buy airline tickets so he couldtravel to Paris and elsewhere with girlfriends. While she wasJain's secretary, Pfister says, she refused to process such expenses-- but Jain "would go bonkers ... He would redo the expensesand give them to the controllers." Through his attorney, Jaindeclines to comment on this allegation and all other characterizationsof his role at Media Vision.  <p> Even before Media Vision's collapse, some former executivesand employees were so disgusted with company practices that theycomplained to a reporter -- and later contacted the Securitiesand Exchange Commission. Along with the FBI, the SEC is now investigatingthe company.  <p> As these developments were reported, the shorts' victory becameever more complete. Media Vision's stock sank as low as $2.63a share. Its bonds fell below 20 cents on the dollar. Half thecompany's board quit within three days of the Chronicle expose.A week later, Jain and three of his lieutenants resigned.  <p> When Matthews heard that news, he sent electronic mail congratulatinghis old friends at Rocker. Rocker and Cohodes, meanwhile, wereboth jubilant and relieved after surviving months when it seemedthey might lose millions on the Media Vision bet. "We felt reallygood," says Rocker. "It was a very big win."  <p>   <p> Although his firm was proved right, along with all the otherMedia Vision short-sellers, Rocker wasn't hailed as a hero withinthe investment community. He's used to that. Short-sellers areridiculed when they're wrong, reviled when they're right. Theymay make money, but they seldom make any friends.  <p> Except among their clients, that is: With one of the largestshort bets on Media Vision, the Rocker firm ended up clearingmore than $5 million for its investors -- mostly taken from thehides of people who chose instead to believe Paul Jain, MontgomerySecurities, Cowen & Co., and the securities analysts at a numberof big brokerage houses.  <p> Today, Media Vision remains a troubled company that is dealingwith the fallout from ongoing investigations. In July, it wasforced to seek federal bankruptcy protection. In a letter tofriends the day he resigned, Jain whined about his treatmentin the whole affair. "It has always been a mystery to me," hewrote, "how men can feel themselves honored by the humiliationof others."  <p> Paul Jain will be dealing with his humiliation for some time.Rocker, Chanos, and all the other shorts, by contrast, have alreadymoved on. Their next targets? Rocker isn't saying. Neither isChanos, who was the first analyst to pick Media Vision as a loser.Neither is Matthews.  <p> But if you own a hot stock like Media Vision, they all say,maybe you should do a bit more research. While there's stilltime.  <p>  <hr>  <p>Copyright 1994 Capital Publishing Limited Partnership. All rightsreserved.  <p>

Why scam artists love to target retirement money.<p>By Kathleen Murray<p>During his career as an insurance-marketing rep, John Keeler, 67, switched jobs so many times that he never had a chance to build up much in the way of retirement savings. So when he stumbled upon First Pension Corp., based in Irvine, California, he thought he'd found a great way to make up for lost time. Here was a company that offered to set him up in limited partnerships investing in pools of mortgages -- and purported to earn between 13 percent and 28 percent a year. The company had splashy brochures and a 14-year track record. Keeler plunked down $6,000 in savings.<p>Earlier this year, on April 22, First Pension filed for bankruptcy. Three weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the company, charging that its officers had defrauded investors out of some $124 million through an elaborate pyramid scheme. Instead of investing incoming funds in new mortgages, regulators alleged, company president William Cooper and his associates used at least some of the money to pay off old investors. The company operated a network of 218 partnerships, though it actually owned just 17 properties, regulators also said. Keeler and 9,000 other First Pension investors -- some with more than $100,000 at stake -- are now awaiting the outcome of bankruptcy and legal proceedings to learn if they'll be able to recoup any of their money. <p>The saga of First Pension underscores the importance of checking out the administrator of a retirement plan carefully before committing any funds. It also highlights the perils of "direct participation" programs, where the company administering a retirement account is also a company that sells investment products.<p>"This is a perfect area [in which] to commit fraud," says Lisa Gok, assistant regional administrator with the SEC in Los Angeles. The reason is that investors in retirement accounts plan on keeping their money in the same place for a long time; if con artists take it, the investors may not even realize it's gone.<p>Most retirement-plan administrators, of course, are legitimate, and their direct-participation programs pose minimal risks. Big mutual fund companies like Vanguard, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price and brokerages like Charles Schwab and Merrill Lynch regularly sell their own mutual funds and help clients set up retirement accounts. But even with these trusted companies it's a good idea to check with local securities regulators for evidence of any problems.<p>Investors who investigated closely would have turned up several danger signs at First Pension. One clear warning was interlocking ownership with other entities. The same people who owned First Pension also owned Vestcorp, the company that sold the partnerships. In 1992, the National Association of Securities Dealers fined Vestcorp $7,500 for, among other things, not disclosing its relationship with First Pension and improperly withdrawing funds from escrow. In addition, Cooper, a politically connected real estate developer, was president of three different firms that acted as general partner for some of the limited partnerships. Cooper also was affiliated with the custodian bank that acted as trustee for the funds.<p>More red flags: The investments were unregistered. By limiting the number of investors in each partnership to 35, the company was able to sidestep state disclosure requirements about the properties. These investments also failed the too-good-to-be-true test: With past returns of up to 28 percent, the partnerships were doing too well, considering that the real estate market in Southern California was in the tank. "You've got to ask yourself if the performance makes sense," says the SEC's Gok. Regulators now believe that promoters were using incoming funds to make their numbers. <p>If someone wants to commit fraud, it's difficult to detect. But there are ways to protect yourself.<p>Read the prospectus and offering materials, particularly sections that discuss risk factors and conflicts of interest. If this information is not disclosed, as in the case of First Pension, ask for it. If you can't get answers that way, look for another place to put your money. <p>Offering materials should also provide detailed information on how your funds are being invested. When his documents didn't identify specific mortgages, Gordon Reiter, a retired aerospace engineer from Torrance, California, who had invested in excess of $100,000 in Vestcorp partnerships, contacted Cooper to ask if he could get more information about the properties in question. Cooper brushed him off, saying that he had to protect the property owners' confidentiality. "Looking back, I should have pressed him," Reiter says. Steven Gourley, a Los Angeles attorney who was a state regulator in the 1980s, recommends asking to see evidence of hard assets in a limited partnership -- appraisals, who owns the properties, and what their payment record is, for example.<p>Check with regulators. You can often investigate operators of even unregistered securities if they're licensed with other agencies. For example, Vestcorp and First Pension dealt in real estate. California's Department of Corporations had no records of disciplinary action against Cooper or his companies, but the state Department of Real Estate revoked Cooper's license in early 1984 for misappropriating $577,000 in investor funds. <p>If you can't get your money out of an investment within a reasonable period of time, report it to the Department of Labor. The SEC has received letters from investors who tried to withdraw their funds from Vestcorp partnerships in 1984 and 1985 and were put off by First Pension. At the same time, the investors continued to receive phony statements showing that their principal was growing each year. The SEC believes this trick was designed to keep them from pulling out their funds. It should never take you more than a couple of months to transfer funds out of a pension plan.<p>This may seem like a lot of sleuthing, but as investors with First Pension have learned, the price of not doing your homework can be steep.<p><p><p>

The old standbys have let investors down. Here's a new group that should provide solid growth in a sometimes volatile market.<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Blue-chip stocks, like old soldiers, never seem to die. They just fade away, eventually metamorphosing into what James Craig, portfolio manager for the <a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Fund</b></a>, calls "the big uglies." But the U.S. economy is a dynamic one -- and every so often a new blue chip is born. <p>With this in mind, we set out to refresh the blue-chip list for the '90s and beyond. Our goal: Identify 50 prime stocks that meet the definition of blue chip as investors have understood it for most of the 20th century. <p>This was no small task. To merit inclusion on such a list, a stock would have to be able to provide steady capital gains, hefty dividends, and rock-solid safety. These were the characteristics that made the blue chips of yesteryear so highly prized that the stocks were often passed on from one generation to the next.<p><a name="NYSE:K"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10841"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kellogg</b></a> was once such a stock. Starting in 1955, its upward trajectory was so reliable that an investor could have acquired the cereal maker's shares and then gone to sleep for the next three decades. While slumbering, the fortunate owner would have raked in average annual price appreciation of 10 percent plus dividends. <p>H.J. Heinz was another. Its stock appreciated by an average of 15 percent a year from 1967 to 1985. The story was much the same for other blue chips: <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>, Procter & Gamble. On occasion, hot growth stocks such as Xerox would outshine the chips. Yet in market drops, the aggressive-growth stocks would fall in frightening fashion, while the blue chips, sustained by their dividend yields, edged down with reassuring dignity. <p>Are there stocks today worthy of being called blue chips? For help in finding out, we consulted some of the investment community's best minds, including professional investors, market strategists, and securities analysts. We asked Paul Greenwood and Rolf Agather of the Frank Russell Co., the Tacoma, Washington, market-research firm that produces the Russell stock market indexes, to run a series of studies for us on large-capitalization stocks going back to 1978. Standard & Poor's Compustat, which keeps financial data on 8,900 companies dating as far back as 1950, identified companies that met criteria for margin growth and improvements in profitability. Gail Dudack, U.S. market strategist at S.G. Warburg, an international money-management firm, made another important contribution when she led us to look for companies that have kept their production costs low; growth in the 1990s will depend on increasing profit margins even as prices charged to customers fall.<p>The product of our research, we believe, was a fresh method for selecting stocks with the optimal combination of safety, yield, and growth -- hallmarks of the classic blue chips. Some of the names that made our list were hardly surprising, among them <a name="NYSE:G"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10655"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gillette</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:AUD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10148"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Automatic Data Processing</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:RBD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11294"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Rubbermaid</b></a>. Others were less obvious as blue chips, if not exactly unknown as growth vehicles, such as <a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a>, <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:ABS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10049"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Albertson</b></a>'s. Blue-chip investors might erroneously consider those stocks too volatile for their portfolios. Yet we found their short-term volatility has disguised a steady and almost predictable long-term appreciation. Other high-profile stocks -- including many that investors may still regard as blue chips -- failed to pass our tests. A look at blue-chip history will help explain why.<p>On July 3, 1884, Charles Dow put together the first index of leading stocks -- a list that many investors would come to associate with the term blue chip. It included 11 railroads plus Western Union and appeared in what was then called the Customer's Afternoon Letter, a publication that would later become The Wall Street Journal. In May 1896, Dow split an expanded list in two: One list focused on railroads, and the other exclusively on industrials. That first Dow Jones Industrial Index included speculative growth companies such as <a name="NYSE:GE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Electric</b></a>, a high-technology company financed with venture capital that had staked its future on Thomas Edison's scheme for electric lights. The list also included huge trusts like American Sugar and U.S. Rubber, which wielded control over entire industries. Others, like Tennessee Coal & Iron and Chicago Gas, typified the muscle of the newly industrializing nation.<p>What characterized these early blue chips? Central Leather, which joined the Dow in 1912 and left the list in 1924, was a corporate Croesus: Its balance sheet showed $56.8 million in property and timberlands. The company owned tanneries, lumber mills, extract factories, finishing plants, glue works, machine shops, and the entire capital stock of the Susquehanna and New York Rail Road. In 1917 Central Leather paid a regular dividend of 5 percent and declared a special dividend of 4 percent on its common stock.<p>Stocks like these helped establish the parameters for blue-chip investing. The most obvious: A company must have a certain substance, usually measured by size. Yet size can be misleading. Over the years, many investors have erred in thinking of mass as intrinsically desirable, a guarantee of safety. But size is important only when it contributes to competitive advantage, a key characteristic of all blue chips. The big companies that came to be identified as blue chips had sterling balance sheets that enabled them to absorb short-term shocks, to invest in new technologies, and to wage war against their rivals. They typically had large and loyal customer bases, as well as octopus-like distribution systems that assured that their products would always get presented to consumers, often in preference to rival goods that were cheaper or better.<p>Size thus translated into might -- an advantage that enabled blue chips to dominate their markets, earn higher returns, and offer hefty dividends. In 1978, for example, the 50 largest-capitalization stocks yielded 5.5 percent, according to the Frank Russell Co. Those dividends were a crucial part of the appeal of blue chips for conservative long-term investors. Even if the stock encountered tough times, shareholders knew that their dividend would cushion the fall.<p>Size still offers an edge. For all the talk of big-company layoffs and the emergence of an entrepreneurial economy, large corporations still usually manage to reward their shareholders. An investor who put $1,000 in the Russell 1000 index of large-capitalization stocks in 1978 would have had $8,850 worth of stock at the end of 1993, assuming all dividends were reinvested along the way. During the same period, an investor in small caps would have earned slightly more -- his $1,000 would have been worth $9,190. The big-cap investor, however, would have slept more soundly. In the small caps' worst year of those 15 years, their prices as measured by the index lost 19.5 percent of their value. The worst dip in the big caps was 5.1 percent.<p>In constructing our list of the new blue chips, we began with some of the historical blue-chip virtues and added some new criteria to reflect the changing economy. We started off by limiting the list to companies with market capitalizations (the price per share multiplied by the number of shares outstanding) of at least $600 million, the size of the smallest company on the Russell 1000 index. We also eliminated utilities and financial concerns: Interest rates influence their share prices too strongly to make them blue chips. Of the 1,000 candidates, 640 made our initial cut.<p>Then we looked for the strongest balance sheets. Perhaps not surprisingly, only 13 companies of the 640 had senior subordinate debt with a Standard & Poor's rating of AAA, the strongest indication of safety and management prudence. Wincing, we recalibrated our financial scales to accommodate the releveraging of corporate America that took place in the 1980s. Eventually we decided to draw the line at a single-A rating. This requirement alone struck from our list such struggling industrial giants as <a name="NYSE:BS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10210"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bethlehem Steel</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:UAL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11520"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>UAL</b></a> (the parent of United Airlines) and some current growth-stock favorites, such as retailer <a name="NYSE:BBY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10209"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Best Buy</b></a>.<p>While the payment of dividends was once an important part of what made a stock a blue chip -- and the higher the dividend the better -- we felt this part of the definition also needed revision. In today's economy, companies must reinvest at a faster rate to remain competitive. No longer can they afford to sit on huge piles of rusty assets. It made sense, or so it seemed, for U.S. Steel to pay $3 in dividends on the $5.16 a share it earned in 1960. Today it is at least as reasonable that Intel pays out 20 cents in dividends on the $5.20 a share it earned in 1993. <p>Still, we felt the payment of at least a modest amount was important; it does suggest a certain confidence in the future on the part of corporate directors. Consequently, we struck such growth-company stars as <a name="NYSE:CPQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10381"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Compaq</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:SGI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11735"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Silicon Graphics</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:TOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11495"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toys "R" Us</b></a> from our list, because they didn't give us this indication.<p>To weave the safety net tighter, we looked at profit margins. Companies can no longer rely on simply selling more of their goods or services to increase their earnings. Certainly they cannot rely on upping prices. A true blue chip, we decided, should be able to raise profits by becoming more efficient. To reflect this, we excluded from our list companies with growth in either gross margins or operating margins of less than 0.5 percent a year.<p>Stability alone doesn't make a blue chip. Stability plus performance does. Earnings increases for a blue chip should certainly beat the increase in gross domestic product over the past five years. That growth in GDP, reflecting real output plus inflation (just as corporate earnings do), averaged 5.4 percent a year. We set the bar 200 basis points higher, requiring earnings growth of at least 7.4 percent a year to qualify as a blue chip.<p>We wanted to see a proportional increase in the candidate's price. Over the five years ended December 31, the Russell 1000 returned 14.8 percent a year in price gains plus reinvested dividends. A blue chip ought to do at least as well. We kept on the list only stocks with an average annual return of 15 percent; with bulls dominating the stock market for most of the five years, that seemed the least we could ask. This requirement further shortened our list, to 75 companies.<p>Finally, we required predictability and determined which of those 75 showed the steadiest earnings growth. As a measure, we used standard deviation, a statistical calculation that in this case showed how far a company's quarterly earnings growth strayed from its average annual growth over five years. The 50 companies with the least volatile quarterly earnings growth made up our final list.<p>Stock price is conspicuously absent from our selection method. This is a list of stocks a blue-chip investor may want to own but not necessarily to buy tomorrow. When, then, should an investor buy? In the table, we've rated each stock for timeliness. The ratings are one asterisk for stocks that seem fully priced to us at present (wait to buy them), two asterisks for stocks that seem fairly priced (buy them now if you really like the company), and three asterisks for stocks that represent value at their current price (clear buys now at this price). <p>To arrive at the ratings, we considered several indicators of reasonable price. One was the five-year range of each stock's price-to-earnings ratio. Stocks are buys near the low end of that range. We also calculated the ratio of each stock's p/e to its growth rate, showing which stocks are trading at prices that seem disproportionately low relative to their growth prospects.<p>We also applied the relative-dividend-yield system employed by institutional money managers Anthony Spare and Nancy Tengler to those stocks with substantial dividends. The firm Spare, Tengler, Kaplan & Bischel manages $2.2 billion using this system. According to Callan Associates, an investment-consulting firm, for the 15 years ended December 31, 1993, Spare, Tengler's portfolio beat the S&P index in annual return -- 17.7 percent to 15.7 percent -- and showed lower risk as well.<p>The details of that system are explained in Spare and Tengler's book Relative Dividend Yield. To simplify, the system uses the ratio of the yield on a specific stock to the average yield on the S&P 500, in a way that produces buy and sell signals. The yield on individual stocks historically fluctuates greatly, sometimes reaching a level much higher than the S&P, sometimes reaching a level much lower. The extremes represent periods when the stock is out of favor with investors, whose selling has reduced its price and increased its yield, and when it is overvalued by investors, whose buying has driven up the price and reduced the yield. Stocks are buys when relative dividend yields are high and sells when they are low.<p>That's it: our guide to the new blue chips, from their definition to the timing of their purchase. The list begins below.

						When he stepped down as Apple chairman, he was looking to restore his good name--and get rich, too. Instead, he met a small-timer named Peter Caserta.<p>By Jesse Kornbluth<p>The tale of John Sculley's brief, reputation-shattering tenure at a tiny company called Spectrum Information Technologies has enough curious characters and moral lessons to fill a book of fables. But it begins modestly, with a pain in the neck.<p>Peter Caserta's neck.<p>It was late May 1993, and the Spectrum chief should have been basking in glory. After hustling clients for years in what he called "a breakthrough in investment banking" but a recent federal complaint describes as a fraudulent boiler-room operation, Caserta had finally gained control of an entire company from one of his customers. Spectrum was no prize, but it owned some intriguing patents concerning the transmission of computer data over cellular-telephone networks.<p>Now, using persuasion and flint, Caserta had managed to land a dream endorsement for these minor assets: a deal with giant AT&T to license Spectrum's patents. <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a> had warned Caserta not to overstate the deal's value, vetoing the phrase "hundreds of millions of dollars of royalties for Spectrum" in his proposed press release. But in an interview after the May 11 announcement, Caserta got carried away, talking about "one of the most important licensing agreements of the decade, generating"--yes--"hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties."<p>Did Spectrum stock move as a result? Only from $4.75 to $13 a share. And Caserta looked like a genius. But soon afterward, AT&T issued a harsh reality check that valued the deal at only a few million. In a flood of disappointment, investors dumped their Spectrum stock. <p>The result should have been the end of Caserta's brief career in high tech. He had triggered what was then the biggest-ever selling spree for an over-the-counter issue, with 34.4 million Spectrum shares changing hands in a single day as the stock fell to $6 a share. Lawyers lined up to file class-action suits against him and Spectrum. And the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into what looked like a stock manipulation.<p>Caserta's response to all this? He hurried to his chiropractor for an adjustment.<p>For a year, Caserta had been treated by Lynn Petronella, a 39-year-old chiropractor's assistant. And during his time on her treatment table, they had become quite friendly. He cheered on her dreams of producing a semi-autobiographical movie about a female runner, even offering to help get financing. Naively thrilled, Petronella returned his encouragement--this time telling him to "get back in the saddle again" with some good news.<p>What neither of them realized was that Petronella herself held the key to that good news. It took a few more months for Petronella to learn that Caserta idolized <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a>chairman John Sculley, who had become the nation's best-known advocate of wireless communications. A licensing arrangement with Apple--now that would be great for Spectrum.<p>To Caserta's amazement, Petronella offered to make the connection.<p>Was she daffy? Not at all. Fifteen years earlier she had been a competitive runner sponsored by PepsiCo and had sometimes jogged with Sculley, then Pepsi's president. She hadn't talked to him since, but that was no problem: She had, after all, once cold-called Peter Ueberroth and gotten through.<p>In late September, Petronella phoned Sculley. And just as she had predicted, he took her call. Better yet, he took a follow-up call from Caserta--and invited Caserta to his home in Greenwich, Connecticut, to demonstrate Spectrum's technology the very next morning.<p>Caserta couldn't have dared to imagine what came next. In a farce of the highest magnitude, the Long Island nobody would soon be making millions off Sculley's name and reputation--only to end up being named in a fraud investigation by the U.S. Attorney.<p>Meanwhile, Sculley, afflicted by self-doubt and more than a touch of greed, would be dragged into a hell of his own making. Angling desperately for the business hall of fame, he found instead a place in every business-school lecture about the need for due diligence. A mere year after sitting beside Hillary Rodham Clinton at her husband's first big address to Congress, the self-styled visionary would face the future with his image shredded and a nickname that may prove indelible.<p>Numbsculley.<p>Readers of Philip Roth's "Goodbye, Columbus" will remember the difference a few miles can make. The narrator lives with his aunt and uncle in a muggy Newark apartment; his lover lives in a lush and breezy mansion in an elite suburb. It's cooler there. Life is more refined. As he travels to see her, the young man can't help feeling as if he's literally ascending.<p>So it was for Peter Caserta as he went to visit John Sculley on the morning of October 1, 1993. The Caserta home, in Plandome, on the north shore of Long Island, is hardly a slum. But Plandome is just a starter community compared to exclusive Greenwich, across Long Island Sound, where Sculley lives on four acres among the great names of American business. Sanford Weill, head of Travelers, lives close by; the Hirschhorn mansion is down the street.<p>Sculley is tall and lean. He favors crewneck sweaters, khakis, and boat shoes. If it weren't for the perpetually haunted look in his eyes, he could be stepping out of a Ralph Lauren ad. And that's no affectation: Sculley has a classic upper-class WASP background, sheltered and discreet--childhood homes in New York and Bermuda, the best private schools, an Ivy League education. It's not surprising, therefore, that he chose not to buy an ostentatious estate in Greenwich but went instead for an expanded clapboard farmhouse with dairy barns. His third wife, Leezy, has equally perfect pitch: The overall effect in their home is of muted opulence.<p>Caserta is Sculley's opposite. Bald and bespectacled, he's a relentless, street-smart, thick-skinned salesman. He has said that his philosophy is "Commit like your life depended on it. And at the end, remember it's just a game." A more fitting motto for him might be "Always be closing"--the line at the start of David Mamet's devastating play Glengarry Glen Ross. For Peter Caserta, no is merely foreplay for yes.<p>For his visit to Sculley, Caserta excitedly hired a limousine of the length that teenagers favor on prom night. And he brought along a cheering section: his son Peter, Lynn Petronella, and Dana Verrill, Spectrum's Dallas-based chairman and one of its founders. Knowing he was an outsider in Sculley's dining room, Caserta played up the fact and made it charming. Mostly, though, he caught Sculley's attention with his persuasive talk about Spectrum and its wondrous patent portfolio.<p>Sculley was mesmerized by Caserta--as he has told friends, the experience was "hypnotic." His most recent project at Apple was a handheld electronic device called Newton, a kind of supersmart cross between a pocket telephone and a Filofax. Despite his repeated requests to Apple engineers, the newly launched Newton couldn't yet send a wireless fax. Now here was Caserta hooking Sculley's own Newton to a device Spectrum had been marketing for years and handing the gadget across the dining table.<p>"Send yourself a fax," Caserta said. Sculley wrote a fateful line on the Newton's screen--"To Peter Caserta: Let's make this a success, John Sculley"--and activated its phone function. Seconds later, from the home office, came the crunching sound of his fax machine.<p>Sculley was so dazzled that Petronella thought he would get in the limo and come right back to Long Island with Caserta. He shouldn't have been. Commercial wireless data networks and other companies have been working on comparable technology for years, and analysts were briefed on Apple's own plans in the area in late 1992.<p>But Sculley sometimes likes to play the naif. And, as a former colleague says, "With John you have to remind yourself: naive in the service of whom?" In fact, Sculley already knew a bit about Spectrum. Just weeks earlier he'd gotten an enthusiastic report about the company from a young Connecticut stockbroker named Sean Dockery, who had been dating his niece. Dockery had described Spectrum as a neat little business with interesting prospects. So when Petronella called, it was synchronicity Sculley couldn't resist. And indeed, the five-hour meeting had elements of fate.<p>For all his talk about the pleasures and rewards of entrepreneurship, Sculley's career is a model of advancement through astute corporate maneuvering. He had barely arrived as chief executive at Apple, for example, when he became a rival to his charismatic recruiter, Apple cofounder Steven Jobs. Sculley felt he had misread Jobs's ability to manage Apple and, only months later, forced Jobs out.<p>Now, in Sculley's Greenwich dining room, Peter Caserta seemed another charismatic corporate rookie, albeit with far less talent than Jobs. But once again, Sculley misread a benefactor's character. And this time, it was Sculley who was the chump. Unaware that Caserta was a brilliant persuader who owned what the feds now call a fraudulent money-raising operation, he smiled credulously as Caserta looked him in the eye and uttered words that were, at that moment in Sculley's life, magic: "You can have this company and run it any way you want."<p>Sculley was even more vulnerable than Caserta knew. His golden career was going sour, and its 54-year-old proprietor didn't quite know what to do. Sculley in trouble? Few would have believed it just months earlier, but by the time he met Caserta it was undeniably true. Having been stripped of his chief-executive position by the Apple board of directors, Sculley was left pondering his future while clinging to the fig-leaf title of chairman.<p>It was quite a comedown. When Sculley arrived at fast-growing Apple in 1983, he was a sugar-water marketeer who knew little about computers. But after taking on a technology tutor and ousting Jobs, he began to guide Apple to its present-day status as a Silicon Valley institution and an $8 billion corporate giant. His success was unarguable. "He took a bunch of computer hackers who run around in sandals and jeans and married them to Wall Street," says Andrew Seybold, editor of Outlook on Mobile Computing. "It takes a smart human being to marry cultures like that."<p>In 1992, Sculley had a year that--on the surface, at least--exceeded even the most hallucinatory CEO fantasies. Bill Clinton apparently eliminated him as a running mate only because he had been divorced twice. International Business Machines mulled giving Sculley its top job, and American Express also tried to woo him. After Clinton's election, he was asked to join the new cabinet. Sculley has acknowledged to friends that he should have left Apple for <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>. But back then, he didn't know he was about to be blindsided by Apple's board of directors.<p>In retrospect, there is no shortage of reasons for the board's displeasure with Sculley in early 1993. His much-touted Newton project was floundering because he had set expectations impossibly high, and Apple's core Macintosh computer business was under assault from cheap IBM-compatible machines that had finally duplicated the Mac's famous ease of use. Yet Sculley, in what many took to be a sign of terminal hubris, had anointed himself Apple's chief technology officer, a strange title for a man who'd had no technical training.<p>Despite his techno-fervor, Sculley was becoming disconnected with the talent at Apple. Greg Smith, who heads an electronic-publishing company called RoundBook, recalls attending the first meetings of an Apple-affiliated spin-off called General Magic. He was stunned to see that Sculley had allowed dozens of Apple's top-flight engineers to abandon the parent company. "That told me Sculley was either indifferent or didn't know how to keep these people," Smith says.<p>Ironically, the incident many consider Sculley's greatest triumph--sitting beside Hillary for Bill's first big speech--marked the beginning of the end for the former cola warrior. To Silicon Valley, the myriad newspaper photos and TV images of that moment were evidence that Sculley's true agenda had little to do with Apple.<p>"Before that, John was just a Friend of Bill," says Tim Bajarin, an analyst and consultant who has known Sculley since his first days at Apple. "After that, he was targeted."<p>Suddenly, everything about Sculley seemed wrong at Apple. Now he was an outsider, an elitist who kept his personal Lear 55 jet idling so he could escape to the East Coast on weekends. His wife was known to be sick of the myopia and infighting she saw at the heart of Silicon Valley culture and was removing herself to more genteel Greenwich. And a self-important Sculley kept telling reporters of a future in which wireless mattered a great deal to him--and computers didn't.<p>In June 1993, after an uncharacteristically heated board meeting, Sculley finally resigned as Apple's CEO. Everyone believed he had been pushed, of course, and that he would, in time, resign as chairman. The crowning blow came in August, when the Newton made its debut to withering reviews.<p>Silicon Valley functions on the Hollywood model, with reputation even more important than accomplishment. In that insular but media-conscious world, the Newton debacle was like a verdict on Sculley's entire career--overnight he became a has-been who needed a box-office hit, and fast, to certify his comeback.<p>Apart from the enormous reversal of fortune, Sculley's impending departure from Apple was worrisome for another reason. A decade earlier, when he was preparing to leave <a name="NYSE:PEP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11166"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pepsi</b></a>, Sculley had told Donald Kendall, his mentor and PepsiCo's CEO, about Apple's huge pay offer. "The only thing that's a big deal is the stock options," said Kendall, cutting to the heart of the matter. "What guarantees do you have? I don't think the money should be taken that seriously--it's all bet on the come."<p>Kendall's insight was keen. Thanks to Apple's roller-coaster ride, the eastern transplant would return home far less wealthy than he had hoped. By the time he was set to leave Apple, the options he was holding were worth just $2.4 million. His departing settlement would be mingy, too: $1 million severance, a one-year "consulting fee" of $750,000, plus a commitment from Apple to buy his California home and his jet. He didn't get any pension.<p>Compared with his Greenwich neighbors, Sculley seemed a financial underachiever. Although his wife owned only four horses and his yacht was just a 100-footer, he felt strapped. He had built Apple into a titan but hadn't really shared in its success. And so his attention turned to Barry Diller, the Hollywood executive who had abandoned traditional media for QVC, the home-shopping cable-TV channel. With that leap, Diller had become Sculley's model: "He found a small company that no one had noticed," Sculley has said. "When he joined up, he got an equity position in the company, and a lot of people saw its potential."<p>Before the door slammed behind him at Apple, Sculley was determined to find a Diller-like situation that served two pressing needs.<p>Vindication was one.<p>Wealth creation was the other.<p>Sculley was off to Japan right after his introduction to Spectrum, so it wasn't until October 7 that he next saw Caserta. This time the pair met on Caserta's turf--Spectrum's Long Island headquarters, a crisply renovated suite in a building that was also home to the Caserta firm that would later be raided by U.S. postal inspectors looking for evidence of fraud.<p>Sculley was upbeat that day, and he saw what he wanted to see. He would later say he considered Spectrum "a little gem," a company with $125 million in revenue, almost no debt, an appealing tax situation, and a patent portfolio that was finally accumulating licensees. And he liked Caserta, who struck him as a little rough around the edges but solid and good-hearted.<p>For his part, Caserta was--as always--ready to close. His speedy negotiating tactics parallelled those of the allegedly fraudulent operation he owned. According to a federal complaint, that operation made its money by pressuring prospective clients to sign agreements before they had adequate time to reflect.<p>"We'd love to get you involved" at Spectrum, Caserta told Sculley. "Want to go on the board? Be a consultant?"<p>"No thanks," Sculley replied. "I'm looking to do a start-up--something I create and own myself."<p>"Well...you could run Spectrum," said Caserta. "If you'd come on board, I'd step down."<p>Sculley repeated his position. They were at a stalemate.<p>So Caserta shrewdly told Sculley about the preferred shares. There were 25 million of them floating around, he said, authorized but unattached to any individual. But not for long: They were due to be extinguished on October 20, the date of Spectrum's annual meeting. If Sculley put off joining Spectrum until after the meeting, he'd still get the $1 million salary that's de rigueur for first-tier CEOs, plus a nice options package, of course--but those options would be in Spectrum common stock.<p>The men discussed an intriguing possibility: What if Spectrum were to offer Sculley options to buy all those preferred shares--at a significant discount? If the company did well, the shares would trade easily and bring him more profit. Sculley's interest rose.<p>Spectrum's accountants vetoed that approach a day later, and Sculley agreed to skip the discount. But price, for Caserta, had never been the point. What mattered was that he had successfully led Sculley to a significant shift in his thinking. Now the question wasn't whether Sculley should join Spectrum--but at what price. Caserta had him hooked.<p>"How many options can I get?" Sculley asked.<p>"Ten million," Caserta said.<p>"Twenty."<p>They compromised at options for 18 million shares, about 20 percent of Spectrum's common stock if exercised. Sculley would be allowed to cash in 3 million of them right after he joined. (Had he done so, he could have had an instant profit of about $20 million.) The rest could be redeemed at the rate of 3.75 million shares a year over the following four years. Potential profit: $75 million plus. Small wonder that it took Sculley only days to agree in principle to jump from Apple to a company with a central office staff of 38.<p>Then, and only then, did he start his due diligence.<p>His focus was on Spectrum's patents. Were they really so strong that all the other wireless companies wouldn't be able to get around them, assuring the company a role in the future? Sculley's experts--including Raj Singh, an authority on cellular-telephone technology--came to a quick conclusion: The patents were rock solid.<p>That was debatable. What followed wasn't. Assuming the patents had integrity, Sculley figured the people behind them did, too. But Peter Caserta and his team hadn't developed Spectrum's technology. And even if they had, Sculley's idea of due diligence was laughable: According to people involved in the matter, he simply asked Caserta whether there were any problems in the company or in his past.<p>Here the story diverges. Caserta has said in court records that he told Sculley about the class-action suits and the SEC investigation, both arising from the AT&T brouhaha. In his legal response, Sculley insists he was told only of the class-action suits, which Caserta claimed were about to be settled. And when Sculley asked Caserta if the company used any aggressive accounting practices, Sculley says in his suit, he was told it didn't.<p>Whatever the truth, the fact remains that there was a vast amount of information available about Spectrum--and about Caserta. Sculley and his lawyers could have discovered it by tapping into almost any on-line data service or by running a background check. They did neither. As they saw it, Sculley wasn't buying Spectrum; he was just going to work there.<p>Again, Sculley's mentor Don Kendall was on hand with a gruff and prescient warning. "I hope you checked the people as thoroughly as you checked the patents," he said. But Sculley was too busy figuring out how to become the Barry Diller of wireless to listen. It took him a few weeks, therefore, to realize there was a great deal he didn't know about Peter Caserta.<p>By then it was too late.<p>
While John Sculley was climbing the silken path that led from St. Mark's School through Brown University and the McKinsey consulting firm, Peter Caserta and his brothers were fighting their way out of Little Italy with whatever tools they could find. Clem Caserta became an actor, appearing in character parts in some of Robert De Niro's movies. Frank Caserta gravitated to business. Peter abandoned his dream of becoming a professional baseball player and went through the two-year course of study at the now defunct RCA Institute of Technology.<p>Today, Peter Caserta describes himself as an engineer, a credential that usually requires four years of study. But then, he's never been very good with details--he even lies about his age, says a Spectrum spokesman. Caserta has described his role in the Apollo space program in so many grandiose ways that it's hard to remember he was actually working as a subcontractor to Grumman, a Long Island aerospace company, during those years.<p>But Caserta's involvement with NASA--however marginal--went to his head. Literally: It was there, he says, that he achieved a philosophical breakthrough he likes to call Apollo Transfer Technology, which he describes as "a visionary management technique that has been proven to be one of the most effective tools ever created to enhance the profitability of small to medium-sized companies."<p>Using this "management science," executives are supposedly able to address problems precisely even as they ask large questions. "We operate in two domains, the sequential and the instantaneous," Caserta has said. "The instantaneous is the domain of creativity and innovation. You look at a process and have an instantaneous insight that allows you to achieve what has never been done before."<p>Of course, this is all mumbo jumbo. It's not even original--unless Caserta somehow invented the language and themes of the Forum, Werner Erhard's most advanced est seminar, about 15 years before Erhard himself did.<p>Erhard, a self-described con man until he founded est and discovered that "transformation" could be profitable, knew that you don't need to make sense to draw a crowd. All you need is language--the more esoteric, the better. Erhard's philosophical musings were dense blends of Husserl, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein; his epigrams were sheer nihilism. "There are only two things in the world: nothing and semantics," he said. Audiences actually paid to ponder this mock-Zen balderdash.<p>In fact, in his est days Erhard used the rhetoric of liberation to destabilize hundreds of people who paid nearly $500 to sit in locked hotel ballrooms for two weekends of harangues and "sharing." The aim was to use hours of talk to break down long-held beliefs. At a certain point, est trainees would experience a spiritual crisis. Then, just as life seemed meaningless, a seminar leader would drop in a new theology that transformed trainees into converts.<p>Erhard and Caserta share many common phrases and ideas: "paradigm power shifts," "What we don't know, we don't know," and so on. They share the Forum, another Erhard seminar that Caserta attended and liked. They share Howard Schor, who once worked for Erhard and, as a "world-renowned consultant," became a managing director of a Caserta concern and, more recently, handled licensing for Spectrum. And they share a willingness to claim outrageous benefits from their services.<p>From 1978 to 1988, according to his promotional material, Caserta used his Apollo Transfer Technology techniques to produce "ten straight years of profitability" in "22 different high-technology entities." Using different math, these turn out to be a single company, Interglobal Technical Services, which Caserta and his brother Frank started in 1976 to provide short-term help for engineering companies. Interglobal was reasonably successful, and they sold it in 1988.<p>Caserta brought his Apollo techniques into his next enterprise, the Caserta Group, which he and his wife, Terri, then 31, formed in 1987. This company was the only business Caserta ever named for himself. It's also his Achilles' heel--the place where Caserta's character would find its most overt expression and the target of the U.S. Attorney's fraud investigation.<p>"He's a very persuasive talker," says David Fox, president of Nestor, a small company that works on handwriting-recognition software. "He told me that once he approved something, raising money was a snap. But after we paid him a fee and did a lot of work on a business plan, he never introduced us to a single investor."<p>Fox's experience of Caserta's "management breakthrough" isn't unique: A two-month Worth probe anticipated--and confirms--many of the U.S. Attorney's allegations. What we found is best summed up by a Caserta client who paid $24,000 but never got financing: "I'm a New Jersey guy," he says, "but this was ten pounds of shit in a five-pound bag."<p>There's good reason for such discontent: The Caserta Group had great difficulty raising money for anyone but itself. Using Erhard-like techniques, it buried clients in meaningless noise. There was a flurry of paperwork to "qualify" from a pool of companies vying for introduction to potential investors--a vision statement, "power questions," a financial profile.<p>And, mirabile dictu, virtually everyone seemed to qualify. Because that's how the Caserta Group got its money. Qualified clients were instructed to show up at the operation's offices with a blank check. Hungry for financing, they complied, only to learn that all the hurdles they'd passed entitled them to... pay Caserta. Up to $25,000, occasionally more, for careful due-diligence services before the Caserta Group felt comfortable presenting the company to possible investors. But according to the U.S. Attorney's complaint and the bleating of angry clients, close vetting was seldom, if ever, performed.<p>By the time they got through this last maze, Caserta Group clients tended to discover they'd found the egress and that there were no investors in sight--but for a price, the Caserta Group was still willing to provide additional consulting services. At this stage, the clients became an angry bunch, mostly at themselves. Says a peeved customer: "This is the biggest mistake I've made in 30 years of being in business. And it's my fault: I got snowed."<p>Caserta was never available when dissatisfied clients called, but in his own way he shared their disappointment. Remembers a former Caserta Group associate: "He used to say, 'One day we'll hit it big. We'll find a company that looks good, we'll take a share, and we'll make millions.'"<p>In 1991, such a company finally appeared: Spectrum.<p>"When we started in 1983, Dallas didn't even have cellular-phone service," says Alan Weinkrantz, Spectrum's first public relations consultant. "I was there with Orville and Wilbur Wright."<p>Well, that's a PR guy speaking. But in its infancy, Spectrum actually did have something quite novel: a way to send data across the airwaves error-free. It later acquired a patent for a nifty cable that could simulate a dial tone for toneless cellular phones, allowing them to be used with the modems, or communication devices, found in many portable computers.<p>Spectrum's dilemma was that it entered the market too soon--in the mid-1980s, no one much needed technology that was great for things like sending faxes from limos. To keep afloat, the company engaged in questionable business practices that failed to produce revenue or new products. In 1991, people close to Caserta say, a struggling Spectrum finally called the Caserta Group after hearing about its amazing ability to raise money--a pretty unlikely scenario. More probably, someone from the Caserta Group cold-called Dana Verrill, Spectrum's affable chief executive, and wondered whether he was looking for money.<p>And was he ever! The previous year, Verrill had seen Spectrum's stock delisted by the Nasdaq trading system for its inability to meet minimum capital requirements. Now he was once again experiencing a capital crunch.<p>Caserta saw the opportunity and went into overdrive. A typical Caserta Group arrangement called for it to get two board seats, a consulting contract, and some stock when it succeeded in obtaining financing for a client. But by the fall of 1991 Caserta had performed an incredible feat of persuasion, even by his standards. Without providing any financing for Spectrum, he and several of his advisors somehow managed to get elected to the company's board. Caserta had his foothold.<p>With Caserta's encouragement, Spectrum soon went looking for an acquisition target with good cash flow--and quickly found it in much bigger Computer Bay, a Wisconsin-based computer reseller that was for sale in part because of its board's dissatisfaction with the founder. According to Joe Frigon, Computer Bay's former top financial officer, Caserta used the takeover to wrest control of Spectrum from founder Verrill when some side issues in the deal went sour almost immediately. A former Spectrum board member says Caserta blamed Verrill for the screw-up. Three months after the Computer Bay deal went through, Verrill was kicked upstairs to chairman and Caserta became Spectrum's CEO.<p>With Computer Bay providing--then as now--80 percent of Spectrum's revenue, Caserta focused on signing up licensees for Spectrum's patents. "Make no mistake about it," he said that November, "Spectrum intends to enforce [our] patent rights and not deprive ourselves of revenues estimated in the billion-dollar-plus area." The method he chose to achieve his goal: pestering established technology companies until they paid for Spectrum's patents--usually just to get him off their backs. <p>The strategy was based on a sad reality. Spectrum's technology was aging badly as more versatile approaches blossomed in wireless data transmission. And there was nothing comparable in Spectrum's pipeline. In fact, there was nothing in Spectrum's pipeline at all: Between 1988 and 1992, the company spent only piddling amounts on research and development.<p>Caserta's talk of a billion-dollar revenue stream was utter nonsense. In 1993, the company's patent portfolio produced only $8.7 million in licensing and royalty fees, a number that will hardly grow much if the deals Caserta touted last year are typical. Spectrum's arrangement with Rockwell International, for example, calls for Spectrum to get $2.5 million plus royalties--but also says half of those royalties will go straight back to Rockwell until the $2.5 million has been repaid. A deal with U.S. Robotics brings Spectrum $1.5 million in fees, plus royalties. But Spectrum agrees to repay $1.25 million to cover advertising costs.<p>This is the shape Spectrum was in when Caserta triggered the AT&T brouhaha. And matters hadn't improved in the months between then and Sculley's appearance on the scene. Just ask workers at Data One, a once-promising systems-integration unit of Spectrum that wilted under Caserta's management. In late summer of 1993, 20 of its employees were summoned to meet with Caserta. The main purpose was to get sales commitments from each employee--the higher, the better.<p>But what the Data One folks found most memorable was Caserta's renewed passion for Werner Erhard's teachings. "He went around the room and asked us one by one, 'Would you take the Forum?'" one employee remembers. "Then we were all asked to close our eyes and think about the Forum."<p>Sculley knew none of this when he stepped before the media as Spectrum's new chairman. Indeed, some of it may still be news to him--just as so many other facts were news to him when the New York Times called on his first day to wonder why he had ever joined Spectrum.<p>In short order, reporter Susan Antilla told him about Spectrum's 1990 delisting and a more recent SEC investigation of Gene Morgan, Spectrum's underwriter. "It sounds like you know more about it than I do at this point," Sculley said sheepishly.<p>His education was about to begin.<p>Believing that few Spectrum officials understood wireless technology, Sculley took on a tutor: Arjun Gupta, who had graduated from Stanford with two degrees in computer science and then gone on to get an M.B.A. and work at the McKinsey consulting firm. Gupta had long dreamed of joining forces with Sculley; after hearing him speak at a conference in early September 1993, Gupta buttonholed his idol. Halfway through the conference, Sculley had to  leave for the airport. Undeterred, Gupta jumped into the car with him--then bought a plane ticket at the airport and talked all the way to Sculley's destination. In a strange twist, this 33-year-old consultant would become the Spectrum chairman's chief advisor and confidant, without ever accepting a dime from Spectrum or Sculley.<p>While Gupta brought Sculley up to speed on industry issues, Spectrum acquired a firm run by Caserta's nephew. It also agreed to buy a consulting company. And at Sculley's direction, it tried to settle many of its outstanding lawsuits, including the shareholder suit from Caserta's AT&T incident.<p>Every new event was accompanied by a Spectrum press release lavishing more attention and praise on Caserta--praise often attributed to the new boss. Meanwhile Sculley seemed missing in action, unavailable to reporters and unwilling to say exactly what he was doing. People started to wonder: Was Sculley the Patty Hearst of high tech?<p>In truth, Sculley and Gupta were traveling extensively and meeting the major players in wireless. But the way Spectrum people read this hermetic friendship, all Gupta really wanted was to separate Sculley from his new job so the pair could go into business together. Caserta was openly skeptical of Gupta's talents--"He's never run anything or managed anyone! What's his experience?" he'd say--but he wasn't about to butt heads with Sculley. This was, after all, the logical time for him to make a graceful exit.<p>Dana Verrill and two other longtime Spectrum executives had already left. Caserta was to be next, so he approached Sculley with an offer. "Do you want Sal, Al, and me to go?" he asked, referring to the company's chief financial officer and an executive vice president. "If you do, we will."<p>In fact, Caserta had already taken preliminary steps to leave. Early on, he had received Sculley's blessing to exercise almost half of his 2 million options, now bloated in value because of the Apple boss's arrival. In November he unloaded them, reaping an $8.6 million payout. There was very little to hold him at Spectrum anymore.<p>By contrast, Sculley was becoming increasingly desperate to keep Caserta around. If Caserta left, he felt, he would be locked in. Huge amounts of Spectrum stock were moving toward him: Without Caserta and his crew aboard, Sculley would look less like an employee--and more like Spectrum's only true owner.<p>How had this happened, he wondered? Did Caserta hire him so he could leave? Just a month into his job, say people familiar with his thinking, Sculley twigged to the real game at Spectrum. It was like a cartoon lightbulb clicking on: This is a race for the doors. And the more Sculley thought about it, the less he wanted to be on the losing side.<p>But how could he justify an exit?<p>In early December, Bloomberg News Service said Spectrum had recorded some future licensing revenue as if it had all been paid--but then spread a balancing payout to the licensee over several years, boosting Spectrum's short-term profit. Arthur Andersen, Spectrum's accountant for a decade, had signed off on the approach, but to Sculley it smacked of aggressive accounting. And back in September, he recalled, Caserta had specifically denied that Spectrum trafficked in such measures.<p>With that, the endgame began.<p>Sculley made it clear he regarded the accounting issue as a valid reason to quit and promptly holed up in the office of his lawyer, Arnold Burns. Caserta and his crew decamped to LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & McRae. And Chris Franco, Spectrum's young general counsel, scurried back and forth as a go-between.<p>Franco finally brokered a peace, but only by reminding Sculley that the consequences of leaving would be dire. The executive's arrival had added nearly a quarter-billion dollars to Spectrum's market value, he noted. If Sculley were to leave, the stock would surely drop again and there would be shareholder suits against him--not to mention a suit from Spectrum for breach of contract.<p>Ever conscious of money issues, Sculley backed down. But he still directed KPMG Peat Marwick, which he had hired to replace Arthur Andersen as Spectrum's accountant, to reexamine how the company recorded licensing revenue. He also began focusing on the daily grind at Spectrum, letting Arjun Gupta drift out of the picture.<p>For a while, things appeared almost normal. Sculley looked for a Manhattan office that would accommodate a pared-down Spectrum staff. He and wife Leezy thought up new names for the company. In a mid-January speech to the Massachusetts Software Council he sounded upbeat, joking about his new company's status as an unknown but noting that "there are lots of little companies out there in the wireless world--just as there were in the computer business 15 years ago. So it's an extraordinary opportunity."<p>Then, in late January, Sculley got fresh reasons to leave. The Peat Marwick recommendation was in, and it was grim: Spectrum had to restate its earnings for two quarters, changing a profit into yet another loss. And it wasn't until Sculley embarrassed himself in an interview that he found out--from a reporter--that the SEC was continuing its investigation of Spectrum over <p>the AT&T matter. In fact, he later learned, the investigation had been bumped up to formal status.<p>But no one at Spectrum, he would later claim in court documents, had bothered telling him.<p>Early in February, at Sculley's direction, Spectrum informed the SEC that it would restate its earnings on February 7. The weekend before the announcement, Sculley faced a difficult choice. On one hand, he was on the verge of signing a lease for a new Spectrum headquarters in the Seagram building in Manhattan. He had even settled on an image-cleansing new name for Spectrum: GlobalWave. On the other hand, Sculley no longer trusted Caserta to tell him the truth.<p>Just before the market opened for trading that Monday morning, Sculley submitted his resignation. He also sued Peter Caserta--but not Spectrum--for $10 million. Spectrum promptly upped the ante, countersuing for $300 million. And as Franco had predicted, class-action lawsuits against Spectrum were expanded to include Sculley.<p>For an executive with big expenses and no salary, there wasn't much more that could go wrong.<p>"Despair is the only cure for illusion," writes sociologist Philip Slater. "Without despair, we cannot transfer our allegiance to reality. It is a kind of mourning period for our fantasies."<p>Peter Caserta probably wouldn't understand that. By late March, the feds had moved against the Caserta Group; Caserta took a leave of absence from Spectrum the following day. His successors at Spectrum say he's a man of integrity who will ultimately be vindicated. Right up to the denouement, Spectrum associates described him as ever cheerful, a man who sees blue skies today, bluer skies tomorrow.<p>But most of the other key participants in the Spectrum follies are licking wounds and struggling to become reacquainted with reality. Dana Verrill and two of his key Spectrum associates, for example, are back in Dallas. No more high tech for them--they've hooked up with a small chain of Italian restaurants and hope to take the company public. Then there's Lynn Petronella. She wrestled a $300,000 finder's fee from Spectrum, invested heavily in its stock, and lost $100,000 when the stock tanked on the news of Sculley's departure. Now, with eyes opened, she wants to develop a film called In the Company of Men, about her 7.5 minutes of fame.<p>Spectrum will not be easily healed by new CEO Edward Maskaly, a longtime unpaid advisor to the Caserta Group. In the U.S. Attorney's charges, Maskaly is described as an investor who the Caserta Group claimed was interested in financing a client's company. Apparently, the client never received any financing. Even if his intentions are found to be honorable, however, Maskaly's prior connection to Caserta may prove to be unfortunate, for it perpetuates the link between a company that promotes clear communication and one with a reputation for obscuring it.<p>The Caserta Group, meanwhile, has acquired a new name (the Paradigm Group) and a new owner (John Bohrman, Caserta's son-in-law). But its problems continue--Bohrman was one of those arrested in a recent raid on Paradigm by U.S. postal inspectors. A few days before, he was frantically trying to distance himself from his father-in-law's linguistic technology. "That was Peter's thing," he said. "I'm not into semantics. I tell it like it is. Companies come here to find capital, and I know that. I have no intent to boggle anyone's mind, nor do the people I work with."<p>No one, in all this, fell further or hit the ground harder than John Sculley. He has done what he can to put his lost months at Spectrum behind him, dropping his lawsuit against Caserta when Spectrum dropped its lawsuit against him. (As a condition of the settlement, both Sculley and Caserta agreed not to speak to the press.) But although Sculley is still a defendant in the shareholders' suits, he has told friends he can't bring himself to hate Caserta. He has, however, cooperated with the feds' investigation of Caserta's business.<p>Sculley, at least, has learned something--in this fable there are no victims, only volunteers. <br>

Short-term moves aren't useful indicators now<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Where are interest rates headed? Is inflation coming back? Divining answers to those questions is particularly difficult when the various markets send mixed messages, as they are doing now. Long-term investors watching the short-term news may be reading the wrong signs.<p>Interest rates on 30-year bonds have climbed almost without pause since the Fed first boosted rates on February 4. Meanwhile, gold, the traditional inflation hedge, actually declined in price. The bond market seems to be believe that the Fed sees inflation everywhere. The gold market, however, seems to be saying that inflation isn't really a worry.<p>Which market should you believe? We'll go with the gold. Why? There's a high level of leverage in the bond market now. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, clients of the  dealers who sell government bonds had borrowed approximately $180 billion as of March. The collateral on these government-bond borrowings is - you guessed it - more government bonds, which fluctuate in value. That kind of pyramid magnifies profits when investors guess right, but also boosts losses when they guess wrong. As a result, the short-term swings of the bond market, which come as the pros try to avoid big losses when rates don't behave, are likely to be overdone. Wall Street carries every trend to extremes.<p><p>

						A California stock promoter is making big waves on Wall Street.<p>By Gary Hector<p>In an office with fading carpet and cracked walls in a shabby Sacramento neighborhood, stock market history is being made--on the telephone.<p>Promoter John Liviakis is demonstrating how he works the line in virtuoso style, telling stockbrokers around the country the story behind Wesco Auto Parts, Inc. In a nutshell, according to Liviakis, Wesco has become "the Domino's Pizza of the parts-distribution industry." And when the rest of the market catches on...does a 400 percent or 500 percent stock-price rise seem too generous a reward for the early birds?<p>To get its story of 20-minute deliveries in a $48 billion market to influential stockbrokers, Wesco agreed to pay Liviakis a fee of 980,000 shares of Wesco stock. So much stock, in fact--5.6 percent of the outstanding--that Liviakis had to disclose his holding to the Securities and Exchange Commission. For such staggering fees, exceeding the wildest dreams of most financial-public-relations people, Liviakis delivers the goods. Brokers and the customers to whom they relay Liviakis's story are responding to the pitch. In the mere three weeks he has been on the case, the price of Wesco shares has risen to $6 a share from under $3. Pre-Liviakis volume had been less than 50,000 shares a day. After Liviakis, it jumped to a peak of almost 1.8 million shares in one day, more than the number that either Ford Motor or Hewlett Packard traded on that day. <p>Liviakis's skill in spinning stories from stocks and selling the stories to stockbrokers has been repeatedly demonstrated. And this has made him famous among a large group of followers in the brokerage community. The stocks he promotes often get heavy media coverage, yet Liviakis's behind-the-scenes involvement is almost never mentioned. <p>Last year, he took on five obscure clients and, in a matter of weeks, helped increase the total market value of their shares by more than a quarter of a billion dollars. The share price of one client, InVitro International, increased 28 times, to $14 a share from 50 cents. In all cases, the share prices since have retreated somewhat, and the gain in market value has shrunk. Even so, for a promoter whose first client was Cascade International, it was a remarkable series of coups. <p>Cascade made stock market history, too, in its own way. In 1991, investors became aware that its story--about the business of operating cosmetics counters in drugstores--was largely fake. The company was liquidated; its shares were worthless. Liviakis took on Cascade as a client in 1985, when the stock was selling for less than $1, and worked with little apparent success to push the price up. In 1988, he says, he resigned the account. "My initial instincts told me something wasn't quite right," he says now, although it took two years before those instincts compelled him to quit Cascade. The shares peaked at $11.75 in 1991, without Liviakis's assistance, before tanking.<p>Since then, Liviakis's instincts have worked to his benefit. He has become a phenomenon in the small-cap market, the promoter turned guru. Every steamy market seems to produce one. In the early 1980s, it was Steven Greenberg, a flamboyant PR man-about-New York who got rich from the start in the casino stocks he was hired to promote. Liviakis's and Greenberg's precursors pushed investment trusts in the 1920s, Canadian mines in the 1950s, and advanced technology ever since the 1960s. Occasionally, one of them would find the genuine article, a concern with the market and stamina to join the ranks of America's great little companies. Mostly, however, the promoters found half-baked outfits with stories that sizzled but products that eventually flopped, and the stocks themselves sank back into the obscurity whence they came. For that reason, most stockbrokers distrust most stock promoters. The brokers all know promoters who wouldn't hesitate to inflate the price of worthless securities if they could, leaving the brokers and their clients to the tender mercies of short sellers. But Liviakis doesn't seem in the same class as the garden-variety tout. He not only sells companies; he helps reshape them, refinance them, and hire better management. Among brokers, he has developed a following that resembles a cult. <p>Liviakis earns his living in a classic Wall Street game that illustrates a simple but profound truth about the place. It is engineered to distribute securities--that is, to sell them--not to buy them. If it were otherwise, brokers would keep to themselves all those investment "products" they assert will double or triple in value next year. Stocks like those on Liviakis's list don't move higher simply because they are great companies, even if some of them are. Little-known stocks, like life-insurance policies, need to be sold. Many, and probably most, will eventually tumble--deep in their hearts, the brokers know that, too--but meanwhile, who wants to argue with the tape? Or the commission statements?<p>Liviakis might seem an unlikely candidate for deification as guru, but the position demands no professional credentials. He is a college dropout and failed stockbroker with weaknesses for expensive toys: automobiles, horses, and antique furniture. A vegetarian, he pops about 80 diet supplements a day, from vitamins to bee pollen. Posted to his bulletin board are photos of trotting horses that he owns and races.<p>What Liviakis lacks in formal education, he makes up in passion. He describes his work as a quest to find "the best little companies in the country." He says it takes painstaking research into 1,000 companies a year.<p>Last year, after more than a decade of scouring, the effort paid off with Projectavision, Inc., a tiny New York company that had developed a projection-television system with an unusually sharp picture. Liviakis discovered the company in 1992 and pushed it for a year without success. Then, last March, the company signed an agreement whereby Matsushita licensed Projectavision's depixelization ray, which will reduce and even eliminate graininess from TV pictures. The terms weren't announced, but the development added sufficient weight to Liviakis's story to move the price to $16.75 at its peak last spring from the 87-cents-a-share level where it had been languishing.<p>Almost simultaneously, Liviakis scored with InVitro International, of Irvine, California. InVitro makes chemical testing equipment that, it says, will reduce the need for live rabbits in corrosive chemical tests. Then came Lidak Pharmaceuticals, a maker of antiviral drugs that show promise in herpes and cancer therapy. Before Liviakis, Lidak shares traded around $1. With Liviakis spreading the story, they rose to 97/8 in August 1993. <p>By word of mouth, Liviakis's reputation spread through the brokerage community. His list of contacts grew; he now has the names of 4,000 brokers, investment advisors, and securities analysts on his Rolodex. Increasingly, they took his telephone calls and joined the phone conferences he often uses to make his pitch. By the middle of 1993, Liviakis's endorsement was sufficient for a broker to recommend a stock. In August Liviakis added a fourth client, Advanced NMR Systems, Inc., a maker of high-speed medical-imaging systems. In two weeks, the share price zoomed to nearly $8 a share (on volume of more than 2 million shares a day) from $4 a share (on volume of 200,000 shares a day) before Liviakis began promoting it. Advanced NMR reported a loss of $3.7 million on sales of $1.4 million for the first nine months of 1993, and the share price drifted back to $6.50 before year's end. That still put a market value of $100 million on the company, a figure 50 times greater than its annual revenues.<p>When Liviakis launched his promotional campaign for Wesco in mid-October, brokers and investors were willing to forget that the company lost more than $1 million in the fiscal year ending in June and that it was running out of cash before he helped it raise new capital. Wesco, too, became a winner.<p>Liviakis finds it hard to remain modest after such successes. "This may sound obnoxious," he says, "but I'm just being honest with you. We [his firm, Liviakis Financial Communications] have a reputation in the United States now of being far and away the most influential force in the small-cap market. Our name carries an awful lot of clout."<p>Among the many brokers who have prospered from his promotional efforts, it surely does wield clout. Others, however, find his success disturbing. The real killings in Liviakis stocks have been made by the relatively few investors who got on board early and sold near their peaks. People who bought near the peaks got hurt. InVitro, for example, fell from a high of $14 a share to end the year at $6 a share. It may take a gifted salesman like Liviakis to scout and tout a hot stock, but no amount of promotion can keep buyers from dumping their holdings and taking their gains.<p>However promising the companies Liviakis promotes, he does put the rosiest possible construction on their prospects. According to him, Projectavision has a revolutionary technology that could change the way the world looks at television. Liviakis says Lidak Pharmaceuticals has "the answer to herpes." And he calls Wesco "the fastest-growing public company in the auto-parts business." <p>These assertions don't always jibe with more sober views. Wesco, for instance, is growing. But its percentage gains in sales reflect a tiny base. Wesco's future depends on its Reddi Brake Supply Co. division, a chain of retail service stores it just began opening a year ago, with projected yearly pretax profit as high as $230,000 a store. If the Reddi Brake division can reach 100 profitable new stores by the end of 1994, Wesco's stock price may be justified. Reddi Brake has about 30 stores now, so getting to 100 will be no small feat. Brad Dunlap, a broker at Makefield Securities Corp., near West Palm Beach, Florida, is a fan of Liviakis's. Still, he says, "Wesco is either going to be a tremendous winner, or it is going to be like an F-15 with a full tank of gas, crashing into a mountainside."<p>"We are the most exciting investment opportunity around because we are growing at 500 percent a year," says Gordon Werner, vice chairman of Wesco. "AutoZone has proved you can build a chain. We think we can continue to grow at an extremely rapid rate."<p>To some professional financial publicists, Liviakis's practice of taking stock in client companies spells trouble. It encourages a PR counselor to assist the market in setting the highest possible price on the client's stock, which may not be the reasonable price that a disinterested professional analysis of corporate prospects would suggest. Liviakis, however, says he only accepts restricted stock that he must hold for at least two years. This, he says, keeps him committed to long-term performance.<p>Liviakis is controversial partly because the stocks he promotes are inherently speculative. Promise aside, their future depends on products still being developed and on market share not yet secured. It is part of Liviakis's talent that his faith in his clients' ability to realize their potential seems unaffected. In the tradition of promoters from Barnum on, he believes his own spiel. At least it strikes others that way, not least of all his clients themselves. Dr. David Katz, president of Lidak Pharmaceuticals, says, "I've dealt with all types of people in the securities industry. You kind of develop a perception of what the person is going to be. When I met John, he just totally shocked me. This is a genuine, down-to-earth, hardworking, conscientious fellow. There is nothing flippant about him. There is nothing shady about him."<p>Says Robert Blake, a broker at RAF Financial Corp. in Denver: "We talk on the phone two or three times a day. I know John would never intentionally mislead me. There is some kind of closeness between John and myself. I can't explain it. I've never worked closely like this with anyone else."<p>Liviakis labors painstakingly to create a story that sells. Before the selling, he prepares his clients. He worries over detail, making sure the company is listed by Standard & Poor's guides and any other standard brokerage references. He fixes any glaring financial flaws. If the company needs cash, he helps arrange to borrow it privately. <p>So far as the story is concerned, he ignores all elements but the product and the market. Forget that the company is still losing money. Forget that it has no sales. Forget that the competitors are Japanese zaibatsu or a pack of hungry American start-ups. Just look at the product, with gross margins typically 40 percent and going higher, and the market, inevitably measured by the billions, so that even if the company captures only 1 percent of it, its sales would be...you get the idea.<p>Liviakis spends his day making calls and answering them, always returning to the story. "I have trouble dealing with all the telephone calls," he says. "From the time I walk in here until the time I leave, I don't get a chance to breathe. I don't have a chance to urinate." Liviakis arrives at the office at 5:55 a.m. and leaves at 6:30 p.m. He goes without lunch and dinner breaks because he has "no time to eat." His clients join him in some conference calls with brokers around the country, 50 to several hundred at a time, from small firms such as Black & Co. in Portland and RAF Financial in Denver to regional offices of larger firms such as Oppenheimer & Co.<p>Liviakis says he succeeds because he is so selective in the clients he represents. They must have a hot "concept," or story, preferably a product with a claim to technological innovation in a large market. The companies must be obscure so far as the securities market is concerned. None of Liviakis's prospects are large enough to be followed by securities analysts, and none have many shares outstanding. "The smaller the market cap, the better," Liviakis says. That makes it easier to get shares into what Liviakis calls "strong hands," long-term investors who can afford to wait weeks or even longer before cashing in on a run-up in the stock price. As the strong hands take shares off the market, Liviakis whips up enthusiasm among other investors, who, by increasing the demand for a shrunken supply of shares, bid the price up.<p>While the naive may sense something vaguely if legally manipulative in all this, Liviakis puts another spin on it. "With my efforts in investor relations, I profoundly affect the supply/demand equation," he says.<p>He makes it sound almost like a crusade. "I realized years ago that small-cap companies didn't have any support out there," he says. "There is a bias against them from the brokerage community, investment banks, commercial banks, even institutional investors. There are thousands of small companies that wish they'd never gone public. They've got no visibility, no investment-banking assistance. Their stocks are undervalued and underfollowed.<p>"Realistically speaking, most small-cap companies never become successes. So the trick is to find the 1 in 500, or 1 in 1,000, whatever the number is, that actually can become a sustained success."In fact, small-cap or "emerging growth" stocks have been Wall Street darlings for nearly two years now. It's just that Liviakis's clients are simply too small and thinly capitalized, even by ordinary emerging-growth-company standards, to attract much attention on their own. They need help, and Liviakis is there to provide it.<p>"The name of the game is to see something that everybody else hasn't seen yet,"Liviakis says. "Because if it is so obvious, then it is already reflected in the stock's valuation, and there is no opportunity. So we are looking for something that is not obvious, that is not well perceived yet, that does not have any public relations, and the valuation is reflecting that lack of perception and support."<p>Liviakis believes that he can spot "the best little companies in the country,"but his long-term performance on this score is less than awe-inspiring. Certainly, he is experienced, having followed stocks for 27 years, since he was 10 years old. At that age, he says, he sat at the kitchen table listening to his father, who owned a Sacramento appliance store, discuss the stock market. Young Liviakis persuaded his parents to let him put $25 into a Value Line special-situations stock fund. "Every day I would look at this portfolio of about 100 stocks and dream," Liviakis says. "I'd get quotes for each of the stocks, and I'd pester my broker every day with calls." By 17, he says, he was managing money for relatives and "doing pretty well." <p>Stocks were just one of his obsessions. His father took him to the racetrack when Liviakis was a teenager. That led to an interest in training horses. At 21, he bought his first racehorse with a partner. He now owns and races 27 standard-bred trotting horses. <p>His passions led Liviakis to drop out of college. "I'd go to the library every day, but I'd spend my time researching stocks instead of studying for classes,"Liviakis says. He also converted to vegetarianism 20 years ago and hasn't eaten a single piece of meat since.<p>At 23 he registered as a stockbroker, and he had a system for beating the market, avoiding the heavily traded <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a>es and <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>s of the world in favor of more volatile small-cap stocks. He sold his customers on them, too. His first job was at E.F. Hutton in 1980. He says he "came out of the box fast with the highest first-month [sales] production in E.F. Hutton's history."He stayed at Hutton little more than a year before jumping to <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch & Co.</b></a> His tenure there lasted eight months. He took three other jobs and left them quickly. His entire brokerage career lasted only three years.<p>A broker who worked briefly with Liviakis remembers him as "a home-run guy, bet the ranch. He's a great salesman, but he's a risk taker. In a market like the one we've got today, his kind of small stocks do very, very well." But markets change, and in the past Liviakis inevitably ran into problems, this broker remembers: "He'd talk his way into a brokerage firm. Then eventually he'd get blown away when one of his picks tanked."<p>Liviakis had left Merrill Lynch in April 1982. Two months later, two married couples who attended the same Greek Orthodox Church in Sacramento as Liviakis's parents filed a lawsuit against Liviakis in Sacramento. The suit asserted that the couples had entrusted their life savings to Liviakis, who they said had promised to help them earn more than the 7.5 percent they had been getting on the savings. They opened accounts with Liviakis at Hutton and transferred them to Merrill Lynch when he joined that firm. According to the suit, Liviakis put them into small-cap stocks --on margin. When the market fell, the couples lost their life savings. They sued to recover $121,000 plus punitive damages of $1 million. The case was settled privately, Liviakis says, for more than $80,000. "Virtually all brokers have some client who tries to recapture a loss," Liviakis says. "These were fairly sophisticated investors. They were extremely successful when we started. I was a very aggressive broker and typically bought stocks on margin. When the market crashed [in 1982], they'd get margin calls."<p>Among other stocks, Liviakis had put the customers in Knogo Corp., a tiny manufacturer of electronic surveillance systems to deter shoplifting. The customers bought on margin as Knogo shares fell from a high of 303/8 in 1980 to a low of 91/2 in 1981.<p>Liviakis says a great many of his customers--among them the two couples--accumulated a "massive position" in Affiliated Hospital Products, Inc., a St. Louis maker of latex gloves and other medical supplies. The stock was thinly traded, with more than 70 percent in the hands of another corporation, so that the purchases by Liviakis's customers drove up the price. After he left Merrill Lynch, some of them sold, pushing the price back down and leaving customers who had kept the stock with monstrous margin calls.<p>In 1983, out of the brokerage business, Liviakis founded Liviakis Financial Communications. The diligent research he prides himself on now wasn't obvious during his first few years in business. That lack of intensive research and investigation may have led to Liviakis's brief liaison with Victor Incendy, founder and chairman of the now notorious Cascade International, Liviakis's first client. Liviakis admits that with no track record, he had few prospective clients at the time. A friend at Prudential Securities urged him to advise Cascade on investor relations. Liviakis jumped at the chance, despite his instinctive feeling that something was amiss at Cascade.<p>Cascade was definitely unfollowed and unloved. Its shares languished at 80 cents a share. Liviakis took it on and pushed the stock to about $6 a share. In 1988 Liviakis and Incendy separated. Liviakis says, "I grew increasingly wary of the people involved, the little inconsistencies, and the overall mysterious nature of the place."<p>A fraud, however, had been set in motion. Cascade's share price rose to $11.75 on company sales figures that were fabricated. Where the company claimed up to 290 cosmetic counters and racks in leading stores, the actual number was closer to 30. Chairman Incendy allegedly had secretly sold millions of shares of authorized stock from his desk drawer. The sales may have realized as much as $100 million, according to Richard Lilly, a former securities analyst at JW Charles Securities, who is writing a book about Cascade.<p>Lilly says he spotted Cascade early as a fraud and discussed it with Liviakis. Liviakis himself recalls thinking that during the talk, "the light bulb went on in my head." Incendy disappeared from sight; criminal indictments in Manhattan have been brought against him and other officers of Cascade.<p>Other stocks that Liviakis promoted during the mid-1980s never met his high expectations. Among them were Airship International Ltd., a Florida blimp operator; Holmes Microsystems, a Utah modem maker; Quadrax Corp., a Rhode Island manufacturer of lightweight extra-strength materials for a variety of uses from aerospace to bicycle production; and Big Sky USA Inc. (now known as Organik Technologies, Inc.), a Washington State clothing manufacturer that had developed a system for nonshrinking cotton without using harmful chemicals. The companies weren't flops; they simply never became hot stocks.<p>Has Liviakis's stock-picking ability improved? He says it was always sharp, but he just couldn't persuade managers of the most promising companies he found to hire him. "I came very close to representing companies that became fantastic winners," he says. "But then I was forced to take companies that were riskier and earlier-stage than I wanted."<p>Last year's winners have yet to meet the toughest test, that posed by a bear market. A closer look at the jewels in Liviakis's crown should give conservative investors pause. <p>Projectavision, for example, commands an 87/8 market price based largely on Liviakis's claim that the company's technology "could be revolutionary." Specialists in the field say this particular revolution is already over. Systems similar to the Projectavision system are already on the market from such giant manufacturers as Sharp. And more advanced products are on the way. David Mentley, a specialist in projection TV at Stanford Resources, Inc., says that about a dozen suppliers, including Sanyo and other major Japanese firms, are developing liquid-crystal-display projection systems.<p>Mentley has seen prototypes of inexpensive systems that, he says, "completely obviate the need" for what Projectavision produces. Those advances are coming from Texas Instruments and Philips Electronics. How then can the market value Projectavision at $98 million? Mentley says he doesn't know. Marvin Maslow, the CEO of Projectavision, says, "We actually like to think of ourselves as the most conservative of Liviakis's companies. We think our stock price represents a reasonable value."<p>InVitro International, another Liviakis success story, seems equally problematic. No one disagrees that the firm's intentions are laudable. It was created to find test-tube substitutes for scientific experiments done on animals. Its success, however, depends on Corrositex, a test for the corrosivity of chemicals done entirely in a test tube. At present, InVitro says, chemical companies must conduct these tests on the bare skin of live rabbits. The chemical is applied directly and is then checked regularly over a period of 24 hours to see if the chemical has done any irreversible damage to the live tissue. InVitro estimates the market for Corrositex at $200 million to $500 million. Others have tried to verify the size of the market, and can't. A specialist says it is as likely to amount to $10 million as $100 million. <p>InVitro appears to be making assumptions about a new standard for the transportation of corrosive materials adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Un- der those guidelines, all chemicals and other materials must be classified according to a new three-part rating system. InVitro implies in its marketing material that all chemicals will have to be retested to fit that system, at a presumptive cost of $100 million.<p>But that simply isn't going to happen, specialists say. Although the agency's standard is new to the United States, it has been in use in other countries for years. As a result, most multinational companies already have the data they need and won't need to re-test all their chemicals to meet the new standards. It's true that many new chemical compounds are created annually, but their corrosivity can usually be determined by referring to prior testing, without the necessity of starting from scratch.<p>Even if the market is as large as projected, there are reasons why chemical companies might avoid Corrositex. Richard Humburg, a specialist in the transportation of hazardous materials at Dow Chemical, says that Corrositex "is not entirely accurate for some chemical groups." As a result, the Department of Transportation allows Corrositex to be used to prove that a chemical is corrosive--but not to prove that it isn't. If a chemical passes a Corrositex test for safety, the results still must be verified by a conventional rabbit test.<p>Competition challenges InVitro, too. Procter & Gamble and Advanced Tissue Sciences, a company that grows human tissues and organs, developed a corrosivity test last year that uses engineered skin tissue. Such tests could be more useful than Corrositex's tests, which rely on a synthetic membrane.<p>The story behind the story at other Liviakis companies is similar. With a little poking around, the risks and questions multiply. It's always possible that hidden away in a lab or a test room, there's a product that will turn one or more of these companies into a Xerox or a Genentech. That hasn't happened yet, and it's by no means clear that it will.<p>Every bull market breeds a flurry of IPOs by companies that never sold anything but their stock. Liviakis's clients, by and large, seem to be a good deal more solid than that. Certainly they are speculative, but there's nothing wrong with speculation, and the rising tide of a bull market floats all ships. Those with a hand at the bilge pump float even higher. That's John Liviakis--pumping the bilgewater into friendly seas, filling the hold with air.<p>Gary Hector, a former editor at Fortune, is the author of Breaking the Bank: The Decline of BankAmerica (Little, Brown, 1988). <p><p>

Five Domestic Policies that Work<p>By Jean Godfrey-June<p>In his 1982 best-seller, megatrends, John Naisbitt noted that more and more people were choosing to forgo the camaraderie of office life to work at home. This was one trend, he figured, that wasn't going anywhere. Who, after all, would choose social isolation when they could spend their days under the glaze of fluorescent lights, drinking bad coffee and fighting petty corporate battles? <p>Quite a few people, actually. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that some 20 million workers across America commute no farther than down a hallway or up a flight of stairs.That number is growing by as much as 13 percent annually, as sophisticated desktop computers, modem lines, and fax machines change the nature of the traditional office. Many of these workers are self-employed--they have even earned their own demographic moniker, "lone eagles"--but organization men and women are getting a chance to unbutton their collars, too. According to LINK Resources, a research and consulting firm in Manhattan, 7.6 million company employees work at home at least part-time. Jay Chiat, who owns Chiat/Day, a Los Angeles-based advertising firm, is all but kicking his employees out of the office. He is refitting the agency's headquarters as a "virtual" office, which means that most of the people who work there only need to drop by for meetings. Otherwise, their work space is wherever their notebook computer happens to be. "People can be creative anywhere,"Chiat says. "I don't care, as long as the work is good."<p>As the nature of work changes, the very nature of the home office is changing, too. Increasingly, a home office is not just an afterthought but an integral part of home design. We have chosen five lone eagles who have transformed their homes into stylish offices. Here's a look inside.<p>
THE ART DEALER<p>William Beadleston left big-city life seven years ago to live in a log cabin in the Rocky Mountains. Not, at first blush, a wise move for an international art dealer. But Beadleston's log cabin is in fact a palatial 6,000-square-foot home he designed himself, and it's located in Aspen, Colorado, in the heart of the world's least-isolated remote mountain valley. Beadleston buys and sells pieces by artists such as Picasso and Miro. To stay in touch with the market, he keeps an office in New York and works with dealers all over the world to orchestrate purchases for collectors and museums. His office is on a hilltop 50 yards from his home. He's usually on the phone to Europe early in the morning and doing business with Japanese clients late into the evening. And the hours in between? "If it's a nice day, I'll go hiking or skiing." <p>
THE FASHION DESIGNER<p>While her colleagues duke it out on seventh avenue, fashion designer Han Feng stays home. Set in an apartment high among the turrets of Manhattan's landmark Ansonia building (you might recognize it from the movie Single White Female), her combination home, showroom, office, and design space seems a world away from the hustle and bustle of the rag trade. Whereas most designers attempt to keep clients away from their work areas, Feng's spaces flow right into each other. A cook prepares lunch in the kitchen while Feng's six employees laugh and gossip at their workstations. "It's comfortable," says Feng, who sees her off-the-beaten-path location as an asset. "Everyone said the fashion people wouldn't come, but they have." Only two years in business and Feng's designs have been featured in the windows of such high-end retailers as Saks Fifth Avenue. She has also appeared in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and the New York Times.<p>After emigrating from China in 1985 with her American husband, banker Stuart Schonberger (they met when he was teaching English in her hometown of Hangzhou), Feng started small with scarves and home accessories. She moved quickly to the simple, fluid clothes that are now her trademark. The informality of the home office fits her approach to design: "I start with a square or an oblong shape for all of my pieces," she says. "People's bodies give the clothes shape."<p>
THE CONSULTANT<p>Joe Boyd and his wife, DeAnna, who run J.A. Boyd & Associates, a construction-management and litigation-support firm based in Northern California, spend a good part of their workday out of the office. On the porch, that is, overlooking vineyard-dotted Napa Valley. And when they need to be further afield visiting clients on-site, for instance, their private plane is at an airstrip just three quarters of a mile away. <p>For nearly 30 years, the Boyds ran their business out of an office in San Francisco. But two and a half years ago, when they realized that computer technology could untether them from the office, they hired San Francisco architect Steve Geiszler to design a home and office that could work as one. The result: A three-room office suite--containing an office, library, and "technology room"--connected to the house by a long hallway. The office walls are covered by custom paneling and the rooms are filled with hand-painted furniture, but the signature feature is the deck, which has hookups for phone, fax, and computer. <p>"I'm out here, under the trees, enjoying the view and working most nice days," Boyd says. "It's an incredible way to live."<p>
THE TRADER<p>In his 20s, Mike Meldeau drove race cars. In his 30s, he built a company that made high-performance tires. Now, at age 47, he trades stocks. If that sounds like a comedown, consider the fact that his home office is a 104-foot luxury yacht, the Temptation, which he sails through the Bahamas.<p>Since selling his tire business to <a name="NYSE:GT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10668"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Goodyear</b></a> in 1991, Meldeau has developed a substantial stock portfolio, which he trades himself, whether in port at Marsh Harbour, Abaco, the Bahamas, or anchored off the shores of a deserted island. "I was frustrated trying to find someone who could manage the portfolio better than me," he says. "And I love trading. I meet other yachtsmen and get tips I wouldn't normally run across--many of these people are involved with major corporations."<p>Even from an offshore anchorage, Meldeau stays as informed as anyone on Wall Street--though his monthly phone bills run upwards of $5,000. He is the first person to receive real-time stock information on a yacht, thanks to a satellite hookup from Data Broadcasting. Like millions of investors, he watches CNBC compulsively.<p>And how does Meldeau structure his trading day? That's easy, he says: "It depends on the weather."<p><p><p>

ABS-$53
The company operates some 650 retail grocery stores, primarily in the West. Albertson's is a favorite of Brian Suher, a vice-president at Piper Jaffray Inc., because of the company's 15-year string of sharp yearly increases in revenue, profit, and dividends. Based in Boise, Idaho, Albertson's sells many of the necessary items in the family budget. Although it has a high price-to-earnings of 22 (about the current market average), its low debt (24 percent of assets) puts Albertson's far ahead of its largest competitor, Safeway, which is still loaded with mountains of LBO financing. During the 1987 crash, Albertson's took but five months to come back to its pre-crash level.<p><a name="NYSE:CLX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10354"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Clorox</b></a>
CLX-$55
Investors have to admire any company that's willing to take a securities analyst out to lunch on the day the stock market crashes. Growth in earnings and dividends has been steady, the company's product is not a big-ticket item, and people buy cleaning products even in a depression. Plus, the company has very little debt. The dividend: 3.7 percent.<p><a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> 
KO-$44
The company's one bonehead move__messing with Coke in 1985__was shrugged off by investors, and growth in revenue, profit, and dividends has been uninterrupted for two decades. Foreign operations account for two-thirds of the business, meaning global diversification. The stock has split three times in the last seven years, but it has been under pressure lately__as have all brand names: Coca-Cola hasn't moved since 1992. <p><a name="NYSE:CPQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10381"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Compaq Computer</b></a>
CPQ-$48
One of the best performers of 1987, Compaq makes <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>-compatible personal computers. But that's where the similarity between Compaq and Big Blue ends. Compaq is heading towards record earnings this year, according to Value Line. Yet the stock is selling at half the market multiple__a P/E of just 10 and price-to-book of 1.3. The stock had its correction recently when the company's earnings were cut from $4.87 per share in 1990 to $2.62 in 1991. But Value Line is forecasting $4.90 in 1993. <p><a name="NYSE:EFS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11872"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Enhance Financial Services</b></a>
EFS-$19
Enhance is a reinsurer of municipal bonds. The stock sells at about eight times earnings and right at book value. With taxes going up, says Pittsburgh money manager David Hunter, "municipal finance is here to stay." <p><a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>
INTC-53
A leading semiconductor maker based in Santa Clara, California, Intel was one of the best-performing stocks in 1987. After some rocky times in the mid-1980s, Intel's profitability is accelerating, tracking the booming worldwide sales of personal computers. In the semiconductor industry nearly all costs are fixed, so when sales get above break-even, everything drops to the bottom line. With continuing growth forecast for the 1990s, Intel is a cheap stock with a price-to-earnings ratio of just 11. <p><a name="NYSE:KM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10830"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kmart</b></a>
KM-$20
Here's a good example of a retailer that's getting dragged down by softer earnings forecasts throughout the industry. Since peaking at $28 in late 1992, Kmart shares have sagged to $20. At just nine times earnings and 1.2 times book value, Kmart stock is discount merchandise. Kmart, with its 4.2 percent dividend, shouldn't be confused with Wal-Mart, which still sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 30. <p><a name="NYSE:PFE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11175"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pfizer</b></a>
PFE-$64
Pharmaceutical stocks have had a huge correction," says Tom Mudge, vice-president of equity research at Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser in San Mateo, California. "One concern is that drug companies won't be able to raise their prices under a new health-care system. But if you can sell enough new drugs, particularly overseas, then raising prices isn't that important." Pfizer is selling below the market multiple, historically unheard of for drug stocks. It has rarely sold below a steep premium during the past two decades. And it has many new drugs in development, which is more than can be said for most industry leaders.<p><a name="NYSE:RD"></a><b>Royal Dutch/Shell</b>
RD-$91
This worldwide oil company has "tremendous free cash flow," says Scott Black of Delphi Management. The stock sells at about 15 times earnings, about seven times cash flow, and only 1.5 times book value. That cash flow is largely responsible for Royal Dutch's impressive 5.2 percent dividend. What's more, oil is an inflation hedge, and, of course, oil stocks did very well during the 1970s.<p><a name="NYSE:WEC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11645"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wisconsin Energy</b></a>
WEC-$27
Wisconsin Energy barely felt the 1987 stock-market crash, rebounding to pre-crash levels by year-end. It sells at slightly under the market multiple, yields a 5 percent dividend, and has smooth-as-silk price appreciation. Wisconsin Energy is a vanilla utility, with none of the unwise diversification that has harmed many in its industry. Dividends have risen every year since the mid-1970s. Rate increases percolate nicely, too, so earnings and dividends are likely to continue upward. <p> <p><p><p>

 SACRED COWS  
<p>
 By John Rothchild  
<p>
 I had a chat with Joe Oddlot the other day. we go way back,
Oddlot and me, back to the days when a broker was a broker and
a good investment was a stock. Those days, of course, are long
gone. A broker hasn't been a broker since they all became financial
consultants in a mass ceremony in the 1970s, when Merrill Lynch
was still bullish on America.  
<p>
 But I'm getting ahead of myself. Oddlot was still a broker the
first time he phoned me up, out of the blue, on my private line.
No friend or relative, lost or otherwise, has ever gushed at
the sound of my hello the way Oddlot did. And after the gushing
stopped, the serious business of pitching began. He told me that
IBM was poised for an upward move, and that he had identified
me as the kind of highly successful person who could benefit
from opening an account and buying some IBM from him.  
<p>
 We met at a bar with a happy hour, where the meatballs on toothpicks
were free. Oddlot said that his purpose in life was to put highly
successful people like me, who could make their own investment
decisions, into stocks like IBM, which were poised for an upward
move. "It sounds like you're reading from a script," I said.<p>
<p>
 He didn't respond at first, but after his third beer he admitted
that he'd been quoting from "Opening Lines for Equities," which
he'd memorized in broker's school.   
<p>
 I complimented him on his diligence: Memorization has always
impressed me. But I said that since I was only moderately successful
and my wife made most of my decisions, all his efforts would
be wasted on me. By then, I'd had my fill of free meatballs and
Oddlot had picked up the bar tab.   
<p>
 Time went by, and the stock market went up and down, and one
day while browsing through my Rolodex I found Oddlot's number.
This reminded me how far IBM had fallen off the edge of its upward
move. In fact, the stock price was half what it had been when
Oddlot first mentioned it.  
<p>
 I dialed Oddlot's number for old time's sake, and also to find
out if IBM was doubly poised for an upward move. A secretary
told me Oddlot no longer worked for Merrill Lynch. He'd gone
to Prudential-Bache.  
<p>
 So I called Prudential-Bache and asked for Oddlot. He didn't
seem to remember me. I reminded him about the happy hour we'd
spent eating free meatballs on toothpicks. "They don't serve
the meatballs anymore," he said. "Now they have spicy shrimp."<p>
<p>
 So we met for spicy shrimp. "Just out of curiosity," I said,
"I wonder if you're still recommending IBM to highly successful
people who can make their own investment decisions?"  
<p>
 "I couldn't do that," he said. "It would be wrong."  
<p>
 "You sound like President Nixon," I said. "But you're not a
crook긏ou're a broker."  
<p>
 "Not anymore, I'm not긅ow I'm a financial consultant. As your
financial consultant, I don't advise you to buy a single stock
before we have built up a relationship." He became quite serious.
"Stocks are fickle, but a good relationship can last a lifetime.
As a matter of fact, I'd like to begin to build a relationship
with you."  
<p>
 "I didn't know you cared," I said, but we set up a second meeting
at his office to discuss my long-term financial goals. "What
are your long-term financial goals?" he asked. "More money,"
I said, but that wasn't enough. He had me fill out a questionnaire
in which I told all: my net worth, my insurance coverage, my
monthly mortgage payment, and the like. At the end of an hour,
Joe Oddlot knew more about my private business than my parents,
my sister, or any of my friends.  
<p>
 "Funny thing about this relationship," I said. "You know all
about me긊he monthly tax bite for my house, the cost of my kids'
braces, everything. But I know zilch about you, except that you
wear suspenders and you dine out on happy hours." So he told
me a little bit about himself. He hadn't always been part of
America's investment community. For one unhappy spell between
Merrill Lynch and Prudential-Bache, he'd worked in a shoe store,
helping clients with their podiatric goals.  
<p>
 Oddlot punched all my numbers into his desktop computer, which
determined that my financial goals would best be met by my investing
in an oil-and-gas limited partnership. "What about all the stocks
that are poised for an upward move?" I asked. "A limited partnership
is better than a stock," Oddlot said. "It is a product. A product
has tax benefits, and is perfectly suited to a person with your
financial profile and long-term financial goals."  
<p>
 Somehow, the idea of an-oil-and gas limited partnership made
me think of Texas, which made me think of Lyndon Johnson, who
was exposed by author Robert Caro as a conniving, foul-mouthed
boor who stole votes and rigged elections. "I can't buy your
product," I told Oddlot, "because I don't trust Lyndon Johnson."
This did not help our relationship-building.  
<p>
 In fact, I didn't hear from Oddlot again. Then recently, I saw
a Prudential ad on TV (they'd taken away the hyphen Bache). The
ad showed a man about to dive into an empty swimming pool and
break his neck because he could no longer support himself on
his life savings. Apparently, he would have been spared this
agonizing death if he'd opened an account with Prudential, where
the most important thing they earn is our trust.  
<p>
 This ad reminded me of the oil-and-gas limited partnerships
that Oddlot had tried to sell me way back when, and of the many
Prudential clients who had filed class-action suits to recover
their life savings, which were lost when the oil-and-gas product
failed to help them achieve their long-term financial goals.<p>
<p>
 Once again I contacted Oddlot, and I asked him if we could start
rebuilding our relationship over a bowl of spicy shrimp. "It's
not spicy shrimp anymore," he said. "It's tapas."  
<p>
 So we met over tapas. After his second beer, Oddlot said he
was sick of tapas, having taken five all-expenses-paid trips
to Barcelona, Seville, and Madrid as rewards for selling the
most product in five different months. "That's what I wanted
to talk to you about," I said. "The oil-and-gas product. Could
it be poised for an upward move?"  
<p>
 Oddlot said he was no longer in the business of recommending
products or in the business of building relationships. Now he
was in the business of earning trust. And the best way to earn
my trust, he said, was to make sure my money was getting all
the attention it so richly needed and deserved, not from him
but from a reputable money manager with a proven track record.
He gave me a list of money managers approved by Prudential. <p>
<p>
 "What's in this for you?" I asked. After his fourth beer, he
told me. By connecting me with an approved money manager, he
would get an up-front commission plus a "trailing fee" paid every
year for as long as I stuck with the manager. This would help
Oddlot reach his financial goal of steady income그nd keep him
out of the shoe store.

						Below, the pros (minus Al Frank, who joined the panel in 1996) evaluate their picks from last year. The numbers following company names are the total returns. As always, the stock picker may have sold shares after the publishing deadline.<p>
Preston Athey<br>
<a name="NASD:ELRC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13294"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Electro Rent</b></a>  +13.6%
<a name="NASD:CMRO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13033"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Comarco</b></a>  +19.1%
Electro Rent is the largest holding in my fund. It's a great value and still undiscovered by Wall Street analysts. Comarco may not be the slam-dunk value it was in 1996, but it's still a solid hold with 20 percent growth potential. <p>
James Craig<br>
EDS  -9.7%
<a name="NYSE:CCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10345"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Citicorp</b></a>  +43%
I've reduced my position in data-processing giant EDS, but I still hold it and Citicorp. <p>
Shelby Davis<br>
<a name="NYSE:EQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13307"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Equitable</b></a>  -2.7%
<a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a>  +13.2%
I still hold the stocks and like the companies, but these turnaround stories have developed slowly. Reorganizations don't always hew to the schedule we'd like them to. <p>
Daniel Leonard<br>
<a name="NYSE:CHK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12049"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chesapeake Energy</b></a>  +209%
<a name="NYSE:NEC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11050"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Natl. Education</b></a>  +106.4%
Both are keepers for 1997. Oil-and-gas explorer Chesapeake keeps hitting new wells and growing rapidly. National Education has excellent products and services and is just now scratching the surface of the educational-software market. <p>
Jim McCamant<br>
<a name="NASD:SMTG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13506"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Somatogen</b></a>  -23.4%
<a name="NASD:ISIP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14081"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Isis Pharm</b></a>.  +42.9%
Somatogen's stock rose 65 percent in 1996 before falling because of temporary delays in clinical trials. I'm holding. Isis's progress in inflammation and anti-cancer treatments is promising, and we're raising our buy limit to $20 a share.<p>
Ralph Wanger<br>
Chuck McQuaid 
<a name="NYSE:OAK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11108"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oak Industries</b></a> +5.2% 
<a name="NASD:LBTYA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=51395"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Liberty Media</b></a>  -8%
New products will help Oak in 1997. We took some gains but continue to hold. We're holding Liberty because, no matter who wins the war between cable and satellite, penetration of specialized programming will increase. <p>
Michael Murphy<br>
<a name="NASD:ADSK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12689"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Autodesk</b></a>  -34.5%
<a name="NASD:EUPH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=44511"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Euphonix </b></a> -44.1%
We still like both of these stocks. Autodesk is a good buy, despite temporary problems. Euphonix has encountered delays in a line of promising new broadcast products, but we're holding on and expecting higher revenues in 1997. <p>
William Nasgovitz<br>
<a name="NYSE:SKO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13430"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ShopKo Stores</b></a>  +45.1%
<a name="NASD:DESI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13199"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Designs</b></a>  -23.8%
I'm holding these stocks. ShopKo is building a solid franchise in the rapidly consolidating pharmacy industry. Apparel retailer Designs upgraded its newly acquired Boston Traders line of stores, and I expect better earnings in 1997. <p>
Louis Navellier<br>
<a name="NASD:SMTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12316"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Semtech</b></a>  -51% 
<a name="NASD:ZIGO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15204"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Zygo</b></a>  +22.4%
I've sold Semtech because its earnings slowed toward the end of the year, and it now has a negative risk-reward ratio. Zygo still has attractive fundamentals, but the stock is too volatile now, and I've sold it as well. <p>
Eric Ryback<br>
<a name="NASD:MCOM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15760"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Metricom</b></a>  -10.3%
<a name="NASD:CHRS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12948"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charming Shoppes</b></a>  +100%
I still own these two stocks. Charming Shoppes' new management is reducing debt and turning the stores around. Metricom just opened new wireless systems in Seattle and Washington, D.C., raising its subscriber base substantially. <p>
Donald Yacktman<br>
<a name="NYSE:UAM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42135"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>United Asset Mgmt</b></a>. +34% 
<a name="NYSE:FNQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15674"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Franklin Quest</b></a>  +7.3%
UAM is still the second-biggest holding in my account, and I can't buy anymore, although I would if I could. Franklin Quest has produced disappointing net income, but I still like the company and recommend it again.<p>

						Whom Do You Trust?
I really enjoyed "can this market be trusted?" by 
Jim Jubak (May). I believe it was Sir Isaac Newton who led us to the phrase "What goes up must come down," and then a distant relative, 
Alfred E. Neuman, gave us "What, me worry?" Somehow, I survive 
in the current market keeping these two axioms in mind.
Jack Lefkowith
Wyomissing, Pennsylvania<p>Jim Jubak makes historical comparisons to determine market valuation. Using these measures, he suggests that the current market is overvalued. He then undermines this assertion by stating that current conditions have rendered such measures "irrelevant." He goes on to attribute the spectacular rise of the market to the massive amounts of cash that have poured into equities, yet he admits that no evidence of such a relationship exists. While I don't disagree with his thesis, Jubak seems to contradict himself throughout the piece.
Andrew Glocker
St. Louis Park, Minnesota<p>Credit Revolution
Did Mike Steere, the writer of "Soul of the Revolver" (May), have his tongue in his cheek? I have had one credit card for more decades than I care to count. Never have I paid a charge for an open balance. According to Steere, I should not be a target for more credit cards. So why do I receive, at least twice a month, solicitations from every card issuer in the country to have me accept another credit card?
V. Porter
Boca Raton, Florida<p>I was once a credit-card transactor, but ever since creditors introduced balance transfers into the interest-rate wars, I've been a kiter -- I regularly incur enormous balances (for my income level) and cycle them among several high-limit cards. I clear each balance every month by transferring it within the grace period; needless to say, by being such a "good" customer, I've been rewarded with limits that are not even remotely commensurate with my actual ability to pay. No matter -- since I never accrue interest, paying off my principal would be a waste of money! To suit my purposes, a credit card must carry no annual fee, offer the option of transferring balances as a regular service (cards with onetime or infrequent special offers to consolidate debt are of limited use), charge no transaction fee for the transfer, and allow for a grace period on balance transfers. These bank cards are my Holy Grail, as much as the high-income revolver is the debt pushers'. By applying a modicum of forethought to such specifications as billing cycles and credit limits, any sports fan with enough credit cards can watch thousands of games on his new 48-inch TV while the bill bounces around in plastic land ad infinitum! Someone with a less cavalier attitude, who fears each bank might eventually seal the kiters' loophole by eliminating any of the above criteria, can still take advantage of this method by making a large bank deposit with one of his cards' convenience checks. He can save for the TV with the interest he earns, secure in the knowledge that the debt can be paid in full if need be. True, the wellspring of balance transfers may dry up someday, but the interest-free deferral of financial obligations for an indefinite period of time is surely a more prudent strategy than revolving. And if it never stops, the kiter enjoys a free lunch courtesy of the consumer-credit industry!
Rob Leder
Stamford, Connecticut<p>Notes From Underground
Jim Rogers's column "Safety Nyet" (May) reminds me of the two-inch pile of Moscow subway bonds I inherited. Purchased in 1909 by a relative now long deceased, these bonds will probably never have value except as wall decorations. Russian investments won't be in my portfolio.
Daniel C. Bolger
Lancaster, Ohio<p>Digital Equipment
After reading "Little By Little" ("Review," May), I wondered if Laurence Hooper had used any of the personal digital assistants he discusses. In a case smaller than my old Filofax, I carry an Apple Message Pad 120, a PC-card modem, a charger, and cables. If Hooper insists on carrying a desktop charger and keyboard, he's missed the point of the MP 120. It also does just fine recognizing my handwriting and allows me to accomplish some tasks more effectively than ever, and I've been using computers since 1967.
David Howe
Milford, Massachusetts<p>Bonds to Stay
Susan Lee's "Bonds Away!" (May) misleads the small investor. How can transaction costs be killers when you can buy or sell five bonds for less than $40 or ten bonds for only $50? I also disagree that bond investing isn't for amateurs. I can't believe bond managers concur with Eduardo Haim when he says it's almost impossible for nonprofessionals to do well on their own. Since the mid-1970s, more than half my investments have been through the bond market, with only one loser: a savings-and-loan bond. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and vice versa. I've bought and sold numerous issues more than once, and every day you own a bond, you earn the coupon rate of that issue.
Walter G. Shaver
Phoenix, Arizona<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched an investigation into L.B. Import Export, a company recently looked into by the Advocate (May). Several readers had sent money directly to L.B., expecting to receive stock, and found that the company was apparently nonexistent.<p><p>

						By Anne Field<p>Energy stocks climbed 16 percent in the six months ended May 15 -- but it's not too late to tank up. Wall Street has shunned many independent oil and gas producers because of small size or poor past performance. Low inventories and high demand should continue to lift energy prices, making these producers a good bet. In the first quarter of 1996, the spot natural-gas price rose to $3.17 per thousand cubic feet from $1.34 the year before, and oil leaped from $19.79 a barrel to $24. Gas could hit five dollars by 2010, and oil could double, says First Albany's Michael Smolinski. <p><p><p>

						Our old system was good at picking stocks headed up -- this version adds a better way to avoid stocks going down.<p>By Jim Jubak<p>In our June 1994 issue,we set out to identify the new blue chips. We picked 50 stocks that met the definition of blue chip as investors have understood it for most of the 20th century. To merit inclusion on our list, a stock had to provide steady capital gains, growing dividends, and rock-solid safety. These were the characteristics that made the blue-chip stocks of yesteryear so highly prized that they were often passed from generation to generation. At the same time, we tried to adapt those timeless goals to today's
fast-paced global economy. That battleground has become so competitive that even a blue chip can no longer coast on its name or balance sheet.<p>So how did that list do? From May 6, 1994, the earliest date any reader could have acted on our recommendations, through May 17, 1996, our picks returned 46.4 percent, including reinvested dividends.<p>That's not bad at all for a group of stocks selected in large part for their safety and low risk.<p>Yes, the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index did even better during the same period, returning an amazing 57.3 percent. But in a red-hot market -- such as the one that ruled 1995 and the first five months of 1996 -- blue-chip stocks should climb more slowly than the broad index. It's a price well worth paying as long as they live up to their promise of remaining more buoyant when the wider market turns down.<p>The only thing that troubled us about our earlier list was that six stocks actually showed negative returns. H&R Block lost 12.3 percent, <a name="NYSE:SUP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12352"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Superior Industries International</b></a> was down 13.2 percent, and <a name="NASD:CBRL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13128"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store</b></a> fell 4.8 percent. Also, a few of our 50 made only minimal gains. <a name="NASD:AGREA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12591"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Greetings</b></a> and <a name="NASD:ASAI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12682"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Atlantic Southeast Airlines</b></a> returned just 1.8 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively. Even <a name="NYSE:RBD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11294"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Rubbermaid</b></a>, a company whose earnings per share had increased every year for more than a decade, suddenly faltered in 1995. Rubbermaid's earnings fell almost 30 percent, and the stock returned only 12 percent during the period of our study.<p>So even though our system delivered high returns, as intended, in a soaring market, we decided to make a few modifications to further improve the safety and predictability of our choices. The result, we believe, is a system that maintains the heart of the method developed in 1994 but gives more attention to the specific competitive advantages of each company. In addition to our earlier insistence on size, financial strength, and growth, our newest blue chips are market leaders and low-cost producers, are gaining market share at the expense of competitors, and have readily identifiable sources of future growth.<p>We began our 1996 search for the new blue chips with data from S&P's Compustat and the Frank Russell Co. of Tacoma, Washington, the investment research firm that produces the Russell stock-market indexes. Our research universe comprised the 500 stocks with the largest market capitalization -- size isn't everything, but it still provides an edge and often indicates a company's financial strength. We asked Compustat for data that measured each company's growth and profitability: growth rates in earnings, sales, and dividends and profitability in terms of gross and operating margins. We also asked for the standard deviation of earnings (a measure of the variability of earnings) over the past five years. And we asked Compustat to calculate how well an investor would have done holding the stock for the past five years.<p>Using these data, we applied the series of screens that we designed in 1994 to eliminate companies that couldn't jump simple hurdles. (We used the characteristics of the companies in the Russell 1000 to set the level of each hurdle.) We eliminated companies whose earnings per share had grown more slowly than the 5 percent annual growth rate (including inflation) of the U.S. economy as a whole. That knocked out, among others, defense contractors <a name="NYSE:GD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10633"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Dynamics</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:NOC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11093"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Northrop Grumman</b></a>. Another screen allowed us to discard companies, such as <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford Motor</b></a>, that had shown a big slowdown in the growth of earnings in the past 12 months.<p>A third screen removed companies whose operating profit margins had declined over the past five years. Some of the companies eliminated at this stage, such as publisher <a name="NYSE:TMC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11483"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Times Mirror</b></a>, were obvious candidates. Others, such as computer makers <a name="NASD:SUNW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14833"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sun Microsystems</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:CPQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10381"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Compaq Computer</b></a>, were surprises -- they were the victims of falling computer prices.<p>The next screen eliminated companies whose stocks had trailed the 14.95 percent annual average return on the S&P 500 over the past five years. Finally, we dropped companies with weak balance sheets (rated B or lower by S&P), companies with highly variable earnings, and companies that had cut their dividends in the past five years.<p>Only 199 stocks passed these tests.<p>Then, in a step new for 1996, we looked at each of the remaining companies in detail. Was there evidence that past success could be duplicated in the future? Could we identify of new growth? How likely is it that a company can successfully defend -- or even expand -- its margins? On the negative side, we looked for declining market share, overcapacity in an industry, and management complacency.<p>More than any of the screens we'd designed, this subjective review searched for trends that would make (or fail to make) past growth in corporate earnings sustainable -- and more predictable to an investor.<p>Our 1994 screens didn't clearly identify dangers that lurked in the future of some companies with illustrious pasts. Not all events are predictable, of course. We couldn't have known that an Atlantic Southeast Airlines plane would crash in August 1995. But we should have considered the airline's lengthy and expensive transition to jets from turboprops for its business customers. We didn't pick up on the implications for Rubbermaid of <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a>'s resistance to higher prices on plastic household products. Nor did we consider the risk in Superior Industries' dependence on <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> and Ford in the relatively volatile market for specialized wheels.<p>Our subjective study should significantly improve the quality of our latest picks. It led us to eliminate recent hot performers, such as motorcycle maker <a name="NYSE:HDI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10706"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Harley-Davidson</b></a>, when we saw evidence of developing pricing pressures. We dismissed otherwise attractive stocks, such as <a name="NYSE:CSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10385"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Computer Sciences</b></a>, because a company was not a clear market leader. We looked at the pattern of earnings year by year to see how companies behaved when the economy slowed as 
a whole and when their industry turned down. We rejected companies, such as <a name="NYSE:CLX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10354"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Clorox</b></a>, that had prospered because of turnarounds that now essentially appear to have run out of steam.<p>This stage eliminated 84 stocks.<p>To arrive at our final 50, we determined which of the remaining 115 companies had a combination of traits most likely to result in growth, safety, and predictability. Using a system that awarded points on a scale of 1 to 100 for increases in earnings per share, sales, dividends, and profitability, we ranked our finalists. (Yields have continued to decline in this market, so this year we didn't automatically eliminate stocks without dividends. The safety aorded an investor by a yield of 1 percent seems an insufficient reason by itself for preferring a stock.) We added points to the scores of companies that are market leaders, are stealing business from competitors, or are low-cost manufacturers or retailers, as defined by analysts.<p>The final list of 50 is both predictable and surprising. Thirteen companies return from the 1994 list: <a name="NYSE:AUD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10148"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Automatic Data Processing</b></a>, <a name="NASD:CTAS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12979"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cintas</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:GPS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11469"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gap</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:G"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10655"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gillette</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a>, <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:JNJ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10824"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Johnson & Johnson</b></a>, <a name="NASD:LLTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13973"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Linear Technology</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:OMC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14326"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Omnicom Group</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:SHW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11350"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sherwin-Williams</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:WIN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11642"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Winn-Dixie</b></a>.<p>The newcomers include technology giants, such as <a name="NASD:CSCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13494"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cisco Systems</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>. In each case, the high risk associated with fast growth is mitigated by the company's dominance of a market sector (networking, computer printers, and software operating systems, respectively). Other newcomers are hardly household names, but <a name="NASD:AMAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12647"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Applied Materials</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:AVY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10150"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Avery Dennison</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:DBD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10460"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Diebold</b></a> each leads its industry. These companies made the list because leadership gives a company a significant edge and assures the investor of greater predictability in earnings. Diebold's automatic-teller machines, for example, continue to capture market share as banks close branches run by humans and install ATMs.<p>Other companies, such as <a name="NYSE:MA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10969"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>May Department Stores</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:NUE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11098"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nucor</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:LUV"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11377"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Southwest Airlines</b></a>, pursue business strategies of demonstrated success. May will bring its low costs to the soon-to-be-acquired Strawbridge & Clothier chain. <a name="NYSE:NUE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11098"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nucor</b></a> has become the fourth-largest U.S. steelmaker by aggressively using the newest technology to keep costs low. Southwest has created a low-cost structure that none of its competitors can match.<p>As we did in 1994, we kept stock price out of the selection method. This is a list of stocks that a blue-chip investor may want to own but not necessarily want to buy tomorrow. In the table that follows, we've rated each stock for timeliness (how attractive they are right now). Stocks that seem fully priced to us (wait to buy them) get one star. Stocks that seem fairly priced receive two stars. Stocks with three stars represent clear buys at their current price.<p>To arrive at these ratings, we considered the five-year range of each stock's price-to-earnings ratio in the context of the current market. Stocks at the low end of their five-year range generally were given better ratings than those at the high end. We made exceptions only when a stock appeared to have a good reason for a higher-than-usual p/e ratio (it had to have recently improved its earnings growth in a way we felt was sustainable).<p>Investors should remember that any system that attempts to compare a stock's price to its fundamental value is at the mercy of the stock market. For example, in 1994, we called Coca-Cola overvalued at $39.38. In mid-May 1996, it traded at $46.13 -- after a two-for-one stock split. In 1994, the stock's price-to-earnings ratio was 23; recently, it was 38. If the market as a whole continues to roar ahead, Coca-Cola could well climb from its current price. But at a level like this -- one clearly above any value supported by the stock's fundamentals -- even a blue chip becomes a risky investment.<p>That's our revised -- and we think improved -- guide to the new blue chips. <p>---

Which credit-card issuers really go to bat for you?<p>By Gail Liverman<p>If you've ever fought over a disputed credit-card charge, you know there's a limit to what you can do yourself: It's your credit-card issuer who fights the battle for you. So it's important to know which banks will take up your cause in earnest. "The ones that
invest in customer service and put time, effort, and dollars into that area do a better job, like <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:AXP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10085"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Express</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:WB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10581"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wachovia</b></a>," says Ruth Susswein, executive director of Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer group based in Salem, Virginia. <p>One of those trying to bolster its customer service, NationsBank, recently became one of the first card issuers to establish a customer-advocacy group specifically designed to handle cardholder disputes after traditional routes have been exhausted. "We take on the role of advocate," says Mallory Anderson, vice president and manager of cardholder disputes for the company. "That's the way we see our role, and we hope our customers see us the same way." NationsBank handles most of its cut-and-dried cases -- the wrong amount appearing on a statement, double billing -- by phone or fax. The advocacy group gets involved in more complex cases, such as when a customer refuses to pay for a poor-quality item or never receives a product a merchant claims to have sent.<p>AT&T also makes life easy for a cardholder looking to dispute a charge on its Universal Card, which received the highest ranking for overall customer satisfaction in a recent J. D. Power & Associates survey (see box). AT&T will mail a form, called a ballot box, to a disgruntled cardholder who telephones. This way, the cardholder needn't go through the trouble of composing a letter to exercise his or her legal rights.<p>Legally, interest can't be charged while a bill is in formal dispute, but it can be charged retroactively if the cardholder loses. Despite its customer-advocacy position, NationsBank does assess interest retroactively. With American Express's Optima cards and AT&T's Universal Card, interest charges resume if the cardholder loses the dispute but aren't assessed for the period of appeal.<p>Of course, many issuers aren't responsive to disputed charges. Fortunately, the law is on the cardholder's side. Under federal truth-in-lending regulations, you have the right to get an error corrected on your credit-card bill provided you notify the issuer in writing within 60 days of the postmarked date on the statement. While your claim is being investigated, you don't have to pay the charge, and your credit record can't be adversely affected. You also have the right to put in a claim on a purchase you feel is of poor quality, as long as you have made an attempt to resolve the dispute directly with the merchant. <p>In the scramble to keep good customers, some issuers have automatically ruled in favor of valued cardholders in disputes up to a set dollar limit, says Michael Auriemma, president of Auriemma Consulting Group in Westbury, New York, a credit-card-management consultant. But issuers are loath to admit they do this. NationsBank's policy on the matter is "proprietary information." American Express director of communications Marcos Rada says Amex might absorb all or part of a charge for "an extremely highly valued card member who has been a member for many years and is under a compelling situation beyond their control." <p>So if you've been a good customer, it's worth taking any dispute, no matter how minor, to your issuer. <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> TOOLBOX  <p> By Maxwell Dale  <p> Q: What is a stock split? <p>A: A way for a company to lower its apparent stock price. For example, the <a name="NYSE:GPS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11469"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gap</b></a> recently announced a two-for-one split. An investor who owned one share at $56 before the split will own two shares priced at $28 each afterward. Nothing has really changed.  <p> If nothing changes, why does a company split its stock? <p>Lowering the price by a split can make a stock seem more desirable to a larger number of individual investors, and many companies want to attract this type of long-term investor.  <p> Is a stock split good? <p>The reason for a split하 strong run-up in the stock pricereflects strong earnings growth and management's confidence in the future,but it doesn't mean the stock will continue to rise.   <p> Is it better to sell the stock before or after the split? <p>According to academic studies, the actual split doesn't have a direct impact on the stock price. The price usually runs up until the split and then continues to rise only if earnings increase. If the split is accompanied by an earnings increase, the stock may move up slightly for a brief time close to the announcement. <p> What's the difference between a stock split and a stock dividend? <p>A stock dividend is a dividend paid in stock instead of cash. Like a split, it doesn't increase the value of a share but gives an investor additional shares, each of which is worth slightly less. An investor with 100 shares worth $10 each who receives a 10 percent stock dividend will now own 110 shares worth $9.09 each.   <p> What's a reverse split? <p>Companies may reduce the number of shares by consolidating them into higher-value units. Just as a stock split reflects positively on a company, a reverse split can be a warning: The company is trying to avoid a low stock price, which might prevent institutional investors, who may have limits on how little they can pay for shares, from buying. Only the number of shares an investor owns (not their total value) changes. <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> RIDING THE CYCLES <p>If the economy grows faster than expected, then cyclical stocks should prosper  <p> By Constance Gustke  <p> Cyclical stocks are the market's roller-coaster plays. Driven by the engine of the national economy, the earnings of cyclical companies climb peaks and then fall into valleys. The reason: These companies traffic in durable consumer goods such as autos and homes -- or the raw materials that go into these items --and sell in mature markets where demand fluctuates with economic conditions.   <p> In the 1990 recession year, for example, cyclical stocks swooned, falling 20.13 percent versus a 6.56 percent decline for the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index. Regardless of product niche or management style, cyclical companies slow down when the economy does --and so do their stocks. The stock price of <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> dropped over 40 percent during 1994, when consumers pulled back on high-ticket expenditures because interest rates rose by almost three percentage points.  <p> Investors usually flee to growth stocks when they fear a recession. Because these companies are in less mature markets -- young industries where demand will grow even if the economy stagnates -- their stocks stay steady or decline less rapidly than cyclicals doin an economic downturn. During the 1990 recession, when cyclicals plunged, growth stocks gained 2.48 percent, according to Safian Investment Research in White Plains, New York.  <p> When the economy rebounds, though, cyclicals shine. As the economy recovered from the recession in 1992 and 1993, cyclicals beat the S&P 500 handily, registering double-digit gains.  <p> Cyclicals are treading water now because investors aren't sure where the economy is heading. "Investors are hedging their bets between growth stocks and cyclicals," says Kurt Walters, vice president of research at Safian.  <p> The extreme volatility of cyclical stocks makes them poor buy-and-hold investments. For example, GM eked out an 8.62 percent annualized return compared with 15.2 for the S&P 500 during the ten year sending on January 31, 1996. "Cyclicals are bought to be sold," says Joseph Barthel, an analyst at Fahnestock in New York.  <p> Investment strategists recommend buying cyclical stocks when their prices are low on a historic basis and their price-to-earnings ratios are high, as they are when the economy is in a recession or the market is anticipating one. Buying stocks with high p/e's may seem the wrong thing to do, but for a cyclical, a high p/e is the result of depressed earnings and can often signal the trough just before earnings turn around.  <p> Savvy investors don't overlook the fundamentals, either. They seek out industry leaders with rock-solid balance sheets and minimal debt loads. Quality stocks are apt to rebound fastest once the economy regains its luster. Studying a company's fundamentals is the best way to tell the difference between a sound company that is riding the waves of the economy and a troubled enterprise in danger of going under.  <p><p>

						Newly appointed regulator Mary Schapiro says the NASD is finally committed to doing right by investors -- and that she's the proof <p> The National Association of Securities Dealers hasn't enjoyed much credibility as a self-regulatory organization. The Nasdaq stock market, which it operates and supposedly oversees, has long been known as an insider-oriented club where powerful trading houses thrive and small investors can get cheated. Part of the problem, according to the Rudman Commission, a high-level task force that recently released a report on the NASD's problems, is that the world's largest SRO routinely fails to put "substantial daylight" between itself and the Nasdaq market it is charged with regulating. Last fall, however, the NASD promised to clean up its act. In November, it formed a new regulatory arm, NASD Regulation, and gave 40-year-old Mary Schapiro the job of running it. At the time, Schapiro was chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. She is also a former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission. While at the CFTC, she won a reputation for rigorous enforcement by boosting the commission's number of investigations by more than half. "She can be tough when she needs to be," says former SEC commissioner Rick Roberts. Recently, Schapiro talked with Worth financial editor Elizabeth Macdonald about her plans to address the interests of investors as president of the NASDR.  <p> Worth: How would you respond to people such as Alan Davidson, president of the Independent Broker Dealer Association, who says that the Nasdaq market is beyond reform? <p>Schapiro: I think Nasdaq has been a phenomenal engine of growth for some extraordinary companies. It has offered a lot to the investing public in only 25 years. I think one of the very legitimate criticisms in the Rudman report is that the focus of the energy of the organization has largely been on the growth of the business. Now our focus is clear; it's regulation, not, say, new listings or Nasdaq technology. I care about market development the way any investor would, but I have no responsibility for it. It won't take one scintilla of my attention.  <p> What persuaded you to make financial regulation your occupation?<p>In the winter of 1979 and 1980, Nelson and Bunker Hunt were charged with manipulating the silver market. It made me angry that a small group of people would attempt to manipulate the market to the detriment of thousands of people. I was fascinated, too, that two people could have such an impact on a market that was presumably big, deep, and liquid. So right after I graduated from George Washington law school, I went over to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission in D.C. and got a job as a trial attorney.  <p> Any tough moments in your career? <p>It didn't discourage me, but last August, The Wall Street Journal ran an editorial that was pretty nasty. They criticized my enforcementaction against Metallgesellschaft AG. The company had lost hundreds of millions of dollars trading energy products, and its actions had almost brought down the New York Mercantile Exchange. Sowe fined them $2.5 million and forced them to institute certain controls before they could begin trading again. Has the Journal ever liked an enforcement case brought against a big company? Probably not. But it was the meanness and the inaccuracies in the editorial that bothered me.  <p> Criticism comes with the territory. But I try to turn it into a positive if I can. In 1994, Tom Donovan, the president of the Chicago Board of Trade, reportedly said in one of his board meetings that he wasn't going to be intimidated by some blond, five-foot-two-inch girl. When the Chicago press called me to get my reaction, I said, Well, I'm not five two, I'm five five. Tom and I have gotten along better ever since.  <p> What will you initially focus on to fix the NASD's less than stellar reputation?  <p>I want to concentrate on the issues in the Rudman report, such as upgrading the disciplinary process. We'll be supplementing the hearing committees in the NASD's 11 district offices with professional hearing officers, who will conduct disciplinary hearings to determine whether brokers have violated the law and,if so, what sanctions should be imposed. Also, we will be filling half our board of directors with non-industry members.   <p> What about enforcement? <p>We're going to devote more resources to this area. Regulation is meaningless unless you're willing to back it up. At the end of the day, people aren't going to use the market unless they think it's fair.  <p> What will it take to persuade investors that you are making a difference? <p>We have to prove we're committed to the highest-quality regulation of the market. We have to demonstrate that in how we examine sales practices at brokerage firms, in our surveillance of the Nasdaq market, and in our handling of customer complaints.  <p> How will you fix some of the systemic problems that currently exist, such as incentive programs that encourage brokers to take advantage of their customers?  <p>We must hold accountable the people up the chain of command at brokerage firms. Too often, we get cases where branch managers choose to ignore red flags because a broker is generating a huge amount of revenue. Some firms aren't as diligent in cleaning their own houses as they should be. So we'll discipline firms for failing to supervise their employees.  <p> You're talking about 507,000 brokers at 5,400 firms trading a daily volume of 524 million shares. Can you really be  effective policing such a large beat as a self-regulatory organization? <p>I don't know of any other industry where self-regulation has been as effective a tool as in the securities industry. Take the medical profession. How many times have you read about doctors who have made repeated, tragic errors before there's action by their peers? We've sanctioned thousands of brokers for violating the rules. Also, if we're not there to examine sales practices,look at the books, and check internal controls, who's going to do it? The SEC has 200 examiners. They can't do the whole job. <p> What sort of a standard do you think the investment industry should be held to?  <p>In my seven years at the SEC and CFTC, I've read thousands of enforcement cases, and it's disturbing to  see how investors are sometimes treated. It has given me  a sense of focus. I believe that when people entrust their money to  a broker, money that they've worked hard for, they have a right to be dealt with fairly and honestly. A broker must adhere to a standard of integrity and fairness. If a broker does not live up to that standard, he or she ought not to be working in the business anymore. We must take them out of the industry.  <p> Do you think mandatory arbitration  adequately redresses investors'problems? <p>My view is, if we're going to have mandatory arbitration, then we darn well better be running a first-class arbitration operation.We're looking at major procedural changes to improve timing and efficiency, and to keep disputes out of the courts. Litigating in court isn't really an ideal solution, either. The expense is extraordinary. Also, going to court can be a delaying tactic, and investors often lose out that way, too.  <p> Investors receive virtually zero information from the NASD hotline on crooked dealers. Such requests often fall into a blackhole. Any plans to fix this mess? <p>We are working on it. We will soon be able to offer better and more complete information on complaints against brokers, arbitration awards, and disciplinary actions. I also want to make this information available to investors on the Internet.  <p> Can you say anything more about your plans to improve your response to customer grievances?  <p>Last year, the NASD received more than 4,500 customer complaints. My concern is that if we have a market decline you will see the volume of complaints shoot up dramatically. We need to be prepared to handle that event when it happens, rather than scurrying around after the fact trying to clean up the back log. So I've asked for an internal report on how we can improve the process and how we  can deal with an increased volume of complaints, if necessary. I also want to be able to use the complaint information more effectively for enforcement cases and to get a better sense of what's going on across the country, to see trends in bad practices. <p> Do you plan to pursue more "message cases"핪hose with maximum deter- rent value?  <p>Yes, I'm a big believer in message cases. That was my approach at the CFTC, where we had an enforcement staff of 145 to police a huge industry. It sends a clear message about what is not acceptable and helps people modify their behavior before they get into trouble. Also, it has a punitive effect. We have to bring more than message cases, though; we need a higher quantity of cases. We need to do both.  <p><p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> THE MUNI MINEFIELD <p>Flat tax. Schmlat tax. The real threat to municipal bonds lurks at the local level.   <p> By Greg Millman  <p> In 1994, many bond-fund investors were blindsided when Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes revealed unexpected risks in their portfolios. This year could be d茯 vu all over again. Risks in the municipal-bond market have been creeping upward, and the methods for warning investors aren't flagging the problems.  <p> To many investors, national politics appears to be the biggest threat to munis. Like a sword of Damocles, newly fashionable flat-tax proposals hang over the market, threatening to eliminate munis' unique tax advantage. This fear dampened muni returns during the bond-market rally in 1995. Janet Yuen, fixed-income analyst at Lipper Analytical Services in New York, says that general muni-bond funds were up 16.84 percent, while general U.S. Treasury funds were up 22.21 percent.  <p> But the income consequences of the flat tax are fully priced into the market. The real risk in munis is coming from state houses and city halls and a potential liquidity crunch in muni-bond funds.  <p> This is not obvious --  which is a  major part of the problem. Some states and cities are enjoying their most robust health in years. Sunny California, which looked like a financial mudslide a year ago, surprised everyone  by turning up a budget surplus. Meanwhile, states such as Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts have been setting aside "rainy-day funds" to protect against such emergencies as recessions and budget strains that may develop as Congress sends more responsibility their way.  <p> On the other hand, Standard & Poor's downgraded 21 municipal issuers of general-obligation bonds in the third quarter of 1995 alone, affecting $30 billion of debt, mostly from Los Angeles County, New York City, and the state of Louisiana. Throw in the downgrade of Washington, D.C., paper early last year and Orange County's bankruptcy travails, and there are some deep credit potholes on the muni highway. "This is a period of great uncertainty. Investors who don't want to worry about their money don't want to invest in places where things can turn around quickly," says Claire Cohen, vice-chairman of Fitch Investors Service in New York.   <p> What should you look out for? Some states have been hampered by popular initiatives and referenda. "Watch states that use these means frequently," Cohen advises. California voters, for example, have successfully limited tax increases and now spell out how tax revenues are to be spent. Investors need to monitor local political news closely in such states as California, Oregon,Washington, Massachusetts, and Colorado, says Cohen.  <p> For their part, fund managers can no longer rely on the taxing authority of municipalities to secure debt on general-obligation bonds, once considered very safe. Instead, they prefer so-called special-purpose issues such as water, airport, and electric-power bonds, secured by a definite revenue stream. Two words explain why --  Orange County. "Textbooks have always told us that general-obligation bonds were preferable to revenue bonds because issuers can always levy taxes," says Dick Berry, senior portfolio manager for AIM Management Group in Houston. "That may be true legally, but political realities may make it impossible." On the other hand, people will always have to drink water, flush toilets, and turn on lights.  <p> But as deregulation opens once protected industries to competition, special-purpose bonds aren't what they used to be, either. For example, bonds used to finance public hospitals are less secure: Hospitals now face competitive threats as well as changes in Medicare and Medicaid. "The only thing riskier than a hospitalis a nuclear power plant," says Jeff Schaub of Fitch Investors Service in New York.  <p> In many cases, investors aren't being properly compensated. Chuck Nellans, senior health-care analyst at John Nuveen & Co., notes that a hospital bond rated A yielded only 6.07 percent in December versus 5.86 percent for an  A-rated water-and-sewer bond.  <p> Even worse, the muni funds with the greatest risks frequently have five-star ratings for performance in Morningstar's widely followed fund listings. Morningstar measures downside volatility, the price movement of the bonds in a fund, says Mark Wright, fixed-income analyst at Morningstar. That works well for high-rated bonds that trade regularly, but lower-rated bonds don't respond to interest-rate changes as quickly. And unrated bonds --  those that haven't been evaluated  by a ratings agency, such as Moody's Investors Service, because  the issues are small or the issuers are leery of a negative rating --  don't trade enough for their prices to reflect any change in value.  <p> "When you look at Morningstar, every fund that has 50 percent or more unrated municipals is considered low-risk because its prices don't move," says Sanford Bragg, managing director of the Managed Funds Group at Standard & Poor's. "If they had to sell these unrated munis, you could have a situation similar to mortgage derivatives in 1994." In that fiasco, fund managers who owned mortgage derivatives couldn't find buyers when they were desperate to sell. That sent muni-fund values south -- fast.  <p> If a sudden sell-off were provoked by any number of pending tax-law changes, muni-bond-fund managers would be hard-pressed to raise the cash to meet redemptions.  <p> Despite credit and liquidity risks, muni-fund managers have been buying credits of lower and lower quality to gain yield. This has narrowed the price differences between high and low credits. "Right now, with credit spreads tight, you're not getting paid to step down in credit quality," says B. Clark Stamper, portfolio manager of <a name="FUND:VMPAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VMPAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Davis Tax Free High Income Fund</b></a>. "Back in1990 and 1991, [bonds rated] BBB were yielding 150 basis points more than AAA munis. Now it's more like 40 basis points."  <p> As a result, muni investors need to take a careful look at the credit ratings of muni issues in funds. Investment-grade bonds of AAA to BBB carry relatively minor credit risk. Grade BB and below is the realm of junk bonds. <a name="FUND:AMHIX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/AMHIX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American High-Income Municipal Bond Fund</b></a> had 29 percent of its portfolio in BB  bonds and 5.4 percent in B bonds as of December 31, 1995 --  not a good choice for investors focused on preserving principal. Portfolios with large positions in unrated bonds carry even more risk. <a name="FUND:BCHYX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BCHYX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>The Benham California Municipal High-Yield Fund</b></a>, for example, had 28 percent of its portfolio in unrated bonds as of December 31, 1995.  <p> "It's very important for muni investors to know what they are looking for," says Arthur L. Schwarz, a principal at Weiss, Peck and Greer, a New York investment-banking firm. "You can buy a 20- to 30-year portfolio of low-grade bonds to maximize returns or put the same money into a one-year AAA security to maximize preservation of capital. Our clients take their risks in other sectors --  the muni portfolio is an anchor to windward when everything else goes to hell."  <p><p><p>

						Every day Caroline Baum launches her bond market column into cyber-space. Everyone who counts listens.  <p> By Jim Melloan  <p> "Hi!...What's new?...I've heard some real money is selling...tens and bonds...Have you turned bearish on me?...I'm chuckling about the Hillary stuff...She's in deep doo-doo now...Now it's a monetary-policy thing, not a fiscal-policy thing...I have trouble understanding it from a Keynesian point of view...Did you notice some of these Eurobond deals are coming flat to Treasurys?...Anyway, I'm going to go write a little something. Have a good day." <p>Caroline Baum, "the only person who can make the flattening of the yield curve sound pornographic," according to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, is working the telephone. She is possibly the most influential -- and certainly the funniest -- columnist covering the U.S. government securities market. She is the unchallenged mistress of the biggest, most liquid, and most important market on the planet.  <p> Sometime near the end of this year Baum will write her four millionth word on the Treasury market -- only a tiny fraction of which has ever seen print. That's because her twice-daily column appears on the screens of Dow Jones's Telerate, the high-priced on-line information service that is the data source in bond tradingrooms around the globe.  <p> Baum's column is among Telerate's most popular pages. She is,says a major bond trader, "read by every important decision maker"in a market that, more than any other, determines and reflects the state of the global economy.   <p> Unfortunately, the religious right...has determined that the only output that needs stimulating is reproduction. The $500-a-child tax credit is the piece de resistance.

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Cover Story  <p> THE RETURN OF INSIDER TRADING <p>It's the 1980s all over again -- only worse -- and the top cop on the beat can't stop it  <p> By Christopher Byron  <p> During the last full week of August 1995, the common shares of a small and nearly comatose media company named <a name="NASD:GBFE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15150"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Western Publishing Group</b></a> barely budged on the Nasdaq electronic stock exchange. Each business day that week, no more than a paltry 20,000 or so shares changed hands -- always within a narrow band between $9.875 and $10.125 a share.  <p> Then, on Tuesday, August 29, the shares of Western Publishing abruptly awoke from their torpor. Volume jumped to 37,200 shares, with the stock closing at $9.75 a share. The next day, 73,700 shares of the company traded, lifting the closing price to $10.375. Thursday and Friday were much the same, with both the price and volume of the stock continuing to rise. Then, when the markets reopened after the Labor Day weekend, on Tuesday, September 5, an astonishing 191,200 shares of Western Publishing changed hands, with the stock closing at $11.75 a share, up nearly 21 percent in just six days.   <p> Why these mysterious volume and price surges in the stock? The company hadn't been in the news and hadn't even put out a press release in months. In fact, the one Wall Street analyst who bothered to follow Western Publishing had had nothing to say about the stock all summer. Was the company about to make an important announcement? And if so, were insiders driving the stock up, seeking to profit illegally on their advance knowledge?  <p> Investors hadn't long to wait for an answer. The very next day,Wednesday, September 6, the world learned what some still-to-be-identified players had apparently known all along: Western Publishing was the target for a takeover by a Wall Street셕acked buyout groupled by the former head of Simon & Schuster, Richard E. Snyder. <p> The public disclosure of the proposed $14-a-share buyout, distributed on the afternoon of September 6, had exactly the effect the insiders wished. It kicked the stock into orbit. On the first full day of trading after the announcement, volume in Western Publishing rose to nearly 1.5 million shares, with the price spurting to $14.50 a share.   <p> It has been eight months since this piece of insider profiteering lurched into view, yet neither the Securities and Exchange Commissionnor the National Association of Securities Dealers -- the two oversight bodies charged with policing the trading in companies such as Western Publishing -- has done anything about it. They're not likely to, either, because small- to medium-sized theft from the public market is no longer a big enough crime to warrant the attention of the cops who police the financial markets. There gulators have all they can do to keep up with the virtual crimewave of new and much bigger fraud now spreading through Wall Street.  <p> As a result, situations similar to the Western Publishing affair now occur almost every day, and the inability of regulators to go after the cheaters is helping to send a disturbing message: The potential profits are so high and the risk of getting caught is so low that insider trading is once again worth the gamble. It's a risk-reward calculus that any first-year MBA student caneasily understand.  <p> No one knows that better than SEC chairman Arthur Levitt, Wall Street's top cop. Levitt knows what he's talking about -- and leaves much unsaid -- when he asserts, "We're doing a good job with the resources we have." Coming from the SEC chief, such a comment amounts to an admission that he lacks the resources to go after any but the biggest and most flagrant offenders. It's a different message entirely from the one the chairman deliveredas recently as a year ago, when he repeatedly pronounced that U.S. securities markets were more honest than ever before.  <p> Not long ago, in a distinctly downbeat speech on the securities industry at mid-decade, Levitt told a gathering of NASD officials and stockbrokers in Washington, "We have every right to be proud of the industry that has been so good to us, and is so good for America. But we must also be realistic about its problems. Fundamental to our markets is investor confidence that they are fair, that they are open, and that they are level. And lately, that reputation stands threatened."  <p> Levitt's scolding of the industry for everything from criminality to aggressive sales practices is both on target and clearly overdue. But the bigger problem facing regulatory enforcement officials these days is the lack of manpower and other resources needed to keep up with all the bad guys -- on the Internet, over the airwaves, in the penny-stock market, in the mutual-fund industry, in the new-issues market for such techie-sounding exotica as wireless-cable franchises. In arena after arena, the crooks are on the march, while the cops are barely holding their own.  <p> "Sure," says a top NASD enforcement official on the insider-trading beat, "we looked at the Western Publishing thing informally when it occurred. But the situation was complicated, and it would have taken a lot of time and effort to get to the bottom of it, so basically we made a judgment call not to pursue it."  <p> Who were the insiders in the Western Publishing affair? They could have been company officials or investment bankers at Warburg,Pincus Ventures, the firm that put together the deal. They could have been lawyers working on the terms of the deal, or family, friends, and acquaintances of anyone involved. Insiders could have bought the shares in their own names or blindly through offshore shell companies in Caribbean island nations such as the Caymans or the Netherlands Antilles. And the influx of their orders could have alerted sharp-eyed stockbrokers everywhere to place their own "free-riding" orders behind them on the assumption that something was up.  <p> Insider trading is at once devilishly difficult to prove and the next most lucrative activity to trafficking in crack cocaine. No wonder it has once again become the thing to do on Wall Street, as if the lessons of the 1980s have already been forgotten. <p> Thus, one day before <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>  announced its hostile $3.3 billion bid for Lotus Development last June, shares in Lotus jumped three and a quarter points, on close to four times normal trading volume. And on June 10, 1995, two days before <a name="NASD:CEPH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14307"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cephalon</b></a>, a drug manufacturer, revealed testing results for a breakthrough medicine to treat Lou Gehrig's disease, Cephalon's trading volume more than doubled (the price of Cephalon's shares doubled in the days following the announcement).  <p> Variations on that theme were seen over and over again in 1995-- in cases involving Mitek Surgical Products, <a name="NASD:QKTN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16677"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Quickturn Design Systems</b></a>, DOVatron International, Adesa, <a name="NASD:SMSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14785"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Standard Microsystems</b></a>, Leaseway Transportation, Columbia First Bank, Legent, and many others.  <p> All those situations and others became the subject of NASD market-surveillance referrals to the SEC, but they barely scratch the surface. Wall Street veterans say that not only is there more cheating among the Street's clients and customers but the same is true for the brokers and dealers. "I've been on Wall Street 36 years," says Louis Ehrenkrantz, president of Ehrenkrantz, King, Nussbaum Securities,"and I can tell you for sure that the level of chicanery is worse now than I've ever seen it. You have to go all the way back to the era of blind pools in the 1920s to find something comparable." <p> The fact is, in a world of deregulated global markets, with instant access to information in virtually every country on earth, the regulators increasingly find themselves outgunned and outwitted by a new class of hustlers. They may operate out of Wall Street itself, in corporate boardrooms, or even in the media, where financial talk-show personalities such as Sonny Bloch (see Worth, June 1995), now awaiting trial on interstate mail- and wire-fraud charges, give investment advice without revealing their private financial interests in the investments they promote.  <p> Drawing a perverse and unintended lesson from the Wall Street mega-prosecutions of a decade ago, these new charlatans of high finance have discovered that it's much easier to get away with pocketing $100,000 ten times in a row than with bagging $1 million once. Not only aren't the exchanges bringing enough cases to have much deterrent value, but of those they do bring, most can't be pursued by the overextended SEC.  <p> Those few cases that are followed up involve years of evidence gathering before a case is ready for trial. It took more than six years before the SEC and the Justice Department, working together, could gather enough evidence to break up a ring ofinsiders that began trading illegally on <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a> takeover targets as early as December 1988. The ring came together when an AT&T vice president tipped a friend regarding a planned bid for Paradyne, according to court records. When the ring members traded in and out of the run-up in the Paradyne shares and no one seemed to notice, they got bolder and were soon trading illegally in one AT&T deal after another. It wasn't until last summer that the SEC and the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York announced arrests and secured confessions from some of those involved.  <p> Now as ever, the principal breeding ground for insider tradingremains mergers and acquisitions, since advance news of a pending bid inevitably spreads to dozens of individuals -- bankers, lawyers, and corporate officials -- before the deal is announced.  <p> Last year the M & A arena was hotter than ever, with a record-breaking 8,954 deals worth $458 billion, greatly eclipsing previous totals. Yet the NASD developed and referred only 107 cases of suspected wrongdoing to the SEC, fewer than the 115 referrals it made a decade ago in its peak referral year of 1986. Since then, Nasdaq trading volume has more than tripled. The same general pattern repeats itself at the New York Stock Exchange, which referred only 26 insider-trading cases to the SEC in 1995. Meanwhile,the SEC brought only 45 insider-trading cases in total last year. <p> That 1980s-era effort, targeted at such individuals as Ivan Boesky, Martin Siegel, and, ultimately, Michael Milken, was designed to drive home the message that corruption in general -- and insider trading in particular -- would not be tolerated on Wall Street,where small investors invariably feel the deck is stacked against them anyway.  <p> The lesson has come and gone, and today there is virtually open defiance of insider-trading laws. Take the case of Tivoli Systems, a software company that was the object of a late-January takeover, at $47.50 a share, by IBM. The bid represented a premium of more than $10 a share over the prevailing market price, so it was hardly surprising that in the five trading days prior to the announcement, share volume in Tivoli more than tripled, lifting the price from $35.50 to nearly $37.75 a share.  <p> Whether the target of inside-trader attentions has a large market capitalization seems to make no difference. Thus, though rumors were everywhere last spring that Capital Cities/ABC was about to become takeover bait, on only two occasions from the beginning of May through the middle of July did trading volume exceed 400,000 or so shares per day.  <p> Then, starting on July 21, the stock began racking up more than 500,000 shares in trading volume almost every day, with volume on some days approaching a million shares. Why?  <p> The most likely explanation is that news had begun to leak out that a bid for the company, at a huge market premium, was imminent from . On July 31, <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney</b></a> unfurled its bid for Cap Cities -- at more than $26 a share over the prevailing market price.  <p> The situation was exactly the same last autumn when Australian-owned Broken Hill Proprietary bid $28 a share for Magma Copper. From the beginning of October through the middle of November -- a period of more than 30 trading days -- Magma stock experienced only two days in which volume exceeded 500,000 shares; on nearly every other day, volume was less than half that, sometimes totaling fewer than 75,000 shares.  <p> On November 21, though, volume jumped to 791,900 shares and then to 2.1 million the next day. The price, meanwhile, began to climb, from $16.75 a share to $20.125 a share by November 29. On November 30, after the close of business, Broken Hill announced that it was offering a full $28 a share for Magma Copper. <p> In recent years, trading on inside information has grown more sophisticated, with more and more new ways to "game the system." For example, there are "equity swaps" and "zero-cost collars"-- techniques that allow a stockholder to transfer ownership without trading through an exchange -- which are just the ticket for corporate insiders who think their company's stock price might soon drop but want to get out with less risk of being noticed. "These kinds of schemes are now commonplace on Wall Street," says Bob Gabele, the publisher of a closely followed newsletter that tracks buy and sell decisions by corporate insiders.  <p> "It's the Wild West down here," adds Thomas Pirro, who runs the New York office of Compliance Data Center, which maintains an extensive database on securities fraud and functions as a clearinghouse for investment firms wanting to check out the bonafides on prospective new clients. "There's scarcely a day that goes by when we don't come across at least one new multimillion-dollar swindle unfolding somewhere."  <p> Pirro mentions so-called Reg. S swindles, designed to use unregistered offshore stock as collateral for margin loans, sapphire-bondscams, Nigerian banknote scams, wire-transfer scams, initial-public-offering hedge-fund scams, and so on.  <p> Faced with this blizzard of malfeasance, William McLucas, chief of enforcement for the SEC in Washington, says, "We have to pick our fights where they'll do the most good. We have to keep sending the message that it's not okay to have road warriors on Wall Street. We can't have the place break out in the financial-world version of extreme fighting."  <p> His boss, SEC chairman Levitt, says, "We just can't bring every case we'd like to, and we have to assign priorities." Levittis a rare bird in Washington these days: a Clinton appointee to a federal agency who has managed to escape the budget-cutting enthusiasms of Newt Gingrich. At the same time, though, his resources are increasingly inadequate for the job of policing the nation's securities markets.  <p> Levitt is on the spot. As a result of the enactment last winter of Republican-sponsored reform on litigation in the securities industry, plaintiffs' lawsuits will now be more difficult and costly to pursue (see "Insecure Securities"). That will make the SEC more than ever the last line of defense between the investing public and those who want to take their money and run.  <p> A recent study by the Congressional Budget Office sees reform as putting yet more strain on the SEC's resources, concluding it will saddle the agency with as much as $250 million in additional enforcement-related costs through 2001. And that doesn't include the nearly certain quantum leap in enforcement referrals in the year ahead from the NASD, which has beefed up its computerized market-surveillance system and can now instantly spot suspicious changes in the trading patterns of stocks. The man in charge of the operation, Lynn Nellius, says he expects referrals to the SEC to increase in 1996.  <p> The SEC's budget for the fiscal year beginning in September will be essentially the same as it was on the day Levitt became chairman almost three years ago. Without additional muscle --and a visible determination to use it against the white-collar criminals of Wall Street -- the capitalist marketplace will get only dirtier. Says Meyer Berman, the doyen of Wall Street short-sellers:"The SEC tries to do its best. But I really believe they don't understand what's happening. Crime on Wall Street has gotten out of control. The inmates are now running the prison. There is nowhere else in the world that you can steal so much money so fast and never get caught."  <p>
TOUGH TIMES FOR THE CHAIRMAN  <p> Is this man happy? In late January, Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the nation's top market cop, was sitting for a photo shoot when he got the news that Linda Quinn, the SEC's longtime director of corporate finance, had decided to leave for a job in the private sector.  <p> Levitt has drawn fire over several recent top-level resignations from the SEC, though there seems to be nothing to them beyond the normal ebb and flow of senior personnel from government to the private sector. In reaction to the criticism leveled at Levitt, Quinn herself says, "That stuff is all bunk. Arthur's a great boss and colleague, and I'm only leaving because the offer was too good to pass up. There's nothing more to it than that." <p> In fact, Levitt deserves high marks for much of the work he has done during his three years in the job. He's given top priority to investor protection and education and has spoken to dozens of investor groups around the country. Levitt uses these appearances to urge his listeners to ask tough questions of their brokers. "There's an implicit conflict of interest built into the very manner in which brokers are compensated by their firms," says Levitt. "The more stock they sell, the more commission dollars they pocket. Investors need to understand that their own interests are not necessarily shared by their brokers."  <p> Few people can speak about the brokerage industry with the authority of Levitt, a man who can claim to have played a major role increating the Wall Street of the late 20th century. Levitt was recruited to the business as a young man in the early 1960s by Arthur L. Carter, a partner in the fastest-tracking boutique investment firm of the go-go years, Carter, Berlind & Weill (which later became Carter, Berlind, Weill and Levitt).  <p> "Arthur Carter was an absolute genius, but he pretty much kept to himself," recalls Russell Rosen, a Florida real-estate man, who worked as a broker at CBW&L.  "As a result, the man we mostly saw around the office was Arthur Levitt. He was an absolute class act, and you could tell that he was definitely going to go far. "CBW&L was one of the first orchestrators of the mega셕lock trade. It also pioneered the hostile takeover when it helped financier Saul Steinberg buy Reliance Insurance in 1967.  <p> At CBW&L, Levitt met and befriended just about every important person on Wall Street, from his partner Sanford Weill, now the chairman of Travelers, which owns Smith Barney (CBW&L's eventual successor), to ex섾oldman, Sachs chairman John Whitehead, and from Paul Volcker and David Rockefeller to John Phelan, Alan Greenspan, and Sol Linowitz. In 1978, Levitt departed CBW&L, accepting an offer to head up the American Stock Exchange, which he ran until 1989. Before joining the SEC in 1993, Levitt owned and published Roll Call, Capitol Hill's daily newspaper of record. <p> At the SEC, Levitt has worked hard to get firms to abandon such cheesy practices as single-product sales contests, in which a company with a moldering inventory of, say, guaranteed investment contracts tries to move them off the shelf by giving incentive bonuses to its brokers for selling them. He has also had success persuading firms to discontinue the practice of paying larger commissions to brokers for moving in-house merchandise than for selling goods available on the open market.  <p> Another Levitt initiative: the long-overdue cleanup of the municipal-bondmarket, where pricing information is often hard for investors to come by and where for generations bond houses have nailed down deals by paying kickbacks and bribes to local officials. To that end, the SEC has proposed rules requiring greater disclosure of, among other things, the broker's commission in a bond sale. Under Levitt, the SEC has also become much more interested inthe mutual-fund business, which now accounts for close to 20 percent of all investment savings in this country. Levitt openly worries that too much of the industry's assets -- which total $2.8 trillion -- are becoming concentrated in markets whose liquidity can change rapidly.  <p> Ordinarily, investors would be in excellent hands with an SEC chairman who seems to have the best of intentions. But these aren't ordinary times on Wall Street, and Arthur Levitt's good intentions alone may not be enough.   <p><p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Cover Story  <p> INSECURE SECURITIES <p>The bad news? Congress made it harder for stock investors to detect fraud or fight back after being ripped off. The good news? It could have been worse.  <p> By Michael France  <p> On December 22, Congress passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Among the law's many provisions is one that makes it harder for investors to file fraud lawsuits against companies suffering sharp drops in share prices.  <p> Eleven days later, <a name="NYSE:SGI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11735"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Silicon Graphics</b></a> made a surprise announcement: Quarterly profits would fall 29 percent short of Wall Street estimates. Its stock plummeted 16 percent in a matter of hours.<p>Two days after that, <a name="NASD:ADBE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12518"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Adobe Systems</b></a>, too, disclosed disappointing earnings. Shares took a 35 percent dive. Over the next few days,this pattern repeated itself at <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>, <a name="NASD:DELL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13193"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dell Computer</b></a>, <a name="NASD:CYRX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16430"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cyrix</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a> -- many of the same companies that had lobbied hardest for the new law.  <p> Was it a coincidence?  <p> Opponents of the legislation, which passed when Congress stampeded over President Clinton's surprise veto, had contended all along that the bill was a disaster for investors. Representative John Dingell, for one, had declared the bill "conceived in sin," and a consumer group dubbed it "the Crooks and Swindlers Protection Act." This miniature technology meltdown, they said, proved their point.  <p> "It's my belief that certain companies -- especially those involved in lobbying for this legislation -- in fact held back bad news until after it passed," says famed San Diego plaintiffs' attorney Bill Lerach. On January 26, he filed a fraud suit, the first major test of the new law, against Silicon Graphics.  <p> Lerach's accusations enrage Ken Glueck, the lobbyist for the American Electronics Association, a key supporter of the law. "To say that companies were withholding bad news until after the legislation is complete nonsense," he snaps. "Are we talking fraud or are we talking about the dynamics of a market that has risen more than 1,000 points in nine months?"  <p> The new securities legislation, supporters say, is good news for ordinary investors. They contend it will reduce the amount of money honest companies spend fighting frivolous claims and free managers from wasting their time in court. To get their message to Congress, the computer, accounting, and securities industries have, since 1993, made more than $10.5 million in political contributions. But not everyone who agrees with them was paid. Even the matrons of the Beardstown Ladies investment club in Illinois have pronounced the legislation "a great deal for investors."  <p> So which side is telling the truth? Neither.  <p> This legislation is bad for investors -- no matter what the Beardstown Ladies say. It's likely to lead to a modest increase in investment fraud, while decreasing the amount of money injured investors can recover in court. It may also make it riskier to invest in some industries. But the 1995 securities act is hardly "a license to cheat small investors," as Money magazine recently claimed. Lying to shareholders is still a crime. And although the legislation will cut back on private class-action fraud suits, it will not eliminate them. Nor does the act restrict the enforcement powers of the Securities and Exchange Commission, state securities agencies, or self-regulatory authorities such as the New York Stock Exchange.  <p> "Even after this legislation, America still has the cleanest stock market in the world. I don't think anyone else comes close," says Henry T. C. Hu, a University of Texas Law School securities-law expert. "The basic securities-law system that has worked so well is not being tampered with in a fundamental way."  <p> Still, the stock market now poses three new risks: Companies can hype their prospects more freely; the licensed professionals who are supposed to prevent corporate wrong doing -- particularly accountants -- may have less incentive to play their watchdog roles; and defrauded investors may have a harder time suing. Understanding these risks will help investors assess the safety of their existing portfolios and make intelligent cost-benefit decisions in the future. There are also a few new legislative land mines lying around, which, if they explode, could cause more harm than the 1995 securities bill.   <p> RISK ONE: HYPE <p>"In February, 1987, we commenced a television advertising campaign in the Southern California market. We believe this television advertising could have a significant impact on increasing average revenues per service location. We are confident of achieving record revenues, income and earnings per share교nd confident of these record results continuing through fiscal 1988." -- a press release from Barry Minkow, chairman of the board of ZZZZ Best, March 16, 1987  <p> Minkow's now infamous claims are what securities lawyers call forward-looking statements, a category of information that may include everything a company says -- whether divulged in a press release, buried in a prospectus, or whispered to an analyst over lunch -- about its future concerning projected revenues and dividends, new product announcements, or disclosures of potential liabilities. <p> This type of information is of obvious importance, which is why securities regulations encourage companies to make forward-looking statements and investors to scrutinize them.  <p> But forward-looking statements can also be dangerous. In the month after the above press release was issued, for example, the price of the common stock in ZZZZ Best climbed from $10.50 to $17.375 a share. But less than three months later, the company filed for bankruptcy, and its claims were revealed to be completely fraudulent. Minkow was sent to jail, but investors lost an estimated $100 million.  <p> Of the approximately 125 companies sued each year for securities fraud, Bill Lerach estimates that about a quarter are accused of making misleading forward-looking statements. The single most dangerous thing about the new securities law -- the provision that almost caused SEC chairman Arthur Levitt to withhold support for it -- is that it offers unprecedented protection to companies that lie about their prospects. Under this law, investors can't sue a corporation for inaccurate forward-looking statements as long as the statements are "accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ."  <p> This sounds reasonable, but in practice, companies will be able to make grandiose claims about potential earnings, then bracket the hype with boilerplate disclaimers to insure themselves against liability. According to Manhattan plaintiffs' attorney Edward Labaton, the new law might have permitted Minkow to insulate his forward-looking statements by tacking the following language,which actually appeared in another ZZZZ Best document, to his public statement: "Competition in the carpet-, upholstery-, and drapery-cleaning business is intense, and the cost of entry into the industry is relatively low. ZZZZ Best expects to continue to face severe price-cutting and other competitive practices from its competitors in most, if not all, of its locations." <p> Most of the fraud generated by the new law will not, however, be perpetrated by con artists but by legitimate companies whose executives have a strong personal interest in boosting share prices. In the Silicon Graphics suit, for example, it is alleged that CEO Edward R. McCracken repeatedly told the public that his company's revenues would grow by 40 percent in fiscal 1996. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs' lawyers claim that he failed to disclose that the company would be unable to manufacture enough computer workstations to meet this target. Why would McCracken do such a thing? So that he and other insiders could sell $14 million worth of stock at inflated prices, according to the plaintiffs' lawyers. Silicon Graphics spokesman Harry Pforzheimer calls Lerach's lawsuit "frivolous" and says, "There is no merit to the allegations" it contains.   <p> Regardless of how the Silicon Graphics case turns out, the new law means you'll probably be seeing more cases of companies' making rosy forecasts, then disclosing a bolt of bad news seemingly from out of the blue. As Columbia University law professor John Coffee says, corporate fraud "does respond to different levels of risk, and I think we will see somewhat more of it." How much more is hard to predict, but there are reasons to believe it will not become anything close to routine. The new law does not restrict the SEC's ability to sue companies that exaggerate their prospects, even if individuals will have a harder time doing so. And many people think the agency is going to do just that. <p> "The SEC is going to be waiting for a high-visibility forward-looking-statement case, and it's going to bring a very aggressive enforcement action just to make a point to the business community," predicts Donald Langevoort, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. And while the SEC is stretched thin these days (see "The Return of Insider Trading"), there are powerful market incentives for companies to be honest, even if they don't fear prosecution. "If you are a publicly held company or just becoming one, chances are very high that you are going to have to tap the capital markets a second time and a third. It is a relationship, and therefore companies and their executives have a reputation to protect --separate and apart from any statutes," says Hu.  <p> Finally, the new law does not apply to many types of investments, including initial public offerings, partnerships, limited-liability companies, penny stocks, and tender offers. Nor does it protect companies or executives that have run into trouble with the SEC in the past three years. Most important, it's still illegal for executives to make untrue "historical statements" -- that is, to lie about last quarter's earnings or any other facet of a company's actual financial performance. In short, cooking the books remains a crime, a fact that many critics of the legislation have overlooked.  <p> Bottom line: The new securities law won't start an epidemic of fraud, but beginning today, investors should be more skeptical about companies whose primary appeal is a hot new product or is based on a sweeping social trend (say, the rise of the Internet). Such firms are most likely to be found in the sectors that sell the future, such as high technology, communications, biotechnology, and entertainment.  <p> As a general principle, small companies are riskier than large ones. "It is not the Fortune 500 that is going to be presenting problems here," says Coffee. Small firms must create excitement about future prospects in lieu of present accomplishments. Moreover,small-cap stocks receive less scrutiny from analysts. It's not that investors should avoid small companies and growth stocks. Rather, they should take the simple precaution of assuming that everything a company says about its future is false unless supported by independent evidence. "Securities are not bought in this country; they're sold. Somebody's broker calls them up and says buy XYZ stock, and they just buy it," says John Fedders, a Washington,D.C., lawyer who is the former director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. "Investors need to start reading more about the stocks they are buying."  <p> RISK TWO: SLEEPING WATCHDOGS <p>The collapse of Koger Properties, an office-park developer once traded on the New York Stock Exchange, illustrates the second major problem with the new securities law. During the real-estate recession of the late 1980s and early 1990s, CEO Ira Koger boasted that his Jacksonville, Florida, company was achieving record returns. Then in September 1991, it declared bankruptcy, driving the share price down from about $23 to 69 cents in a matter of days. Koger now faces up to 31 years in prison on tax-evasion charges, if convicted.  <p> The accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche had audited Koger Properties from fiscal 1987 to fiscal 1990, and found itself a co-defendant when investors sued for securities fraud. In March 1995, a Florida jury found that Deloitte had failed to disclose Koger's fraudand ordered it to pay up to $81.3 million in damages. The verdict is under appeal.  <p> Deloitte could be held responsible because of a legal doctrine known as joint and several liability, which says that even though Deloitte is not the only wrong doer it is still liable for all investor losses if no other defendants can pay. Because the main conspirators are often broke by the end of litigation, joint and several liability has been a lifesaver for investors in many of the most notorious securities-fraud cases, including that of Charles Keating and his Lincoln Savings & Loan.  <p> Joint and several liability, for obvious reasons, is wildly unpopular with such professionals as accountants, lawyers, and underwriters, who help the Kogers and Keatings of the world hide their scams. Accountants have been hit hardest, because they are theoretically in the best position to blow the whistle on fraud. From 1990 to 1992, the Big Six accounting firms spent $517.6 million on awards and settlements in just one major category of audit-related federal securities cases.  <p> Under the new legislation, accountants and other secondary parties will no longer be on the hook for every penny investors lose unless, as in a small minority of cases, they were fully aware of or participants in the scam. Otherwise, when the role of professionals is limited to recklessly or negligently overlooking fraud, jurors will assign liability -- probably in the range of 25 percent or less, estimates Coffee.  <p> Proportional liability, as this is called, is worth millions to the accounting industry, which paid millions to get it. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, accountants and their political action committees gave at least $4.8 million to congressional candidates from January 1993 to June 1995.  <p> Because of the new law, investors caught in a ZZZZ Best or Lincoln Savings nightmare have much less chance of being made whole. Only those who have lost more than 10 percent of their life savings and have a net worth of less than $200,000 will retain the right to joint and several liability.  <p> The broader risk is that this decrease in liability will reduce the incentive of professionals to blow the whistle on wrongdoing. However, even though accountants won't face as many $81 million losses, the potential for $20 million verdicts should still get their attention. In addition, the cost to accountants and lawyers of defending themselves against securities-fraud suits, and paying for judgments and settlements, is commonly several times higher than their original engagement fees. One firm mentioned during the accounting industry's lobbying campaign for the 1995 securities bill had received a $91,000 audit fee, but spent $8.4 million defending itself in a lawsuit before paying out a settlement of $997,500.  <p> State regulations, too, keep professionals in line, and those who participate in fraud can lose their licenses. Proportional liability "is less bad than it sounds, even though it may well hurt investors at times," says Columbia University law professor Harvey J. Goldschmid. "The key issue for me is deterrence, and no accountants or lawyers should feel comfortable putting their heads in the sand."  <p> Bottom line: This second risk -- the related hazards of sleeping watchdogs and reduced liability -- is a lot like the first in that it's going to make investing a bit more hazardous, but not so much that you should cash in your stocks and buy gold coins. History has shown that this risk is greatest in financial-services companies such as insurers, banks, and brokerages. They sell intangible products that are hard to keep track of and difficult to value, making it easier to hide losses and fabricate gains.This was illustrated recently by the revelation that Daiwa Bank's New York branch suffered $1.1 billion worth of losses through fraudulent bond trading.  <p> "Daiwa shows just how easy it is to hide billions of dollars' worth of losses in financial companies," says Coffee. "That's where accountants are critical: where there is no visible evidence of losses. If <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a> stopped producing cars, people would notice. But Daiwa could lose its shirt, and unless the accountants do a good job, you wouldn't know."  <p> RISK THREE: THE CLOSED COURTHOUSE  <p>President Clinton claimed that the reason he vetoed the securities legislation was not the increased risk of hype or shoddy accounting. It was because of a provision governing "pleading standards"-- the rules setting forth how much detail about an alleged fraud the plaintiffs' lawyers must provide in initial court papers to get a judge to hear a case. Because the bill requires so much up-front information, the president feared investors would never make it through the courthouse doors.  <p> The new legislation says that attorneys can't bring cases unless they describe the alleged scam "with particularity." This means they have to provide all five W's about the fraud: who, what,when, where, and why. Under prior standards, judges would let cases proceed even if a couple of W's were missing, allowing plaintiffs to begin the discovery phase of litigation and reviewinternal corporate documents that might reveal corroborating information. Plaintiffs' attorneys claim the new pleading standards will make it almost impossible to file lawsuits. "You have to have an insider to really start to be able to file a securities-fraud case," complains Patricia Hynes, a partner at the New York law firm Milberg Weiss, which is known for its work in securities-fraud class-action lawsuits.  <p> The evidence suggests she's exaggerating. The new pleading standard is essentially the same one that has been used for years by federal courts in New York, Connecticut, and Vermont. And plenty of securities-fraud cases are successfully brought to court in those states. Well-known Ardmore, Pennsylvania, plaintiffs' attorney Richard D. Greenfield thinks that only about 10 to 20 percent of the cases will bestruck down. "I don't expect that most judges are going to change their fundamental inclination, which is to let good cases go forward and to knock out bad ones," he says.  <p> Bottom line: No one will have a handle on how judges will interpret the new law -- which explicitly states that they are not bound by the federal rulings in New York, Connecticut, and Vermont-- until the initial round of cases slogs through the system, and that could take well over a year. Until then, a smart thing investors can do is keep meticulous records -- saving physical evidence of all the information used to make a particular investment decision, whether it be a newspaper clipping in which an executive hypes a company or marketing material touting a real-estate partnership. <p> Also, take notes after you speak to your broker. They'll help your attorney fill in the five W's. This advice is especially important for residents of Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, where federal judges have traditionally been hostile to securities suits. You can keep track of the Silicon Graphics suit and other securities-fraud cases by visiting the National Council of Individual Investors' Web site (http://www.ncii.org/ncii).  <p> FUTURE SHOCKS  <p>Last July, Republican congressman Jack Fields of Texas, the powerful chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, aimed a shotgun at American securities law. His "Capital Markets Deregulation and Liberalization Act" (H.R. 2131) was intended to hit a wide range of rules governing brokers, corporate raiders, institutional money managers, and companies that issue stocks and bonds.  <p> The majority of the proposals in H.R. 2131 are not particularly threatening to small investors, but one element could make the markets far more dangerous: a plan to gut state securities regulation. Fields, who believes that the cost of raising money is too high in the U.S., wants to eliminate many of the laws that state securities agencies enforce, as well as cut the fees they receive for registering investment advisers and investment companies. Almost inevitably,legislatures would respond by shrinking state securities agencies. <p> That would be very bad news for investors. State securities regulators are the first line of defense against investment fraud. In 1994, they initiated 6,379 enforcement actions, compared with a mere 497 by the SEC. More to the point, while the SEC lacks the resources to investigate cases in which investors lose less than $1 million, state securities agencies are geared toward stopping small boiler-room operations.  <p> "Individual investors would feel the impact of the Fields bill in a far more direct way than they are going to notice securities-litigation reform," says Gerri Detweiler, policy director for the National Council of Individual Investors. And at a time when the SEC is facing possible budget cuts, she says, state securities cops are more important than ever.  <p> Consumer groups have energetically opposed Fields's bill, forcing him to redraft it and to surrender some key provisions, but not, it appears, the attack on state securities law. Still, H.R. 2131 faces an uphill struggle, having attracted little support in the Senate. Moreover, many congressmen feel they've already done enough for the securities industry with the litigation-reform bill. "The general feeling is likely to be. We gave you a big banana already and it caused a big commotion. We had to override the president. Now we've got other issues to deal with,'" says John Fedders.  <p> However, Fedders says that both Fields and the securities industry appear eager to pass the legislation this year. In addition, Fields has announced that he will step down at the end of his current term, and this could prompt a sympathy vote for the legislation. "He's been a good soldier, and the party leadership may try to give him a departing gift," says one D.C. insider who has been involved in negotiations over the redraft of the Fields bill. Still, this source thinks that the distraction of an election year will prevent the Fields bill from becoming law in 1996."I think you could very well see the bill pass through the House this year," the source says. "But whether it could pass through the Senate and make it to the president's desk is an altogether different question." Individual investors have a critical interest in seeing that it doesn't.  <p> The National Council of Individual Investors' other top legislative priority in 1996 is defeating a California initiative called Proposition 201. It's backed by the same Silicon Valley interests that lobbied for federal securities-litigation reform and is intended to choke investor law suits at the state level.  <p> Proposition 201 requires the loser in a shareholder law suit to pay the winner's attorneys' fees. If passed, this measure would just about wipe out investor lawsuits in California statecourts, leaving victims there with sharply reduced legal options. Faced with the risk of paying for millions of dollars in defense fees, most plaintiffs are not going to file cases without hard evidence of fraud, something rarely available before attorney shave gone through discovery. That's why the House of Representatives-- although zealous to eradicate frivolous litigation -- dumped a similar "loser pays" provision from the federal legislation. <p> "Litigation is speculative. You never know how it's going to turn out," says A. Lee Sanders, executive director of the Citizens for Retirement Protection and Security in Los Angeles. "This initiative will kill investors because there is a lack of parity in financial resources: The people who perpetrated the securities fraud will have the money, and the victims won't."  <p> While plaintiffs' lawyers have not traditionally brought many securities-fraud cases in state court, they are now expected to do so more frequently to get around the new federal securities law. That's why high-tech companies have spent $3.5 million backing Proposition 201 -- and why the National Council of Individual Investors is committed to stopping it.  <p> The vote on Proposition 201 is scheduled for March 26, around the time this issue hits the newsstands. If it passes, expect a string of copycat proposals in other states. And even if it doesn't, Pepperdine Law School securities-law professor Benjamin J. Stein says that recent victories at the federal level have emboldened opponents of securities regulation to continue the fight against fair investor laws in the states. "The blood is in the water and the sharks are circling," says Stein.   <p> Sharks? Blood? Stein's imagery may be exaggerated, but his fundamental point is sound. The securities act of 1995 does mark a watershed. After passing major securities bills increasing investor protection in 1978, 1984, 1988, and 1990, Congress reduced this protection for the first time in recent history. "The fact that both [Senators] Ted Kennedy and Chris Dodd supported this legislation tells you something about how thoroughly frustration with the securities-regulation system infects all parts of the political spectrum," says Donald Langevoort of Vanderbilt. And this bodes ill for investors in the future.  <p> Paradoxically, this political disillusionment comes at a time when the capital markets are at historic highs and ordinary consumers are entering them in record numbers. Although there's no reason for investors to do an about-face, their recently acquired sense of security about the marketplace could turn out to be dangerous. If there's one lesson investors should take from the 1995 securities act, it's that they can no longer assume the government will protect them. Instead, they may have to start getting used to defending themselves.  <p> "We seem to be moving from a world of seller beware to one of buyer beware," warns Gerri Detweiler. "The problem is that many people still don't recognize that."  <p>  <p>A SELF-DEFENSE PRIMER  <p> Your stock drops 40 percent in two weeks, or your dividend check bounces, or your broker audibly gulps when you announce plans to sell shares in that great oil-field partnership he trumpeted and then he stops returning your phone calls. A scary thought forms: Maybe you've been defrauded.  <p> HERE'S WHAT TO DO NEXT  <p>Write your broker: Send a certified letter seeking an explanation and a refund for any money lost. Include your account information, copies of any relevant documents, and a brief description of the problem. If there's no response, mail the same letter to your broker's branch manager, then to the brokerage agency's national compliance manager. "Give these things short fuses," advises Philip A. Feigin, Colorado securities commissioner. "Say something like, I'd like a response in ten days.'"  <p> Contact state authorities: If you're not happy with the brokerage's response, or if you didn't use a broker, call your state's securities agency. Then follow up with a written complaint. "Don't put it off," says Gerri Detweiler of the National Council of Individual Investors. "Your complaint could be the one that sends up a red flag at the agency."  <p> Alert the SEC and the NASD: After alerting the state agency, call the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Assistance at 800-SEC-0330. If you purchased the investment from a broker, also complain to the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) at 202-728-8000.  <p> Get a lawyer: If all of the above fails, as a last resort retain a lawyer. This will cost at least a couple of thousand dollars, and possibly much more, but it's the best way to recover your money. Ask for references, and hire only attorneys with experience in securities-fraud cases.  <p> If you receive a letter in the mail indicating that you area plaintiff in a class-action suit against a company in which you own stock, there's little choice but to stick with the attorney handling the case. Most investors don't have enough money at stake to file their own lawsuits.   <p> NOTE: Procrastination in these matters is not an option. The law gives you only one year after you discover the problem to file a suit -- or three years after the scam began. "It will never get better tomorrow. Act as soon as things start looking suspicious," says Feigin.  <p><p>

 JUNK-BOND FUNDS CAN JAZZ UP THE MIX 
<p>
Junk bonds aren't as risky as they seem--every fixed-income portfolio
should have some.  
<p>
 By Teri Karush  
<p>
 Income-hungry investors fled into high-yield-bond mutual funds
last year, swelling junk-bond fund assets from $43 billion at
the end of 1994 to $53 billion by the end of November 1995. It's
easy to understand why: As of December 31, the annual yield on
the average junk fund was 9.25 percent versus 5.8 percent for
the average Treasury fund and 5.95 percent for the average corporate-bond
fund.  
<p>
 Are junk-bond investors chasing yields over a cliff? After all,
these bonds pay such high yields because they were issued by
companies with shaky credit ratings. Do they have a place in
the conservative investor's portfolio?  
<p>
 Junk bonds don't behave much like other bonds and consequently
have a different risk profile. For example, the prices of junk
bonds don't fall as far as those of Treasurys when interest rates
rise. In 1994, when the Federal Reserve raised the discount rate
by 1.75 percentage points and ten-year Treasurys limped to a
negative 8.3 percent return, high-yield bonds posted only a 1.17
percent loss. That's partly because the higher yields paid by
junk bonds offset falling prices.  
<p>
 But there's another reason. Junk-bond prices, like those of
stocks, are affected more by the health of the issuing companies
than by interest rates. The price of a junk bond will climb if
the issuing company starts to make more money, improving the
chances that it will be able to pay off the bond.  
<p>
 However, when the economy slows긍hich looks likely in 1996긁unk
bonds and junk-bond funds suffer. In the recession year of 1990,
for example, junk bonds showed a negative 4.35 percent total
return versus 6.68 percent for ten-year Treasurys. Corporate
earnings growth could fall from about 16 percent in 1995 to 10
to 12 percent in 1996, says Charles Lemonides, portfolio manager
with Sterling Advisors, a division of Gruntal. That will increase
the danger that financially shaky companies could default on
their bonds.  
<p>
 How great is the potential damage? Not enough to outweigh current
yields, say the experts. Lemonides, for example, doesn't expect
enough of a slowdown to make the default rate soar: It may edge
up from 4 percent, he says, but should stay below 5 percent this
year. Even the crop of bonds that are two years old or more그n
age when unwelcome surprises tend to occur, according to King
Penniman, executive vice president of Duff & Phelps Fixed Income
in Montpelier, Vermont귿ails from companies that were healthy
enough to survive the recession of 1990.  
<p>
 John Bianchi, manager of the Smith Barney High-Income fund,
says that investors should put no more than 25 percent of their
bond portfolio into high-yield funds and diversify the rest among
government, corporate, and international debt. Mark Wright, a
Morningstar fixed-income analyst, recommends three high-yield
options: Vanguard's Fixed-Income Securities High-Yield Corporate
fund (800-662-7447), which buys bonds with an average maturity
of 7.8 years and has delivered a total annualized return of 15.33
percent for five years; Northeast Investors Trust (800-225-6704),
which buys bonds with an average maturity of 7.3 years and has
returned an average of 17.07 percent annually; and MASFunds'
High Yield Portfolio (800-354-8185), which has an average maturity
of 9.5 years급lightly riskier극ut has given investors an average
annual 19.64 percent.

Worth magazine/Investing<p>BONDS FOR A NEW YEAR
The heyday for bonds may be over. Here's the best portfolio for today's low-yield environment.<p>By Clint Willis<p>What's a fixed-income investor supposed to do now? Back in November 1994, bondholders had the best of both worlds. Long-term issues offered decent yields of 8 percent; better yet, the subsequent plunge in interest rates caused bond prices to rise, handing investors fabulous capital gains: The total return on long-term Treasurys reached more than 30 percent in the 12 months through November 1995.<p>That was then. As of January 2, yields on 30-year Treasurys were a piddling 5.96 percent, only eight-tenths of a percentage point higher than the 5.15 percent offered by the average money-market fund. Moreover, the decline in long-term rates has left little room for further capital gains. And while interest rates appear steady, higher inflation can't be totally discounted. "This is not a friendly part of the economic cycle for fixed-income investors," says Henry Gailliot, chief economist for Federated Investment Advisers in Pittsburgh.<p>A rush to money-market funds isn't the solution. If interest rates fall, taking bond yields with them, investors may regret that they didn't lock in that paltry 5.96 percent coupon__and they'll miss any capital gains to be had. Nor is this the time to load up on long-term bonds, hoping for a repeat of past increases. Investors need a portfolio designed for today's economic climate.<p>This requires assessing where inflation is headed, since bond prices will take the opposite tack. The good news is that it's hard to find a market watcher who thinks inflation will rise. The 51 economists who participated last December in a survey by the newsletter Blue Chip Economic Indicators voiced a consensus that the consumer price index would increase by 2.9 percent. That's identical to the estimated inflation rate for 1995 and even lower than the 3 percent rate that prevailed when this economic recovery began in 1991.<p>"Ordinarily, inflation increases as the economic recovery matures and productive capacity grows tighter," says Leslie Nanberg, chief fixed-income officer at Massachusetts Financial Services. Why is this time different? Take your pick:low worldwide demand for credit and labor; technology-driven productivity increases; balance sheets fattened by corporate downsizing; increased baby-boomer savings; or lower government spending here and abroad.<p>If the United States slips into a recession (only a one-in-three chance, Gailliot, Nanberg, and others estimate), inflation could drop to 2 percent and 30-year Treasury yields to 4 percent. There's also a chance (most prognosticators put it at one or two in ten) that inflation will climb suddenly if, for instance, a revolution breaks out in Saudi Arabia and oil prices soar. <p>That said, it's likely inflation and interest rates will rise only modestly in the next few years. Unfortunately, this rosy outlook is already built into the price of long-term bonds. In the near term, investors expect interest rates to decline and drive up bond prices even more. That's why they're willing to buy long bonds despite a yield that's little more than that of safer money-market funds. If those investors start worrying about inflation again, long-term-bond prices will plummet. "If something happens to overturn the consensus on inflation, we'll end up with some pretty severe losses for bondholders," says James Stack, editor of InvesTech Market Analyst in Whitefish, Montana.<p>What kind of fixed-income investment is best suited for that combination of stable inflation and flat or falling interest rates? The appropriate portfolio would concentrate on intermediate issues, capturing a total return of 6 to 13 percent in the expected environment while protecting against serious losses if rates rebound sharply. According to Los Angeles based Capital Management Sciences, which provides fixed-income analysis, such a portfolio calls for a 60 percent stake in bonds that mature in 5 to 10 years (Treasurys in this range recently yielded 5.5 percent; investment-grade corporates, 6.1 percent); 20 percent in 20- to 30-year bond issues (6 to 6.6 percent); and 20 percent in 3- to 5-year bonds (5.4 to 5.9 percent). <p>Investors can build this portfolio fairly easily by putting 60 percent in Vanguard's <a name="FUND:VBIIX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VBIIX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bond Index Intermediate-Term Bond</b></a> fund (6.38 percent; 800-662-7447); 20 percent in the <a name="FUND:PRULX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRULX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price U.S. Treasury Long-Term</b></a> fund (5.97 percent; 800-638-5660);and 20 percent in Vanguard's <a name="FUND:VBISX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VBISX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bond Index Short-Term Bond</b></a> fund (6.19 percent; 800-662-7447).<p>If interest rates stay steady, this mix will deliver a total return of 5.7 percent to 6.3 percent, significantly better than that of money-market funds. If long rates fall by a full percentage point, investors will pick up 12.3 percent (Treasurys) to 12.7 percent (corporates). Meanwhile, a rise in rates of one percentage point would cut the portfolio's total return to less than a percent, and if inflation doubles to 6 percent, and long rates rebound to 8 percent, the portfolio would lose 6 to 7 percent of its value.<p>Although this portfolio won't deliver the stunning 30 percent gains of last year, it should prove a slow but steady earner for conservative fixed-income investors. "The gunslingers are going to get driven back out of the bond market," says San Francisco money manager Steve Janachowski. "We're heading back to the days when bonds were for income and stocks were for capital gains."<p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> WHEN DOES A BAD YEAR SAY SELL? <p>Despite a roaring market last year, some superstar growth funds stumbled   <p> By Tim Middleton  <p> In a year when the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index put on a heavenly performance, some of the mutual fund industry's brightest angels lost their wings. Longtime top-performing funds such as <a name="FUND:ACRNX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACRNX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Acorn</b></a>, <a name="FUND:CHAAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/CHAAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Crabbe Huson Special</b></a>, and <a name="FUND:BEONX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BEONX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Berger100</b></a> failed to match the 29.85 percent returned by the average diversified equity fund. More troubling, in 1995, each of these funds trailed its ownlong-term track record and was outperformed by almost all other growth funds. Acorn gained 18.75 percent versus its five-year average gain of 22.42 percent. Berger 100 sank to a 19.18 percent output from a five-year level of 23.64 percent. Crabbe Huson Special eked out a mere 7.95 percent return compared with a five-year average gain of 21.61 percent, according to Morningstar.  <p> Is it time for investors in these funds to start looking elsewhere? Obviously, a single year of weakness is no reason to dump a fund that has performed well over time. But it does call for at least some investigation.  <p> In two cases Acorn and Crabbe Huson the funds' weak 1995 returns resulted from managers' following the same strategies that had earned them success before. Investors who bought these funds because of their iconoclastic managers should stick with their choices. "Part of the price you pay for above-average performance in certain years is below-average performance in others," says Earl Osborn, an investment adviser with Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough in San Francisco.  <p> But in the case of Berger 100, the fund's recent performance could signal problems.  <p> Acorn's fall from grace reflects manager Ralph Wanger's continued preference for global stocks, which faltered last year, and his indifference to technology stocks, which fueled much of 1995's market gains. In 1995 the fund put about one quarter of its assets into foreign stocks, around six times the average for a  small-company fund, according to Morningstar analyst Susan Paluch. At the sametime, Acorn, which recently reopened to new investors, maintains a relatively light technology allocation of 17.9 percent, compared with 25.2 percent for the typical small-company fund in 1995, according to John Rekenthaler, the publisher of the newsletter Morningstar Mutual Funds.   <p> That's consistent with the strategy that earned Acorn its dazzling long-term record. In 1993, for example, Acorn's heavy international weighting helped Wanger garner an exceptional 32.32 percent return."That seemed like genius," says Paluch, "and he's still thinking the same way, but the market isn't."   <p> Wanger acknowledges this: "I think international markets will do better than the United States in 1996, if for no other reason than the U.S. did better in 1995," he says. "These things tend to equalize." Investors of like mind will stick with the fund for its exposure to foreign growth stocks.  <p> Investors appear to be taking a long-term view at Crabbe Huson Special. Even though the fund's year-to-date return is dismal, it still enjoyed net inflows of cash each month in 1995. "This was obviously not people chasing hot performance," says fund manager James Crabbe. "This was people who have agreed with what we're doing."  <p> Crabbe missed the party last year by remaining true to his contrarian vision. Having bought technology stocks in 1991 before the herd piled in a move that earned the fund returns of 33.4 percent in 1992 and 34.6 percent in 1993 Crabbe sold them in 1994 before the sector started its latest run. He even went as far as short selling technology stocks to the tune of 25 percent of fund assets. <p> Crabbe remains certain the sector will tank when Wall Street begins to focus on fundamentals. For example, he expects the current shortage in computer chips to reverse in 1996 as chip-makers from Texas to Asia begin production at new plants and the economy slows. "The semiconductor industry's customers, from lighting ballast [in fluorescent bulbs] to autos, are cyclical. Why shouldn't semiconductors also be cyclical?" Crabbe asks.  <p> While Acorn and Crabbe Huson Special appear to have been merely out of sync with the market, the troubles at Berger 100 raise some questions about the basic direction of the fund.  <p> The year was full of missteps for Berger fund manager Rod Linafelter. An investment in Mexico cost shareholders when the peso collapsed. Then HMO and nursing-home stocks tumbled at the prospect of lower government reimbursements. Finally, Cyrk Inc., a company that specializes in market promotions, melted down because of a short fall in orders from client <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a>.  <p> Berger's record may be the result of more than a stretch of bad luck. The fund will begin 1996 with assets of $2.2 billion 23 percent of it in cash well above the $15 million it had at the beginning of 1991. And that may simply be too much money for a fund that built its reputation by investing in small, aggressive growth companies.  <p> Although Linafelter sees no correlation between his soaring assets and his sinking performance, Berger 100 is not the same fund it was in such golden years as 1989, when it returned 48.3 percent, and 1991, when it shot up a whopping 88.8 percent. (Assets that year ballooned from $15 million to $200 million.)  <p> Back then, it was a pedal-to-the-metal small-cap fund. Now it stop holdings are such giant growth stocks as <a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a>, Gillette, and Fannie Mae. The median market capitalization of the stocks in the fund's portfolio was recently $4.7 billion."I think it's pretty obvious they've had a problem managing growth," says Sheldon Jacobs, editor of The No-Load Fund Investor.  <p> Berger 100 could, of course, recover, but it may never return to the small-cap style that produced its long-term track record. <p><p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> SOMETIMES GROWTH ISN'T ENOUGH <p>A study of the Nifty Fifty shows that it's possible to pay too much even for great companies  <p> By Jim Jubak  <p> How much is too much to pay for a great growth stock? It's an  impotant question for long-term investors, especially at a time when technology favorites such as <a name="NASD:CSCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13494"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cisco Systems</b></a>, as well as consumer stalwarts such as <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> and Gillette, are trading at sky-high prices. We set out to find an answer using a recent historical study of the famous Nifty Fifty growth stocks of the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the process, we learned that the best means for identifying reasonably priced growth stocks is a sophisticated but far from obscure measure called the sustainable earnings growth rate. It's just what it sounds like:  a way of calculating a company's potential for growth over the long term. (For another view with a shorter time horizon on how  to value growth, see Peter Lynch's column on page 29.)  <p> The Nifty Fifty were, as far as Wall Street was concerned, one-decision stocks: Buy them for the long run and reap the benefits of double-digit profit growth year after year. This idea appealed to so many people that by the end of 1972 <a name="NYSE:PRD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11198"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Polaroid</b></a> traded as high as 97 times trailing 12-month earnings and <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a> at 81 times earnings, versus 18 times earnings for the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index. Every student of the market knows what followed: 1973 ushered in a dive that wiped out 40 percent of the S&P's value over a two-year span. The highfliers got creamed even more severely. Polaroid dropped from $126.12 a share on December 31, 1972, to $18.62; McDonald's plunged from $76.25 a share to $29.37. Not too nifty.   <p> The perspective of history, though, provides some lessons to be learned from the collapse of the Nifty Fifty. Wharton's Jeremy Siegel, who conducted the Nifty Fifty study, recently calculated that even investors unlucky enough to have bought these stocks at their peak would have done okay if they had simply held onto them. Through May of 1995, the end of Siegel's study, a portfolio of the 50 stocks bought on December 31, 1972, would have returned 10.08 percent a year, compared with 11.23 percent for the market as a whole.  <p> The goal of Siegel's study was to demonstrate the superiority of stocks as an investment over all other asset classes. When we looked at his numbers, however, we found they contained a second lesson of value to investors.  <p> What we saw was that, on average, the best-performing growth stocks in the Nifty Fifty from 1972 through 1995 were those that traded for the lowest price-to-earnings ratios on December 31,1972. The ten stocks on the list with the lowest p/e ratios showed a mean annual return of 11.71 percent over the 22 years, while the ten with the highest p/e's returned an average of just 6.35 percent a year.   <p> The implication is that investors who refuse to pay too much for growth will do far better than those who are less discriminating. <p> Is there a technique an investor can use to know where to draw the line? To explore this issue, we asked Standard & Poor's Compustat to reconstruct the financial data for the Nifty Fifty stocks that an investor would have known at the start of the study period on December 31, 1972. Our subsequent analysis showed that the ten worst performers over the following 22 years had certain elements in common.  <p> The first was falling profit margins. While only 9 of the 41 stocks in our sample (9 Nifty Fifty companies no longer exist or trade publicly) had declining profit margins in 1972, 5 of those were among the 10 worst performers over the next 22 years.  <p> Second, the losers had high payout ratios, which measure the percentage of earnings being paid to investors as dividends. Investors pay a premium for growth stocks because high-growth companies are expected to reinvest current earnings to produce even higher future earnings. That can't happen, though, if a company  is devoting a large percentage of its  net income to dividend payments. Among the ten worst long-term Nifty Fifty picks, for example, <a name="NYSE:AVP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10152"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Avon Products</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:LLX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10917"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Louisiana Land</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> paid out extraordinarily high dividends  as a percentage of earnings in 1972: 62 percent, 58 percent, and 49 percent, respectively. <p> As a third measure, we calculated what's known as a sustainable earnings growth rate for each company. This measure is based on a simple assumption that over the long term a company's growth rate can't be higher than the return earned on investors' equity (a ratio known as return on equity, or ROE).  <p> For example, during the 12-month period ending on November 30,1995, the earnings of <a name="NASD:SUNW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14833"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sun Microsystems</b></a>, a computer maker, grew121 percent. But the company's return on every dollar of invested equity was just 22.56 percent. This suggests that, over the long term, earnings will probably decrease to an annual growth rate closer to 22.56 percent.  <p> Calculating a sustainable growth rate, then, involves taking the figure for a company's return on equity and multiplying it by the percentage of earnings that the company is retaining instead of paying out in dividends. This number forecasts a company's likely maximum long-term growth rate.  <p> Sustainable earnings growth rates can be very different from current rates of earnings growth. For example, <a name="NYSE:EK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10500"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Eastman Kodak</b></a> had commendable earnings growth of 30.39 percent in 1972. But because its return on equity was just 19.8 percent that year, and because the company was paying out 41 percent of its profits in dividends, its sustainable growth rate was only 11.68 percent. Kodak ended up among the ten worst stock market performers over the next 22 years.  <p> On average, the ten best of the Nifty Fifty (over the 22 years) showed a higher average return on equity than the ten worst 19.32 percent compared with 17.97. That translates into a higher rate of sustainable growth for the top performers, 11.5 percent versus10.32.  <p> The figures on sustainable earnings growth rate also show that most of the historic two-to-one performance difference between both groups resulted from investors' over paying for stocks with inferior fundamentals back in 1972. This mistake is captured graphically by another simple formula, one of our own devising: the price-to-earnings ratio divided by the sustainable growth rate. The average result for the top Nifty Fifty stocks comes to 3.21; for the worst it's 5.44 a sharp distinction. In otherwords, investors in the stocks that turned out to be the poorest performers over the long haul were paying almost 70 percent morefor each unit of sustainable growth than were investors in the top performers.  <p> What do these measures tell us about growth stocks in today's market? To put our theories to use, we created two lists of stocks after screening the entire universe of 7,471 issues on Morningstar's U.S. Equities database. We first looked for the highfliers of the moment:  stocks with price-to-earnings ratios of at least 34.5 (or twice that of the Standard & Poor's 500), positive earnings growth for at least five years, and market capitalizations of at least $1 billion. We found 49. Second, we built a list of classic growth stocks: those with high p/e's (above the market norm of 17.25), five-year earnings growth rates averaging more than 15 percent a year, and market capitalizations of at least $5 billion. Of these we found 44.  <p> We then took both lists and calculated sustainable earnings growth rates for each stock.  <p> Among the highfliers, many current market favorites showed poor results. <a name="NASD:SBUX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15745"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Starbucks'</b></a> sustainable growth rate is just 8.71 percent;<a name="NASD:BSST"></a><b>Baby Superstore's</b> is only 12.8 percent. In the past year, both had huge increases in earnings 163.6 percent and 96 percent, respectively. But both also reported low returns on equity of 8.71 and 12.8. (Since neither company is paying a dividend, the sustainable growth rate of each is equal to its return on equity.) The explosive earnings growth at both companies is coming from rapid expansion and as expansion opportunities dry up, growth will fall toward the current return-on-equity numbers.  <p> <a name="NASD:ESST"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=44543"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ESS Technology</b></a>, which makes sound-processing chips and boards, and <a name="NYSE:DST"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=44563"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>DST Systems</b></a>, a computer data-processing company, had the highest sustainable growth rates. Two more familiar names, Internet hardware maker Cisco Systems and <a name="NASD:BROD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11907"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Broderbund Software</b></a>, followed hard on their heels with sustainable growth of 35.61 percent and 30.60 percent, respectively.  <p> Using our newly created ratio of p/e to sustainable growth, investors can compare our two lists to see which stocks offer the most sustainable growth for the dollar. Highfliers such as ESS Technology and DST Systems hold their own, showing ratios of 0.79 and 0.65, respectively. Even though these stocks have p/e's that make them seem expensive 52.78 and 39.38 their sustainable growth rates are high enough to provide strong growth for the buck. Cisco Systems and Broderbund, with ratios of 1.28 and 1.20, respectively, also deliver growth relatively cheaply.  <p> Some of the traditional growth stocks also yield high growth for each dollar invested. The top of this list is dominated by familiar names such as Coca-Cola, Gillette, <a name="NASD:AMGN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12623"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Amgen</b></a>, and Sun Microsystems. Sustainable growth rates for these companies range from 34.68 percent for Coca-Cola to 22.56 percent for Sun Microsystems. <p> Coca-Cola, for example, shows a ratio of p/e to sustainable growth of just 0.94. Companies with relatively low current earnings growth, such as Gillette and <a name="NYSE:PFE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11175"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pfizer</b></a>, both promise more growth for the buck, with ratios of 1.27 and 1.52, respectively, than such high-tech favorites as Fore Systems (10.91 ratio) and U.S.Robotics (3.94 ratio).  <p> The lessons of the Nifty Fifty suggest that the true long-term investor will earn better results by buying stocks that deliver the most sustainable growth for the dollar. Gillette, for example, may not be flashy, but it offers strong odds for superior long-term returns. <p><p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> INVESTING BRIEFS  <p> Vanguard Gets Pricier  <p> Vanguard Group, loved by many skinflint investors for its low fees, is raising its minimum investment from $500 to $1,000 on new IRAs. In June, Vanguard will also automatically deduct a $10 annual fee on non-retirement accounts with balances of less than $2,500. To avoid the fee, investors can boost a fund above the $2,500 level or set up an automatic plan to deposit $50 a month or more. The fee will also be waived for investors who have at least $50,000 in Vanguard funds. Fidelity Investments and <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab & Co.</b></a> added similar fees in the fall of 1995.  <p>  <p>A Stock Ticker of One's Own  <p> Personal-computer users can now put a stock ticker on their screens, thanks to a new CD-ROM called Internet Mania. QuoteScan, one of eight components on the CD-ROM, provides 20-minute-delayed quotes on up to five stocks at a time users pay no extra per-quote fees. In addition to quotes, owners of the CD-ROM package can search for news articles and create Web pages. The CD-ROM, put out by software-maker Corel, in Ottawa, and PC Quote, in Chicago, sells for $24.95 (800-772-6735).  <p>  <p>Financial Jottings  <p> The <a name="FUND:ACRNX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACRNX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Acorn Fund</b></a> and its sibling, <a name="FUND:ACINX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACINX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Acorn International</b></a>, have both reopened to new investors. The small-cap Acorn Fund has returned an average annualized 14.8 percent over the past 15 years, <a name="FUND:JAVLX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JAVLX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus 20</b></a>also reopened. The fund regained respect in 1995 by beating the Standard & Poor's 500 Index with a 37.6 percent return through December 7 after underperforming the index from 1992 to 1994. Ron Elijah, manager of the sizzling <a name="FUND:RSCOX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/RSCOX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Robertson Stephens Value+Growth Fund</b></a> up 47.9 percent for 1995 as of December 7 has been tapped to run a new technology fund, the Robertson Stephens Information Age Fund.

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> ESTIMATING THE FUTURE  <p>Earnings forecasts are the most important factor in moving stock prices <p>  <p>By Pamela J. Black  <p> A company's earnings are key to determining its stock price. But stocks don't trade just on the money a company actually carries to the bank. Stock prices are based on expected earnings what Wall Street calls earnings estimates and can move up or down rapidly depending on how real earnings compare with expectations. Consider the electronics retailer <a name="NYSE:TAN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11441"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tandy</b></a>: When the company's third-quarter earnings per share came in one penny short of analysts' expectations, the stock plunged 24 percent.  <p> Earnings estimates are educated guesses made by securities analysts about the future profitability of the companies they follow. The best estimates result from careful modeling of a company's costs, the mix of products the company sells, and the demand for these products. Good analysts get out of their offices to listen to what customers say about a company's product and talk on the phone to suppliers and competitors. Large companies maybe followed by 30 to 40 analysts, while small companies may befollowed by only a few, or sometimes none at all.  <p> Research firms such as Zacks Investment Research in Chicago,I/B/E/S International in New York, and First Call in Boston compile estimates from the analysts who follow a stock to calculate anaverage expectation for a company's future earnings. (Individual investors can check research from I/B/E/S, Zacks, and First Call through such services as CompuServe Prodigy, and <a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b>.) <p> Such research can offer important clues to future changes in stock prices. Analysts update their estimates continually, and savvy investors look for patterns in the changes. Is the estimate of a company's earnings for the next quarter slipping? Have a few analysts raised their estimates? Investors also want to know if the spread between the high and low estimates is getting wider or narrower. A widening spread indicates analysts are increasingly divided in their opinions on a stock. "The dynamics of how the earnings estimates change tell you a lot," says Ed Keon, senior vice president of I/B/E/S.  <p> Interpreting changes in earnings estimates requires knowledge of both a company and its industry. When expectations for a company are already low, a disappointing earnings report will not have much impact on the stock price. Take the beleaguered chemical industry, says Ben Zacks, executive vice president of Zacks Investment Research. "If a company comes in ten cents below the estimate, no one cares." But when expectations are high, a stock can get trounced if it falls short by even a few cents. That's one reason technology shares are so volatile.  <p> Four times a year analysts get to check their best guesses against reality when companies issue their quarterly financial reports. Afterward, analysts of ten change their future estimates. Following Tandy's report, 15 of the 16 analysts who covered the company lowered their estimates.  <p> But "revision fever" can strike in the days just before a company reports, as one analyst after another produces a new estimate. Many of these word-of-mouth revisions aren't picked up by the large research firms. That's why a stock that meets the published estimates can still rise or fall rapidly after earnings have been announced.  <p><p>

						January 1996--Special Issue <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> TOP PICKS FOR 1996 <p>To get an early glimpse of the coming year, we assembled our regular panel of topflight investment pros and asked for their thoughts about the markets. They provided not only that but also their favorite stock selections for the year ahead.  <p> Reported by Jonathan Butler  <p> In each issue of Worth, a panel of acclaimed investment pros share their favorite stock picks with readers. For this special issue, they've agreed to comment on the upcoming year as well as to disclose their two best bets for 1996. The price listed in parentheses with each choice is the maximum at which the pro considers it attractive. It should be assumed in each case that the fund managers have bought the stock for their funds. The newsletter writers may also own or control shares in the stocks they recommend. We selected the members of our panel for both their demonstrated skill and the wide range of investment styles they represent.  <p> PRESTON ATHEY <p>Athey, who runs the <a name="FUND:PRSUX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSUX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value Fund</b></a>, is rapidly gaining a reputation as a hot portfolio manager, specializing in value stocks with market capitalizations below $250 million. Small Cap Value was Worth's top choice in 1995 for funds of this type.   <p> ATHEY'S OVERVIEW: The coming year will be a positive one. I don't see the Federal Reserve tightening the money supply because inflation doesn't look like a near-term threat. The combination of modest economic growth and a reasonably accommodating Fed should lead to a respectable performance by the market. Growth companies (foods, health care, consumer non-durables) will benefit because their earnings will look relatively good. But cyclical companies (steels, metals, autos) will be hurt as economic growth slows. I expect a fairly strong dollar, so smaller companies should do better than larger companies. It won't be a time to bet on major corporate turnarounds. Instead, invest in the Steady Eddies.  <p> <a name="NASD:ELRC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13294"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Electro Rent</b></a> ($22) <p>Headquartered in Van Nuys, California, this $230 million company leases and rents electronic equipment, primarily personal computers and work stations. This is a growth business with expanding margins.The only competitors are local mom-and-pop stores. Electro Rentis national, so customers know it is up-to-date, has national warehouses to replace machines and parts, and has the best service and selection. People are willing to pay a little extra for these advantages. No Wall Street firms follow the company, so it trades below its potential. I expect the company to earn $1.70 a share during the fiscal year ending May 1996, up from $1.23 a share a year earlier. That puts the stock price at a reasonable multiple of 11.5. Return on equity is an attractive 17 percent and rising. Electro Rent is my fund's No. 1 holding.  <p> <a name="NASD:CMRO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13033"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Comarco</b></a> ($12.50) <p>Comarco, located in Yorba Linda, California, has two businesses. It manages facilities for government installations, performing services that range from monitoring high-tech systems to hiring janitors. But it also has become a player of sorts in the cellular-phone business. Comarco developed a product that evaluates the quality and consistency of a cellular company's network. The cellular business accounts for less than half of Comarco's revenues, but more than half of its profits. Within a year, 75 percent of Comarco's profits could come from cellular. This is a small growth company with a $50 million market capitalization. Yet the Street still regards it as if it were a value play: The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is about 13 (far below what's typical for most wireless companies). The company's return on equity is about 20 percent. I think earnings will grow at least 20 percent annually over the next couple of years. Comarco is basically undiscovered. When investors finally do take notice, the stock could double.  <p> JAMES P. CRAIG <p>Craig, who manages the <a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Fund</b></a>, invests primarily in large growth companies with the goal of preserving capital. His fund earned a five-$ rating from Worth in 1995.  <p> CRAIG'S OVERVIEW: The economy is not as woeful as is widely believed. Look for slower but consistent growth with lower interest rates in 1996. I have the most confidence in companies that have shown steady and stable growth. But cyclicals could rebound when it becomes clear that fears about a recession are overblown. The best sectors to be in will be financials, drugs, and possibly papers and airlines. My outlook is predicated on stable interest rates.   <p> <a name="NYSE:EDS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41915"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>EDS</b></a> ($50) <p>Data-processing giant EDS (listed as <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> E shares on the New York Stock Exchange) will be a huge beneficiary of the rising demand for outsourcing. Over the next 12 to 18 months it will bid on $30 billion worth of business and should get a good chunk of it as the dominant player in the field. Dallas-based EDS should have 20 percent earnings growth and 18 percent sales growth in the years ahead. I think it will earn $2.25 a share in 1996 and $2.65 a share in 1997. With a price-to-earnings multiple in the low 20s, the stock should get to $60 by the middle of next year a 30 percent gain from current levels. I also expect GM to spin off EDS in 1996, which will be a good thing for EDS shareholders.  <p> <a name="NYSE:CCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10345"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Citicorp </b></a>($70)  <p>Keys to the success of this huge U.S. banking company will include strong international growth and the stability of its U.S. credit card operation. I think that recent fears about credit card delinquencies have been exaggerated. New York셕ased Citicorp's aggressive, $3 billion share-buy back plan also should provide a lot of support for the stock. The current program should be over by the fall of 1996, at which point the company will probably launch another $3 billion plan. If this happens, I expect earnings of $7.65 a share in 1996 and $9 in 1997. Unless interest rates collapse, the stock could trade at $90 a share within a year or so.   <p> SHELBY M.C. DAVIS <p>Davis, who runs the <a name="FUND:NYVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NYVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>New York Venture Fund</b></a>, invests in large companies using a value-oriented style. His fund earned a four-$ rating from Worth in 1995 and has racked up average annual returns of19.6 percent during the past five years.   <p> DAVIS'S OVERVIEW: With the economy on autopilot, the market will be defined by slowing, but not collapsing, gains in corporate profits. We'll probably see slightly lower interest rates early in the year, but rates should return to current levels by the end of 1996. Inflation will remain a nonissue. Politics will be a noise factor but won't really influence the direction ofthe market. The investing theme of the year: "Turning around battleships takes time."  <p> General Motors ($45) <p>Detroit giant GM is a cyclical-value turn around story. The automaker is cutting costs and repairing its balance sheet. It still has a long way to go to achieve margins comparable to its competitors', but its North American market share is stabilizing. GM is now putting more emphasis on marketing and is improving the way it launches new products. This is a huge industrial company, but it is learning more and more about how to operate like <a name="NYSE:PG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11211"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Procter & Gamble</b></a> when it comes to things like brand management and savvy promotion. I think the stock could get as high as $75 a share in the next few years.  <p> <a name="NYSE:EQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13307"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>The Equitable Companies</b></a> ($23) <p>Equitable, which I recommended in Worth last month, is a fast-growing New York셕ased financial company with three excellent businesses: annuity and life insurance, money management (Alliance Capital), and investment banking and securities brokerage (Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette). This broad spectrum of growth deserves a higher valuation than other insurance companies. I think this will be the year Equitable attracts more believers it's so big people can't ignore it any longer. I'm still looking for earnings of more than $2 a share for 1996. I think this could be a $30 stock by mid-1997.  <p> DANIEL B. LEONARD  <p>Leonard manages the <a name="FUND:FSFSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FSFSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Invesco Strategic Portfolios Technology Fund</b></a> and has an eye for growth stocks in technology and related fields. His fund earned a five-$ rating from Worth in 1995, with an average return of 29.5 percent over the past five years.  <p> LEONARD'S OVERVIEW: The market has had some wonderful years recently, so we're due for a cold shower. I think we'll be lucky to get a 5 percent rise in stock prices over the course of 1996. If any theme will continue, it will be the merging and restructuring of American industry. No sector will be immune, especially not banking.  <p> Chesapeake Energy ($34) <p>Based in Oklahoma City, Chesapeake is one of the three most active drillers of onshore wells in the country, and investors are returning to the energy sector. This $330 million company with rapid reserve growth and good expense control has had a high success ratio at finding oil and gas. The stock, at around $30 a share, is trading at roughly 20 times my earnings estimate of $1.96 a share for the fiscal year ending in June. Yet with Chesapeake's profits growing at roughly 50 percent a year, the stock could be up to $45 within six months. Earnings should hit $2.92 a share for the fiscal year ending June 1997.  <p> <a name="NYSE:NEC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11050"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>National Education</b></a> ($10) <p>New management has turned around this company by cutting costs. Headquartered in Irvine, California, it makes educational software for technical and industrial employee training. It is the largest company of its kind with over 7,000 clients and few competitors. Targeting new small- to medium-sized clients and emphasizing client/server and networking products should boost revenues. Once the Street notices how quickly this company's earnings are improving, the stock could jump to between $12 a share and $15 a share.  <p> JIM McCAMANT <p>McCamant has a wide range of experience in the fields of technology and venture capital. His "Medical Technology Stock Letter" focuses on investment opportunities in biotechnology companies.  <p> McCAMANT's OVERVIEW: 1996 will be a good year for smaller stocks. Except for some technology outfits, smaller companies generally haven't been big winners as of late. In a continued slow-growth environment, investors will be looking for stocks that can do better than average. Improvement in small-company stocks started in 1994, but we had a correction this past fall. I expect a rebound in 1996.  <p> <a name="NASD:SMTG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13506"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Somatogen</b></a> ($20) <p>Somatogen, with a market capitalization of $400 million, is the leader in developing a blood substitute that has the potential to be the largest single product in the biotech industry. The Boulder, Colorado, company has a great partner in <a name="NYSE:LLY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10509"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Eli Lilly</b></a> and has just finished a successful early phase-two trial. When the biotech industry was last hot in 1992, the stock sold at $50. The company has made tremendous progress since then and now sells at $15. My 18-month target is $50.  <p> <a name="NASD:ISIP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14081"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Isis Pharmaceuticals</b></a> ($12) <p>Based in Carlsbad, California, Isis develops therapeutic compounds. The company has the best antisense technology (which turns off RNA in the cell to prevent production of disease-causing proteins). Initial products are antivirals and anticancers. A partnership formed in 1995 with Boehringer Ingelheim focuses on anti-inflammatory drugs. The stock is around $10, off its 1995 high of $15.25. My target is $25.  <p> MICHAEL MURPHY <p>Murphy, who holds a U.S. patent on a securities-value calculator, has been writing the highly regarded California Technology Stock Letter since 1981. His focus: Identifying high-growth companies. <p> MURPHY's OVERVIEW: The big question is whether Windows 95 will finally lift off, causing corporations to up-grade large numbers of computers. Everything unrelated to PCs (semiconductors and parts) is doing fine. If Windows does start gaining ground, as I think it will, it sets us up for another year of 20-plus percent growth for PCs and semiconductors, which is more than the Street is expecting.  <p> <a name="NASD:ADSK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12689"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Autodesk</b></a> ($38) <p>Autodesk is a major software company that makes AutoCAD software for architects and engineers. Located in San Rafael, California, the company is currently in the midst of a transition from there lease of version number 12 of its software to the release of version 13. Wall Street is nervous about how fast this change overwill occur. But this is a real growth company. The numbers are super: Pretax margins are almost 20 percent; annual earnings growth is about 18 percent. I expect the company to earn $2.40 per share for the fiscal year ending Jan-uary 1997, which means it's trading at around 16 times earnings. This is very cheap for a company that's growing fast and dominates its business. <p> <a name="NASD:EUPH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=44511"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Euphonix</b></a> ($10) <p>Because Euphonix, based in Palo Alto, California, is a relatively recent offering, it's not well understood yet. It is a niche company that incorporates digital technology in mixing boards used in sound studios. There's a lot of opportunity because its two largest competitors make significantly inferior products. It has a well-defined market, so its marketing expenses are relatively low. I project sales to grow at a rate of 50 percent annually. Pretax margins are about 10 percent now but should be over 15 percent in a couple of years. I expect the company to earn 40 cents per share in 1996, which puts the stock price at 20 times earnings, or less than half the company's growth rate. Euphonix has two or three years of growth ahead of it regardless of what happens with the economy.  <p> WILLIAM J. NASGOVITZ and HUGH F. DENISON <p>Nasgovitz and Denison are one of our favorite stock-picking duos. Their <a name="FUND:HRTVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HRTVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Heartland Value Fund</b></a> was one of Worth's top five fund picks in 1994. The two focus on acquiring the stocks of domestic small-cap companies they believe to be undervalued by the market.  <p> NASGOVITZ AND DENISON'S OVERVIEW: Retailing stocks are out of favor and unloved because they have repeatedly disappointed the Street with their earnings. Performance-driven institutions have been dumping the group, and so have individuals for tax-loss reasons. But retailers may bounce back in 1996 as they emerge from a period of considerable downsizing. Their stocks are now selling at good values.   <p> <a name="NYSE:SKO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13430"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Shopko Stores</b></a> ($12) <p>This specialty discount retailer out Wal-Marts <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a>. It operates130 stores in 15 northern states (it is based in Green Bay, Wisconsin) that are better looking and offer better service than a typical Wal-Mart. The stock is a great value, trading at only 3.5 times cash flow and 7.5 times 1996 earnings estimates of $1.20 a share.It also has great downside support: At $10 a share, it is trading well below its book value of $13 and paying a roughly 4 percent dividend yield.   <p> <a name="NASD:DESI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13199"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Designs Inc.</b></a> ($8) <p>This specialty retailer offers a broad selection of Levi Strauss & Co. products plus its own Boston Traders label. The stock plunged from a 1993 high of $25 a share after earnings went into a tailspin. But things have turned around. Same-store sales at this Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts-based company are showing improvement. We expect earnings to increase roughly 30 percent to $1 a share in 1996 and to more than $1.25 a share in 1997. The stock currently is trading barely above the company's book value.  <p> LOUIS NAVELLIER <p>Navellier, who writes the popular MPT Review, uses modern portfolio theory to identify high-return, low-volatility stocks. His newsletter has been ranked No. 1 for its performance over the past ten years by The Hulbert Financial Digest. In April 1994, he launched the <a name="FUND:NASCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NASCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Navellier Series Fund's Aggressive Small Cap Equity Portfolio</b></a>.  <p> NAVELLIER'S OVERVIEW: Economic growth has been accelerating faster than we once imagined. I'm finding that my buy list contains a lot more large-capitalization stocks than just a couple of months ago. The stock market's breadth and power is expanding; bonds have been strong and appear to be supporting the market. Earnings are accelerating as well. The market tends to rally in an election year. Price-to-earnings ratios are reasonable. I would guess that the Nasdaq will be up 20 percent in 1996, the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500 indexes each up around15 percent.  <p> <a name="NASD:SMTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12316"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Semtech</b></a> ($35) <p>Sales at this semiconductor maker (located in Newbury Park, California) are growing at over 60 percent. Margins are expanding, so profits are growing even faster than sales. The stock is just being discovered by institutions. This should really drive the price up over time. The other positive for the stock is that its on-balance volume is high, which means that there are more upward than downward ticks in the stock.  <p> <a name="NASD:ZIGO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15204"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Zygo</b></a> ($42) <p>Professional investors are starting to notice this Middlefield, Connecticut-based producer of precision optical equipment for monitoring manufacturing quality. As I mentioned in the December Worth, the company's profit margins are expanding and fourth-quarter sales increased 71 percent over last year's. Like Semtech, Zygo is also attracting more institutional ownership. The stock has also been behaving well its on-balance volume is very strong.  <p> ERIC E. RYBACK <p>For more than a decade, Ryback has been earning solid annual returns for the <a name="FUND:LDDVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LDDVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lindner Dividend Fund</b></a> while assuming little risk. His approach is to look for current income first and capital appreciation second.  <p> RYBACK'S OVERVIEW: Bill Clinton will want a strong economy, so he'll do everything in his power to convince the Fed to make that happen. Greenspan's election comes up early in 1996. I'd assume he'd want to stay in office, but who knows, maybe he won't. I really don't expect a very good year because I see a lot of uncertainty hanging over the market.   <p> <a name="NASD:MCOM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15760"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Metricom</b></a> ($25) <p>Metricom installs commercial wireless data networks in large cities (San Francisco, Seattle, San Jose, Washington, D.C.) and on a growing number of college campuses. Operating in a license-free spectrum, the Los Gatos, California, company attaches its small radio units to streetlights. This enables it to provide high-speed,two-way communications and unlimited Internet access to customers for under $30 a month. Its modem configuration is included in Windows 95. Handheld communicators incorporating voice mail are under development as well. Metricom is a viable company on its own, but it is also a buyout target. The company has no earnings yet, but this could easily be a $50 stock.  <p> <a name="NASD:CHRS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12948"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charming Shoppes</b></a> ($5) <p>Charming Shoppes, based in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, is a strip-mall retailer of women's clothing, located predominantly on the East Coast. Unaccustomed to borrowing money, the company is arranging financing that will carry it through a restructuring program to close poorly performing stores and replace a stale merchandise assortment. This plan will be carried out under the new leadership of a proven apparel executive from <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears</b></a>, Dorrit Bern, who took over as president and CEO of Charming Shoppes in October. Earnings may take a year to recover but the stock will strengthen on any sales rebound. Buy up to $5 for a return to the $7 to $9 level. <p> DAN SULLIVAN  <p>Sullivan, who has published The Chartist since 1969, has one of the most impressive long-term performance records in the investment-advisory business. He relies on technical analysis to identify long-term equity investments.  <p> SULLIVAN'S OVERVIEW: Consumer spending constitutes two thirds of the economy. So the prospects for 1996 will be muted by: 1) slow job growth, 2) record levels of household debt, 3) record low household liquidity, and 4) the impending large-scale changes in tax laws aimed at lowering the deficit through reduced governmentspending on welfare and Medicare. Cyclical and discretionary-product companies will not be able to maintain profit growth in this environment. A lower capital-gains tax would favor long-term growth stocks with recession resistance.  <p> <a name="NYSE:MDT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10981"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Medtronic</b></a> ($62) <p>If this company had a theme song, it would be "The Beat Goes On." Not only do its pacemakers keep the heart pumping properly, but it has repeatedly delivered exceptional earnings growth year after year. Located in Minneapolis, Medtronic is a leading medical technology company (about half the pacemakers in the world are produced by Medtronic). It also maintains an impressive pipeline of other cardiovascular and neurological products. It does business in more than 120 countries; almost 50 percent of its sales come from overseas markets. The success of Medtronic lies in its extensive research and development efforts. Its impressive string of new offerings has helped the company achieve an annual earnings growth rate of 19 percent over the past 5 years. The Jewel implantable defibrillator and the Thera bradycardia pacemaker have allowed the company to exceed earnings expectations of late. This positive earnings momentum should carry over through the end of the decade. <p> <a name="NYSE:UNH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15007"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>United Health Care</b></a> ($64) <p>United Health Care, a Minnetonka, Minnesota-based HMO company, will not be able to sustain the phenomenal growth rate it achieved during the past five years. Still, I do expect it to continue posting solid gains. As a national leader in a growing industry, UNH has positioned itself to capitalize on the switch from traditional fee-for-service insurance plans to HMOs. Its membership base has grown faster than its competitors' while at the same time its costs have remained among the lowest in the industry. The company's accelerated membership enrollment is a result of a successful strategy of growth through acquisition. It has madea science of purchasing smaller companies and effectively integrating them into its system. Its successful ways should continue, with earnings growth in the neighborhood of 20 to 25 percent over the next three to five years.  <p> RALPH WANGER AND CHUCK McQUAID  <p>Wanger and McQuaid, along with Terence Hogan, run the acclaimed <a name="FUND:ACRNX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACRNX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Acorn Fund</b></a>. Acorn got a four-$ rating from Worth in 1995. Wanger and McQuaid look for stocks of small-cap companies that stand to benefit from favorable economic trends.   <p> WANGER AND MCQUAID'S OVERVIEW: As we look to the future, we like the prospects for what we call downstream technology. Yes, the semiconductor stocks have been very hot. But we think that at some point capacity will match demand, and profits will suffer. The commodity-like semiconductor companies will be plagued by price-cutting and low margins. There's going to be a shift away from these types of outfits. As a result, we are focusing on the companies that will benefit from what the semiconductor companies are doing. Cable programmers and cellular franchises are examples.  <p> <a name="NYSE:OAK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11108"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oak Industries</b></a> ($25) <p>Headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, Oak produces key basic components for the information superhighway: connectors for coaxialcable, pump lasers for optical amplifiers used in fiber-optic networks, and oscillators for wireless-communications base stations. All three markets are growing rapidly as cable and telecom companies improve their infrastructure worldwide. The stock is off from its ten-year high of $32, perhaps because of a new accounting rule that requires Oak to report higher taxes than it actually pays. On our estimate of fully taxed 1995 earnings of $1.95 a share, the stock is cheap. We think it should trade at at least15 times 1995 earnings, or $29 a share.  <p> <a name="NASD:LIBT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16058"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Liberty Media</b></a> ($32) <p>Liberty, which owns interests in 71 cable channels, was our top pick in November, and it remains one of our favorites for 1996. The joint venture it recently formed with News Corp. will be able to bid against ESPN for major sports events. The venture also will provide new broadcast outlets for Liberty's current sports programs.

The last time was in 1990, so we're definitely overdue. It's a lot like an extra-inning ball game: Will it last 10 innings or 15 innings? Fed tighteningsiphons money from long-term investments (Treasurys and stocks). So if the Fed gets worried about inflation, the market will suffer. <p> <a name="NYSE:UAM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42135"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>United Asset Management</b></a> ($39) <p>Boston-based UAM is a holding company with 44 investment-managementsubsidiaries. The stock has gone nowhere since I recommended it in June, but I still believe in its potential.

						We'll admit it. We're no better at keeping New Year's resolutions than anyone else. We're probably going to keep eating prime rib and chocolate cake, slicing our drives, and postponing those repairs on the roof . But one pledge: If we're going to be tubbies with wild swings and leaky roofs, we should at least have our financial house in order and earn as much as possible on our investments. that's why we asked ten respected financial planners to share their best advice for 1996. The result is a list of timely and sensible recommendations no investor should ignore. <p> By Andrew Gluck and Timothy Middleton  <p> 1. TAKE YOUR 401(K) TO THE LIMIT. Michael J. Chasnoff, Cincinnati, Ohio. There's absolutely no reason not to increase your contribution to your 401(k) plan to the limit, says Michael J. Chasnoff, a financial planner at Advanced Capital Strategies in Cincinnati. "It's a no-brainer," he says. "I see clients who are well-to-do now, but they're not saving enough for retirement. They may wind up impoverished and relying on Social Security in their old age." <p> In 1996, 401(k)s will become even sweeter deals. Federal law prevented employees from socking away more than $9,240 in a 401(k) for 1995, but for 1996 the limit rises to $9,500. The additional $260 a year of contributions may not sound like much, but crunching some numbers shows how the benefit will compound over time. For an employee who is paying 40 percent in combined federal and state taxes, whose employer is matching 50 percent of her contributions, and whose account earns a 10 percent return, that $260 a year, over 25 years, amounts to $42,191.  <p> Chasnoff emphasizes that 401(k) participants must contact their employers to maximize their contributions. "It won't be done automatically," he says. "If you don't tell your employer to go to the $9,500 limit, you might be letting tens of thousands of dollars fall by the wayside."  <p> 2. INVESTIGATE YOUR INSURANCE. Roy Ballentine, Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. Life insurance, like any other aspect of your personal finances, deserves regular scrutiny. Roy Ballentine of Ballentine & Co. in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, advises clients to contact their insurers and request a disclosure document called an in-force policy ledger. This ledger is a statement that strips a life-insurance policy to its bones and can reveal just how secure your policy is.  <p> An in-force ledger shows a policy's current cash value. (Cash value is a feature of all life insurance except for term policies. It represents the investment side of a life-insurance policy inother words, the "extra" that represents the difference between a whole-life policy and a term-life policy.) The statement also projects how much cash the policy should accumulate in the future. For example, for a universal life policy, the in-force ledger will forecast the amount of interest income the insurer expects you to earn on your cash value after subtracting administrative and other expenses.  <p> The problem to watch out for is the potential for an erosion in the cash value of your policy. If projections show that the cash value is going down instead of up sometime in the future, you might find that your insurer will inform you that you must start paying additional premiums or face having the policy expire."We've seen lots of in-force illustrations where the projections show that unless the client puts additional funding into the policy, it will lapse well within the life expectancy of the insured," Ballentine says.   <p> Conscientious life insurance agents provide this kind of in-force analysis for their clients annually, Ballentine says. If yours doesn't, talk to two or three other agents and ask them to analyze your policy.  <p> 3. SHARPEN YOUR MUTUAL FUND FOCUS. Deena B. Katz, Coral Gables, Florida. When William Sharpe won the Nobel prize in economics in 1990, he was recognized for some brilliant insights about investment risk. Deena B. Katz at Evensky, Brown & Katz in Coral Gables, Florida, recommends applying his brain power to your own portfolio of mutual funds by using a calculation known as a Sharpe ratio to assess just how efficient your funds are.  <p> A Sharpe ratio measures how much profit you reap for every unit of risk you take. Essentially, it takes a fund's annual return rate, subtracts the return on risk-free Treasury bills, and divides the result by the fund's standard deviation. (Standard deviation is a statistical measure used to gauge a fund's volatility by showing how widely its returns tend to vary from its average return.) In practice, calculating the ratio requires crunching a lot of monthly numbers. Fortunately, you can just look up your fund's Sharpe ratio in Morningstar Mutual Funds, which is available in most libraries.  <p> Once you've found the Sharpe ratio for your funds, you can compare them against other funds to determine how much risk you're taking to earn your returns. For instance, someone might view <a name="FUND:LLSCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LLSCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Longleaf Partners Small Cap Fund</b></a> and <a name="FUND:KSCAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/KSCAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kemper Small Cap Equity Fund</b></a> as essentially interchangeable. Both are small-company stock funds, and both gained about 15.7 percent annually over the past three years. But the Kemper fund's three-year Sharpe ratio is 0.79 while the ratio for Longleaf Partners Small Cap is 1.23. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the less risk you've taken to get your profits. "This is arguably the single most important evaluative tool for a fund investor," Katz says.  <p> 4. TAKE YOUR CUE FROM CONGRESS. Robert Wacker, San Luis Obispo, California. With tax reform all the rage in Washington right now, it appears likely that Congress will pass some sort of capital-gains tax cut. Robert Wacker at R.E. Wacker Associates in San Luis Obispo, California, is betting that legislators will allow investors to exclude half of their capital gains from taxation. "That means it will be critical to rethink your allocation of equity and fixed-income investments between taxable and tax-deferred accounts," he says.  <p> The current system taxes all long-term capital gains at either your income-tax rate or at 28 percent, whichever is lower. That structure has prompted many investors to put more equities into tax-deferred retirement accounts IRAs and 401(k)s with the idea that those are longer-term investments. Typically, such investors would tend to put tax-free fixed-income investments usually municipal bonds or bond funds in their taxable accounts, with the idea that those funds need to be more stable and liquid.  <p> But if a 50 percent exclusion on capital gains is adopted, investment planning will be turned on its head. Wacker recommends that investors essentially reverse course, changing the emphasis of their taxable accounts to equities and putting fixed-income investments taxable bonds and bond funds into tax-deferred accounts. With the lower effective capital-gains tax rate, it's no longer quite as attractive to shield your gains on equities in the tax-deferred accounts. And, having freed up those tax-deferred accounts from equities, investors can use them to shelter the income on taxable bonds. Essentially, all this switching around gives investors the chance to move into higher-yielding taxable bonds from lower-yielding municipals without watching that edge get eaten by taxes.  <p> For an example, Wacker examined the hypothetical case of an investor whose $500,000 portfolio allocated 65 percent to equities and 35 percent to bonds. Prior to any capital-gains tax cut, this investor might be likely to have his entire tax-deferred retirement account devoted to equities, his taxable account invested 30 percent in equities and 70 percent in tax-free muni bonds. Wacker would recommend that this investor flip-flop the entire taxable account to equities while placing 30 percent equities and 70 percent taxable bonds in the tax-deferred account. It takes a fair bit of number crunching, but Wacker can show that, with a 50 percent exclusion in capital gains, switching the allocation as he recommends will net the investor around $60,000 more over15 years an increase of about 4.7 percent over the old, pre됶apital-gains cut allocation method.  <p> Wacker warns that the strategy works best if the switch doesn't involve large sales charges for either buying new investments or selling existing ones. Concentrating on no-load funds can make switching the funds around less painful. Of course, given such a complex strategy, it's wise to consult with a financial professional before making any changes.  <p> 5. BET AGAINST INFLATION WITH BONDS. J. Michael Martin, Columbia, Maryland. Bond market investors seem to be expecting a rise ininflation. J. Michael Martin of Financial Advantage in Columbia, Maryland, thinks they're wrong, so he's advising clients to buy bonds now, wait for them to rally, and then sell.  <p> Is there a deal to be had? It depends. Long-term Treasurys have been yielding about 6.4 percent while inflation has been holding around 2.5 percent a spread of nearly four percentage points. From a historical perspective, Martin argues that spread between the long bond and inflation is high. According to his research, over the last 60 years, the yield on long-term Treasurys has averaged 1.8 percentage points higher than the inflation rate. So the current spread would seem to imply that bond investors anticipate higher inflation. If they're wrong and Martin is right, then, as he says, "Bonds are on sale."  <p> "In 1996, people are going to see that we've just completed an entire business cycle without inflation flaring up," says Martin, a former research director at mutual fund company T. Rowe Price Associates. "They're going to realize inflation isn't the bugaboo it was in the 1970s and early 1980s."  <p> So Martin is telling clients to expect a major bond rally in1996, with long-term yields sinking a percentage point or more. For investors who want to speculate on the possibility of a bond rally, Martin suggests purchasing long-term zero-coupon Treasury bonds or the <a name="FUND:BTTTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BTTTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Benham Target Maturity 2020 Fund</b></a>, which invests in zero-coupon Treasurys maturing in 2020. Zeroes are bought at a deep discount from their face value of $100 but pay their full face value at maturity. Because zeroes don't pay interest annually, their price fluctuates more than the price of traditional T-bonds.  <p> Of course, that cuts both ways. Consider a 30-year zero yielding 6.4 percent now. The bond is priced at $15.55 and will be worth $100 when it matures. If the yield on 30-year Treasurys jumps a full percentage point, the zero's value will dip to $11.75, a decline of 24 percent. But if a rally materializes and the30-year bond yield sinks a percentage point, the price of the zero rises to $20.64 a 33 percent gain. Either way, keep in mind this is a trading play: If Martin's predicted rally does materialize, you'll make money by selling not by holding.  <p> 6. LAND SOME INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE. Judy Lau, Wilminton, Delaware. In 1995, the real estate investment market finally began to revive. Judy Lau of Lau & Associates in Wilmington, Delaware, is telling clients not to neglect real estate as part of a balanced investment strategy.  <p> "I always like to have some real estate in the portfolio," Lau says. "And this sector still hasn't had the run-up that stocks have." Property is replacing gold as the inflation hedge of choice among investment advisers, and it also produces an income stream of 7 to 9 percent a year. How much to own? Lau says 10 percent of total assets is the right amount for most investors. But some of her clients fear the entire sector. She encourages them to nibble at real estate until they feel more comfortable.  <p> The two most sensible options for participating in this new land grab are real estate investment trusts and the mutual funds that invest in them. The problem with buying individual REITs directly is that they tend to be highly focused on specific kinds of real estate, and therefore tough to assess. One REIT might own a string of shopping centers or malls nationwide, the next a complex of office buildings in a single region. Each requires different analysis: Retailers are filing Chapter 11 in droves, but some developers, particularly in North Carolina, are booming. Also, about one REIT in 20 owns mortgages, rather than properties, making analysis even more difficult.  <p> Given all that, Lau much prefers real estate mutual funds for her clients. "With REITs, there's too much even for a professional to keep up with," she says. "So I let somebody else pick the REITs to own." She's partial to <a name="FUND:CSRSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/CSRSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cohen & Steers Realty Shares</b></a>, which used to have a high initial minimum but has been bringing it down; the fund is now available through <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab</b></a> for a minimum of $2,000. The number of real estate sector funds grew from 22 to 35 in 1995, so there are plenty of options for investors to choose from.  <p> 7. FINE-TUNE YOUR WITHHOLDING. Peg Downey, Silver Spring, Maryland. Until a George Bush-inspired reform compelled the IRS to bring withholding into line with taxpayers' likely income-tax bills, over-withholding was chronic particularly for families and homeowners. Now, however, the opposite is true. "We're seeing more and more clients in danger of being under-withheld," says Peg Downey of Money Plans in Silver Spring, Maryland. "Some are even facing penalties."  <p> Properly filled out, today's W-4 forms should result in withholding at close to the correct amount, even when husband and wife both work. But exceptions abound, especially for those who've changed jobs recently. Different employers may withhold at different rates. Also, employers are particularly prone to make withholding mistakes on state taxes. "Sometimes the headquarters of the business is in a different state, and they inadvertently send your money to that state," Downey says. She advises her clients to fillout W-4 forms carefully, scrutinize pay stubs to judge whether withholdings are appropriate, and file a revised W-4 if necessary. <p> 8. TRIM YOUR EXPOSURE ON ESTATE TAXES. If you own a business or have substantial real estate investments, Gary Pittsford of G.L. Pittsford & Associates in Indianapolis recommends that that you consider setting up a family limited partnership or limited liability company. Doing so can help you save on estate taxes and pass along more to your kids instead of Uncle Sam.  <p> Here's how it works: Real estate holdings and stock in any closely held family businesses are placed inside the partnership. Parents continue to control the assets as general partners. But because the partnership's interests aren't marketable and neither parent holds a majority of votes in the partnership, the value of the interests can be sharply discounted when they are gifted to heirs, cutting estate taxes drastically.  <p> For instance, take a couple with two kids who set up a partnership to own a small business and real estate valued at $5 million. Each parent has a $600,000 lifetime exclusion from estate taxes, so the two of them can pass up to $1.2 million tax-free to heirs. But by discounting, the couple can actually give away a lot more than $1.2 million of their assets without incurring estate taxes. Because the gifted partnership interests won't give voting control to an heir, the courts say the value of the interests can be discounted by perhaps 25 percent or more. Take another discount say around 35 percent because the partnership interest isn't marketable to the public. The parents can actually give away about $2 million of assets and discount it to stay within the $1.2 million lifetime exemption. This avoids the 55 percent estate tax rate on an extra $800,000 a savings of $440,000.  <p> 9. DON'T MISS THE POINT ON FEES. Ginger Applegarth, Winchester, Massachusetts  All investors should take the time to figure out exactly what they're paying for investment advice," says Ginger Applegarth of Applegarth Henderson Advisors in Winchester, Massachusetts. All else being equal identical investments, identical returns an extra percentage point in fees and expenses is a percentage point off your investment return.  <p> What's the big deal about one percentage point a year? Simple: Just like with compound interest, the cumulative effect can be staggering. Take the case of two investors, each earning 12 percent annually on their original portfolios of $100,000, for 20 years. To simplify things, we'll lump all fees together and assume that the first investor pays fees totalling 3 percent of her assets each year. That investor winds up with $560,441 after 20 years. But if the second investor pays 2 percent in fees each year, he'll accumulate a total of $672,750 an increase of $112,309 over the investor paying more fees.  <p> Even if your adviser is using no-load mutual funds to assemble a portfolio, you're still paying the adviser's fee plus fund-company expenses. And if a stockbroker is advising you on investments, you're paying trading commissions. A money manager investing your funds in individual stocks and bonds will likely tack an advisory fee on top of commissions.   <p> Applegarth recommends that investors add up all investment fees they've paid in the last few years and come up with the average annual amount that they're paying. Include fees to your adviser, stockbroker commissions, money-management fees, and any fund charges, such as load fees. Applegarth believes that, generally speaking, fees shouldn't total more than 2.25 percent of assets annually. (If you have more than $500,000 invested, your fees shouldn't exceed 2 percent.)  <p> What should you do if you're over that limit? Talk to your broker or investment adviser, Applegarth says. You can discuss ways to minimize fees, such as relying more on no-load funds and index funds. And if you aren't satisfied with the performance of your investments and the service you've been getting, Applegarth recommends that you seriously consider moving your money elsewhere.  <p> 10. LOOK BEYOND YOUR OWN BACKYARD. Joel Isaacson, New York City. If you haven't already looked overseas for some new investment opportunities, now is the time, says Joel Isaacson of Joel Isaacson & Co. in New York City. He thinks a repeat of1995's stock market run-up is unlikely, so he's telling clients to take some profits on top-performing domestic stock funds and shift cash into diversified foreign stock funds and emerging-markets funds.  <p> "The best investment opportunities arise when there is uncertainty," Isaacson says. One of his favorite spots is the Japanese stock market, which is down about 50 percent from its high. Diversified emerging-markets funds are also promising, Isaacson says. Data from Morningstar Mutual Funds examining 41 such funds shows them down more than 18 percent for the year ended October 31.  <p> Meanwhile, stock markets in recovering European economies have lagged behind the U.S. equities markets, with the average price-to-earnings ratio of European stocks about 22 percent below U.S. stocks. Isaacson thinks European stocks are poised to catch up in the next year or two. Asia also offers opportunities. While the U.S. economy is expected to grow at a moderate 2 percent to 3 percent in 1996, Isaacson says the Asian Tiger countries, including Malaysia, South Korea, and Hong Kong, will grow 6 to 8 percent, making them a good investment through 2000. "The greatest growth potential for the rest of this decade is outside the U.S.," says Isaacson. <p> He has been advising clients to put up to one third of their equity-fund portfolios into diversified foreign and emerging-market stock funds. Even conservative investors, he says, should put at least 10 percent of their assets into these funds. His two no-load favorites: <a name="FUND:WPIEX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/WPIEX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Warburg Pincus International Equity</b></a> and <a name="FUND:PPEEX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PPEEX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pierpont Emerging Market Equities</b></a>.  <p> Andrew Gluck is a Senior Writer at Worth.

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>CONVERTIBLES FROM THE TOP DOWN<p>By Jonathan Butler<p>If the market teaches anything, it's that nobody is infallible and that the prospect of rising returns carries the certainty of rising risk. Still, there is a way to get high yields and equity-like returns with relatively low risk--through the hybrid financial instruments called convertibles. Convertibles (the term covers convertible bonds and convertible preferred stocks) are securities that can be exchanged for a set number of shares of common stock. For example, the owner of Alaska Air 6.5 percent convertible bonds due in 2005 has the option to convert each bond into 46.5 shares of common stock. When they were issued at par on June 21, the common stock was trading at $17.63, making the conversion value of the convertible bonds $820.<p>According to Ibbotson Associates in Chicago, convertible bonds had annualized returns of 11.8 percent between 1973 and 1992, half a percentage point better than stocks and more than 2 points above bonds. <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> estimates all convertibles yielded the same 11.8 percent annually from 1988 through March of 1995. And a March 1995 Salomon Brothers study found that, since issuance, convertible securities have realized 118 percent of their underlying stocks' gains and only 50 percent of their losses.<p>While converts, as they're called, have grown more attractive to investors (between 1991 and 1994, the market value of outstanding convertible issues rose 44 percent), they are still the Rodney Dangerfields of asset classes. Brokers don't like them because they're complicated and illiquid. Wall Street firms don't like to spend a lot of time (and money) researching them because they're generally issued in relatively small amounts. Consultants and financial advisors shun them because they don't fit neatly into traditional asset-allocation models.<p>But since convertibles' returns do not correlate closely with those of stocks and bonds, they are an excellent way to diversify most portfolios. And despite the low credit ratings assigned to most of these securities (more than half are below investment grade), shifting money to them from stocks actually increases the security of a portfolio, because converts are higher in the capital structure--meaning they will be paid off before stocks in the event of bankruptcy. <p>Most convertibles yield 1 to 2 percent less than straight corporate bonds of the same maturity. Because they are exchangeable for common stock, convertibles move in the same direction as the underlying stock. They're usually less volatile, however, in their price swings: On average, convertibles match up to 70 percent of the common stock's price appreciation, but because the price of the convertible is unlikely to fall below its value as a fixed-income investment (called the investment value), convertibles rarely suffer more than 40 percent of a decline in the common stock. <p>This positive risk-reward relationship is known as favorable leverage. As a rule, unless the common stock goes up more than 40 percent over the life of the convertible, you're better off owning the convertible.<p>The downside protection of convertibles allows you to invest in a more speculative or volatile company with less risk. Let's say that back in September 1993 you wanted to invest in the technical-training company National Education but were nervous about the stock's recent slide. Instead of buying the stock, which at the time was at $6.75--down from over $30 five years earlier--you could have bought the 6.5 percent convertible bond due in 2011. This would have looked smarter in hindsight: While the stock fell 44 percent over the next 20 months, the convertible lost less than 10 percent of its value and, after factoring in its 9.25 percent current yield, turned in a flat total return over the period.<p>Most firms that analyze convertibles do so through models that estimate their potential upside and downside. For example, Value Line Convertibles Survey is currently recommending Air Express International's 6 percent convertible bonds, due in 2003. According to Value Line's calculations, the Air Express convert is a good bet because it should share in 80 percent of the common stock's rise but in only 38 percent of a drop. "This tilts the odds greatly in your favor," says Value Line convertibles research director Barry Nelson. <p>The Air Express converts are also attractive, says Nelson, because of their low conversion premium. This is the percentage by which the price of the convertible exceeds its conversion value, its value when converted into common stock. It usually reflects the convertible's yield advantage over the common stock. As a rule of thumb, the smaller the premium, the more closely the convertible tracks the movement of the stock. At 7 percent, Air Express's premium is far below the average convertible's premium of 30 percent. With the bond currently yielding about 5.5 percent (the mean for converts), the investor needs to hold on to the bond for just over a year to break even, assuming the stock remains flat.<p>In case this all sounds too good to be true, investors should keep in mind a couple of potential problems. First, most convertible bonds are callable: The company has the option to buy back the bonds at a fixed price after a set period of time, usually three years. The Air Express bonds, for example, are callable in January 1996 at 104.2. Since the bonds are currently trading at 110, the holder would give up the 5.8 point spread if the company called the bonds, earning only the coupon yield over the remaining months.<p>Only about a quarter of convertible bonds are called and redeemed for cash, however. "Most managements don't want to cough up the cash required to buy in the bonds," says Nelson. Instead, they prefer to have investors exchange bonds for stock, which they may do only when the conversion value is above the call price. In fact, most companies wait until the conversion value exceeds the call price by at least 20 percent to guard against the possibility of stock declines during the 30-day redemption period.<p>The ideal environment for converts is falling interest rates and rising stock prices. This meant double trouble  for the group in 1994, when Fed hikes and stagnant corporate profits gave the group its worst performance, down almost 4 percent, since 1987. But for the same reasons, converts, already up 7 percent this year, are a good bet right now, says Michael Rosen, manager of the Rochester Bond Fund for Growth.<p>Since converts are less liquid and less closely followed than stocks--only about a third of the converts in Value Line's 585-company universe of convertibles are listed on an exchange--they are often priced less efficiently. For example, the bid-ask spread (the difference between the price at which buyers are willing to buy and sellers are willing to sell) on California Microwave stock rarely gets wider than three quarters of a point. The convertible bonds (5.25 percent, due 2003), however, recently traded with a 5-point spread. This means that if you bought $10,000 of the convertibles one minute and wanted to turn around and sell them the next, you would have an immediate loss of $500.<p>Individual investors may have a hard time finding buyers and sellers of small lots and, as a result, will have to pay higher prices than the larger traders. For these reasons, unless you have a lot of time and money to devote to convertibles, experts recommend sticking with one of the 32 convertible mutual funds out there. But make sure you know what you're buying: Many funds own common stocks as well as converts.<p>

Worth magazine/Features<p>STOCKS ON TV
Something revolutionary may be going on here, but is this any way to get investment advice?<p>By Richard Todd<p>I wonder at what point in his career Louis Rukeyser, the host of the television show Wall Street Week, became aware of his growing resemblance to George Washington and began, with the fluffing of his silver hair, the downturning of his mouth, and the studied elongation of his face, to cultivate this image. In any case, the transformation is now complete, and Rukeyser could easily take his place on the dollar bill, making him, as one senses he would like to be, perfectly emblematic of money.<p>Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser (its proper name) is TV's oldest money show, and for a long while it was virtually alone in covering the financial world. This year it celebrated its 25th annual new year's party, a look at the year that was, with Rukeyser and guests in black tie, none more splendid than the host himself.<p>But how long can this elegance continue? Business broadcast journalism is changing fast, and thanks to the miracles of cable and satellite you can now watch something about finance 24 hours a day. PBS offers not only Wall Street Week but Adam Smith and the business-news show Nightly Business Report. These are somewhat staid shows; the pace quickens when you turn to CNN--with its daily Moneyline and Business Day and Your Money (along with its own weekend wrap-up, Money Week) and coverage of the markets throughout the day. Then there is CNBC, which from dawn well into the evening devotes most of its odd mix of programming to business and keeps a blue line of stock quotations running across the bottom of the screen. For total immersion you go to the hyperkinetic Bloomberg channel, broadcasting around-the-clock worldwide financial intelligence.<p>I have been spending a lot of time before the screen lately, and there may well be something revolutionary going on here, but it seems important to issue one caveat. This new surge of reporting is "journalism" of a very gentle sort. It is relentlessly uncritical. Television news grows out of newspaper traditions, and the financial pages have traditionally been among the meekest in the paper. Somehow, publishers have always been more sensitive to the feelings of the president of the local department store than to those of the president of the United States. When this docile enterprise takes to the airwaves, the result is more theater than investigation. One can't, in any case, look to anything on television for adversarial coverage of business. It's like expecting an astrologer to criticize the stars. And in all fairness, that doesn't seem to be what most viewers are after.<p>Coziness with the subject has been one of the hallmarks of Wall Street Week. The show still commands great loyalty from its viewers, 8 million to 10 million of them, though they may as a group be aging more or less in step with their veteran host.The fascination Rukeyser holds for viewers, the way in which he serves as some sort of icon, remains one of those enticing little mysteries of popular culture. Rukeyser is famously overbearing and smug, in persona anyway--he's doubtless a lapdog at home. The persona must be at least part of his appeal. After all, he and his viewers aren't married to each other; people can't have stuck with him all these years despite his attitude.<p>The show has become ritualistic, beginning with a monologue from Rukeyser in which he reviews the week's news in tones of high contempt. Rukeyser is the only performer I can think of who actually sniffs in disdain. These performances are distinguished by his Tourette's-like compulsion to pun his way through loonily extended metaphors. <p>On Super Bowl weekend he went through a dozen or so football analogies. "Nickel back--in the stock market, that's what you get for each thousand dollars you were foolish enough to invest in the Elliott Wave Theory. The retailers and automakers are claiming unnecessary roughness, and many of the nation's credit card chargers are limping off the field." Later in the show Rukeyser took questions from viewers; one wrote inquiring about nursing-home stocks, and Rukeyser ended the segment by saying, "If your personal finances could use some of that tender loving care, we'd be happy to help you nurse them along. So don't be a pill; if you think you're getting the fever, just press the buzzer for one of our angels of financial mercy here at Wall Street Week."<p>Right. You feel a little bit as if you're laughing at the boss's jokes during these shows. I had ouched and grimaced my way through a number of these moments before I got the basic idea. We're invited to appreciate more than the cleverness of our host. It's an entire attitude--sportif--toward money that Rukeyser offers. <p>Here is a basic principle of money shows on television, which I think Rukeyser pioneered: They never involve the suggestion that money could actually be, well, sort of a problem. It is instead the object of a grand game. Everyone on the show, God knows, has a lot of it, and the viewer is invited to pretend that he or she does, too. One of Rukeyser's recent guests, pension fund manager George F. Russell Jr., remarked of age-appropriate investment strategies, "My grandson is 100 percent in equities, and my 86-year-old mom is 90 percent in T bills." <p>The drawing-room tone that Rukeyser maintains begins to seem kind of odd if you think seriously about the venue--television's leveling demographics mean that not everyone in the audience can have children with portfolios. Indeed, you would imagine that a number of people, in a nation that tends to live from paycheck to paycheck, might tune into this show and want to throw a brick through their screen, so distant is the program's sense of reality from the one they daily inhabit. But you can often go awry expecting people to act on their class interests in our country--it's a constant wonder, our belief in the possibility of the sudden rise that makes most Americans indulge their betters. Wall Street Week plugs right in to these cultural conditions, and what it provides is a feeling of clubbiness. Even the information it imparts comes this way, conversationally, allusively, and I'm happy to have it. To be perfectly candid, you have to sit around my dinner table for a very long time before someone will bring up the Elliott Wave Theory. For that I have to go to the table of Mr. Rukeyser.<p>Wall Street Week's rival for pride of place among long-running, influential money shows is Adam Smith's weekly production. Smith is actually Jerry Goodman, a onetime fund manager who started writing under a pseudonym, got more famous than he expected, and is stuck with his act. We are what we pretend to be. Smith earned a reputation for colorfulness, if not irreverence, in his early days as a print journalist, but now he is very reverent indeed toward the establishment he reports on.<p>The virtues of the Smith show start with his relatively self-effacing style, which leads to general liveliness. Also, the show is lavishly produced, with on-camera jaunts around the world and lots of graphics when there's no place to go. And most important, because of years in the trade and his ability to sound saucy but be nice, he has access as good as anybody's in business journalism. Thus his old friend Warren Buffett sits still for a long and quite charming interview in which the reputation of America's favorite billionaire investor is polished like an old fire engine. Smith has also recently interviewed the secretary general of the United Nations, the president of the <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford Motor Co.</b></a>, and the former prime minister of France; he tends to go to the top. <p>Smith got his start in journalism in the 1960s at New York magazine, with jaunty pieces that became his first book, The Money Game. The pieces featured fictive characters whose doings made sense of the obscure world of finance. International crisis? Blame the "gnomes of Zurich." Business was far more faceless then, and Smith provided personality. He still does, and the show is at its best when it's got a strong figure to present. <p>When the subject can't be so easily personified, Smith gets into difficulty, chiefly because he tries to do so anyway. Recently he took on the not inconsiderable burden of explaining derivatives to his audience. Presumably the audience included some people who already understood derivatives, but I think they were in danger of unknowing by the end. This was a confusing show, which illustrates another truth about finance on television: It's hard to explain anything.<p>Smith's gambit was to call the derivatives experts "rocket scientists." "Well, I think some people have used that term," said one of the interviewees, the genial David Shaw of D.E. Shaw & Co., "but I certainly wouldn't know how to get a rocket in orbit myself."<p>The show featured no fewer than half a dozen film clips and graphics of rocket liftoffs, along with a couple of shots of falling dominoes (to illustrate the domino effect) and some interesting miscellany: a clip from a Frankenstein movie and a square-dancing sequence.<p>I was probably a bad viewer; being literal-minded, when I see a picture of square dancers, I think that that's the subject, and I was watching the delicate way the old coots held their hands and almost missed Smith's explanation of why derivative trading resembled this venerable American custom. Then I realized he was talking about "swaps," just like changing partners. Oh. <p>Later I began wondering why financial questions of any complexity seem so damnably hard to get at on television. I'm not sure it's entirely the medium's fault, though linear thought of all kinds has had a notoriously bad time of it on TV. Directors and producers worry constantly about the boring presence of the "talking head." But sometimes the talking head is just what you need, particularly when you're talking about something that can't be illustrated because it can't be seen. We tend to forget that money and its instruments are themselves symbols, a language invented to represent wealth, and that by the time we get to square dances and derivatives we have symbols of symbols of symbols of symbols. Maybe you could find a good metaphor for derivatives in television programming about money: Each is a game based on what happens in another game.<p>In any case, Adam Smith is your man for entertaining scenes from current business, but not for analysis. Then again, analysis doesn't appear to be the wave of the future. The wave of the future is information, and we want our information now.<p>To my mind, the best business-news show on television is the Nightly Business Report, also a product of PBS. If this program were a person, its virtues would be self-awareness, a sense of focus and limits. It's got a mission and sticks to it--a sensible ordering of the day's financial news, a summary of the markets, major corporate developments, personnel changes, along with a nightly feature story or two, generally involving an interview keyed to the news. This is the closest television comes to rendering tomorrow's financial pages.<p>Something good happens at the subliminal level on the Nightly Business Report, which began in 1979 but enjoyed a major reformatting four years ago. A certain genius went into the casting of the show, which features Paul Kangas, broadcasting from Miami, where the show was created, and his young co-anchor, Cassie Seifert, in New York. Kangas, a former stockbroker, handles the market analysis, and he has the lingual talents of an auctioneer, which makes listening to the numbers easy. Seifert does the newsier side.<p>This is a Dan and Connie team that works. They unite the generations. Kangas is 57 and looks the way 57-year-old people used to look, unapologetic of girth and jowl, hearty of manner. ("Wishing you the best of good buys" is his corny closure.) Seifert, who's 32, is one of those post-yuppies who seem determined to transcend their age, or at least not be like the hectic, edgy generation that preceded them. With her Breck-girl hair, she could be a reincarnated spirit of the 1940s. There's a charmingly old-fashioned but competent quality to the two of them; you can picture them as a father-daughter team running a fabulously successful financial-services firm in Ohio. <p>The show has also achieved good access in the corporate world, with, to be sure, the usual price. I recently saw a Nightly Business Report interview with Louis Gerstner, the <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> chairman, that couldn't have been cozier. The show's reporter asked softball questions to which Gerstner gave winningly real-guy answers. <p>"Is it time to call the restructuring a success?"<p>"Well, it's time to say that it really is taking hold. We said to the analysts early on [we had to] keep getting our gross margins to stop declining, to lower our expenses, and finally get revenues growing. And now all three are kicking in."<p>This was a reasonable exchange, a couple of guys talking about problem solving: We gotta spend less and make more! I too was feeling sort of buddyish with the shirt-sleeved Gerstner, having to remind myself that this fellow had gotten rid of 35,000 people, that there are things about his life I couldn't begin to know, that he is unimaginably powerful--and yet he was strangely miniaturized by this powerful medium. <p>By contrast to the Nightly Business Report, CNN's daily coverage of business, though more extensive, seems rather pale. CNN is, of course, on morning, noon, and night with business news, along with sports, politics, entertainment, and whatever comes along to fill the time. The network's flagship money show is Moneyline with Lou Dobbs, supplemented by the morning show Business Day, with various shorter financial segments during news programming. The CNN business correspondents--Dobbs, Stuart Varney, Deborah Marchini, the commentator Myron Kandel--have about them that melancholy look that seems to haunt so many CNN announcers, an air of small but inescapable tragedy: no date tonight, no date tomorrow.<p>Perhaps what CNN needs is a good financial crisis analogous to Desert Storm or the O.J. Simpson trial, some sort of meltdown of the Hang Seng with the crisis rolling across the time zones and a Wolf Blitzer in every panicked market--now a devaluation of the pound, now German banks failing like lemonade stands. God forbid, I know, but this would doubtless be the making of CNN business. <p>But for the moment CNN earns the faint praise of our age: It's there for you. <p>CNBC takes it to another level. For years before there was cable television, there was the dream of cable, "the wired nation" and all sorts of fanciful predictions about the glories we would see--but no one could have quite predicted the Nashville Network, or QVC, or the Golf Channel--or CNBC. CNBC advertises itself as "First in business, first in talk," signaling its bizarre mix of daylong business news and the likes of Geraldo Rivera and Charles Grodin and Phil Donahue by night. Whatever merriment goes on in the evening, from 5:30 a.m., with Before the Bell, for the next 15 hours, CNBC is all business, ending with Money Tonight. The network has just added a new personal-finance program promisingly called The Money Club.
CNBC does interviews on its noontime show Inside Opinion and corporate news on Today's Business--but the thrust of the programming is to keep the viewer as close to the markets as possible. During trading hours a ticker runs across the bottom of the CNBC screen continually, with quotations from both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. <p>Almost every money show on television at one moment or other talks about stock picks, by soliciting the views of experts, but on CNBC this is the meat and potatoes of daytime programming. Twice each day the channel's master tout, Dan Dorfman, appears live with freshly gathered intelligence on individual stocks, and these segments are repeated from time to time. Dorfman, like Adam Smith, got his start as a print journalist; he has worked for the Wall Street Journal and USA Today and contributes to Money magazine. He brings a city-room style to the game; I guess he doesn't actually chomp on a cigar, but that's the effect. The whole concept here is that he's just off the phone with a source, what he's got is hot. The length of these segments seems determined by Dorfman's lung capacity--he sounds as if he's delivering his message at a dead run.<p>My favorite players on CNBC strike a more contemporary note--they're among the varying cast of young guest stars on the feature called Buy, Sell or Hold, analysts and managers such as Liam Dalton, David Katz, and Jim Awad. <p>The format couldn't be simpler--sort of a televised radio talk show, with callers seeking advice on stocks, moderated by a CNBC staffer, most notably the friendly, lip-glossy Sue Herera.<p>"Let's go to Alabama next, and Craig is on the line." <p>"Sue, we really enjoy your show."<p>"Thanks for watching." <p>And then the caller turns to the guest advisor for his opinion on one stock or another: Buy, sell, or hold? And invariably the fellow with the baby face and the good suit knows everything about the stock!<p> <a name="NYSE:MLT"></a><b> Mitel</b>, <a name="NASD:AMGN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12623"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Amgen</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:HUM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10756"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Humana</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:WH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Whitman</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:CCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10345"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Citicorp.</b></a> Buy, sell, or hold?<p>"Middle of an up move tax-loss bounce candidate was at eight and an eighth 18 months ago... could go to 45, showing some topping action can only give it a hold." <p>These guys are amazing.

Listening to Liam Dalton one day, I had the feeling that if I called in to ask his view of Keats, buy, sell, or hold, he'd quote a few lines from "Ode on a Grecian Urn," point out that the Romantics were due for a cyclical recovery, and suggest I buy. <p>Anyway: Smart guys. They're smart. It's not clear that I am any smarter having listened to them. <p>This is, after all, a very odd way to get investment advice: rapid-fire from someone you don't know, who's giving the same wisdom to hundreds of thousands of other people who are sitting at home diddling with their portfolios.<p>But I may miss the point. <p>CNBC provides a more electric, up-to-the-minute sense of belonging, of playing the great game, than you can ever get by luxuriating around Louis Rukeyser's conference table. It's the sense that everything is possible, the rush of the market coming right into your living room. This is the sheer joy of information for information's sake. <p>Knowledge is power, or so say the powerful. But information--information is something else again. I am beginning to think it is more like a drug--the opiate of the moneyed masses, the curse of the investing class. I seriously doubt that Warren Buffett receives--or wants to--as much sheer information as is available daily to the viewer surfing from CNN to PBS to CNBC to--the state of the art in raw information delivery--Bloomberg TV.<p>I'm sure it will get better than this--soon they will be able to hook up Quotron electrodes into your skull as you sleep, or Chicago commodities prices will be broadcast into your bathroom mirror, or your car won't start if London gold falls below $369. (Don't leave home until you sell those mining stocks.) But for the moment, what we have is Bloomberg, and it's pretty good. <p>The Bloomberg channel is the latest venture of Michael Bloomberg, the former Salomon Brothers trader whose second fortune rests on the financial data terminals he invented, called "Bloombergs." He's into self-eponymizing. There is also Bloomberg, "a magazine for Bloomberg users," and Bloomberg radio. <p>Bloomberg television features a distinctive format that doesn't depend on any technical breakthrough, just a kind of courage. It pushes split-screen technology to the edge. At any moment you are apt to be watching five or six different panels. Up in the upper right-hand corner sits a hapless, often rather disheveled announcer who seems to be trying to shout above the silent roar of information on the screen.<p>This is all stuff that's doubtless good to know. Within any couple of moments, you might learn the price of light, sweet crude in New York; the America's Cup trial standings; the most active stocks on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the closing Straits Times index in Singapore; the prices of May bellies and December beans; the ten most popular names (in America) for boys; the ten most popular names for girls; how many points Shaq is averaging per game; the Paris CAC index; and the good news that it's 13 minutes till the Idaho ski report appears. <p>The Bloomberg screen has what at first seems a liability, until you realize that this is the heart of its genius: It is physically impossible for the brain to register all the information that appears at any one time. For a certain kind of viewer, for the information junkie, this is pure heaven.<p>It can be disconcerting at first. The way the human mind used to work--I truly think this era may be passing--we would, when confronted with a variety of information, try to make sense of it. Make a list, prioritize, organize into a narrative. Try to answer the basic question: Why are they telling me this stuff, anyway?
But the question has no answer. Forget it. They're telling you because they know. They're telling because if they didn't the screen would be empty.<p>Let it happen to you. I occasionally turn to Bloomberg just for the pleasure of it. I let the information wash over me, picking up a fragment here and there, perhaps, despite myself, trying to puzzle it out. Maybe jodhpur sales are up in Japan, French girls are being named Marie again, cellular phone stocks were off in Sydney yesterday (or was it tomorrow?)--isn't there a play here somewhere? But no, mostly I just enjoy the rush of information past my skin. You might as well try to make sense of the surf itself. <p>------------------------------------<p>DISCLAIMING STOCK ADVICE<p>By Jonathan Butler<p>The remote control has become a new investment tool: At just about any hour of the day, TV viewers can now tune in to a diverse menu of financial advice. The question is, is any of it good?<p>While most financial programs are eager to dispense endless stock tips, they are equally anxious to avoid any association with the actual recommendations. This applies to shows on CNBC, CNN, and PBS. A spokesperson for PBS's Adam Smith says, "We're not in the business of selling stocks. If any guest offers advice, it's his opinion." Says Louis Rukeyser: "I have never recommended or disrecommended any security, and I have always been at pains to remind our viewers that nothing is endorsed by the management, meaning me." The bottom line? Guests pick stocks. Hosts don't.<p>The guests are usually recognizable specialists from the securities industry. Yet even so, they're not always right. As Dan Dorfman recently said on CNBC, "The pros I quote are not infallible." <p>Some programs issue disclaimers that pop up on the screen at show's end. On CNBC's Buy, Sell or Hold, it's this: "The investment and stock advice given in this segment is from our guest and not from CNBC." Other programs don't bother. "Since CNN does not make recommendations, CNN does not feel it is necessary to issue a disclaimer,'' says spokeswoman Karen Kemp.<p>Disclaimers may suggest good intent by management, but they wouldn't necessarily hold up in a court of law. "If somebody sits there talking falsities for five minutes and then there's a disclaimer, that doesn't wipe--both the guests and show can be sued,'' says Alexander Greenfeld, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in libel. The First Amendment covers the right of someone to state an opinion, including whether a stock will go up or down, and securities law gives people the right to issue information. Trouble begins if a guest knowingly gives false advice, has an undisclosed financial stake in the recommendation, or acts "with reckless disregard for the truth," says Greenfeld. (According to the shows and to lawyers questioned, no financial talk show has been sued to date. Factual errors are often corrected on air.)<p>Most shows say they don't track the performance of their guests' recommendations. Bloomberg examined the stock picks Dan Dorfman made during a single month (March 1992) and found that they returned an average of 21.4 percent over the next 12 months, more than double the Standard & Poor's 500's return of 9.5 percent during that period. Norman Fosback, publisher of the Fort Lauderdale based Mutual Fund Weekly, surveyed nearly 2,000 stocks recommended on Wall Street Week between 1980 and 1992 and concluded that they barely underperformed the Dow if sold 12 months after their mention.<p>Rukeyser dismisses Fosback's survey as phony and accuses the newsletter writer, whom he won't refer to by name, of "smearing his betters." Rukeyser's own survey--on the securities picked by his 23 new year's panelists from 1989 to 1993 and "sold'' 12 months later? Considerably rosier, beating the Dow by three percentage points.<p><p>

						By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>
If asked to select just one tool for evaluating a stock, most securities analysts undoubtedly would choose the price-to-earnings ratio--the number you get by dividing a company's share price by its profit or net income per share.<p>
The p/e, also known as the multiple, gives investors a single number that allows them to compare the values of stock prices. The higher a stock's p/e, the more investors are paying to share in that company's profits.<p>
Price-to-earnings ratios are driven, to a large degree, by earnings expectations. If investors are highly confident a company will improve its profitability or remain profitable, they are usually willing to pay more for its shares, raising the p/e. If profits are threatened or weak, the p/e will probably drop as investors demand compensation for the risk of disappointing returns. <p>
Price-to-earnings ratios also depend on how stocks compare with other investment opportunities. For instance, p/e's generally fall when interest rates rise, because bonds, CDs, and other fixed-income investments yield more and so become more attractive.<p>
Analysts use different p/e ratios to gauge a company's prospects. There's trailing p/e, which is the stock's current price divided by the company's reported earnings per share for the most recent four quarters. This is the most widely quoted figure in newspaper stock listings. It reflects actual results, as opposed to estimated, or forward, p/e, which is arrived at by dividing a stock's current price by analysts' forecasts of earnings per share for the next four quarters. <p>
These two numbers may vary widely. Consider the current share price of Oxford Health Plans, a managed-care company in Darien, Connecticut. Based on trailing earnings for the year ending 1994, this company has a p/e of 54, compared with 17 for the average stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. The stock's forward p/e, however, is 35. Is the stock way overpriced, slightly ahead of itself, or accurately priced? Often, the answer depends largely on the attitude of the analyst or investor toward Oxford's prospects. The forward p/e is often used by brokers pushing a particular stock.<p>
The price-to-earnings ratio also allows an investor to analyze a stock's valuation on a historical basis. Divide the stock's p/e by the p/e of the overall market; that's the relative p/e. Compare this with the stock's relative p/e over the past five to ten years. When a stock is trading below its historical relative p/e, that's often a sign that it's a cheap buy.<p>
Rick Pucci, director of research for IBES, a stock-research firm in New York City, says, "Investors can get a more accurate gauge of how expensive a particular stock is by comparing its p/e with that of other similar companies in the same industry." Also, Pucci notes, "for cyclical companies, there's the opposite effect." Such firms--producers of machine tools, cars, and steel--generally reach their highest p/e's when earnings have struck bottom and investors believe the business cycle is about to turn around, raising profits. <p>

						Your broker may not show you the best buys in small-cap stocks. Here's how to find them yourself.  <p> By Gretchen Morgenson  <p> There is a very good chance that the stocks of smaller companies will be profitable for investors in 1995. Large-capitalization stocks were investors' choice last year, when they showed big earnings growth. Because small caps--those with market capitalizations of $100 million or less--tend to lag big caps, this could be their year.   <p> But will your broker, the person you rely on for many of your stock market ideas, tell you about the best bargains in small caps? Perhaps not.  <p> Not that there's some conspiracy at work. It's just that the high-paid research drones of Wall Street tend to shun fine companies. The reasons for this mostly have to do with--surprise--money.  <p> Start with corporate-finance work. Brokerage firms are attracted to companies that need to raise cash, because the firms get paid to help such outfits float additional equity or issue new debt. A positive research report on a potential customer can make the difference between winning and losing this business. It's not exactly quid pro quo--it's just how things work.  <p> Another huge source of profits for Wall Street is over-the-counter trading operations. It is here that firms make markets in Nasdaq stocks. Most Nasdaq stocks carry higher spreads than those shares listed on the New York or the American stock exchanges; those hefty spreads--the difference between what investors get when they sell shares and what they pay to buy--go directly into the brokerage's pocket. This is why Wall Street firms are much more willing to tout the OTC stocks they make markets in than recommend listed shares of small, obscure companies.   <p> Then there are the fees a firm can make providing so-called executive services to corporate chiefs. These include selling insiders' shares on the open market or allowing insiders to borrow against restricted stock held in their name at the brokerage. All profitable reasons to keep relations with the company smooth. Upbeat research reports help.  <p> Recent shrinkage in Wall Street firms has also reduced the numbers of analysts; those that remain feel compelled to cover mainstream companies. And, oddly enough, research analysts at some firms never taste their own cooking. They choose not to invest their money in stocks they recommend or in equities of any kind. A broker at a major firm who handles many analysts' accounts says, "I think it's outrageous they don't put their money where their mouths are."  <p> What's this all add up to? Individual investors are likely to hear only about stocks that Wall Street must recommend--the big household names, for example--or that a firm feels chummy with. That leaves a lot of respectable stocks out in the cold.  <p> Investors have to track them down alone. The few research boutiques that specialize in digging up Wall Street's buried treasures usually report their findings to institutional investors, such as money managers or fund chiefs. They get paid for their work by executing these institutions' trades.  <p> Michael Reisert, president of J.M.R. Inc. in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, specializes in uncovering unknown companies. "I always look for something that's misunderstood by Wall Street, a hook," he says. "Something that will happen in the future that will make a company's earnings come on."  <p> Investors who want to go solo in small-cap stocks should begin by identifying trends with staying power. Then, figure out the best ways to play those trends.   <p> For instance, radio is in a renaissance; talk radio is the rage and industry ad revenues are rising. Since most radio stocks trade at 12 times cash flow, the trick is to spot a company that's cheaper than the rest (and doesn't deserve to be). Another example: Surging truck sales are creating a bull market for suppliers to the big diesel makers. Instead of buying Consolidated Freightways, look for a lesser-known company that will benefit from truckmakers' growing needs.   <p> Once you've identified an appealing industry, narrow the field. There are several characteristics Reisert and others like him look for before they feel comfortable investing in a company. These include:  <p> Large ownership by management. Top management should own at least one quarter of the company themselves. That way, their motivations are the same as yours. Check the proxy statement. <p> Little or no debt and little need for fresh capital. Debt-to-equity ratios shouldn't exceed 15 percent, or else the company's growth could be sidetracked by the need to service borrowings. Raising new capital dilutes the holdings of existing investors. Calculate debt-to-equity by dividing the company's total liabilities by its shareholder equity.  <p> A management that can verbalize its plan for the future. The company must be able to articulate a credible business plan for at least the next two years. Small-company managements are usually more available to discuss plans with investors; if they're unwilling, look elsewhere.  <p> A product or system that's difficult to replicate or as close to being unique as possible. You don't want to invest in a me-too company; you want a specialist.  <p> Little or no institutional ownership. Your goal: To own a stock before institutions spot it. Therefore, less than 10 percent of a stock should be held by institutions now. (A company spokesman can tell you this figure.) As the company increases its market value into the mid-cap range--to $100 million or more--it will begin to hit institutions' radars. When the bigs start buying, think about selling.  <p> Some companies that meet these criteria, according to small-cap specialists:   <p> <a name="ASE:GNK"></a><b>Globalink</b> (ASE: GNK, $15) produces language-translation software for use on personal computers; translations are 90 percent grammatically correct. Competitors produce gear only for mainframes. Sales rose 90 percent in the first three quarters of 1994.   <p> <a name="ASE:NTN"></a><b>NTN Communications</b> (ASE: NTN, $6.50) is an interactive TV network producing sports-related and trivia game shows. Balance sheet is virtually debt free; revenues rose 52 percent in first nine months of '94.   <p> <a name="ASE:PLX"></a><b>Plains Resources</b> (ASE: PLX, $5.75), an oil-exploration concern with a book value around $10 a share, has one of the few oil-storage facilities up to environmental code in Cushing, Oklahoma, through which all Gulf of Mexico oil must pass. Debt is a bit higher than the other stocks here, but operating management has nearly its entire net worth invested in the company.   <p> <a name="OTC:PRNI"></a><b>Premiere Radio Networks</b> (OTC: PRNI, $7), the fourth-largest U.S. syndicator of radio programming, has low debt and trades at eight times cash flow. Management owns two thirds of the company; institutions own under 8 percent. The cheapest play on radio.  <p> <a name="OTC:WMCO"></a><b>Williams Controls'</b> (OTC: WMCO, $3.50) earnings are growing 50 percent a year; the stock trades at 12 times earnings. The company makes digital throttles that diesels need to meet Clean Air Act standards.   <p><p>

 THE ORACLE OF THE BOND MARKET 
<p>
Learning how to read the all-important yield curve  
<p>
 By Manjeet Kripalani  
<p>
 What's the best move for an investor who wants to buy a bond?
Is it better to snap up bonds that offer higher yields but mature
over longer horizons? Or would it be smarter to settle for a
lower rate on one that pays you back faster?  
<p>
 You could ask your broker or money manager for help in answering
this question. Or you could do as the pros do and divine where
to stash your cash yourself with the help of the yield curve.
Understanding this tool and how it works can help you make the
best choice in buying bonds 긆ne that provides the optimum combination
of yield and maturity.  
<p>
 Those who know how to look at the curve and read its meaning
also can glean information important to all investors. For the
yield curve is the bond market's oracle: It tells how the bond
market views the future at any given moment.  
<p>
 The yield curve is actually the name for a simple line on a
graph that plots the interest rate paid by bonds of similar types
but different maturities. There are many yield curves, but the
most widely followed is the one for Treasury debt, which lists
three-month bills to 30-year bonds. The horizontal axis of the
graph measures the length of time until each bond matures. The
vertical axis, meanwhile, measures the yield of each bond. The
higher the points on the line, the greater the interest paid
by the bond.  
<p>
 Normally, the line slopes upward. That's because longer-term
investments (the ones plotted on the right side of the graph)
carry more risk and thus must pay higher rates of interest as
compensation. In the case of Treasurys, which are guaranteed
by the U.S. government, the primary risk is inflation, which
reduces the worth of a bond's coupon payments as well as its
eventual redemption value.  
<p>
 Occasionally, the curve slopes downward and is said to be inverted.
Such an event took place in 1981, when short-term yields approached
20 percent but 30-year bonds yielded only 14 percent. This inversion
occurred primarily because the market believed the long-term
risk of inflation was much less than the short-term threat. The
last time this happened was 1989.  
<p>
 When both short- and long-term interest rates are roughly the
same, the curve is said to be flat. That is how most of the line
looked when we began the new year (see below). Two-year Treasurys
yielded 7.63 percent, 30-year bonds 7.86 percent. That's a tiny
spread, and it means that the market currently sees little difference
between the short- and the long-term risks of inflation. So investors
who buy longer-term bonds currently receive only a slight premium.<p>
<p>
 A year ago, the spread between the 2-year note and the 30-year
bond was over two full percentage points, or 200 basis points.
The spread between the 3-month bill and the 30-year bond exceeded
300 basis points. Thus, the yield curve looked much different:
sloping more steeply.   
<p>
 But then an overheated economy and inflation fears caused Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan to become alarmed. To cool things
down, the Fed moved to increase short-term interest rates, making
borrowing more expensive for consumers and businesses. The Fed
hiked rates six times in 1994, starting in February. Yields on
the 3-month Treasury bill jumped to 6 percent from 3.03 percent,
and the long bond went from 6.23 percent to around 7.86 percent
in a year. This is what gave us the predominantly flat curve
we had in January.  
<p>
 Notice, however, that the January yield curve has a bend between
the two- and three-year maturity mark. This is called a shoulder,
the place where the curve turns from steep to flat. Typically,
the shoulder is where investors can find the ideal combination
of the highest yield with the least maturity. "The curve is cheap
just now for short maturities," said Rich Suttmeier, yield strategist
at Smith Barney, earlier this year. Two-year and three-year notes
were thus smart buys.  
<p>
 The curve changes daily, of course, as investors trade billions
of dollars worth of Treasurys. What will the curve resemble in
the coming months? That depends largely on the prospects for
inflation.  
<p>
 When the curve is mostly flat, as it is now, another effective
strategy is to buy at both ends of the line. "It's the barbell
effect귿eavy on two ends," says Ashok Varikooty, Treasury strategist
at First Boston. The effect allows for what essentially is a
hedging tactic. By buying both of the ends, short and long, investors
can ensure that their total bond holdings will remain balanced
whatever happens with interest rates in the future.  
<p>
 The yield curve can be especially valuable for longer-term investors.
Those with shorter time horizons should place more emphasis on
their own needs. For instance, someone who plans to cash in a
bond in three years for a down payment on a home should buy one
with an equivalent maturity. That way, the home buyer will know
exactly what to expect upon redemption of the bond.   
<p>
 The other option, buying a bond with the intention of selling
it on the open market prior to redemption, carries an additional
level of risk긊he threat that interest rates will rise and undercut
the underlying value of the bond. Of course, rates could drop
and produce a nifty profit. But such speculation is chancy. The
bond markets are probably the most efficient in the world긄eaning
that at any given moment the probability that rates will rise
or fall are equal.  
<p>
 The yield curve is published every day in Investor's Business
Daily and The Wall Street Journal. Buy Treasurys through a mutual
fund, a broker, a bank, or a commission-free government program
called Treasury Direct. For information, call (202) 874-4000,
or write Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt,
Washington, D.C. 20239. An account will be opened in your name,
and you'll be given an auction schedule.

Worth magazine/Feature<p>THE GREAT BOND CAPER
How did the biggest-ever bank heist become linked with a bunch of small-timers in a seedy New York neighborhood? Well, it all started when Anthony Lama  tried to get two bookies off his back ...<p>By Christopher Byron<p>At the Seaview Diner in South Brooklyn, the ambience has more flavor than the food. Neither could be called four-star -- but in hard-bitten Canarsie, New York, charm is a relative thing.<p>Just steps from the windswept marshes of Jamaica Bay, the Seaview is a leatherette haven from the dank projects and embattled row houses outside. There's calamari and fried peppers, and Mr. Sinatra will fly you to the moon for a couple of quarters in the jukebox -- a nice distraction from the corner boys who hassle old women in the neighborhood.<p>Canarsie is graffiti and intimidation, discount shoes and chop shops. There's no such thing as easy money in this neighborhood; Wall Street's canyons aren't visible from here, and they might as well be a million miles away. Canarsie's major contact with international commerce comes in the scream of transatlantic jets making their final approach to the runways of John F. Kennedy Airport.<p>Yet it was here in Canarsie that the seeds were sown for what might be called the great bond caper. Linking huge robberies in Wall Street and the City of London, it became a wild ride through the world of high finance that would eventually involve a bloody murder, a hoard of famous paintings, international terrorists, and several hundred pieces of paper each worth more than $1.5 million.<p>Five years later a criminal probe into the caper has stalled, and mystery still shrouds the most spectacular element: the largest unsolved robbery in history, a half-billion-dollar heist of notes issued by the Bank of England.<p>On a late winter's day in Canarsie in 1989, however, all of that still lay in the future. This yarn, much of which has never been told before, started more modestly here in the Seaview, as two local bookies convened in a well-worn booth to put some pressure on a man who owed them a gambling debt.<p><p>The heavies were straight from central casting. One was named Robert Rosenfeld, at 230 pounds a hulking meat slab of a man. His partner was Ted Ballison, a Brooklyn gym teacher who flashed around town in a Jaguar equipped with a cellular phone. The man sitting opposite them was Anthony Lama, a back-office clerk who was having trouble making his vigorish -- the interest on his gambling debt, which now ran to $350 a week.<p>Lama was a likable but not terribly bright young fellow. After graduating in 1972 from Xavierian High School in Brooklyn with a mediocre record, he had dropped out of community college. He managed a local Baskin Robbins ice cream shop before starting as a bank clerk for $7,500 a year. Then a friend offered to get Lama a Wall Street job -- working at Salomon Brothers for $12,000 a year.<p>Dazzled by the salary and prestige, Lama leaped at the chance. And according to his personnel file, Salomon's new hire turned out to be conscientious and hardworking. His job was to help log all the bonds that Salomon traders bought and sold for clients each day. Trading in such securities is done on computers, of course. But when a transaction is completed, an actual piece of paper usually changes hands. That's what Lama did for Solly: He kept the paper moving.<p>In the 1980s, few firms on Wall Street were more important in the bond market than Salomon; its expertise helped fuel that decade's debt explosion. And like the rest of America, those in Salomon's back office weren't immune from this cult of leverage. Though Lama's salary rose steadily to reach $20,300 plus bonus in 1985, his debts rose even faster. According to an investigator's report prepared for Salomon, Lama owed more than $10,000 on his Citicorp credit cards and another $1,000 to <a name="NYSE:AXP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10085"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Express</b></a>. He also owed $6,000 on an auto loan and had unpaid bills at stores including Macy's and Sterns.<p>To climb out of his hole, Lama turned to gambling. A friend introduced him to Rosenfeld and Ballison around this time, and Lama started betting with the bookies. He didn't do well. In fact, by Thanksgiving of 1987 Lama had declared bankruptcy. And though he neglected to list it on his Chapter Seven decree, his most crushing burden was to Rosenfeld and Ballison. According to FBI records, Lama owed the sharks $20,000 -- nearly a full year's salary.<p>Depositions, affidavits, and pleas in a subsequent criminal investigation detail what followed. The bookies offered Lama a deal: He could pay off his debt by borrowing the $20,000 from them at 3 percent a week. Cornered, his credit destroyed, Lama felt that he had little choice. And for a while, he was actually able to make his interest payments.<p>But Lama had become addicted to gambling, and, incredibly, he kept on betting with his new bankers. As a result, despite scraping up $17,000 for Rosenfeld and Ballison from friends and family, Lama soon owed the bookies $15,000 all over again. By year's end 1988, the clerk was ducking phone calls from his creditors on a regular basis.<p>Finally, in February of 1989, the bookies caught up with him. In a sit-down at one of the Seaview's formica tables, Lama agreed to resume paying vigorish at a reduced $200 a week. But he stopped again almost immediately. And so, when the three men sat down again at the Seaview a few weeks later, there was no deal on the menu. According to Lama's statements to the FBI, Rosenfeld and Ballison began threatening to harm his family. It was time to make good on his debt, they said. To drive the point home, Lama told the feds, Rosenfeld pulled back his suit jacket to reveal a holstered revolver. The bookies deny that any threats were made.<p>In any case, what happened next would change the lives of many people, from a high-living Houston businessman to an undercover agent to a motley crew of figures from England's underworld. None of these dubious characters ever met Tony Lama, but all would be affected by the clerk's hasty solution to his gambling problem -- stealing from his employer to pay off the bookies.<p><p>Lama worked at Salomon's offices at 55 Water Street, in the heart of New York's financial district. His area was known as the cage -- a space stacked with bonds and certificates, constantly monitored by video cameras. Lama had toiled in the cage for years, and he knew what the cameras could see. Just as important, he knew exactly what they couldn't see.<p>Lama's actions are detailed in a federal indictment, the FBI case file, and two internal reports prepared for Salomon Brothers. At quitting time on St. Patrick's Day in 1989, shortly after meeting with Rosenfeld and Ballison in the Seaview, the former model employee carefully choreographed his moves and walked out the door of the cage with $700,000 in corporate bonds.<p>It was as simple as that. And when the bonds were discovered missing a few days later, nothing much happened. The theft had occurred on a "settlement day," when huge volumes of paper get shuffled at houses such as Salomon. The general assumption was that the bonds had been misplaced, so company officials did little except note the disappearance, search the area, and go about their business. The bonds were expected to show up eventually.<p>By contrast, Lama's willingness to steal wasn't lost on Rosenfeld and Ballison, who took the notes from Lama and told him of a millionaire buddy in Texas who would hold them as collateral against Lama's debts. In the meantime, Ballison says in court records, the bookies urged Lama to deliver as many bonds to them as he could. Several weeks later, on April 28, Lama obliged with another theft.<p>This time the clerk walked out with $135,000 worth of New York State Job Development Authority bonds. Just days later, Lama stole another $150,000 in bonds -- stowing them at his home on New York's Staten Island, he claimed, so he could bribe Rosenfeld and Ballison if they came to threaten his life or his family.<p>By now, close to $1 million worth of securities was missing from Salomon's vault, and Lama's biggest haul was still to come. The grab occurred on August 29, when Lama turned up for work and walked out the door with a stunning $6 million in commercial paper from <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> Acceptance Corp.<p>Unfortunately for Lama, Salomon officials were watching. Having at last realized that bonds were disappearing from the cage, the firm's security personnel had secretly augmented the area's camera system. Lama was caught on videotape stealing the GMAC bonds.<p>Faced with the prospect of a Salomon-administered polygraph test, the clerk confessed his crime and was handed over to the FBI. From there the feds had an easy ride to Rosenfeld and Ballison, apparently leaving just one more man to bring in -- Mark Osborne, the Texan who was holding the stolen bonds for Lama's bookies.<p>But real life seldom follows a script. And as the FBI probed deeper into this seemingly minor case, it began to take on international dimensions.<p><p>Like Tony Lama, John Mark Lee Osborne was a compulsive gambler who lived beyond his means. Unlike Lama, however, Osborne carried it all off in grand style. The subject of repeated investigations and sanctions by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Osborne wound up barred from the securities industry. But he still lived in the swanky Hunter's Creek Village section of Houston and managed to maintain a seemingly respectable family life with his wife, Virginia, and their college-age son. As a gambling client of Rosenfeld's, this crooked financier was a natural destination for Lama's stolen bonds.<p>Some bonds are almost like money: They're not imprinted with the owner's name, so they're essentially the property of whoever holds them. Fencing such "bearer" bonds is a delicate matter, however. Face values are large enough that the serial numbers of stolen notes are easily circulated; reputable dealers will check to see if a bond is hot.<p>Still, if the instruments are passed through enough uninformed hands before they're identified as stolen, the issuer generally has little choice but to honor them. The ideal buyer of a hot bond, therefore, is overseas: In theory, the bonds won't be tagged as stolen until they arrive back in their home country -- by which time they'll have been laundered clean.<p>Rosenfeld and Ballison had sent many of Lama's bonds to Osborne, but Osborne had no intention of holding them. Faced with money problems, he decided to see if he could sell the notes in Europe. Through a friend he hooked up with an English con man named Keith Cheeseman. It was a partnership that would turn out badly for both of them.<p>Cheeseman himself was a piece of work. To borrow a line from Tom Jones, it was the universal opinion that he was born to be hanged. With his laughing eyes and round, full face, Cheeseman had charmed the knickers off half the women in London's East End. But even more than a ladies' man, Cheeseman was a brazen and lifelong fraudster, with a string of arrests and convictions that stretched back to the early 1970s.<p>To please his wife, Kerry -- herself the former owner of a Mayfair escort agency -- Cheeseman had tried to go straight for a while in the 1980s. But the effort hadn't worked. Now here was a Texan who wanted to fly to London to talk to him about a deal involving some bonds. "So I said fine," recalls Cheeseman.<p>Not long afterward, Osborne turned up as promised. "He arrived with this Zsa Zsa Gabor lookalike bird," says Cheeseman, describing Osborne's mistress, Alice Walker. "They checked into a suite at the Savoy Hotel and started this glorified drink-up that went on for days."<p>Osborne had arrived with a briefcase of the GMAC bonds, claiming to have plenty more back in Houston. Intrigued, Cheeseman agreed to come to Texas to see for himself. In January of 1990 he did so, followed by Kerry. The two visited with Osborne for ten weeks.<p>"He had this multimillionaire lifestyle," says Kerry Cheeseman between mouthfuls of cold poached lobster and souffle at London's Carlton Towers Hotel. "Every car he had was black or gold. He took us everywhere -- the Houston Racquet Club, all the most exclusive places. He was known everywhere. But he had no manners. I mean, he would throw peanut shells on the floor and pay the waiters $50 to pick them up."<p>The quartet -- Osborne, Walker, and the Cheesemans -- cut a tacky swath across Houston, as Osborne spent lavishly and behaved like a boor. Kerry Cheeseman says she was especially mortified by Walker's appetite for garish display. "She used to shop two or three times a week on Mark's charge card at Neiman Marcus," she recalls. "But the woman had no taste. I mean, one time she bought this atrocious pair of fur boots for the rodeo."<p>Both Cheesemans recall Osborne's obsession with gambling and cite it as a reason they felt he couldn't be trusted. "He said he had these colossal debts," says Kerry. "Seven digits at least. But he was always working some wild angle. I remember he actually talked about having his wife bumped off and collecting the insurance."<p>By the time the Cheesemans returned to England in March of 1990, Osborne was frantic to place some of the Salomon bonds somewhere. The Texan soon appeared in London once more, apparently in hopes of fencing one of the notes. The man he wound up talking to was a shady English character named Ray Ketteridge. Cheeseman tells of attending a meeting between Osborne and Ketteridge at the home of a local lawyer.<p>As Osborne tried to unload the certificate, says Cheeseman, he boasted wildly to Ketteridge about his banking connections back in the U.S. -- and the braggadocio seems to have impressed Ketteridge. Nothing much got done at the meeting, but federal officials charge it wasn't long before Ketteridge acted on his new friendship, irrevocably linking Lama's thefts to a far more sensational crime.<p>That crime happened just days later: On May 2, a courier was robbed at knifepoint on a street in the City of London, England's equivalent of Wall Street. In broad daylight, the thief got away with 301 bearer bonds, almost all of them issued by the Bank of England and worth 1 million pounds each. It was the biggest armed robbery in history, dwarfing famous jobs of an earlier era such as the Great Train Robbery. In U.S. currency, the haul amounted to about $500 million.<p>Ketteridge seems to have had no part in the actual robbery. Yet only a day or two after the mugging, Cheeseman says, Ketteridge called him and asked for Osborne's phone number in Houston. "He led me to believe he had some of the Bank of England bonds," says Cheeseman, "and that he wanted to unload them with Mark."<p>Ketteridge couldn't be reached for his side of the story. But in a surreptitiously taped interview for a British documentary called The Biggest Robbery in the World, the Englishman says his alleged role in the affair is a case of mistaken identity.<p>In any event, Cheeseman says he indeed hooked Ketteridge up with Osborne. By doing so, he closed the loop between the two bond robberies. Unknown to the con artist, however, the FBI had already cracked open the Salomon case and was tracking Osborne's moves. With Cheeseman and Ketteridge involved, the feds apparently believed they had stumbled upon a massive conspiracy -- a transatlantic ring of bond robbers who had looted Salomon and were now emptying out the Bank of England.<p><p>To tackle the thieves, the FBI set up a sting. By July 31, 1990, Mark Osborne had arrived in New York City for what he thought was a date with the Mafia. In his briefcase he had ten stolen Bank of England bearer bonds, each worth 1 million pounds. From his room at the Grand Hyatt, he headed around the corner to Ryan McFadden's Bar & Restaurant. His contact's name was Tony, supposedly a member of a New York organized-crime family.<p>As Osborne understood it, Tony had agreed to buy all ten bonds, which a federal indictment says were in turn supplied by Ketteridge. For the first certificate, the mob would pay $204,000. For the rest they would work out a deal later, if the initial deal went okay.<p>The meeting went off exactly as scripted. The Texan produced one of the bonds from his briefcase. Tony took it, then suggested that the two step outside so Osborne could get paid. But once the two had left the restaurant, FBI agents swooped down upon them, handcuffing the stunned Osborne and taking him into custody.<p>"Tony," it turned out, was really an FBI agent named David Maniquis. The entire scenario was designed to snag Osborne, already in trouble for fencing the Salomon bonds, for the Bank of England job, too. After the arrest, Osborne was advised of his rights and agreed to become a cooperating informant. His mission: To lure Ray Ketteridge to the U.S. so the feds could bag him too.<p>In reality, of course, the two bond robberies were linked mostly by happenstance -- and furthermore, Ketteridge hadn't played a key role in either one. Nonetheless, Osborne was soon making nervous phone calls to London, saying that Tony the mobster wanted to deal with Ketteridge personally.<p>Instead of rising to the bait, the cagey Ketteridge dispatched a bag man to New York: Jeffrey Kerschel, also known as Jeffrey Kershaw, a lawyer he thought he could trust. Too bad for all concerned -- for, amazingly enough, Kerschel was working as an undercover informant for London's Scotland Yard.<p>To complicate matters still further, Kerschel says Ketteridge's order to fly to New York was so last-minute that the solicitor couldn't properly inform his controller at Scotland Yard before hopping on a plane. As a result, confusion reigned when Kerschel met with Tony -- each unaware of the other's undercover status -- for a replay of the sting that had snagged Osborne.<p>That night, Scotland Yard learned that its man had been arrested by the FBI in New York while trying to collect money from an undercover agent masquerading as a Mafia crime figure. The British cops quickly concluded that their agent had been out to double-cross them and refused to speak up for Kerschel when the FBI asked for verification of his claim to be a British agent.<p>Thereafter, Kerschel's life careened from one nightmare to the next. Forced by the FBI to become a secret informant, he was compelled to make more than a month's worth of FBI-monitored telephone calls to Ketteridge and others back in London, in the hope it might still be possible to lure Ketteridge himself to New York. <p>Nothing worked, so the FBI soon gave up the effort and left the British authorities to pursue Ketteridge. Meanwhile, as U.S. prosecutors in the case saw it, at least they still had Kerschel. In September 1990, says the solicitor, he was told that the U.S. government would press charges against him. Free on a recognizance bond, Kerschel promptly fled the country. One obvious reason was his fear of what might happen if he hung around much longer -- for in a startling and macabre development only days earlier, Mark Osborne's body had been found wedged in the back seat of a car parked in a shopping mall in Houston.<p>The Texan had been killed "gangland style," as FBI files put it -- two bullets to the back of his head. To this day, his murder remains unsolved. But to those involved in the bond robberies and their aftermath, the rubout seemed to send a clear message: Don't cooperate with the cops. By such a standard, Kerschel was now doubly exposed. He had cooperated with the police in England and in the U.S.<p>On the run, the solicitor couldn't claim protection from either set of lawmen he had helped. The FBI wanted to convict him, while Scotland Yard pretended not to know him. For Kerschel, the bond caper had become a terrifying trap.<p><p>Recently arrived in London from Cyprus, where he beat off an attempt to return him to the U.S., Jeffrey Kerschel sits with his back to the wall of a restaurant, sweating profusely and behaving like a hunted man. He says he's been expelled from his men's club and denied a license to practice law. He spent 14 months under virtual house arrest for extradition hearings in Cyprus. Exposed in headlines as a snitch, he's certain that sooner or later there will be an attempt on his life.<p>"This whole thing has been an absolute nightmare for me," he says. "And all I was doing was trying to help my government."<p>How did he get into this mess in the first place? As Kerschel tells it -- self-servingly, to be sure -- he had been an upstanding London solicitor in early 1990 when a client from Athens approached him for help negotiating the underground sale of a hoard of paintings: the famous Beit collection, stolen in 1985 from a manse in Ireland by a gang with links to Irish terrorists.<p>Excited by the situation, not to mention the prospect of a reward, Kerschel felt it was his duty to notify Scotland Yard. He agreed to become an undercover informant, and his secret snitching led to the recovery of a $10 million work by Breugel. Meanwhile, his cover remained intact.<p>Almost immediately thereafter came the Bank of England bond robbery. According to Kerschel, within days his Greek chum showed up once again -- this time with a photocopy of one of the stolen Bank of England bonds. He claimed he had access to plenty more like it. Agog, the solicitor told Scotland Yard about the turn of events and was designated an informer in this case, too. Soon, he says, he was dealing with who else but ... Ray Ketteridge.<p>But despite his eagerness to help, Kerschel could play only a minor role in solving the Bank of England case. The reason is simple: Ketteridge wasn't among the clique that plotted the crime, says Tom Dickenson, the detective who headed the City of London's push to recover the stolen bonds. Rather, he was just one of many routes used to unload the paper when the crooks' original plan fell apart.<p>"The villains were faxing copies of the bonds all over the world," says Dickenson. "Frankly, they just weren't very clever." Perhaps, but they've still eluded capture so far. Virtually all 301 bonds have now been recovered, in locations from Miami to Singapore, and Dickenson insists that London police know who the culprits are. Much of the evidence points toward involvement by Irish terrorists.<p>But curiously, the English courts have never convicted anyone in the world's biggest robbery -- not even Ketteridge, who was arrested when police found nine stolen bonds in his car. When Ketteridge was brought to trial in 1992 in London, the prosecutor for the Crown stunned the courtroom by announcing that the government had decided not to proceed, vaguely citing "the interests of the state."<p>Dickenson is evasive on this subject. But apparently the British have a well-placed mole, perhaps in the IRA, whom they didn't want to expose in court. "We had an informant" is how one English official puts it. "Someone on the inside. We knew that we couldn't get convictions without revealing his identity, so we made a calculated decision not to go forward. We basically had no choice."<p>It also remains a puzzle why Kerschel was cut loose by Scotland Yard and left to fend for himself from the FBI sting onward. But it's clear the former snitch has reason to fear for his life: Mark Osborne wasn't the only person in the great bond caper to meet a grisly death. In a British echo of that killing, a career criminal believed to have been the stickup man in the Bank of England robbery was found murdered in his East End flat in December of 1991. Police believe he was killed for fear he had turned informer.<p><p>Back in the U.S., federal prosecutors had problems too. While the original indictment listed 12 people as codefendants in the case, only one received a lengthy sentence: Keith Cheeseman, the crooked charmer -- who, ironically enough, had played no role in the Salomon or Bank of England bond robberies.<p>Cheeseman was seized in the Canary Islands in January of 1992 and pleaded guilty to conspiracy and transporting stolen goods. He was sentenced to six years in prison; at press time he was due to be released early, and sat in a New York holding cell awaiting deportation to England.<p>Meanwhile, our opening trio from the Seaview Diner -- Lama, Rosenfeld, and Ballison -- all got relatively mild treatment. Lama, the actual thief, became an informant for the FBI and was rewarded with five years probation and no jail time at all. He still lives on Staten Island; through his lawyer, he declined to comment for this story.<p>What of bookies Rosenfeld and Ballison? They plea-bargained and wound up receiving three and a half years and one year in prison, respectively. Both men have yet to serve out their sentences in the Salomon case -- Ballison's stretch began in July, while Rosenfeld is still appealing his punishment.<p>Neither bookie would comment for this story, but they have both been back in the news since they triggered this whole chain of events. Even as they negotiated their deals in the Salomon case, prosecutors have charged, Rosenfeld and Ballison continued to run a bookmaking operation from an apartment building in Queens, New York, not far from Canarsie. They were busted last winter. Ballison pleaded guilty again and was scolded with a painless sentence -- a $5,000 fine and no jail time. Rosenfeld pleaded not guilty; his case is still pending.<p>After almost five years, the great bond caper had come full circle, ending as it started with a small-time gambling hustle born in a neighborhood far removed from the canyons of Wall Street. <p>Christopher Byron is a contributing editor of Worth<p>

They're no free lunch, but ignore them at your peril.<p>By Jonathan Burton<p>It sounds like an offer you can't refuse: The closed-end investment company whose shares you own offers you rights to buy one additional share for each four you own -- and at a price 20 percent below market value. Has the fabled free lunch finally appeared on your table?<p>No; it's just Wall Street raising money again. Rights offerings are by no means gifts; they cost you whether you buy into them or not. <p>If you don't subscribe to the rights offering, the value of your existing shares get diluted by those issued to honor the exercise of the rights. And if you do, further dilution can occur if some of the fresh cash you pony up feeds the brokerage industry's fee mill. The best course to take if you want to remain a shareholder and minimize potential for loss is to sell the amount of shares you hold the rights to and then exercise those rights. That way you will come close to breaking even. The worst option is to do nothing. <p>The markets have been awash in rights offerings by closed-end funds, whose shares are traded in securities markets rather than sold and redeemed by mutual fund organizations. From January 1992 through April this year, 59 closed-end funds raised $3.3 billion through rights offerings, according to Chicago-based fund watcher Morningstar. Many closed-end funds have enlisted brokerage firms to promote their offerings, normally paying them between 3 percent and 3.75 percent of the proceeds. <p>Closed-end fund managers like such deals because, unlike managers of open-ended funds, they see none of the cash that changes hands when investors buy and sell shares every day. To raise fresh cash for investment, closed-end funds sell new shares. Distributing rights to existing shareholders is the best way to make sure an offering succeeds. <p>Fund managers may argue that the more money there is under management, the better off shareholders are. Neither portfolio theory nor investment experience validates this view. It is, however, undeniably true that the more money that management manages, the better off management is. <p>Why do shareholders barely break even, if that, in a rights offering? Let's say you own 100 shares of a closed-end fund with a market value of $10 a share. You and other shareholders exercise your rights to increase your holdings by 25 percent, one new share for each four shares held, at a price of only $8 a share.<p>You started with 100 shares worth $1,000 and you've just paid $200 for 25 new shares. If all that new cash goes to the company, your 125 shares should now be worth $1,200, or $9.60 a share; you have just about broken even. If you'd done nothing and let the rights expire, your 100 shares would be worth only $960, a 4 percent decline.<p>Never again wonder why the market value of closed-end fund shares shrinks after a rights offering is announced. If you plan to exercise your rights, wait until the latter part of the subscription period, when any uncertainties about the offering would have surfaced. Shareholders who don't want new shares can offset or minimize dilution of their existing shares several ways, depending on the deal's terms. Rights have an intrinsic value: the difference between the cost of exercising them and the value of the shares acquired. So you may be able to sell your rights when they start trading.<p>Non-transferable rights -- those you can't sell -- are a bit different. These, too, have value. If you don't want to add money but want to preserve your holdings, sell as many shares as you hold rights to, then exercise them.<p>You'll have to time this carefully. Typically, it takes two to three weeks from the time the offering is announced until the day the rights become shares, called the record date. However, you cannot sell your original shares until the ex-rights date, four trading days prior to the record date, if you want to receive your rights.<p>Suppose you own 300 shares of a closed-end fund with non-transferable rights to buy 100 additional shares at 80 percent of their $10 market price. On the ex-rights date, the shares will trade down to $9.50 each; your 300 shares are worth $2,850. Sell 100 of them for $950 using the proceeds to exercise your right to buy 100 new shares at $8 each, or a total of $800.<p>You keep the $150 in cash, minus transaction fees, plus 300 shares that, after dilution, are worth $2,850. Total:$3,000, just what you started with. Had you done nothing, you would have lost the $150, less transaction costs. <p><p>

Like bull markets, bears follow predictable patterns.<p>By Jim Jubak<p>What to call this market? A true bear - one of those periodic bloodlettings that cost investors 25 percent or more - or merely a correction that has almost run its course? <p>Trouble is, bear markets look exactly like corrections early on, says James Stack, editor of the InvesTech Market Analyst newsletter. Stack voted with the bears last January, advising readers to raise cash levels in portfolios to 60 percent. Now he's estimating that the bear will last until early fall. <p>That's short-lived compared to most major bear markets since 1937 but more drawn out than the 1987 and 1990 declines. Those were atypical, Stack says, lasting two and three months respectively - far short of the 16.5-month average. <p>Bear markets typically unfold in steps. They might begin with a 7 to 10 percent drop - so swift that no one can get out - like the one that began in late March 1994. Then prices stabilize or rally slightly as investors decide to buy on the drop. Another fall is followed by another small rally - known as a bear trap - that's "just enough to get investors to put a little money back in," Stack says. And tech stocks often get clobbered first and hardest in a bear - check out <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a> in mid-April.<p><p>

						Nicholas Wren knew his daring stock play would be the gamble of his life. But he didn뇺 know how much he had on the line. <p>By Colin Harrison.<p>Can a man find salvation in the stock market? Nicholas Wren is betting he can. At the end of Part 1 of 늆he Commuter, Wren had just confronted the man sleeping with his wife and was faxing an order to his broker: Short RemoteCount뇹 stock for all the money he could put his hands on, nearly $300,000. It뇹 a huge gamble. But Wren knows something about the company that the analysts don뇺: Problems with electromagnetic radiation at Remote-Count뇹 headquarters will force the company to virtually shut down operations. Wren plans to clear up to $250,000 on the bet듨oney that will allow him to move his family away from New York and back to his wife뇹 hometown in Ohio. Money that he hopes will save his failing marriage.<p><p>Nicholas Wren was sitting in the backseat of a late-model <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a> Fifth Avenue, speeding north through a gray winter morning on I-270, a spotless ten-lane artery spoking out from Washington, D.C., and again he was agonizing over the price of RemoteCount stock. Again!등hen he should be worrying about this morning뇹 presentation, which, potentially, promised a huge contract, a bigger annual bonus, possible promotion. All he could think about was RemoteCount. His every dollar was riding on the bet that the stock would fall. He뇫 shorted 5,700 shares at $47듮he price couldn뇺 stay there for long. He was sure of it. Hadn뇺 his analysis been correct? Hadn뇺 he weighed all the factors? Oh, but if he뇫 known how nerve-racking this business was going to be, well, then he뇫 never have듍o! That was not the way to be thinking. He had to have faith! Faith! Without it he뇫 be lost. It had been three trading days since Jane Chung, his broker, had executed the order, and since then nothing! Well, yesterday the stock had crept up, just half a point, just enough to terrorize him, and before getting the 5:14 home, he뇫 needed to stop off at a bar outside New York뇹 Grand Central and knock back a couple just to relax.<p>And now the market had been open for nearly an hour, and he didn뇺 know what was happening! 뉷on뇺 turn into a quote junkie on me, Nicholas, Jane had warned. 뉼f there뇹 anything important, I뇳l let you know. In other words, don뇺 bug me. Jane was right; he needed to maintain his composure. He looked out the window hoping for distraction. The highway flowed through the newest paradigm of American civilization듢leaming exurban office parks, townhouses rolling over what used to be cornfields, the landscape tidy as a microchip. He hated it. What he wanted was an Ohio farmhouse tucked away on a bumpy lane, a couple of old maples in front, a few acres out back. That was the plan, to make a bundle on RemoteCount and move Lisa and the kids to<p>Now wasn뇺 the time to be thinking of this. In a few minutes the car would pull into the parking lot of Girardi Corp. Nicholas뇹 task was to hustle the services of his employer, Belton Associates, an engineering consulting firm. According to the research prepared by Nicholas뇹 office, Girardi had grown from an $18 million house contractor to a $277 million office-complex developer. The Washington metropolitan area had kept growing through the Bush recession. Why? Its traditional suburbs, like Chevy Chase, were insanely expensive; the federal government뇹 payroll kept growing; D.C. itself was more or less segregated; and the city was staggeringly violent, even by New York standards. And the newer suburbs were far enough north that one could actually commute to Baltimore듡or a developer, what could be better? Too bad Girardi was privately held.<p>The company had seven projects in the pipeline, each worth more than $40 million, and some of its younger executives had begun to worry about electromagnetic-field radiation등hich is where Belton came in. The office buildings Girardi had under construction required powerful electrical systems for their tenants, who often had as many computers as people. No one had absolutely proved that high EMF levels caused cancer, but the research, nationally and internationally, suggested a correlation, and there was a whole school of lawyers who had made a specialty of EMF liability cases.<p>Nicholas was here to propose to Girardi Sr. a consulting arrangement드 three-year training and project-oversight deal. Belton Associates would train Girardi engineers and architects to avoid high-level EMFs in their new buildings, thereby lessening the threat of expensive lawsuits. It could mean a lot of money for the firm. Just yesterday, Bart Belton himself had come by Nicholas뇹 office to ramble on about how the deal might help them get more business in the Washington market, develop a relationship with a deep-pockets company, even create the possibility for joint <p>But the RemoteCount stock! What was it doing? He leaned toward the driver. 뉻ow long before we get there?<p>늉e got about nine, ten minutes.<p>Time enough to call Jane. He hoped that RemoteCount had already started to drift downward. He picked up the car뇹 cellular phone. Jane was there on the first ring.<p>뉽ane, hi, I뇴 in D.C. this morning.<p>뉼뇴 surprised you didn뇺 call me from the shuttle.<p>늉e were landing. The phones didn뇺 work. How뇹 it look?<p>늉ell, the market뇹 started to rise on the lower oil prices ... wait a sec.... He could hear her tap her keys. 뉴ll right, here등ell, no, RemoteCount뇹 up a quarter point.<p>늂n top of yesterday뇹 half point.<p>늉ell, the Labor Department released some numbers saying more people have jobs. That means more insurance claims for RemoteCount to process. Good for the stock.<p>He straightened his tie. 늁ot good for me, Jane.<p>뉼뇫 say not.<p>Up three quarters of a point, multiplied by the 5,700 shares; he was down about $4,300. He wasn뇺 about to panic, right? Scared money always loses. Some investment guru had said that. To contemplate panic is to panic. Sounded like a Chinese philosopher. 뉽ane, you mind if I give you a call at the end of the day?<p>늁icholas, if there뇹 any kind of significant action, I뇳l call.<p>늋ou can leave it on my voice mail in New York.<p>Next he phoned Lisa at the small law office where she worked part time in their suburb outside New York City. It was a general-purpose law firm, but Lisa had developed an odd specialty든xamining the medical depositions of people who had been in car accidents.<p>뉻i, he said. 늋ou just get in?<p>뉹ew minutes ago, she answered.<p>뉻ow뇫 you sleep?<p>늉ell enough. Her every word a bomb thrown in his direction.<p>늉hat do you have going today? More human misery?<p>늋es, Nicholas, more misery.<p>Fake charm was only going to get him trouble. 뉼 think I can make it home just after dinner. I뇳l try to make the 4 p.m. shuttle.<p>늂kay.<p>늂kay? he pressed.<p>늋eah, okay.<p>뉼s that an 넲kay, that뇹 great, it뇳l be nice to see you? Or 넲kay, try to choose a plane that has no working engines?눖<p>늁icholas, we뇼e both got long days ahead of us.<p>늂h, come on. I got my sad ass up at five o뇪lock this morning in the cold, and I뇴 just looking for a little cheap affection from my wife.<p>He heard her sigh, followed by a long pause as she considered what level of conflict she wished to pursue. <p>뉼뇼e got to get off, she said. 뉼뇴 expecting a call from London.<p>뉾ids fine?<p>늆heyre fine. Tommy said he had a nightmare.<p>늉hat did he딊<p>뉼뇼e got to get off here, Nicholas. I뇼e got to get off.<p>늂kay. We should see a movie sometime.<p>늋eah, we should. Bye.<p>He hung up. Things would get better with Lisa after the RemoteCount deal. That was one of his operating principles. If the deal worked, then he might appear to her as more than the irritating man who got off the train each night and ate dinner in her dining room. To contemplate panic is to panic. Perhaps that applied to a marriage, too. <p>
The car rolled into the girardi corp. office cluster, and a minute later he was gulping coffee in a huge conference room, wondering again if RemoteCount had started to fall, and then all the Girardi executives came in and he forced himself to concentrate on the business at hand등hich he did, performing quite a nice sell job on old Girardi Sr., a big-bellied man with hands that had once grasped hammers and power saws. Girardi Sr. seemed skeptical of anything he could not touch himself, but he had clearly seen the worry in the faces of his young vice-presidents who were helping him make so much money. <p>So Girardi Sr. was receptive, and Nicholas듮hinking ahead to the home he뇫 soon be buying in Ohio든ven slipped in a question about what kind of seed Girardi Corp. used in the lawns around its office parks. Girardi brightened. 뉾entucky bluegrass, he boomed. 늅tick it in on any kinda soil.  <p>With the obvious success of the meeting, Nicholas was hoping he could shrug off RemoteCount뇹 three-quarters-of-a-point rise. Worry and youre lost; believe and you뇼e won, he뇫 heard a failed television star profess on a late-night infomercial, and so, no, he was not going to worry. He believed in his heart that once RemoteCount뇹 EMF troubles became more widely known, the stock would drop. Jane had said that most of the RemoteCount stock was held by the pension funds and they뇫 probably dump it all at once, causing the stock to nosedive. So he뇫 sit tight. RemoteCount would drift along at 47, okay, maybe 48, and suddenly drop. Maybe he뇫 graph the stock뇹 falling price on his Mac using the Microsoft Excel 4.0 that he뇫 bootlegged from the office. No problem. He wouldn뇺 even bother Jane at the end of the day.<p>
He called her from the shuttle at 4 p.m.<p>뉹orty-eight and an eighth, she said.<p>늉hat? Why?<p>늆he broad market is really up today. People are buying everything. The Dow was up 53 points after lunch and settled back up 39.<p>뉵ut why RemoteCount? <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a> or <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald뇹</b></a> or something I could understand, but딊<p>뉻ey, Nicholas, I just trade them, right? Jane said irritably. 뉵ut you know, one of the pension funds could have taken a profit somewhere in a big position in another stock and decided to pick up some interesting smaller stocks, and they just bought a rising RemoteCount price until they filled their position. That could be it.<p>He hung up and did the math; he was down $6,400. His stop order was at 50, and suddenly that seemed rather close. <p>
He tramped inside the front door just after 7 p.m., as the kids were getting in the bath, and hollered upstairs to say he was home, then tossed his briefcase on the floor and floated into the living room. In the kitchen he ate the rest of the kids vegetables and rice out of the pot and idly pressed the play button of the phone machine to see who might have called: nothing. You never knew what could turn up듮his was how he뇫 learned about Lisa뇹 recent (and presumably terminated) affair with Richard Chambers. Ever since Nicholas뇹 brutal little lunch with Chambers a week ago, he could only assume that Chambers had immediately cut short the relationship. And as much as he wanted to confront Lisa about the whole thing, perhaps it was better to wait until they moved. New York would seem like a million miles away. Maybe he뇫 stoically never even bring it up. Or maybe he liked keeping the secret들t let him stay angry at his wife. <p>Upstairs, he stuck his head into the bathroom, and there they were, Lisa bent over the tub reading a book, Sally and Tommy in the warm suds, their little chests and shoulders above the bubbles.<p>뉻i, he said. 뉻ow뇹 my kids?<p>늉ere almost ready here, Lisa said, flipping the page.<p>늂kay. <p>She pushed her dark hair out of her face and looked at him, waiting. Even in her exhaustion, she was still lovely, still someone he admired and wanted to please. But a marriage, he now understood, was not just a static condition; it was a series of marriages between the same two people, and these days theirs was weakened by his inattention to her, burdened by children and work, and poisoned by her affair. They needed a new start, they needed hope, they needed RemoteCount to drop by 20 points. But maybe he could say something pleasant, signal his willingness not to fight. 늆here뇹 a lot of building going on outside Washington.<p>She nodded, faking interest in this comment. 뉼뇴 glad youre back. <p>Did he believe her? He wasn뇺 sure. <p>늀e, too, he mumbled.<p>In the bedroom, he flipped through the mail. The usual bills, the usual junk mail듭olicitations for investment newsletters and credit cards, catalogs for women뇹 dresses and Japanese power tools. Then Tommy, his five-year-old, ran into the bedroom, hair wet, trailing his towel. <p>뉷ad, do dead people all die lying down? he asked.<p>뉼 don뇺 know, Tommy. That뇹 kind of a strange question.<p>뉵illy Meyer says all dead people when they die, they have their tongues sticking out.<p>뉼 don뇺 think so. He toweled off his boy뇹 back. 뉿et뇹 get your pajamas.<p>뉵illy Meyer told me in school.<p>뉻as Billy Meyer seen a lot of dead people?<p>뉻e was with his mom, and they saw a dead man lying on the sidewalk.<p>뉻e saw that? Nicholas said, aghast.<p>뉵illy says they all die with their eyes shut and if드nd if they forget to shut them, then the bugs eat the eyeballs.<p>He looked at his boy and at the smoothness of his cheeks and the odd wet cowlick and his bright eyes and breathless patter.<p>뉷on뇺 worry about it, pal, okay?<p>From the bathroom came the happy sounds of Sally and Lisa finishing up. He and Lisa had made various parenting mistakes듮oo long in the crib for Tommy, too early with the play group with Sally득ut they뇫 gotten bedtime down, never varying the ritual. The kids actually seemed to like going to sleep. Lisa came into the bedroom, followed by Sally, who marched around the room in chubby excitement, her skin pink and warm. His wife flipped a diaper on the bed, and he swooped Sally up, held her gently on her back, dabbed a pinch of Balmex on her rear and put on the diaper. He뇫 once calculated that they뇫 spent nearly $5,000 on Pampers듢ood reason to buy Proctor and Gamble; he뇫 ask Jane about the stock. Now the kids ran around in their pajamas for a few minutes, and then Nicholas got down on his hands and knees like he always did and Tommy flew onto his back for an 는xecutive ride, which meant that Tommy rode on Nicholas over to the bed, where he leapt dramatically into the covers. <p>Sally was in her little bed, and then Lisa turned the light out, and Sally, like she always did, asked, 늁ight-light? And Nicholas answered, 늋es, sweetie, it뇹 on, let뇹 go to sleep, and the kids settled down while he sang 늆ake Me Out to the Ball Game, one of the few songs he knew by heart. While he warbled, 뉵uy me some peanuts and Crackerjack, I don뇺 care if we ever go back... he wondered what he would do if RemoteCount went any higher. A few punk 25-year-old fund managers who knew more about Air Jordans than they did stocks could have a look at RemoteCount tomorrow and start buying for the hell of it; Jane뇹 stop-loss order would kick in at $50 a share and he뇫 be finished듪ut of the game with a $17,000 loss, his foolishness confirmed.<p>
Later, he found lisa in bed reading. <p>늉ell? he said. 뉻ow about a romantic interlude?<p>뉶an I finish my chapter?<p>늅ure.<p>He took off his clothes and got into bed naked, laying his hands on his stomach. He뇫 lose weight once they moved to Ohio. Start running again, biking at least. Then he felt the weight of his wife as she got beneath the covers, and they lay quietly there for a few minutes as they both made the long transit from their respective thoughts toward each other. When he finally rolled toward her, he hoped that she wouldn뇺 be thinking of Richard Chambers, his beguiling smile, his toned buttocks, and so on.<p>Twenty minutes later, after Lisa had returned from the bathroom and he뇫 pulled on a T-shirt and underwear, he drifted in a fugue state, a half dream, in which he saw a new car skidding sideways across a wet road in slow motion. The wet skin of the car, the brilliant spray, the poetry of advertising. The dark figure behind the windshield was him. He liked the Ford Taurus. He was driving and turned off up a long driveway that led to a classic white farmhouse. The buffalo grass made a thick green carpet around the house. The stuff didn뇺 need much water. He뇫 plant a nice row of flowering trees듑argent crab apples, perhaps, or flowering white dogwoods (cornus florida). Or the rare magnolia hybrid Pink Goblet, a vigorous grower, according to the catalog, plantable in USDA zones 6-9. Pruning them was something of an art<p>늁icholas, came Lisa뇹 voice in the dark, 뉼 was trying to buy Tommy some shoes today and they wouldn뇺 take the Visa.<p>늋ou usually use the MasterCard, he said sleepily, tasting his pillow.<p>늋es, that뇹 true, but not because there isn뇺 one dime of credit on the Visa. I haven뇺 been using it, so that means you딊<p>늆here뇹 a $5,000 cash advance on the Visa.<p>늉hy, may I ask?<p>Yes, why? he wondered. 뉼 borrowed it to make an investment.<p>늉hat kind of investment?<p>He sighed. Tasted his own breath, already sour.<p>뉼뇼e put together a들t뇹 an idea to make some money. I think I can actually make some money at it. I뇼e thought it out, Lisa.<p>She sat up next to him. 늉hat뇫 you do with the money from the refinancing?<p>He rolled onto his back. 뉼t뇹 sitting in the brokerage account.<p>뉴ll of it?<p>뉸very dime, Lisa.<p>She seemed to be thinking, ordering her questions. She had a disciplined mind, his wife, and he had always known that she was smarter than he was. 늉hat about that money I inherited and you put into health-care stocks?<p>늆hat뇹 in cash, in the brokerage account.<p>뉼s the credit card advance in the brokerage account, too?<p>늋es.<p>뉼s there more?<p>늀ore in the account?<p>She sighed in fury. 늋es, more in the account, more you haven뇺 told me?<p>뉼 borrowed some money from the other credit cards, and my mom sent me a check, actually.<p>늋our mother?<p>늅he lent me듯s65,000.<p>뉻ow much is in the account?<p>He didn뇺 want to tell her; he wanted to keep the thing close to himself. 뉽ust under 300,000.<p>늉hat? Lisa뇹 voice rose.<p>뉽ust under딊<p>늆hree hundred thousand dollars?<p>He nodded.<p>늉hat are you doing? she cried. 늆hat뇹 our money!<p>뉼 know.<p>뉵ut why뇹 there all this borrowed money and all our other assets in one account, in one place?<p>뉼뇴 making a play, Lisa. I뇴 shorting a stock.<p>늋oure what?<p>뉼t뇹 called RemoteCount. It뇹 a small data-processing company that trades on Nasdaq. It뇹 totally overvalued듈 think it뇹 a great opportunity. He paused for a breath. 뉼뇼e borrowed 5,700 shares of RemoteCount and concurrently executed a sell order for the same number of shares, and now I뇴 waiting.<p>뉵ut you never discussed this with me! That뇹 outrageous.<p>He could feel her shifting in the bed, gathering herself up, her breathing accelerating. <p>늋es, he announced into the dark. 뉼t뇹 outrageous, the whole goddamn thing is goddamn outrageous.<p>늋ou never told me! she screamed. 늋ou could lose it all!<p>뉼뇴 not going to lose it.<p>뉻ow do you know? she cried anxiously.<p>뉴t most I뇳l lose only a part of it. I have a stop-loss order in.<p>늋ou think딊<p>뉷on뇺 worry, he said. 뉼뇼e spent a long time putting this thing together. Youre just going to have to trust me.<p>늆rust you? she screamed.<p>늋es. He leaned close to her face in a way that was not affectionate, and she drew back. With one hand he reached up to the light above the bed and switched it on; both of them winced in the sudden brightness. 늋es, Lisa, he said slowly. 늆he same way that I뇼e trusted you.<p>
For three more days, nothing happened. RemoteCount flicked up and down, feigning a run-up here, dropping three eighths there. He began to hate the stock as if it were a human being who was being purposefully cruel. Meanwhile, despite the argument over RemoteCount, Lisa was warmer toward him, and they had even hired a sitter one night and slipped out to see The Piano, which had a couple of hot scenes between Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel드 couple of hot adulterous scenes, Nicholas noted. In the darkness of the movie theater he slipped a glance at Lisa. Her face was a mask of rapture as the two naked bodies embraced on the huge screen. He looked away. <p>But when they got home, she said she wanted to apologize for her outburst a few nights back. 늋ou should have discussed the idea with me, but I guess I could have reacted better, she said, getting him a beer from the refrigerator. 뉼 mean, I didn뇺 catch all the details, but it sounds like a pretty smart deal.<p>What accounted for Lisa뇹 sudden pleasantness? Having just seen that movie, he thought bitterly, she believed in true love tonight. Then again, he had been something of a jerk not to tell her of the RemoteCount play. He뇫 try to be agreeable. 뉼뇴 just waiting for it to drop, he said.<p>늉ill you explain the whole thing to me again? I got so worked up the other night that I was hardly listening.<p>She listened intently as he laid out the whole play. She was a good listener and quickly  caught on.<p>뉻ow much do you think we could make? Lisa asked. 늀aybe twenty or thirty thousand?<p>뉻ard to say. It would be better not to get her hopes up too high. 뉼f it went well, really well, and the stock dropped to $30 a share, say, that would be about $97,000.<p>His wife stared at him. Really?<p>Really.<p>
The next afternoon, he got an urgent call from Jane.<p>늁icholas, it뇹 at 493/4, and my guess is that it뇳l hit 50 any time.<p>늉hat뇹 going on? Why didn뇺 you call me when it hit 49?<p>뉵ecause it happened fast. One of the technology analysts gave it a buy this morning.<p>뉻e뇹 an asshole. Now, look, you should have called me immediately<p>늁icholas, you have a stop order at 50. I don뇺 have to call you듳ou have already decided what youre doing. I called as a matter of courtesy딊<p>뉶ancel the stop-loss, he ordered suddenly.<p>늉hat?<p>뉶ancel it, he insisted. 뉷on뇺 sell at 50.<p>늉ait a minute, you worked out how much you were willing to lose.<p>뉼뇴 changing my mind.<p>늆his is not the way to make decisions. Youre not a professional trader.<p>뉶ancel the stop-loss. Please do it now.<p>뉴nd what, said Jane, exasperated, 늡hould I replace it with?<p>Yes, of course, she had to put in some kind of stop-loss order. <p>늉hat뇹 my margin here? I had some kind of 10 percent overage in my account, right?<p>뉼t was 10 percent of 47, which is 4.7, which, rounded down, is four and five eighths. If you add that to 47딊<p>늃ut in the stop loss at 511/2.<p>늆hat leaves you exactly one eighth of a point. We can뇺 do this again.<p>늋es.<p>늋ou don뇺 have any more money, Nicholas. If it hits 511/2, I뇴 not going to listen to any noise about sticking more money into your account.<p>He heard the anger in her voice. 늋es, Jane.<p>늁ow you better fax me instructions to cancel the stop-loss at 50 and to put in a new one at 511/2.<p>Which he did. At the end of the day he called Jane to get the quote. Sure, he was being an asshole, but it was his money on the line; he뇫 bought the right to be an asshole. But there was no answer. Jane was gone for the day.<p>
That night he forced himself not to call the brokerage for the price and instead watched the CNN business report, and of course, there was no mention of why RemoteCount had gone up and how far. Who cared? Nobody. It was a nothing stock. Perhaps ten people in America really cared듢ot sweaty balls듮hinking about RemoteCount, and six of them were probably RemoteCount executives. They knew the stock was going to tank. He뇫 seen this pattern. It had to happen. The company made all of its money with 1,400 people sitting in front of screens in one large facility in Seattle that had EMF readings above 3,000 mG. RemoteCount would be forced to shut down and tear the hell out of the building in order to correct the problem. The RemoteCount executives were all cheats and liars afraid to tell their stockholders what was happening to the company. They were sitting at home and telling their wives they뇫 better not buy the Lexus right now. They couldn뇺 sell their own RemoteCount holdings, of course, because that might be insider trading and also could trigger the landslide. Nicholas hated them. They were killing him.<p>
The next morning he walked outside in the cold in his bathrobe, ripped the Times out of its plastic bag, snatched the business section, folded the rest of the paper under his arm, and flipped to the stock tables. RemoteCount had closed at 511/4. Death! Somebody was buying the stock! Today the price would probably vibrate up to 511/2, and there would be nothing he could do about it! Jane뇹 computers would sell his position, and the effect of the whole insane fantasy would have been that he had given away $18,000등hat was that? A Ford Taurus? No. The Taurus ran higher. But certainly a Ford Aerostar minivan. Driver뇹-side airbag, antilock braking system. I뇳l take it in Cayman green with mocha interior trim.<p>When he got to the office, Hal Gruber, his immediate boss, came in. 뉺irardi called Belton last night.<p>Nicholas looked up. He뇫 forgotten about Girardi Corp.<p>늉hat뇫 he say?<p>늉hat did he say? Gruber exclaimed. 뉻e said he wanted to do a three-year deal, and he asked if we were thinking of expanding in Washington, D.C., and needed investors!<p>Really?<p>Gruber slapped him on the shoulder and shook his hand. 뉼 don뇺 know what you said to him down there but jeez, Nicholas, great job. Really great job. Jeez, I mean, Belton was really pleased.<p>Nicholas arranged his features into something resembling a hearty grin. What did it mean, really? Two bosses pleased, a few more pieces of candy in the Christmas bonus. He was still inconsolable. After Gruber left, he pushed the paper around on his desk absentmindedly. He had no interest in calling Jane. Why hasten the bad news? How would he face Lisa? She뇫 been so excited, so happy, when he뇫 told her the workings of the RemoteCount play. She뇫 talked about Ohio, how nice it would be to live near her mother again. Take care of her. And the kids would love being in the country. He뇫 let all of them down.<p>So, right before lunch, when he received the phone message that Jane had just called, he wondered how he would ever get Lisa and the kids out of the city. He couldn뇺 work for Belton Associates the rest of his life. He wanted out, he wanted grass. There had been another incident in their neighborhood recently, a hit-and-run with some Bronx kids whacked out on drugs. A four-year-old was on a respirator, severe brain swelling. When the cops arrived, it got even worse. The kids in the car inexplicably started shooting at them, and the police had been forced to shoot two of the kids. And Billy Meyer had seen a dead man on the sidewalk. And that lunatic had killed a bunch of people on the Long Island Railroad a few months back. This was 1994. What would it be like in 1999? Perhaps he was never going to get his kids and wife out of the sinkhole of New York City. His loss on RemoteCount made the goal even moreremote. Ha, no pun intended! Hell, he thought, get it over with. Life is a series of bets, and sometimes you lose! Yes! He knew that all along! Ha! He shut his office door and punched Jane뇹 speed-dial button on his console. <p>뉽ane?<p>늁icholas, finally! RemoteCount is down to around 38!<p>늉hat?<p>뉼 tried you when it hit 46, she said in excitement. 늆heyre dumping on the West Coast. Calpers sold its entire position.<p>뉴nybody else selling yet?<p>뉼 can뇺 find out. I got a couple of calls in.... Wait, here it is듮he volume is huge, it뇹 at 363/4. The Seattle paper has a long story on closing the facility this morning, Jane said excitedly. 늆hat뇹 what kicked it off. Let me read you the article; I had the whole thing faxed to me. It just came out. Here, it뇹 their business writer. 넨mployees leaving the building yesterday afternoon, some carrying personal items, expressed complete shock at the announcement and worried about making a living in the coming months. 늆hey said they don뇺 know when theyre going to let us in again, said Shanelle Johnson, a data entry clerk.눖<p>뉷oes it say anything about the stock? Nicholas asked.<p>뉼t quotes a local analyst who says that he expects that the company will lose market share.<p>늋eah, I guess so. They뇳l have no market for at least six months.<p>늉ait, also, he says that he expects the company뇹 debt will be downgraded.<p>뉶all me when you get another price, okay?<p>He almost called Lisa; no, he thought, better to wait until the deal is finished; he뇫 go home that evening and give her the exact figure, down to the penny. Instead he went out and treated himself to a big lunch at the Oyster Bar, and then felt too happy to go back to the office. So he wandered into a hardware store two avenues to the east and charged up a new shovel, rake, trowel, and leather work gloves. Sure, it was silly! But wasn뇺 life!<p>And just as he returned at 3 p.m., Jane called again.<p>늆he stock뇹 at 13. Someone bought 3,000 shares at 13.<p>늆hirteen? It seemed impossible.<p>늋oure making serious money here, Nicholas. All the pensions are dumping. Theyre being quite ruthless, positioning themselves for a bounce.<p>늉e have to sell on an uptick, right?<p>늋es.<p>늅hould I sell now?<p>A pause.<p>늁o, she said. 늂ur guy who specializes in technology stocks says he thinks the 3,000 shares is someone trying to stabilize the stock, somebody who owns a lot more still. See, it뇹 only been bought a couple of times on the way down.

Jane might have guessed at the rough price that the other broker at her firm would suggest to his own trading clients. They뇫 know the fundamentals of the company and decide to buy at a certain price, which would make a market for the stock again. The sudden buying volume might attract more buying. But now he was scared and wanted to get out. 뉻ow about 111/2?<p>늂kay, Jane said. 뉼뇳l call when I뇼e got the uptick. Under 11 is going to be no problem is my guess.<p>

Better yet, come into the city and we뇳l see a show, maybe Angels in America, which from its title sounded optimistic, good fun. But there was no answer. Tommy was old enough to pick up the phone. Strange. He left a message saying he뇫 be home soon with big news. Maybe they went out, but Lisa usually ran her errands after picking the kids up from school. He always called at the end of the day. He felt both irritated and fearful. Perhaps someone had broken into the house, perhaps듣e pushed back the possibilities. He glanced at his watch; 4:56 p.m. If the kids had been picked up at the end of their day, at 2:50 p.m., then that meant that all was normal up to that point. Then again, if they hadn뇺 been picked up, the school would have called him, since his office number was on the emergency form. He got the number of the school, dialed it, and reached the lower-school principal뇹 office.<p>He quickly explained to the principal, Mrs. Kroeber, that he was checking to see that his wife had picked up their kids. Was there any way she could check?<p>뉼f your children were still here, I would know about it, she said firmly. <p>Right. Of course.<p>뉴re you worried about them?<p>늉ell, no, I have no reason.... I called home, and there뇹 no answer.<p>Mrs. Kroeber didn뇺 respond. There was an appraising silence on the other end of the line. He knew she saw all kinds of family situations. <p>뉿et me check something, she finally said.<p>While he waited he worked out Jane Chung뇹 commission. It was figured on the number of shares bought and sold and came out to just over $3200, which seemed pretty slim pickings when you considered that she had helped to put $216,000 into his pocket. But then again, he and not Jane had taken all the risk, so<p>늀r. Wren, your children never came to school today.<p>늉hat? <p>뉼 said your children didn뇺 come to school today.

Mrs. Costello downstairs called around 11, she says, but there was no answer at your home. So I suggest that you딊<p>But he was already hanging up and pulling on his coat. <p>
The Camry was not in the driveway as he huffed along the sidewalk from the train station. The house was dark. He fumbled for his keys in the cold, pushed through the front door. 뉿isa? he called, flicking on lights. But nothing. Inside, on the dining-room table, set at his place, were some papers. He snatched them up. First: Letterhead from the law firm where Lisa worked, addressed to him, his eyes flitting to the crucial sentence: 늗as retained my services to assist in the preparation of divorce filings before the New York State Supreme Court, County of Westchester. Two pages later, the formal filing: WHEREAS, Lisa Wren, legal wife of Nicholas Wren, residing atseeks a no-fault judgment in the matter of<p>He sat down. <p>She was gone, the kids in the back of the Camry, headed where? Ohio, he assumed. He knew he could walk upstairs and find that the suitcases were not in the closet and that the kids dressers would be missing a lot of clothes, that Lisa had probably taken some of her jewelry, a few photo albums. But where had she gone? He could only assume that she was halfway to Ohio, maybe spending the night somewhere in Pennsylvania, maybe at a Motel 6등hose stock had really done well two years ago. They뇫 arrive at her mother뇹 house the next afternoon. <p>But when had they left? The kids had not been in school all day, which suggested she뇫 left that morning, just after him. He looked at the date on the law-firm letter. Today. Of course, the papers had been prepared ahead of time. Just a word-processing file at the law firm듞hange the names and addresses and blow up a family. He examined the second page of the letter, which helpfully summarized the key tenets of New York State divorce law. Joint divisible assets, etc. Then: 뉴lthough the brokerage account at... represented by Ms. Jane Chung is listed in your name only, it quite clearly falls within the joint property of the marriage and no further trading, liquidating of positions, reinvestment, etc. may be done in this account without the advance written agreement of Lisa Wren. Kindly have your attorney forward to me a complete accounting of 1) all sums invested, 2) dividends or interest received, and 3) capital gains....<p>He flipped the papers to the table, then picked them up and reread them. It was all very clear. Why had she given up on him? Things had been bad, but they hadn뇺 even discussed...this. He wandered into the kitchen, frowning. Was there something in this he had missed? He was blasted by shock; yes, he would no doubt be drinking later that night; yes, he was falling into a crevasse of grief, but, before that happened, before he gave himself over to all of it, there was... something... a logical question, an irritating matter of sequence. The papers were dated that day, signed by the attorney. Attorneys didn뇺 falsify dates. The papers had been signed today, picked up at the law office. That meant that Lisa had not left for Ohio immediately after he뇫 departed for work. She뇫 driven to the law office with the kids in the car and picked up the papers about the time the office opened, 9:30 or 10. Then, he figured, she뇫 driven back to the house, dropped off the papers, loaded the car, then gotten started on the day뇹 long drive. He drifted over to the sink, looked at the plastic children뇹 cups in the drainer, cartoon figures dancing across them. All Disney licensing. The stock had been murdered recently, the parent company taking huge losses on the EuroDisney park that had flopped in France. Chairman Eisner hadn뇺 even been awarded a bonus.<p>Nicholas Wren looked, for no reason, into his kitchen sink. Resting on the stainless steel edge of the drain, poised to fall in, was a lima bean. Wrinkled and pale green. Lisa had cooked it for Sally, he knew, and as if to commune with his children even as they sped through the dark night away from him, he picked up the lima bean and placed it between his teeth. <p>And bit. The bean was warm. Or rather, it was not cold. Dinner! They had eaten dinner at home! Lisa had fed Tommy and Sally dinner and then left for Ohio. Maybe an hour ago! But why leave so late? Why delay? It was sort of hard on the kids, and Lisa would have them foremost in her mind. Clearly she had planned to leave earlier in the day, but then been delayed. Second thoughts? Her mother telling her not to come? Richard Chambers making a swan song? He went over to the phone. It blinked with a message ready. He hit the play button. Maybe this was it. Maybe she and Chambers<p>뉻i, it뇹 me, came his own voice, made hopeful by the certainty of money, 느nd I have some big news딊 How pathetic and foolish he sounded. Then he had another idea. Perhaps Lisa had called her mother to say she would be leaving later than expected. He hit the phone뇹 redial number. A sequence of tones followed 든nough, he could tell, that the number wasn뇺 local. If her mother picked up, he뇫 somberly tell her he knew that Lisa and the kids were on their way and would she please ask Lisa to at least call him when they arrived safely. Then he would not have to worry that<p>늄uotronex, a woman뇹 voice answered, 늘s pleased to serve your investment-information needs.

No doubt she뇫 been tracking the RemoteCount price ever since he explained the play to her. And surely she뇫 called for a quote that morning and seen that the price was dropping. And called back. Been a quote junkie all day. Just like him. As the price dropped, it would have been more difficult to leave for Ohio. Oh, yes, it must have been an exciting day for her. He shook his head at the beauty of it all. He뇫 asked her to trust him, and she had. And then she뇫 locked in her gain, serving the papers on him just after his short play had succeeded. Yes, he뇫 always known she was smarter! Ha, ha! What a smart wife he had! He took a pencil and paper from next to the phone and did a few calculations. Their gross worth minus their debts, today뇹 profits, after commissions, multiplied by their federal tax rate, which was the one applied to short-term capital gains. A certain symmetricality to the figures emerged, give or take ten thousand.... Why, yes, he figured, how unusual, how strange, that when he and Lisa came to divide up their assets, today뇹 winnings would constitute half their holdings, which meant드nd this was what finally broke Nicholas Wren on that February night after his train ride home from the city듮hat the magnificent profits of his brilliant short play would become exactly what he had never imagined: his divorce settlement, proof of a family destroyed. <p>--------<p>Colin Harrison뇹 most recent novel is Bodies Electric (Crown, 1993).<p>

						<p>Is money a threat? Can it provide peace of mind? Or freedom? Grappling with these issues can be a lifelong battle.<p>By Robert Kotlowitz<p>There are people in this world who are afraid of money. I know, because I have battled this issue myself a lot. Psychiatrists have told me my fear of money is a cover-up, that I'm really afraid of something else, that I'm confused. Maybe so, but I doubt it. I think it is real and always has been, ever since my childhood during the Depression, when money was not an especially friendly object or even a very common one. Back in those days, you really had to seek it out and tease it into existence, holding onto it as though it were life itself. Of course, that is the nature of all depressions.<p>The Depression was not called the Depression for nothing. More than the economy was depressed. We all were, children and adults alike. My psyche seems to have suffered more or less permanent damage. The effects linger to this day. For instance, I hate debt. I loathe it so much that I have refused to take out a mortgage--two houses so far, both bought in full with a single cash payment. I haven't bought a car, or anything else, on time. Debt unnerves me. I view it as something that corrodes the spirit. And it is far too real. It's an inescapable presence in our lives, built to last.<p>I also don't like hearing about the stock market. When it comes to reading the morning paper, I'd almost rather peruse the obituaries than the financial pages. To me, the news is just as awful: market drops, lowered bond rates, corporate failures, mass layoffs. When I see those headlines, my courage sometimes fails me. I block. My day's mood--the way I will see and respond to the world--can be set over breakfast by bad news about money. Even my fantasies are at stake.<p>I happen to know the exact moment that I was first gripped by the fear of money--the sense that there never would be enough, no matter how much I would make one day; the shyness in its presence; the assurance that while the world might be my oyster, money was for other people.<p>I was seven when one of my pals, who was probably too smart for his own good and certainly for mine, began to quiz me. We were at recess. We were both wearing scruffy Depression clothes, full of holes that we tried to hide from each other. My pal asked me this: "Does your old man make 40 bucks a week?"<p>That stopped me cold. I had never thought of the matter before. Yet the question felt very close to the bone, maybe too close. I had no answer, and that was unnerving, too. I felt helpless. And the question threw my own father's probity into doubt. Even though I was only seven, I certainly knew it was an important issue. The Depression was a time when earning money was the central issue in every American household.<p>Did my old man make 40 bucks a week?<p>It is important at this point to understand that I grew up as the son of a clergyman. Now clergymen are often wonderful people-- staunch, faithful, exhortative, and other positive things--but rich they cannot be. Possibly as a result, money is often denigrated in the clergyman's home. It is positioned among the lesser values, something to turn one's back on. It is even claimed to be the root of all evil, a notion that has its charms when there is little money around.<p>But my grade-school chum's question still hung over me like an accusation, one I could not easily escape. Did my old man make 40 bucks a week? When I got up the nerve to ask, my father was not able to relieve my anxiety. In fact, he laughed in my face, not joyously, as I remember it. He also looked slightly crazed, then withdrew. Such was his anxiety about money. I never got a straight answer, then or later. (Over time, I learned that he always avoided the subject, always looked slightly crazed when it came up.) So money became something I was going to have to figure out for myself. I had to figure out what it meant, why there was so little of it. And I had to do this while fear settled inside me, the acrid fear of childhood.<p>For a while, then, $40 a week, almost $2,100 a year, became a standard for me. As far as I knew, that's what you had to have to amount to anything. Or even to be safe. And what could $40 a week add up to? At the time, I calculated that it would pay the rent on our row house; assure us of heat in the winter; provide telephone service (limited), gas, and electricity; clothe us (basically); feed us; and enable us to read the newspaper every day--delivered by hand to our front porch--and take in a weekly movie (15 cents for me). I also had a piano lesson every Sunday for 50 cents. Providing all that, which seems a lot when I catalog it this way, was what was called, then, "making a living," a concept that has now disappeared from the lexicon of the American dream, like so many other primitive notions.<p>Slowly, I grew more sophisticated. I read about the salaries of movie stars. I began to understand the extent of certain great family fortunes: Rockefeller, Vanderbilt, Astor, and many others. My vistas broadened. By the time I was ten years old, 40 bucks a week, as a standard, was out. It was superseded during a walk I took with my grandfather down New York's Park Avenue. This gentleman, who was something of a dandy even in the worst of times, was also a freelance custom tailor (another man of the cloth) who had occasional access to great homes and rich patrons, with whom he plied his trade on a rather perfunctory basis.<p>My grandfather's attitude toward money was basic, if not crude: "I want it when I need it" just about sums it up. In other words, a child's view, like mine. In any case, as we wandered down Park Avenue, where my grandfather had several customers, he eyed the handsome buildings that lined the street and suddenly said: "You have to make $10,000 a year to be able to live in one of those apartments."<p>Ten thousand dollars a year! As though I had asked. The figure rattled around inside my head, like fruit in a one-armed bandit. What did $10,000 a year mean? It was incalculable, infinite, totally abstract, like the national debt today. It was also intimidating, scary, and surely unattainable by the likes of me, to say nothing of my old man. Ten thousand dollars a year was for other people, those who were not afraid of money, who seemed at one with it, at their ease; those, in short, who had it coming to them. Those who had chosen to live on Park Avenue and did.<p>I would say that that moment changed my life. The grit of ambition settled into my bones at my grandfather's airy words, edging fear out for the first time. They were a challenge. They gave me a dim sense that perhaps I might be one of those who had it coming to them, if I chose to be. In short, that it was in my power to control money, not vice versa. I would go for it.<p>I got it, too, but not in any dramatic sense. The only problem was that the target kept shifting. Ten thousand dollars a year was soon made obsolete by $30,000, and $30,000, of course, by...well, you name it. But my confidence grew; that was the point, although it had to be constantly nurtured, like a candle threatening to go out in the prevailing winds. And of course there are always plenty of blustery threats out there to nourish the fear of money, the ongoing anxiety about the sweet crinkly green that feeds the body and lifts the spirit. And what if the whole delicate balance of international finance crashes again, like the house of cards it sometimes seems to be?<p>As I suggested earlier, fear breeds fantasy, and I have become a great dreamer about money over the years, especially when shaving in the morning. Huge abstractions wash over my mind as I wield the razor in front of the mirror. Sometimes I stumble onto $8 million in my morning dreams (inherited, lottery-won, unexpected royalties--every man has his own list). How to divvy it up among my family, how to make my wife, my children, and myself both safe and happy? How to invest, how to save, how to spend? Who gets what?<p>One morning not long ago, the $8 million, which has a nice, even ring to it, took a natural turn and swelled to $80 million, which rings even more nicely, then $800 million, and finally--jackpot!--$1 billion. With $1 billion in hand, I entered the land of Oz. Everything was suddenly in color, I walked on bricks made of gold, the world worked as I dreamed as a child it would. And my natural generosity was liberated. First, I would give $500 million to medical research, right off the bat. Then $250 million to literacy, education, and minority opportunities. Another $200 million to selected institutions whose survival and growth I deem essential to the commonweal. The rest--a mere $50 million--to me and my family and perhaps a few friends (they know who they are), all of us strong, purposeful, valiant, and unafraid. Especially me.<p>One thing I've learned: The fear of money is very close to the fear of being lost, of being set adrift without power or autonomy. I think that both my father and my grandfather shared this sense of helplessness (who didn't then?) and that each, in his own way, helped to pass it on to me. They had no choice. How vulnerable they must have felt about money, like most of their contemporaries. I like to think it's behind me now. I like to think I've thrown it off, that I'm no longer under constraint. But the fact is I'm still always looking over my shoulder to make sure I'm ahead of the game, still wary, still nervous. Maybe that's not so bad, after all. Maybe it's a positive thing. It certainly makes sure that I pay close attention to the subject, that I actually think about money rationally. And I am still free to pursue wealth, to take a dare and choose courage. Some day, even a billion dollars won't seem like so much.<p>Robert Kotlowitz's most recent novel is His Master's Voice (Knopf, 1992).<p><p>

Does your relationship need a major adjustment?<p>By Jill Andresky Fraser<p>For all the attention paid to hiring one, little if any information is available about when--and how--to fire a financial advisor. Yet avoiding or delaying a decision to cut the cord can be quite costly. <p>All too often clients are intimidated or confused about their rights and expectations in their relationships with financial planners, brokers, and accountants. Many people have a sense something's wrong but resist taking action because they don't know who else to go to or whether it's even worth the effort. And there's that guilt factor about firing someone you like personally. "I see these kinds of delays very often," says David Shellenberger, a Boston-based attorney who specializes in investor claims against financial advisors. "It's psychologically very difficult for people to understand that their trust has been breached. So they delay, often for years." <p>Of course there's nothing to be gained by waiting to fire an incompetent or unethical advisor. To make the decision, it's often helpful to have objective guidelines that indicate when it's time to call it quits. Although every situation is different, there are three clear warning signs that an advisory relationship isn't working:<p>--Poor results. Does your financial planner or stockbroker seem to consistently recommend strategies that don't work out as planned? Are you getting audited or penalized by the IRS regularly over tax plays your accountant recommended? When you evaluate your family's financial results, do you suspect you would have been better off investing on your own? To establish an objective basis on which to evaluate performance, clearly set out in writing the goals your advisor is expected to help you achieve and the results you expect to move your portfolio toward that end. Use specific numbers and deadlines whenever possible--for example, beat the market index, earn a 7 percent after-tax annual return, increase life-insurance coverage to $500,000 by the end of the first quarter, etc. Your expectations should be clear, reasonable, agreed to by both parties, and most important, measurable. Then set a time to meet and review the results. And while nobody's perfect, don't be too quick to overlook an advisor's shortcomings. "You've got to aggressively question your advisor about what went wrong in the past and how things will be different in the future. If you're not satisfied with the answers or explanations, move on," advises John Perkins, the securities commissioner of Missouri. <p>--Communication problems. These can run the gamut, warns Christine Bruenn, supervisor of enforcement for the Securities Administration of Maine, from advisors who don't return telephone calls promptly to those who "don't listen to your priorities about risks and returns." If, for whatever reason, you feel you just can't get through to your advisor, complain once or twice--then take your family's business elsewhere.<p>Don't dismiss intangible concerns, such as a feeling that you're just not comfortable with your advisor. They can reflect a sensitivity to high-pressure tactics or high-risk recommendations that are inappropriate for you. If you don't feel comfortable, there's probably a reason.<p>One caveat: Sometimes clients themselves are the problem, as when, in Perkins's words, "they tell their advisors that they don't want to be involved in risky investments but they want to earn large returns." In such cases, it's up to advisors to communicate the trade-offs between those two goals and to help clients set more realistic expectations. But the client also has to help.<p>--Churning and burning. Here's where advisors may cross the fuzzy boundary between incompetent and unethical activities--and in egregious cases, clients might even want to think about suing, as well as firing, an advisor. <p>One obvious no-no: Transactions (purchasing stocks, transferring funds between accounts, paying fees) that take place without approval or authorization from the client. Often the only way to identify that this has happened is by analyzing bank, brokerage, and other regular financial statements. That's a good reason not to rely on an advisor to read and file these for you.<p>Another all-too-common warning sign is account churning. "Watch out for advisors that keep pushing you to carry out an excessively high volume of transactions," warns Stephen Diamond, Maine's securities administrator. Remember that you pay, and your broker earns, a commission every time you buy and every time you sell a stock. Make sure each transaction that a broker suggests makes investment sense to you.<p>Here's the bottom line: You, not your financial advisor, are your family's last line of defense in the investment arena. It's up to you to supervise your advisor's performance and, when you're not satisfied, move on.<p>Fortunately, the act of firing a financial advisor is nowhere near as difficult as deciding whether or not to fire him or her. The key point: Do it by mail (return receipt requested) rather than by telephone. It's not as personal, but a letter preserves a record of your complete instructions, including the date the relationship was terminated. <p>If you suspect you might have some grounds for a legal complaint against your advisor, "hire a lawyer to prepare your termination letter," advises Shellenberger. "The letter should be very straightforward, directing the advisor to terminate the account, effective immediately, and to transfer promptly all financial records, securities, and other documents to an authorized location." <p>Above all, avoid recriminations or complaints. Shellenberger warns, "If you make any statements in your letter about why you're ending the relationship, you might end up limiting your rights and ability to sue later on because you failed to disclose other problems. It's better to end the relationship first, then decide upon other actions if appropriate." <p><p>

						A faddish investment technique called momentum investing has propelled stock prices into the heavens. What happens when the fad fades?<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>Folks who had the good fortune to be in the stock market last year enjoyed one delightful ride. In spite of some dizzying dives in individual stocks or the occasional industry group, 1993 was stellar for equities. <p>The biggest winners were shareholders in the small-capitalization companies, as the averages show. Hands-down winner was the Russell 2000, an index of small-cap stocks, which had increased some 15 percent by mid-December. <p>An only slightly lesser performer was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 13 percent. In third place was the Nasdaq composite, an index of 4,400 companies that was up 12.5 percent last year; trailing was the larger-capitalization S&P 500 index, up only 6.5 percent on the year.<p>Hoping for more of the same, investors are piling into the stocks and mutual funds that won 1993's capital-gains race. Will they be handsomely rewarded once again? Maybe so, but markets rarely stay the same long enough to reward investors assiduously chasing last year's trend. <p>Particularly worrisome is the recent nature of that trend. As more money floods into the stock market, increasing numbers of fund and money managers are taking up a method of investing that has all the earmarks of the latest stock market fad. It's called momentum investing.<p>Unlike past investment fashions, the fad of the moment hasn't affixed itself to a particular group of stocks; neither does it revolve around an industry. What the investment trendies are up to today is a method of stock picking that relies little on how a company is doing--the so-called fundamental analysis of an operation's net worth, business prospects, or balance sheets. Instead, it focuses on how the company's stock is doing. <p>Like all Wall Street fads, momentum investing is beautiful in its simplicity. If a stock's price is going up, it's a buy. When it stops going up, it's a sell. In the world of physics, momentum is motion conjoined with force. In the world of investing, momentum is the motion of a stock conjoined with the force of the herd. <p>Steven Vannelli is a money manager at KJMM Investment Management in San Francisco who has been watching the momentum game play out for some months now. Investors should be concerned about how the game will end, says Vannelli. "The danger with momentum investing is it's great in an up market, hell in a down market," he says. <p>The fuel that has been driving stocks skyward is indeed a volatile mix: low inflation, low interest rates, and increased levels of corporate efficiency, which translate to higher margins and earnings among issuers. Last, but by no means least, is investors' apparently insatiable appetite for investments that will return something greater than the 2.5 percent rate currently found in bank CDs. It is this craving that explains the $411 billion investors poured into stock mutual funds in the last half of 1993, a figure that was up 39 percent from the year before.<p>All in all, it's the perfect environment for creating the newest high-octane investment fad. All rising markets have them. In the bull market of the 1960s, the no-brainer investment strategy revolved around the Nifty Fifty--a group of stocks, including Avon, National Student Marketing, and <a name="NYSE:EK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10500"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kodak</b></a>, that could do no wrong for investors. The bear market of 1974 brought that little fantasy to an end. Then, in the early 1980s, anything to do with high technology became a stock market darling. Until the summer of 1983, that is, when tech stocks crashed to earth. Alas, all good investment fads must come to an end.<p>Momentum investing--investors looking for price action in a stock, bond, or commodity and hopping on for the ride--is nothing new. In the 1970s, it was more popular in the commodities pits than it was on stock exchange floors. It was known then as "trend following," and crafty traders made money with it for several years until the commodities became virtually trendless. Then the followers had nothing to follow. In the 1980s, adherents to what we now call the momentum school were more often known as "relative strength" players, because they looked for strength in stock prices.<p>Today, however, the use of actual earnings growth among momentum players has been superseded by investors who buy stocks largely on recent price behavior. As one money manager explained it, these investors seem to believe that buying on price jumps is a shortcut to the same end. Why waste time slogging through financial statements looking for earnings growth? If a stock's price is rising, it's probably because somebody else who has done the analysis likes it and is buying.<p>When momentum investors buy a stock, their thinking goes something like this: You like it, I like it, maybe we can find a third person who'll like it too. As long as buyers continue to snap up the stock, all is well; like a rocket leaving the launching pad, momentum looks unstoppable, initially. Trouble comes when investors have pushed the stock as high as it will go and a few start to bail. Then, momentum slows, and suddenly, the very reason everyone bought the stock in the first place has disappeared. Everybody heads for the exits at once. When the only reason to buy a stock is based on its rising price, there's little reason to hold when it begins its descent. <p>This explains the violent and seemingly inexplicable downdrafts that are often seen in stocks today. Shares in Household International, for example, dropped almost 8 percent in one day's trading in early December when the financial-services company said its 1994 earnings would likely be at the lower end of analysts' projections. The momentum crowd is also the force behind the troubling volatility evidenced in certain industry groups (see "Swings in the Sectors").<p>Just how popular is momentum investing? Exact numbers of money managers playing the game are hard to come by--they're certainly not listed as such in fund directories. Equally difficult to pin down are numbers of assets currently controlled by momentum players. Part of the problem, according to some fund types, is that few folks want to admit to being proponents. <p>Arthur Nicholas, for example, head of the hugely successful Nicholas-Applegate money-management group ($12 billion under management), hates being described as a momentum player. This in spite of the fact that his portfolio managers count heavily on price and earnings momentum when picking stocks for institutional clients and mutual fund portfolios. The momentum label trivializes his investment style, says Nicholas. Buying stocks based on price moves just doesn't have the gravitas that investors demand of their money managers. <p>Still, the strategy is becoming more mainstream every day. Money manager Vannelli believes momentum investors are an enormous force in today's market. "There's so much money being run by people who don't even read annual reports today," he says. "Huge numbers of investors--insurance companies, mutual fund managers--just buy the momentum." <p>Amy Arnott, an analyst at Morningstar, a mutual fund-analysis firm in Chicago, agrees that momentum investing is on the rise in the fund business. "I've noticed more portfolio managers talking about it," she says. "Plus, when you see a lot of people piling into the same stocks, that's probably the reason." <p>Momentum investing was also behind a big December pitch made to investors and prospects by Carlton Lutts, editor of the Cabot Market Letter, an investment newsletter. Calling his investment strategy the Momentum System 1000, Lutts says it is the secret to "turning $5,000 into $225,000 with just one stock." Lutts writes, "I have discovered what I call the single most important tool for picking winning stocks: Momentum Analysis." When an investing strategy is sold through the mails, you know it's mainstream.<p>Here's some evidence that points to an increase in momentum players among mutual fund managers today: The average turnover ratio of aggressive-growth stock funds, as measured by Morningstar, is up significantly from premomentum levels of a decade ago. <p>How many times a fund manager turns over his portfolio in one year--a 100 percent ratio means a manager has bought and sold the equivalent of his entire portfolio during the year--can be revealing of the fund manager's style. Momentum players, by their very nature, have higher turnover ratios than value investors do; this is because price players move in and out of stocks more quickly--they're happy to abandon a stock simply because it is no longer rising fast enough. Other types of investors are more patient and turn over their portfolios less frequently. <p>It's not surprising, then, that over the past ten years, the average annual turnover rate among aggressive-growth funds--where most momentum players can be found--has increased by 67 percent. Compare this to the averages among other equity-fund categories: Turnover among small-cap-fund managers, for example, grew just 12 percent over the decade, while the average growth and income fund turned over its portfolio just 16 percent more than it used to. And turnover rates among foreign-stock-fund managers actually declined 16 percent during the decade.<p>Another measure of momentum's new acceptance among investors? The cover of the November issue of Institutional Investor, a publication read by professional money managers, celebrates Richard Driehaus, a Chicago-based money manager and big momentum player. And, Wall Street sources say, momentum investing has even trickled down to the ranks of retail brokers, who are pitching their clients on the merits of investing with the herd.<p>People in the fund-management business observe that even former value investors are jumping on the momentum trend. This worries market observers who note that when investors change their strategies midstream, it often signals the beginning of the end of a strong market. Michael Long, principal of Rockbridge Partners, an investment firm in Charlotte, North Carolina, says: "More value types have capitulated to momentum theory. The only way for managers to get money from investors is to be in stocks that have done well." In other words, the biggest movers.<p>Long's point is key to understanding why momentum investing is surging in popularity today. Each new billion that cascades into stock mutual fund coffers puts money managers into this ever more tremendous bind: "How on earth should I invest this money intelligently?" It's a nice problem to have--too much money--but it is a problem nonetheless. The apparent solution, to more and more managers: Invest with the crowd.<p>Veterans of the momentum approach to investing stress that it can only work properly if combined with diligent fundamental analysis. Columbine Capital, a money-management firm in Colorado Springs, has supplied a price-momentum investment model to institutional clients since the late 1970s. The firm studies 12 months of a stock's price moves, corrects the data for excess volatility, and ranks the stock for "relative momentum." John Brush, president of Columbine says, "This gives considerable predictive power, relative to all other stocks. It's a helpful addition to the valuation of stocks. But nobody in their right mind invests on price momentum alone." <p>No? Some of the biggest names in momentum investing today (see "Momentum Mutual Funds") seem to be straying well beyond the boundaries that disciplined adherents, like Brush, stick to. For example, Columbine excludes all new issues from its model --a stock must have at least a year's worth of trading behind it before it has any predictive capabilities. Yet Dreihaus, the momentum trader profiled in Institutional Investor, bets early and often in the new-issue market. So does Catherine Avery, a portfolio manager at Nicholas-Applegate, who runs a $2.3 billion (assets) emerging-growth portfolio. <p>Initial public offerings that skyrocket in price right out of the gate--Snapple Beverage, Boston Chicken, and Callaway Golf are three examples--become immediate favorites of momentum investors if only because their stocks suddenly jump. <p>How does a momentum player make investment decisions? Most fund managers don't like to reveal their secrets, but the process seems to go something like this. Because the fund manager trades constantly through many different brokerage firms, he or she is likely to get the first call from a broker offering shares in a hot IPO. The manager buys all he can, knowing it is likely to rise substantially because there are not enough shares to satisfy investor demand. He also agrees to buy more shares in the open market after they begin trading. As other investors, shut out of the initial offering, snap up the stock, its price typically continues to rise. This action confirms to the momentum investor that he should stay in the stock.<p>Selling time comes when something about the stock's prospects--sales, earnings, or even its price--starts to crest. Maybe there's a sense on Wall Street that the industry the company's in is going to slow its growth. Or the money manager may simply feel there are faster-moving stocks elsewhere that are better buys. Before you can say, "Fire!" everybody's crowding the door.<p>As practiced today, momentum investing can pretty much be summed up this way: aggressive money chasing yesterday's highfliers. Says fund manager Long, "People can't find any other reason to justify paying these prices for stocks, so they call it momentum." Although the practice is not totally responsible for sky-high stock valuations today--both price-to-earnings ratios and book values on the major equity indexes are at all-time highs --it has certainly contributed to rich stock prices. And it has made some sectors of the market much more volatile than before. <p>The trouble is, those rocketing returns of yesterday are what every mutual fund, brokerage firm, and managed-account investor is looking to his fund managers to beat tomorrow. As Tom Wolfe would say, tout le monde has become a momentum investor.<p>And why not, while the market's rising? Momentum makes for fun and gains on the way up. And there's that famous Wall Street maxim "Don't fight the tape." Still, investors have a right to wonder now: What effect will the increasing numbers of momentum investors have in the unwanted but inevitable down market? What happens when stock prices go into a cyclical decline, creating a massive sell signal to all momentum players? <p>The simple answer is that what we all witnessed on the upside will be mirrored in a decline. But as anyone who has lived through a blistering bear market will tell you, gravity has a way of dragging stocks down further than is truly justified. And because certain stocks have been driven to unsustainable heights by the current euphoria of the investing crowd, when their prices fall, the decline will be all the more precipitous.<p>To get a glimpse of what such a descent might look like, check out the action in some of the sectors and stocks that the momentum players have recently abandoned. Consider, for instance, the volatility that characterized just three weeks of trading in the electronics, insurance, and heavy-duty transportation industries during November (see "Swings in the Sectors"). In just three weeks of trading, ending November 12, the electronics component of the S&P 500 went from being the number 11-ranked performer out of 108 industry groups to the 84th, then back again to number 1. The insurance group began the period ranked number 87, then moved down to near the bottom at 101, only to zoom to number 6 by week three. Moves like these, jarring to buy-and-hold investors, have much to do with fast-money momentum players. <p>The effects are even worse in individual stocks. Newbridge Networks, for example, a favorite of the hot-money crowd, lost almost 10 points in the week of trading ended November 19. That's a staggering $392 million of market capitalization, gone in a flash. And why did the computer-networking stock take such a hit? The company's crime was that its second-quarter results as reported--earnings and margins were both up sharply--only just met analysts' expectations. What Newbridge should have done, had it wanted to keep its stock high, was exceed those expectations. <p>Similarly perverse reactions befell other momentum stocks during the same week Newbridge stumbled (see "Swings in the Stocks"). L.M. Ericsson Telephone's American depositary receipts fell almost 10 points on the week, losing $2 billion in market value for the Swedish telecommunications giant. And Qualcomm, a maker of digital wireless-communications gear, plunged almost 20 points on the week, costing it $466 million in market value. Both stocks were victims of unrealistic expectations held by investors who, as is always the case with the momentum game, sold at the first whiff of disappointment. Or, as in these three cases, well before the first whiff of disappointment was evidenced. <p>"I'll sell if the reason for my purchase of a stock is no longer valid," says Nicholas-Applegate's Avery. "If sales are going to be flat or fundamental leadership of the stock has changed and its price has turned down." <p>Not that the company's no longer a winner, mind you. As Avery points out, "It does us no good to be in a company that's good but that nobody cares about." No longer is an investment made because of the company; it's now made because of the stock. And because others like the stock.<p>There are a variety of reasons why investors should be worried about what will happen to stock prices in general when the rocket that is momentum investing begins to reverse. How do we know it will? Because all investment fads do, especially those that require everlasting increases in earnings or stock prices. Even the most benighted investor knows that nothing grows to the sky. Not even <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>. Not even <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a>.<p>As money man Vannelli puts it, "Companies have cycles. They can't keep going ad infinitum at a constant level of change." So investors seeking that unattainable constant pile in and out of companies and industries ever more rapidly, roiling the markets and whipsawing investment bystanders.<p>The very nature of momentum investing determines that the decline, when it comes, will be plenty ugly. Why? Because many of these investors care little about fundamental methods of valuing companies and their shares, so they are largely uninformed of what a company's fair value might be. When an investor has no concept of valuation, he has no concept of value. The result: Declines in stocks that are excessive. <p>Say, for example, that by looking at a company's history and making calculated guesses about its immediate earnings potential, you determine its fundamental value to be around 12 times earnings. But, in their euphoria, momentum investors have bid the stock up to 18 times earnings. When these fickle folk bail out, you may well see the stock drop to 8 times earnings--well below its fundamental value--before it finds its true level again. This is because fewer and fewer investors understand what a company's fundamental value is. <p>Wall Street analysts contribute to this lack of understanding by regularly predicting outlandish earnings for companies in the far-off future. Broderbund Software, a highflying PC software maker trading at around 32 times trailing earnings, is a hit among momentum players. That's because analysts estimate Broderbund's earnings will be $1.64 a share in 1994 and will continue growing at more than 25 percent annually until 1998. Investors, therefore, can rationalize paying 32 times past earnings for Broderbund because they're really only paying 26 times '94 estimates for the stock. Fine, until Broderbund fails to meet analysts' expectations.<p>Veterans of the investing scene say that many analysts' projections today are so hopelessly pie-in-the-sky as to be worthless. Why is this? In the past, analysts would typically shave 15 percent off their cash flow projections to account for uncertainties such as potentially rising inflation or interest rates. Now, analysts only discount their estimates by roughly 3 percent, a much smaller margin for error. <p>Another reason why stocks may fall precipitously when the momentum game finally loses steam? There are fewer short sellers around to buy shares as they're dropping. These investors have been driven out of many stocks by their explosive moves up. <p>Short sellers sell shares they don't own, in the belief that a stock is overvalued, and hope to close out their positions profitably by buying the shares back at a lower price. This buying force provides something of a floor in a falling stock and can actually mitigate a broad decline. But short sellers have been so brutalized by highflying stock prices that many have thrown in the towel and become buyers instead. Since 1991, money under management among the shorts has gone from an estimated $4 billion to $2 billion today.<p>Although down markets are no fun for anyone, they are particularly hard on momentum players. Mark Hulbert, editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest, has studied investment-newsletter writers' performance in up and down markets. He has concluded that these types of investors perform especially badly at the beginning of a downturn because they continue to favor stocks that were top price performers but no longer are. Neither are momentum types winners at the beginning of a bull move. Why? Stocks that have the most relative price strength are stodgy numbers like utilities, which won't participate much in a rally. "Relative strength works best," says Hulbert, "in the final stages of a bull market."<p>The long-term performance of Columbine Capital's earnings-momentum model confirms this thesis. Stocks that ranked highest in the firm's model outperformed the market by almost 2 percent a month during bull phases like 1973 and 1982. But in tougher markets, like those of the mid-'70s and 1983, the model either underperformed the market or eked out only minuscule gains. These returns do not take into account transaction costs. <p>Also troubling is the fact that many fund managers who are big in momentum today have not lived through a long-lasting bear market. Arthur Nicholas, for example, opened up his shop in 1984; portfolio strategist Avery started managing money shortly thereafter. Investors can take little comfort knowing that these managers have not yet survived the crucible of a down market. <p>The folks at Nicholas-Applegate are confident that their system will not fail them, regardless of how the market behaves. Ashley Rabun, president of the mutual fund branch, explains that they weigh their investment criteria differently, depending on overall market conditions. She says, "We're very disciplined. Our weightings change to reflect whatever is getting the highest premium in the market at the time." Meaning, if big price moves in stocks are being rewarded by other investors more than big earnings moves, they'll go with the price flow. But if that suddenly changes, Nicholas-Applegate managers will take the new tack.<p>Newcomers to momentum investing may not know what to do when the herd moves to the next market fad. This worries Robert Moyer, vice president of Driehaus Capital Management, the firm profiled in Institutional Investor. "We're watching the tape moment by moment. We've got a bunch of people standing by ready to move. When [the market] breaks, it will break faster. People are more likely to get hurt because they can't react as quickly."<p>Of course, nobody wants to think bear-market thoughts--particularly when the momentum game is so much fun. And when anybody does mutter darkly about what might happen in a market downdraft, bullish investors happily point to the towering piles of cash currently sitting undeployed in stock-fund portfolios as evidence that the Big Mo will roll on (see "Cash on Hand"). Indeed, the Investment Company Institute reports that stock-fund managers are holding some $58 billion in cash in their portfolios. If the market began to drift lower, the thinking goes, this cash would flood into stocks, providing something of a floor to the fall. Fifty-eight billion dollars is surely enough to stop a downdraft in its tracks.<p>Maybe so. It's certainly a sizable hoard. But when you place it against the market capitalization of all three U.S. stock markets--the New York Stock Exchange, the American, and Nasdaq--the hoard shrinks considerably. That total market value currently stands at an astonishing $5.3 trillion. <p>What does this mean? Even if all the $58 billion in cash now sitting in stock funds went into equities, it would help not one iota in stopping a market decline. In fact, all that money would be absorbed by just about a 1 percent drop in the averages. In a $5.3 trillion stock market, $58 billion is a drop in the bucket. <p>Even the much larger amounts of investor cash sitting in money market funds would be of little help in a falling market.

A faddish investment technique called momentum investing has propelled stock prices into the heavens. What happens when the fad fades?<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>Folks who had the good fortune to be in the stock market last year enjoyed one delightful ride. In spite of some dizzying dives in individual stocks or the occasional industry group, 1993 was stellar for equities. <p>The biggest winners were shareholders in the small-capitalization companies, as the averages show. Hands-down winner was the Russell 2000, an index of small-cap stocks, which had increased some 15 percent by mid-December. <p>An only slightly lesser performer was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 13 percent. In third place was the Nasdaq composite, an index of 4,400 companies that was up 12.5 percent last year; trailing was the larger-capitalization S&P 500 index, up only 6.5 percent on the year.<p>Hoping for more of the same, investors are piling into the stocks and mutual funds that won 1993's capital-gains race. Will they be handsomely rewarded once again? Maybe so, but markets rarely stay the same long enough to reward investors assiduously chasing last year's trend. <p>Particularly worrisome is the recent nature of that trend. As more money floods into the stock market, increasing numbers of fund and money managers are taking up a method of investing that has all the earmarks of the latest stock market fad. It's called momentum investing.<p>Unlike past investment fashions, the fad of the moment hasn't affixed itself to a particular group of stocks; neither does it revolve around an industry. What the investment trendies are up to today is a method of stock picking that relies little on how a company is doing--the so-called fundamental analysis of an operation's net worth, business prospects, or balance sheets. Instead, it focuses on how the company's stock is doing. <p>Like all Wall Street fads, momentum investing is beautiful in its simplicity. If a stock's price is going up, it's a buy. When it stops going up, it's a sell. In the world of physics, momentum is motion conjoined with force. In the world of investing, momentum is the motion of a stock conjoined with the force of the herd. <p>Steven Vannelli is a money manager at KJMM Investment Management in San Francisco who has been watching the momentum game play out for some months now. Investors should be concerned about how the game will end, says Vannelli. "The danger with momentum investing is it's great in an up market, hell in a down market," he says. <p>The fuel that has been driving stocks skyward is indeed a volatile mix: low inflation, low interest rates, and increased levels of corporate efficiency, which translate to higher margins and earnings among issuers. Last, but by no means least, is investors' apparently insatiable appetite for investments that will return something greater than the 2.5 percent rate currently found in bank CDs. It is this craving that explains the $411 billion investors poured into stock mutual funds in the last half of 1993, a figure that was up 39 percent from the year before.<p>All in all, it's the perfect environment for creating the newest high-octane investment fad. All rising markets have them. In the bull market of the 1960s, the no-brainer investment strategy revolved around the Nifty Fifty--a group of stocks, including Avon, National Student Marketing, and <a name="NYSE:EK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10500"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kodak</b></a>, that could do no wrong for investors. The bear market of 1974 brought that little fantasy to an end. Then, in the early 1980s, anything to do with high technology became a stock market darling. Until the summer of 1983, that is, when tech stocks crashed to earth. Alas, all good investment fads must come to an end.<p>Momentum investing--investors looking for price action in a stock, bond, or commodity and hopping on for the ride--is nothing new. In the 1970s, it was more popular in the commodities pits than it was on stock exchange floors. It was known then as "trend following," and crafty traders made money with it for several years until the commodities became virtually trendless. Then the followers had nothing to follow. In the 1980s, adherents to what we now call the momentum school were more often known as "relative strength" players, because they looked for strength in stock prices.<p>Today, however, the use of actual earnings growth among momentum players has been superseded by investors who buy stocks largely on recent price behavior. As one money manager explained it, these investors seem to believe that buying on price jumps is a shortcut to the same end. Why waste time slogging through financial statements looking for earnings growth? If a stock's price is rising, it's probably because somebody else who has done the analysis likes it and is buying.<p>When momentum investors buy a stock, their thinking goes something like this: You like it, I like it, maybe we can find a third person who'll like it too. As long as buyers continue to snap up the stock, all is well; like a rocket leaving the launching pad, momentum looks unstoppable, initially. Trouble comes when investors have pushed the stock as high as it will go and a few start to bail. Then, momentum slows, and suddenly, the very reason everyone bought the stock in the first place has disappeared. Everybody heads for the exits at once. When the only reason to buy a stock is based on its rising price, there's little reason to hold when it begins its descent. <p>This explains the violent and seemingly inexplicable downdrafts that are often seen in stocks today. Shares in Household International, for example, dropped almost 8 percent in one day's trading in early December when the financial-services company said its 1994 earnings would likely be at the lower end of analysts' projections. The momentum crowd is also the force behind the troubling volatility evidenced in certain industry groups (see "Swings in the Sectors").<p>Just how popular is momentum investing? Exact numbers of money managers playing the game are hard to come by--they're certainly not listed as such in fund directories. Equally difficult to pin down are numbers of assets currently controlled by momentum players. Part of the problem, according to some fund types, is that few folks want to admit to being proponents. <p>Arthur Nicholas, for example, head of the hugely successful Nicholas-Applegate money-management group ($12 billion under management), hates being described as a momentum player. This in spite of the fact that his portfolio managers count heavily on price and earnings momentum when picking stocks for institutional clients and mutual fund portfolios. The momentum label trivializes his investment style, says Nicholas. Buying stocks based on price moves just doesn't have the gravitas that investors demand of their money managers. <p>Still, the strategy is becoming more mainstream every day. Money manager Vannelli believes momentum investors are an enormous force in today's market. "There's so much money being run by people who don't even read annual reports today," he says. "Huge numbers of investors--insurance companies, mutual fund managers--just buy the momentum." <p>Amy Arnott, an analyst at Morningstar, a mutual fund-analysis firm in Chicago, agrees that momentum investing is on the rise in the fund business. "I've noticed more portfolio managers talking about it," she says. "Plus, when you see a lot of people piling into the same stocks, that's probably the reason." <p>Momentum investing was also behind a big December pitch made to investors and prospects by Carlton Lutts, editor of the Cabot Market Letter, an investment newsletter. Calling his investment strategy the Momentum System 1000, Lutts says it is the secret to "turning $5,000 into $225,000 with just one stock." Lutts writes, "I have discovered what I call the single most important tool for picking winning stocks: Momentum Analysis." When an investing strategy is sold through the mails, you know it's mainstream.<p>Here's some evidence that points to an increase in momentum players among mutual fund managers today: The average turnover ratio of aggressive-growth stock funds, as measured by Morningstar, is up significantly from premomentum levels of a decade ago. <p>How many times a fund manager turns over his portfolio in one year--a 100 percent ratio means a manager has bought and sold the equivalent of his entire portfolio during the year--can be revealing of the fund manager's style. Momentum players, by their very nature, have higher turnover ratios than value investors do; this is because price players move in and out of stocks more quickly--they're happy to abandon a stock simply because it is no longer rising fast enough. Other types of investors are more patient and turn over their portfolios less frequently. <p>It's not surprising, then, that over the past ten years, the average annual turnover rate among aggressive-growth funds--where most momentum players can be found--has increased by 67 percent. Compare this to the averages among other equity-fund categories: Turnover among small-cap-fund managers, for example, grew just 12 percent over the decade, while the average growth and income fund turned over its portfolio just 16 percent more than it used to. And turnover rates among foreign-stock-fund managers actually declined 16 percent during the decade.<p>Another measure of momentum's new acceptance among investors? The cover of the November issue of Institutional Investor, a publication read by professional money managers, celebrates Richard Driehaus, a Chicago-based money manager and big momentum player. And, Wall Street sources say, momentum investing has even trickled down to the ranks of retail brokers, who are pitching their clients on the merits of investing with the herd.<p>People in the fund-management business observe that even former value investors are jumping on the momentum trend. This worries market observers who note that when investors change their strategies midstream, it often signals the beginning of the end of a strong market. Michael Long, principal of Rockbridge Partners, an investment firm in Charlotte, North Carolina, says: "More value types have capitulated to momentum theory. The only way for managers to get money from investors is to be in stocks that have done well." In other words, the biggest movers.<p>Long's point is key to understanding why momentum investing is surging in popularity today. Each new billion that cascades into stock mutual fund coffers puts money managers into this ever more tremendous bind: "How on earth should I invest this money intelligently?" It's a nice problem to have--too much money--but it is a problem nonetheless. The apparent solution, to more and more managers: Invest with the crowd.<p>Veterans of the momentum approach to investing stress that it can only work properly if combined with diligent fundamental analysis. Columbine Capital, a money-management firm in Colorado Springs, has supplied a price-momentum investment model to institutional clients since the late 1970s. The firm studies 12 months of a stock's price moves, corrects the data for excess volatility, and ranks the stock for "relative momentum." John Brush, president of Columbine says, "This gives considerable predictive power, relative to all other stocks. It's a helpful addition to the valuation of stocks. But nobody in their right mind invests on price momentum alone." <p>No? Some of the biggest names in momentum investing today (see "Momentum Mutual Funds") seem to be straying well beyond the boundaries that disciplined adherents, like Brush, stick to. For example, Columbine excludes all new issues from its model --a stock must have at least a year's worth of trading behind it before it has any predictive capabilities. Yet Dreihaus, the momentum trader profiled in Institutional Investor, bets early and often in the new-issue market. So does Catherine Avery, a portfolio manager at Nicholas-Applegate, who runs a $2.3 billion (assets) emerging-growth portfolio. <p>Initial public offerings that skyrocket in price right out of the gate--Snapple Beverage, Boston Chicken, and Callaway Golf are three examples--become immediate favorites of momentum investors if only because their stocks suddenly jump. <p>How does a momentum player make investment decisions? Most fund managers don't like to reveal their secrets, but the process seems to go something like this. Because the fund manager trades constantly through many different brokerage firms, he or she is likely to get the first call from a broker offering shares in a hot IPO. The manager buys all he can, knowing it is likely to rise substantially because there are not enough shares to satisfy investor demand. He also agrees to buy more shares in the open market after they begin trading. As other investors, shut out of the initial offering, snap up the stock, its price typically continues to rise. This action confirms to the momentum investor that he should stay in the stock.<p>Selling time comes when something about the stock's prospects--sales, earnings, or even its price--starts to crest. Maybe there's a sense on Wall Street that the industry the company's in is going to slow its growth. Or the money manager may simply feel there are faster-moving stocks elsewhere that are better buys. Before you can say, "Fire!" everybody's crowding the door.<p>As practiced today, momentum investing can pretty much be summed up this way: aggressive money chasing yesterday's highfliers. Says fund manager Long, "People can't find any other reason to justify paying these prices for stocks, so they call it momentum." Although the practice is not totally responsible for sky-high stock valuations today--both price-to-earnings ratios and book values on the major equity indexes are at all-time highs --it has certainly contributed to rich stock prices. And it has made some sectors of the market much more volatile than before. <p>The trouble is, those rocketing returns of yesterday are what every mutual fund, brokerage firm, and managed-account investor is looking to his fund managers to beat tomorrow. As Tom Wolfe would say, tout le monde has become a momentum investor.<p>And why not, while the market's rising? Momentum makes for fun and gains on the way up. And there's that famous Wall Street maxim "Don't fight the tape." Still, investors have a right to wonder now: What effect will the increasing numbers of momentum investors have in the unwanted but inevitable down market? What happens when stock prices go into a cyclical decline, creating a massive sell signal to all momentum players? <p>The simple answer is that what we all witnessed on the upside will be mirrored in a decline. But as anyone who has lived through a blistering bear market will tell you, gravity has a way of dragging stocks down further than is truly justified. And because certain stocks have been driven to unsustainable heights by the current euphoria of the investing crowd, when their prices fall, the decline will be all the more precipitous.<p>To get a glimpse of what such a descent might look like, check out the action in some of the sectors and stocks that the momentum players have recently abandoned. Consider, for instance, the volatility that characterized just three weeks of trading in the electronics, insurance, and heavy-duty transportation industries during November (see "Swings in the Sectors"). In just three weeks of trading, ending November 12, the electronics component of the S&P 500 went from being the number 11-ranked performer out of 108 industry groups to the 84th, then back again to number 1. The insurance group began the period ranked number 87, then moved down to near the bottom at 101, only to zoom to number 6 by week three. Moves like these, jarring to buy-and-hold investors, have much to do with fast-money momentum players. <p>The effects are even worse in individual stocks. Newbridge Networks, for example, a favorite of the hot-money crowd, lost almost 10 points in the week of trading ended November 19. That's a staggering $392 million of market capitalization, gone in a flash. And why did the computer-networking stock take such a hit? The company's crime was that its second-quarter results as reported--earnings and margins were both up sharply--only just met analysts' expectations. What Newbridge should have done, had it wanted to keep its stock high, was exceed those expectations. <p>Similarly perverse reactions befell other momentum stocks during the same week Newbridge stumbled (see "Swings in the Stocks"). L.M. Ericsson Telephone's American depositary receipts fell almost 10 points on the week, losing $2 billion in market value for the Swedish telecommunications giant. And Qualcomm, a maker of digital wireless-communications gear, plunged almost 20 points on the week, costing it $466 million in market value. Both stocks were victims of unrealistic expectations held by investors who, as is always the case with the momentum game, sold at the first whiff of disappointment. Or, as in these three cases, well before the first whiff of disappointment was evidenced. <p>"I'll sell if the reason for my purchase of a stock is no longer valid," says Nicholas-Applegate's Avery. "If sales are going to be flat or fundamental leadership of the stock has changed and its price has turned down." <p>Not that the company's no longer a winner, mind you. As Avery points out, "It does us no good to be in a company that's good but that nobody cares about." No longer is an investment made because of the company; it's now made because of the stock. And because others like the stock.<p>There are a variety of reasons why investors should be worried about what will happen to stock prices in general when the rocket that is momentum investing begins to reverse. How do we know it will? Because all investment fads do, especially those that require everlasting increases in earnings or stock prices. Even the most benighted investor knows that nothing grows to the sky. Not even <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>. Not even <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a>.<p>As money man Vannelli puts it, "Companies have cycles. They can't keep going ad infinitum at a constant level of change." So investors seeking that unattainable constant pile in and out of companies and industries ever more rapidly, roiling the markets and whipsawing investment bystanders.<p>The very nature of momentum investing determines that the decline, when it comes, will be plenty ugly. Why? Because many of these investors care little about fundamental methods of valuing companies and their shares, so they are largely uninformed of what a company's fair value might be. When an investor has no concept of valuation, he has no concept of value. The result: Declines in stocks that are excessive. <p>Say, for example, that by looking at a company's history and making calculated guesses about its immediate earnings potential, you determine its fundamental value to be around 12 times earnings. But, in their euphoria, momentum investors have bid the stock up to 18 times earnings. When these fickle folk bail out, you may well see the stock drop to 8 times earnings--well below its fundamental value--before it finds its true level again. This is because fewer and fewer investors understand what a company's fundamental value is. <p>Wall Street analysts contribute to this lack of understanding by regularly predicting outlandish earnings for companies in the far-off future. Broderbund Software, a highflying PC software maker trading at around 32 times trailing earnings, is a hit among momentum players. That's because analysts estimate Broderbund's earnings will be $1.64 a share in 1994 and will continue growing at more than 25 percent annually until 1998. Investors, therefore, can rationalize paying 32 times past earnings for Broderbund because they're really only paying 26 times '94 estimates for the stock. Fine, until Broderbund fails to meet analysts' expectations.<p>Veterans of the investing scene say that many analysts' projections today are so hopelessly pie-in-the-sky as to be worthless. Why is this? In the past, analysts would typically shave 15 percent off their cash flow projections to account for uncertainties such as potentially rising inflation or interest rates. Now, analysts only discount their estimates by roughly 3 percent, a much smaller margin for error. <p>Another reason why stocks may fall precipitously when the momentum game finally loses steam? There are fewer short sellers around to buy shares as they're dropping. These investors have been driven out of many stocks by their explosive moves up. <p>Short sellers sell shares they don't own, in the belief that a stock is overvalued, and hope to close out their positions profitably by buying the shares back at a lower price. This buying force provides something of a floor in a falling stock and can actually mitigate a broad decline. But short sellers have been so brutalized by highflying stock prices that many have thrown in the towel and become buyers instead. Since 1991, money under management among the shorts has gone from an estimated $4 billion to $2 billion today.<p>Although down markets are no fun for anyone, they are particularly hard on momentum players. Mark Hulbert, editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest, has studied investment-newsletter writers' performance in up and down markets. He has concluded that these types of investors perform especially badly at the beginning of a downturn because they continue to favor stocks that were top price performers but no longer are. Neither are momentum types winners at the beginning of a bull move. Why? Stocks that have the most relative price strength are stodgy numbers like utilities, which won't participate much in a rally. "Relative strength works best," says Hulbert, "in the final stages of a bull market."<p>The long-term performance of Columbine Capital's earnings-momentum model confirms this thesis. Stocks that ranked highest in the firm's model outperformed the market by almost 2 percent a month during bull phases like 1973 and 1982. But in tougher markets, like those of the mid-'70s and 1983, the model either underperformed the market or eked out only minuscule gains. These returns do not take into account transaction costs. <p>Also troubling is the fact that many fund managers who are big in momentum today have not lived through a long-lasting bear market. Arthur Nicholas, for example, opened up his shop in 1984; portfolio strategist Avery started managing money shortly thereafter. Investors can take little comfort knowing that these managers have not yet survived the crucible of a down market. <p>The folks at Nicholas-Applegate are confident that their system will not fail them, regardless of how the market behaves. Ashley Rabun, president of the mutual fund branch, explains that they weigh their investment criteria differently, depending on overall market conditions. She says, "We're very disciplined. Our weightings change to reflect whatever is getting the highest premium in the market at the time." Meaning, if big price moves in stocks are being rewarded by other investors more than big earnings moves, they'll go with the price flow. But if that suddenly changes, Nicholas-Applegate managers will take the new tack.<p>Newcomers to momentum investing may not know what to do when the herd moves to the next market fad. This worries Robert Moyer, vice president of Driehaus Capital Management, the firm profiled in Institutional Investor. "We're watching the tape moment by moment. We've got a bunch of people standing by ready to move. When [the market] breaks, it will break faster. People are more likely to get hurt because they can't react as quickly."<p>Of course, nobody wants to think bear-market thoughts--particularly when the momentum game is so much fun. And when anybody does mutter darkly about what might happen in a market downdraft, bullish investors happily point to the towering piles of cash currently sitting undeployed in stock-fund portfolios as evidence that the Big Mo will roll on (see "Cash on Hand"). Indeed, the Investment Company Institute reports that stock-fund managers are holding some $58 billion in cash in their portfolios. If the market began to drift lower, the thinking goes, this cash would flood into stocks, providing something of a floor to the fall. Fifty-eight billion dollars is surely enough to stop a downdraft in its tracks.<p>Maybe so. It's certainly a sizable hoard. But when you place it against the market capitalization of all three U.S. stock markets--the New York Stock Exchange, the American, and Nasdaq--the hoard shrinks considerably. That total market value currently stands at an astonishing $5.3 trillion. <p>What does this mean? Even if all the $58 billion in cash now sitting in stock funds went into equities, it would help not one iota in stopping a market decline. In fact, all that money would be absorbed by just about a 1 percent drop in the averages. In a $5.3 trillion stock market, $58 billion is a drop in the bucket. <p>Even the much larger amounts of investor cash sitting in money market funds would be of little help in a falling market. According to the Investment Company Institute, investors currently hold some $564 billion in taxable and tax-free money funds. Every nickel of it would be absorbed by an 11 percent downward move in equities, which is roughly the loss in market capitalization experienced in 1990. So much for the consolation that cash on the sidelines is protection against a big bear move in equities. <p>The fact is, there is never much in the way of protection for investors when stocks start to slide. Add to this the ill effects that are likely when the trendy momentum game reverses itself, and you've got more than a little reason for caution.

Why investors are never safe from the broiler-room tactics of brokerage firms like Stratton Oakmont.<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>So what if the securities and exchange commission has filed suit against them? The boys at bucket-shop brokerage Stratton Oakmont, Inc. are busier than ever. Dialing as many as 400 investors a day with talk of fat stock market profits, one of the 200 or so Stratton brokers may be calling you next. Hang up the phone if they find you--according to the SEC, they're very good at separating investors from their money. <p>The securities-fraud trial, which targets the firm and its three top guns, Jordan Belfort, Daniel Porush, and Kenneth Greene, is scheduled to begin this month in New York City. Although Belfort and his pals have been awaiting trial since March 1992, they've certainly not been wasting time. After all, hot markets for initial public offerings--like the one we've seen recently--don't come along every day. And there's just too much money to be made on the crummy new stock issues Stratton Oakmont likes to churn out. The stock-flogging show must go on. <p>Stratton sure has chutzpah. The SEC seeks $11 million in ill-gotten gains it alleges the firm made manipulating a stock called Nova Capital. Yet even as the government pursues that action, the Long Island-based brokerage firm is expanding operations and bringing new stock issues public.<p>Last fall, the four-year-old firm threw a big bash at the University of Maryland's job fair, to try to attract recruits for a new office the company is rumored to be opening in the state. The party, with an open bar and live music, was held at a hotel near the university's College Park campus. Not surprisingly, given today's tough job market for college graduates, some 500 people came to learn more about a "career" in the brokerage business with Stratton. As one former Stratton salesman says: "I can just imagine the speech given to these kids: 'You, too, can have all this.' They might as well feed them punch, like Jim Jones did."<p>Stratton's stock-selling techniques are a thing of beauty to behold--as long as you're not one of the investors sucked in. Here's how the game works, as explained by a refugee from the firm. <p>Belfort, 31, a former meat salesman, or one of his colleagues finds a crony or an acquaintance who has a company that can be brought public. It doesn't have to be much of a company, mind you, for Belfort to turn it into one hell of a stock. <p>For instance, one of Stratton's most recent offerings was 1.7 million units--a combination of common stock and warrants--in Steve Madden, Ltd., a four-year-old shoe retailer and designer, which has lost a cumulative $75,000 on sales of $4.75 million since its birth.<p>Why, in the competitive women's shoe industry--dominated by huge, well-capitalized players like U.S. Shoe and Brown Group--would Stratton choose to launch an unknown like Steve Madden? One reason, according to former insiders: The footwear designer is a childhood friend of Daniel Porush, Stratton's president.<p>This kind of association is typical in Stratton's offerings. Consider Master Glazier's Karate International, a New Jersey operator of four karate-instruction centers, which Stratton brought public last October. Never mind that the company, incorporated last March, had losses of $63,800 on sales of $637,000 for the first half of 1993 and a negative net worth prior to the offering: Master Glazier's president was a college pal of Jordan Belfort's. The day the units came public at $4, they zoomed to $9.75. They recently traded at around $9 each.<p>Before you wish that you'd gotten in on the Master Glazier deal, consider this. According to a former salesman who observed numerous Stratton deals, very few "average" investors get the stock at or near the offering price. Those lucky spots are reserved for friends of the firm and insiders. Only after the stock has risen do outside investors get the chance to buy. And this "opportunity" is given only because the insiders want to take their profits and run.<p>Stratton IPOs are often paybacks to Stratton insiders or pals who have loaned money to the fledgling company or its executives. In the Madden deal, for example, Belfort, Porush, and Green are sole stockholders in Madden Acquisition Network Group; upon conclusion of the offering they held almost 40 percent of Steve Madden Ltd.'s common stock. <p>Another of the offerings Stratton intends to dump on the public shows how handsomely the firm likes to reward its friends. The deal is 1.5 million units of something called Arnie's Bagelicious Bagels, a three-year-old bagel manufacturer in Brooklyn that earned $325,000 in the year ending April 1993. Once again, the company is setting out to take business away from established bagel suppliers like Skulnicks, Sara Lee, and Lender's, a division of Kraft/General Foods. In this effort, it may or may not succeed.<p>But Arnie's future success or failure matters little to the investors who loaned the company money prior to the offering. They're getting theirs as soon as Stratton launches the stock. <p>One such inside investor is, you guessed it, Steve Madden, of shoe-store fame. For the $250,000 Madden loaned Arnie's Bagelicious last fall, he will receive full repayment plus 7 percent interest and 150,000 units of Arnie's stock. These units consist of common stock and three different kinds of warrants. What are friends for? <p>After an offering is placed--Arnie's, Steve Madden, it doesn't really matter--the real fun starts. Stratton cold callers, working in rooms of 100 or so, pound the phones casting for clients. If they land a big one--an investor willing to put $100,000 toward a trade--he's called a whale. All others, especially the more recalcitrant customers, are called pikers. <p>The undersea metaphor is apt: Stratton brokers are nothing less than sharks, even if they do wear business suits. At the front of each office is a blackboard where big trades get written up and celebrated. Often, if a salesman opened three accounts, he or she got a $100 bonus. The cold-call cowboys have even sent out three-month-old copies of Worth to new accounts in an attempt to legitimize their firm.<p>But there's nothing legitimate about it, according to the SEC. In its complaint, the commission describes the high-pressure, boiler-room sales practices of Stratton brokers, few of whom have any prior experience in the securities business. Belfort and pals, according to the complaint, "urged Stratton registered representatives to 'take' customers 'to the mat,' 'to rip their heads off.'" Porush and Green gave Stratton brokers a new moniker: "phone terrorists." <p>It is this phone terrorism that propels Stratton stocks into the stratosphere. Rising stocks, like Master Glazier's and Nova's, provide an excellent opportunity for anybody holding shares at a lower price to take profits. After the insiders sell, the stocks typically seem to crater, leaving the outsiders holding the bag.<p>One after another of the Stratton deals--Outtakes, Judicate, Repossession Auction-- spike up in price, only to sink to less than $1 a share. All the way down, investors are strongly discouraged from selling the Stratton stocks they've had the misfortune to buy into.<p>This is just what happened to shares of Nova Capital, the case the SEC is pursuing Belfort and gang on. The SEC claims that Stratton brokers pushed Nova's stock by making exaggerated statements about the company's prospects, then sold their own holdings at the higher prices. The stock, which traded as high as $7, crashed to around $1.50 a share.<p>But there's always another gullible investor waiting to answer the phone. So Stratton continues, unabated.<p>Will the SEC succeed in shutting down Stratton Oakmont this month? Ira Lee Sorkin, Stratton's attorney, thinks not; he is vigorously defending the case. "The SEC complaint is, for the most part, always more serious than the facts truly show," he says. "If you do any analysis of the firm's business, you'll see it has not underwritten blind pools, shell companies, or blank checks. The firm has been successful, and the firm's offerings have been successful." Perhaps. But what about the firm's customers? <p>If the commission wins its case, Jordan Belfort may have to go back to selling steaks. Only trouble is, stocks are much more lucrative. In the two years ending October 1991, Belfort made $9.4 million in salary, bonuses, commissions, and trading profits, according to the SEC. And in the years he's been perfecting his game, Belfort's become quite partial to Ferraris, Mercedes 600s, and $28,000 bottles of wine.<p>Shame to have to give all that up now.<p>Gretchen Morgenson is the executive editor of Worth.<p> <p><p>

Why stable growth doesn't guarantee rising stocks<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Factor out all the interesting disagreements economists have on the immediate future of the U.S. economy and you get the consensus: 1994 is going to look a lot like last year, with growth and inflation of about 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent. Keep in mind, though, that those figures are for the year as a whole. Quarter to quarter, we're in for a bumpy ride.
Richard Hoey, chief economist at the Dreyfus Corp., expects that growth will trace a U pattern in 1994. After a 4 percent first quarter, the economy will slow in the spring.
Stan Nabi, chief economist at Bessemer Trust Cos. in New York, also foresees a big pothole in the spring following a move by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates modestly--one quarter of a percent, or 25 basis points. He expects the Fed's move to come between February and April.
Three percent growth versus 2.5 percent, so what? Well, look at the relationship between economic-growth rates and the stock market in the chart to the right. The market seems to anticipate the economy. Good years for the market, 21.44 percent in 1982, for example, often come in bad years for the economy (down 2.2 percent), because the market anticipates a coming economic upturn. In 1993 the market foresaw another year of growth in 1994. Smooth sailing of 3 percent a quarter in 1994 won't disturb those expectations. But if growth dips from 4 percent in the last quarter of 1993 and the first quarter of 1994 to just 2.5 percent in the spring--and if the Fed raises rates--the market could start anticipating a very different future. And that could give a jolt to stock prices.

Is the market's future full of 10 percent returns?<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Is the market going up? Yes, says the investment firm of Goldman Sachs. One of its models shows that the market is undervalued by 24 percent.<p>Are we due for a correction? Absolutely, says one prominent stock-market strategist. He calculates the market is overvalued by 25 percent. <p>Whom to believe? Both. The two models actually agree: The15 percent annual returns of the1980s are over.<p>The bearish view comes from Michael Murphy, editor of The Overpriced Stock Service. Using the operating earnings of the 30 Dow Jones Industrials stocks and the average price-to-earnings ratio at market highs, he figures the Dow is fully valued at 2970. It hit 3716 on December 15.<p>The bullish Goldman Sachs model, for its part, relies on today's low interest rates and inflation to reach its conclusion.<p>Contradictory views? Go to the end of 1994 and see what happens. No one expects interest rates or inflation to fall in 1994, so any appreciation in either model has to come from earnings growth.<p>As of mid-November 1993, the mean Wall Street estimate of 1994 earnings for the Dow stocks was $228. That's unlikely but not impossible: Earnings in1989, the best year of that decade, were $221. Still, using Murphy's formula, that's just 4104 on the Dow, a 10 percent gain for 1994.<p>After a 4.2 percent increase in 1992 and about 13 percent in '93, a 10 percent rise would bring the three-year average to 9.1 percent, close to the historic norm for equities. Not bad, as long as investors don't take on excessive risk fighting for 15 percent when the market's only giving 10.

Three downtrodden issues worth buying<p>By Derrick Niederman<p>In a market widely viewed as overvalued, are there any "cheap" stocks left? If so, are they worth buying? One way to look for bargains is to single out issues that are priced less expensively than the S&P 500. Currently, the average price of a stock listed in this index runs about 17 times anticipated 1994 earnings. <p>Of course, such a criterion alone would yield hundreds of candidates, many of which deserve a below-average price.<p>So let's add two other things to our search. The first: Visible, predictable earnings growth. A stock with this feature offers hope that the market will one day honor the company's performance by removing whatever skepticism is reflected in the current discount valuation. This would ideally lead to a higher multiple on higher earnings. <p>The second thing we'll look for is a "wild card"__a potential development that could boost the shares of the company in question, but which investors aren't paying for in the current price of the stock. <p>Among today's assortment of cheap stocks, here are three that meet the above criteria, offering a combination of underlying stability and wild-card potential:<p><a name="NYSE:SLM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11410"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sallie Mae</b></a>(SLM), the Student Loan Marketing Association, now trades at $44 per share, less than eight times expected 1994 earnings. Just 12 months ago, the stock traded above $75 per share. The reason for the decline was the well-publicized initiative by the Clinton administration to get involved with direct lending to students__effectively bypassing Sallie Mae. 
Despite this, note that Sallie Mae's current stock price is about the same as the liquidation value of its portfolio. The drastic valuation prevails even though the growth of the student-loan market should enable Sallie Mae to post double-digit earnings increases for several years even as the government phases in its plan. Finally, whatever the government's intent, it may have difficulty implementing a plan that would hurt Sallie Mae as much as the market suggests today. That "negative wild card" is the final piece of the buy recommendation.<p><a name="NYSE:PT"></a><b>Pet Inc.</b> (PT) is an oddly named collection of packaged-food brands: Progresso (soups) and Old El Paso (Mexican food), Van de Kamp (frozen seafood), and Underwood (canned meat). Pet stock trades at $17 per share, just 13 times expected earnings for calendar year 1994. This low valuation persists despite double-digit earnings growth in each of the last three quarters, an unusual achievement in the beleaguered packaged-food industry. (Companies that fail this test include <a name="NYSE:K"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10841"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kellogg</b></a>, Quaker Oats, ConAgra, Borden, Heinz, and CPC International.) Progresso's market share alone has grown from 24 percent to 31 percent in a recent comparison to the previous year.<p>Wild card: The stock has been held back by investor concerns about competition in Pet's Mexican-food segment, notably from Taco Bell (<a name="NYSE:PEP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11166"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PepsiCo</b></a>) and Ortega (RJR Nabisco). These competitive pressures may persist for some time, but the category itself is growing strongly (6 percent a year versus 1.5 percent for the food category as a whole). Moreover, Pet has stabilized its share within this category at a healthy 23 percent. If Progresso could retain its franchise against the likes of Campbell and ConAgra, then investors may be worrying too much about competition in Mexican food. <p><a name="NYSE:BIC"></a><b>Bic</b> (BIC) is a solid consumer company with established product franchises in shavers, pens, and lighters. Bic's stock trades cheaply, at about 15 times expected earnings for 1994.<p>The mature character of Bic's product lines suggests an uninteresting investment story. But there may be a wild card where you'd least expect it: in the lighter business. Cheap competition, a backlash against smoking, and product-liability issues have hurt the lighter business__all that's already reflected in the stock. But recently, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has mandated that manufacturers of lighters make their products child-resistant by mid-1994. Bic has been a trend setter in this area, with several patents to its credit. With this head start, the company figures to gain additional market share in a business that it already dominates.<p>Separately, Bic's lighter margins have been increasing, a result of lessened expense in the product liability area, a nagging problem for Bic a few years ago.<p> <p><p>

Now's the time to clan up with out-of favor environmental stocks<p>By Marie D'Amico<p>Environmental stocks are down in the dumps. The garbage crisis that was supposed to boost waste-company stocks never happened. Recyclers can't find enough markets for their laboriously collected paper and plastic. And the highly publicized market for pollution rights now lies comatose from lack of interest.<p>So now is the time to invest in environmental stocks. Right? <p>Well, actually, yes. And not just to save the world or to behave like a brave contrarian. Opportunities in these stocks exist because most of the damage to this sector of the market has already been done--and in many cases overdone. What's more, the long-term trends that once made these stocks look so attractive are essentially still in place. There are many companies in this industry growing at rates as high as 15 percent annually.<p>But please note that we're talking about individual stocks here. Not environmental mutual funds. The lesson of the last three years is that investors in this part of the market should avoid these funds at all costs. In fact, it's the spectacular disappointment created by these funds that has provided this buying opportunity. Investors who want to understand environmental stocks should know a little bit of the history behind that.<p>Environmental-sector funds were born because of the warm glow created by the 20th anniversary of Earth Day in 1990. And they proliferated like an algae bloom.<p>The funds sold investors a great-sounding story: The passage of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the late 1980s had created a new industry and an ever-expanding market for environmental products and services. Lawrence Greenberg, who at the time ran <a name="FUND:FSLEX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FSLEX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity's Select Environmental Services Portfolio</b></a>, called environmental services "one of the growth industries of the 1990s."<p>The story these funds were selling wasn't really wrong--it was just oversold. Investors "were thinking that they were getting funds that were going to help clean up the environment," says Kurt Brouwer, a partner in Brouwer & Janachowski, a San Francisco investment-advisory firm, "whereas the mutual fund companies were looking to benefit from the fact that environmentalist was a hot buzzword." Investors were promised the moon--a clean conscience, terrific growth, and almost no downside, even in tough times. "Everybody thought you needed pollution control, environmental control, even through a recession," says Tom Desmond, environmental-sector analyst for Morningstar. <p>It was too much. This relatively small sector of the market couldn't handle the new influx of fund money. By the end of 1990, Fidelity's fund had $96.8 million, John Hancock's Freedom Environmental had $51 million, and Oppenheimer's Global Environment $53 million.<p>The result: Fund managers had to overpay for stocks. This drove up prices and expectations, which in turn led to disappointment and a sector-wide slaughter. Rian Fried, editor of Clean Yield, an investment advisory newsletter, wrote in March of 1992: "There were too few publicly held companies with too little stock to afford investment fund managers the luxury of picking and choosing suitable investment candidates.. . .  Their actions were driven by necessity--their prospectuses claimed they were organized to purchase environmental stocks, so they had to purchase environmental stocks."<p>While the average equity mutual fund rose 38.4 percent between the end of July 1990 and the end of that same month in 1993, many of the environmental funds showed declines. The Fidelity fund dropped 11.68 percent during that period. Thomas Sprague, who managed the Fidelity fund until August 5, declared while he still headed the fund: "I don't recommend my fund to people. I suppose I should, but I don't."<p>Today's argument for investing in the environmental sector is far less hyperbolic than the one the fund companies sold three years ago. There are no miracles on the horizon, and the last recession proved that these stocks suffer when the economy turns toxic.<p>Sure, the Clinton administration will give the sector a modest boost. But the emphasis there is on the word modest. If the White House does indeed tighten enforcement of existing regulations, antipollution stocks will benefit, as will the stocks of companies that operate large landfills. Clinton has also promised to encourage development of new environmental technologies like electric batteries and photovoltaic cells, which gives hope to investors on the high-tech side of the environmental sector. The best estimate is that the worldwide market for environmental products and services, now at $200 billion, will grow by 5 percent annually.<p>"Compared to the last 12 years, we have a situation where conditions are going to be better for companies involved in environmental improvement," says David Beckwith, manager of the John Hancock Freedom Environmental Fund. "It's just a question of when it's going to happen," says Rian Fried. The consensus among analysts points to a pickup in this sector late in 1994.<p>So the key to smart investing in this sector is to hunt for value. In other words: Find stocks that are cheap relative to their real growth prospects. Fried, who in addition to publishing a newsletter manages a $30 million portfolio, says his basic approach is "not to pay more than the growth rate." He adds: "We also look at book value. We like to pay between one and two times book."<p>The basic trends supporting these fundamentals look stronger today than a few years ago. Based largely on the expenditures necessary to meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which go into effect in November 1994, Robertson Stephens & Co., a San Francisco investment bank, is predicting 8 percent to 10 percent annual growth in air-pollution-control stocks over the next five years. That law should also help companies developing alternative fuels. The long-expected water-supply crunch is now clearly a reality, giving the business of selling clean water a growth rate approaching 10 percent. Spending on environmental cleanup and remediation (the task of repairing damaged land), perhaps the fastest growing sector, is expected to increase to $174 billion in 1995 from $56 billion in 1989.<p>Solid-waste stocks, on the other hand, still aren't very appealing. There is just too much excess capacity in the industry. Subtitle D regulations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act mandate better linings for landfills to keep hazardous chemicals in garbage from seeping into the groundwater. That will make the cost of owning and operating dumps higher and eventually force smaller companies out of business. But small operators have received a waiver exempting them from the rules until April 1994. Analysts expect that only about 10 percent of the current capacity will shut down in the next two years. That will mean fewer companies to compete with, but the large haulers like Browning Ferris still won't be able to raise prices by much--if at all. According to Fidelity's Sprague, solid-waste stocks as a group are selling at prices 15 to 20 times earnings but only growing at 10 percent to 15 percent a year. "I like it when the [price-to-earnings ratios] are less than growth rates, not more than growth rates," he says.<p>Fried's value/growth rules lead him to stocks such as <a name="NASD:ARCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15921"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Appliance Recycling Centers</b></a> (ARCI) of Minneapolis. Appliance Recycling is "a very simple idea that makes intuitive sense," says Fried. The company collects old appliances and takes them apart to recover the chlorofluorocarbons. It gets rid of hazardous materials and then recycles the metals. The company works with large appliance makers like <a name="NYSE:WHR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11632"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Whirlpool</b></a> and with retailers. A few months ago when it was trading at $17.50, or about 40 times earnings, Fried thought it was too expensive. "This is a company that can grow 40 percent to 50 percent a year and has because it's so small," he says. "I'd want to be looking at more like 30 to 35 times earnings, which would be more in the $15 range." The price has recently declined to that level.<p>The environmental sector seems ideally suited to this kind of investing. There is no single company that an investor must own--and therefore no need to chase any stock. The technologies are fluid, and no one can predict which companies will dominate the future. An investor has plenty of time to buy a few shares, learn more about the company, and then, perhaps, buy more when the price is right. This is one market sector where the future will wait for an investor.<p>A final lesson. In 1990 Fidelity's Lawrence Greenberg crowed to Forbes that Waste Management (now called WMXTechnologies), which at the time was at $33.50, a hefty 25 times trailing earnings, was worth every penny because the company was then compounding its earnings at 25 percent a year. "If you assume that growth keeps up for even another two years, the stock doesn't look so overpriced," Forbes concluded. But growth didn't, and today the stock is selling at $30.75, 18 times earnings. An indictment of investing in environmental stocks? No, but a clear sign that investors who overpay live to rue it.<p>
Think Globally, Pick Carefully: Five small companies where the price is right<p>In many sections of the country, supplying enough clean water to cities and industry is already difficult, and municipal officials from Santa Barbara to Phoenix to Long Island are counting on finding new sources. That will create big opportunities for companies that can clean up wastewater or turn salt water into fresh. "I continue to think clean water is going to be one of the great businesses of the '90s," says Dan Leonard, who until recently was manager of the <a name="FUND:FSEVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FSEVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Invesco Environmental Fund</b></a>. One of the best companies in the business, according to analysts, is <a name="NYSE:ION"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12061"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ionics</b></a>, Inc. (ION), which sells a proprietary system for water purification. Ionics has a lucrative long-term contract with the city of Santa Barbara to convert seawater into fresh H2O. Although the stock has been as high as $60, its current price of $39.25 makes it an attractive long-term investment again, according to Leonard. At that price, the stock is trading at 20 times the last 12 months' earnings per share. Book value of $28.50 a share limits the downside on the stock.<p><a name="NASD:WATR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14418"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tetra Tech, Inc. </b></a>(WATR), another water play, is a consulting company that advises clients on how best to clean up their wastewater. (Don't confuse the stock with the similarly named TETRA Technologies [TTRA], which is a waste-treatment and recycling company.) Its biggest potential client: the Department of Energy, which plans to spend $35 billion over the next five years to bring its nuclear-weapons facilities into compliance with federal environmental rules. Over the longer term, cleaning up those sites will cost $200 billion, analysts estimate. The company's technical skills are well suited to this job, according to Randy Scherago, environmental stock analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co. The company now has $450 million to $500 million in bids outstanding. At a current price of $15.75, the stock was trading at 19 times earnings. For fiscal 1993, the company is expected to show $56.1 million in revenue and earnings of 79 cents a share.<p><a name="NASD:OMEG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16266"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Omega Environmental Inc.</b></a> (OMEG) sells a patented pressurized system for preventing leaks in underground petroleum storage tanks, a major--and expensive--environmental problem for oil companies. Omega's edge? The company has hooked up with American International Group, the largest pollution liability-insurance underwriter in the U.S. AIG will insure at low rates companies that use Omega's system. Tank companies previously found it virtually impossible to get insurance, and when they did, the cost was outrageous. "Omega has actually changed the actuarial tables," says Mari Bari of Mabon Securities. With 2 million registered underground storage tanks, not to mention 5,000 to 7,000 new installations each year, and the possibility of expanding into aboveground tanks, the company has no shortage of growth opportunities. Bari expects revenues to grow to $225 million by the end of fiscal 1996 from $8 million in fiscal 1993. The company is currently not profitable. Recently the stock was trading at $6.<p><a name="NYSE:WLM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11618"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wellman Inc.</b></a> (WLM), the nation's largest recycler, turns plastic and fiber wastes into polyester, nylon fibers, and plastic resins for specialty markets and the home-furnishings industry. According to Rian Fried, an investment manager and newsletter editor, although the company uses recycled materials that it buys cheaply to make its products, the company's profit margins depend on the markets for the raw materials it sells to the producers of carpets, bottles, and other products. Recently the stock was $20, or about 12 times expected calendar 1993 earnings of $1.65, a price that Fried considers a strong reason to buy.<p>As environmentalists continue to battle cutting in old-growth forests, the price of wood pulp used in papermaking is expected to rise. <a name="NYSE:MTX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12333"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Minerals Technologies Inc.</b></a> (MTX) has developed an alternative, precipitated calcium carbonate (the major ingredient in limestone and chalk), which is much cheaper than wood pulp. In addition, the process solves another environmental problem of papermaking--it's already white, so the paper doesn't need to be bleached, a practice under fire from environmentalists. The company's proprietary product allows it to dominate its market, according to Lazard Freres analyst James Winchester. "The company has been a fantastic performer; it's very well run and not leveraged at all." At its recent price of $28, the stock was trading at nearly 23 times projected 1993 earnings per share. Earnings growth is pegged at 20 percent a year.--M.D.<p>

Stocks that should be in your portfolio--even if you have to buy them<p>By Derrick C. Niederman<p>Despite the myriad investment articles that are published every day, one problem that affects almost every common- stock investor on the planet has gotten virtually no attention: Many first-rate stocks go unbought indefinitely--possibly for an investor's entire lifetime--simply because there was no specific moment that seemed like the right time to buy.<p>Stock recommendations that say "buy now" are surely the most compelling. The phrase appeals to our competitive instincts-- after all, buying now may mean getting there ahead of the other guy. That's also consistent with our understanding that business conditions can change quite rapidly, as can the stock market itself.<p>In the last year or so, we have heard recommendations such as "Buy <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a>; the economy is recovering," or "Buy Mylan Labs; it's a Clinton stock." Or even "Buy Sallie Mae; the student-loan system may not be as ill-fated as is commonly believed." Each of these recommendations is rooted in the present. There's certainly nothing wrong with that--and there are hundreds of other ideas where these came from.<p>But even this long list has some glaring omissions. For example, would an investor who inherited a portfolio today be upset if <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a> was in it? Of course not. But change the question just a little bit. Would the same investor go out and buy McDonald's today? Probably not--simply because there is no specific reason to buy that hasn't been around for years. And, in an ironic way, buying today is an admission that it was a mistake to not buy it before. <p>Note that in the case of McDonald's, I could have said exactly the same thing if this article had been written in 1988, because even then there was no immediately compelling reason to buy. Some analysts might argue they saw the promise of the company's burgeoning international operations, but these factors existed before 1988. At the time, McDonald's was trading at $22 per share. Today it's above $50. And the international argument still applies.<p>Where will McDonald's stock be five years from now? I can't say precisely, but it's an excellent bet that it will be higher than it is today; that's what steady earnings growth will do. Yet companies with results this consistent--and whose names are well-known --are often not the sort of companies that leap up on any given day to tell you that your portfolio can't live without them.<p>Included on this list would be companies such as <a name="NYSE:TOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11495"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toys "R" Us</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney</b></a>, Fannie Mae, and other industry leaders. These stocks are not underfollowed, nor are they underrecognized, but they are worth owning. I could come up with reasons why they could be considered particularly attractive now--Disney's share price has recently been depressed by continued disappointments from its Euro Disney subsidiary; Toys "R" Us now trades at a smaller than normal premium to the S&P 500, the result of a few months of only moderate same-store sales increases. But for stocks like these, investors shouldn't require reasons of this type, because they aren't as important as these companies' fundamental strengths.<p>Ironically, the proliferation of financial information in the last several years has played a role in steering supposed long-term investors away from such holdings. Part of the "problem" is that to be a long-term investor is to be responsible. No short-term thrill seeking. Yet being responsible surely means acting on the latest possible information. How can you invest on the basis of information that could be several weeks old?<p>Perhaps the extra financial information we get these days is the "too much" part of the proverbial good thing. If the whole world truly did change every two weeks, there would be no such thing as long-term investing. What the stocks above have in common, of course, is that they have been extremely successful long-term holdings, or put another way, the reasons for owning them have been true year after year, even at increasingly higher share prices. Yet by the very virtue of these long-term advantages, any demandfor the most exciting story of the moment will leave them out.<p>The paradox of the hunt for the right time to buy can be made worse by personal quirks. Many of us love bargains. We dismiss the above stocks--which don't tend to trade inexpensively--on the grounds that someday in the future, they'll run into a short-term problem, and we can buy them then, when they're a bargain.But what kind of strategy would reject a stock at $20 and then buy it at $40 because it has been at $50? And what if the short-term problem never comes? Again, the need for an immediate reason to buy can get in the way.<p>It should come as no surprise that similar difficulties arise on the sell side. If we are to sell a stock now, most investors like to know that now is the best time to sell. Sounds nice, but it's a bad start. <p>In 1990, I wrote a brief column suggesting investors sell <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>, then trading for just over $100 per share. Given what's happened since, it will go down as one of the best sale recommendations I ever made, and certainly one I don't mind bragging about. But remember, IBM once traded at $175; my recommendation wasn't timely in the least.<p>Back then, it was difficult to foresee the magnitude of IBM's losses and the magnitude of the dividend cut, although both were certainly possibilities. What was more evident was that IBM had thousands of shareholders who were hoping (largely without foundation) that IBM would come back. No particular point seemed like the time to sell. From that backdrop, the most likely scenario was a multiyear southward pattern as more and more investors gave up the ship. And that's what happened. The climactic drop of the last year was stunning but, in a sense, gravy.<p>The psychology of selling a stock that has already declined parallels the buying side and is perhaps even easier to see: It's an admission that we were wrong when we didn't sell earlier. In these cases, our egos prefer that the stock return to its previous highs, enabling us to ignore the downturn altogether. But why should it? If the company's franchise has been damaged enough, the stock won't come back at all. The act of selling a past-peak stock is never psychologically rewarding, but do it anyway--there could be rewards down the road.<p>Today, that consideration applies to such companies as <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a>, Borland International, a host of pharmaceutical companies, and even to IBM itself. A sale today guarantees doing so at the wrong time, because each of these stocks could have been sold for more had they been sold earlier. But the old rule applies: If you wouldn't buy it today, then perhaps you shouldn't hold it, either. What that really means is that a decision to do things in a nice timely way might just improve the performance of your portfolio.<p>Contributing editor Derrick C. Niederman is a mathematician turned securities analyst.<p><p>

Do-it-yourself arbitration can save investors a bundle in legal fees<p>By Katherine Vessenes<p>Linda Martin, a nuclear-medicine technologist living in Minneapolis, had mediocre success investing in Big Board stocks, so in 1985 she started buying penny stocks on margin. The first stock she bought went from $.50 to $3.75 in a few months, and she was hooked. "Although I didn't appreciate it at the time," she says, "it might as well have been roulette."<p>In 1989 Martin closed her account from a large regional brokerage house to work with stockbroker Gary Tjosvold at Schneider Securities in Phoenix, a firm dealing in many of the small-company stocks she wanted to buy.<p>One of those stocks was Westar, in which she bought a substantial holding. In October 1990 Martin wanted to increase her cash for some upcoming personal expenses and advised Tjosvold to sell some of her Westar stock and some bonds she owned. But when she got her monthly statement the day before Thanksgiving, she saw that Tjosvold had sold her bonds but had used the proceeds to purchase 52,000 more shares of Westar for her account.<p>Martin called Tjosvold for an explanation. He assured her it was a clerical error and she shouldn't worry. "Call me after the weekend," he said, "and we'll straighten everything out." She agreed to wait a few days because Schneider Securities had a history of getting her statements wrong. Although Tjosvold had always corrected the "errors" in the past, this time it seemed like more than a mistake, and she planned a major confrontation with him after the long weekend.<p>The day after Thanksgiving, Martin got a phone call from the firm, telling her that Tjosvold had died of a heart attack. She immediately contacted Tjosvold's supervisor, Dick Sheneman, who steadfastly denied that Tjosvold had made any unauthorized trades or had used her bond proceeds inappropriately. He claimed he could find no paperwork indicating she wanted to sell Westar at all.<p>Over the next month, she continued to request that Schneider rescind the trade and refund her $7,500 from the bond sale, plus cover her losses on her Westar stock that should have been sold:The company had gone bankrupt shortly after Tjosvold's death.<p>Sheneman offered Martin only $7,500. "At that point I started looking around for alternative solutions," she says. "I called the Minnesota attorney general and the National Association of Security Dealers." Based on the advice Martin got from the regulators, early in 1991 she filed a grievance with the NASD, the self-regulatory organization of brokerage firms.<p>But in September 1991, after months of investigation, the NASD found "insufficient evidence" to support any wrongdoing, offering no further explanation. Schneider Securities promptly reduced its settlement offer from $7,500 to $2,000.<p>"I was thoroughly discouraged," Martin remembers. "I called several law firms and learned they didn't take [contingency] cases for less than $100,000. With no lawyer to help me, I felt I was up a creek." Without a lawyer who would forgo a fee up-front in return for a percentage of what Martin would win (if anything), taking Schneider to court was out of the question: Even a simple securities case can run up $30,000 in pretrial fees and another $30,000 if it goes to court, way more than the $15,000 she was claiming.<p>One of the attorneys she talked to suggested arbitration, where disputes against brokers are heard in an informal setting by three arbitrators chosen locally by the NASD, but predicated on acceptance by both parties. For investors, arbitration has many advantages over a civil trial. Arbitrators aren't bound by the courtroom rules of evidence and procedure, so cases can move more quickly. What's more, brokers can't use many defenses, such as the statute of limitations or hearsay rules. And arbitration can be significantly less expensive than litigation.<p>Nevertheless, it's not unusual to spend $25,000 in legal fees to get through an arbitration hearing, and that was still not in Martin's price range. A solution was suggested by attorney Terry Fleming of Lindquist & Vennum: He would coach Martin to handle the case herself. Fleming specialized in cases involving investors and brokers and had assisted a number of clients through do-it-yourself arbitration.<p>Fleming helped in a number of ways. He told her how to organize her files to impress the arbitrators. Martin developed a loose-leaf notebook system for her exhibits her monthly account statements, trade confirmations, correspondence with Tjosvold, and a summary of gains and losses, all filed chronologically and color coded for easy reference. "Setting this up was a lot of work," Martin says, "but it really paid off."<p>Fleming also helped Martin distill her presentation into a short, simple, chronological account of what happened and a precise statement of what she wanted the panel to do to solve the problem. He even advised her on what to wear to the hearing (conservative but tasteful; it doesn't hurt to impress the panel with a touch of class) and how the panel would act; she would know everything to expect so as not to be surprised. On Fleming's advice, she filed a claim for $15,200 based on unauthorized trading, misrepresentation, and illegal use of her bond proceeds in her margin account. "Meeting with Fleming gave me increased confidence and a clearer focus," says Martin. His total bill: $400.<p>Walking into the hearing room on January 15, 1992, without a phalanx of attorneys was one of the worst moments of the entire process. At first, Martin was intimidated by the behavior of the Schneider Securities representative and the three arbitrators, all men, who chatted amiably among themselves, virtually ignoring her. She waited quietly for five minutes past the appointed time and then took charge, asking for the hearing to begin. When they readily agreed, Martin began presenting her case. Six hours later she finished.<p>The Schneider representative, in contrast, was ill-prepared and spent less than 30 minutes presenting his side, relying chiefly on the favorable decision by the NASD grievance investigators. He tried to discredit Martin by producing internal memos in which Schneider personnel had called her a "flake" and "off the wall." "They were overconfident since they had won the initial round with the NASD grievance process," Martin explains, "so Schneider didn't prepare, and it showed."<p>Justice came in the mail on April 3, 1992. The arbitrators found in Martin's favor and ordered Schneider to pay her $7,300 without explaining their decision or how they arrived at the amount. This result is close to recent NASD statistics that show clients in arbitration win 60 percent of the time and on average are awarded 61 percent of the amount they claim.<p>Even though the process was long and at times humiliating, and in the end she received only what she was originally offered, Martin is satisfied. She is still investing, but more conservatively, and she has gone back to her former broker at the established firm.<p>-----<p>IT'S CHEAPER TO SETTLE:<p>It's not unusual for trusting investors to naively follow a broker's advice without understanding the risks or sales charges. Don't despair. There are a number of effective actions that don't involve litigation: <p>Step 1: Get a strategy. Losing money by itself is not a basis for a complaint. The most common complaints used against brokers are failure to disclose risks or sales charges and recommendation of an unsuitable investment. Claims against brokerage firms almost always allege failure to supervise the firm's brokers.  <p>Step 2: Set the objective. Some clients want their investment returned; others want interest too; some just want an apology. <p>Step 3: Contact the broker. Call him and explain the problem. Then listen to what he has to say. If that isn't satisfactory, tell him clearly what would be. Then send the broker a letter summarizing the call and the desired solution, giving a deadline for a response. <p>Step 4: Contact the firm. Some firms are so concerned about their reputations that they'll go to extremes to keep a client satisfied. Most reasonable firms would rather settle with an investor than incur the costs of litigation.<p>Step 5: File a grievance. Complaints to the NASD and state departments of securities can terrify a broker since these agencies have the power to fine, suspend licenses, or even put them out of business. It's an effective and inexpensive way to get relief. <p>Step 6: Arbitrate or litigate. Litigation requires competent securities counsel, but arbitrating yourself can be a cost-effective way to reach a satisfactory settlement.<p>Katherine Vessenes is a certified financial planner and attorney with the St. Paul law firm Chandler and Mason. She speaks nationally on investor issues and ethics in financial planning.<p> <p><p>

						September 1993 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> HOW TO CREATE A BEAR-PROOF PORTFOLIO <p>(and still make money)  <p> Anybody can outsmart a bear market: Just move into cash. Butwhat if the market goes up? Here's how to play it safe withoutlosing the upside.  <p> by Stuart Weiss  <p> Monday, October 19, 1987 was the beginning of the end of a lotof careers on Wall Street, including mine. I started the morningin a hotel room in San Francisco, preparing to visit severalBay Area companies that looked like interesting investments.As I was getting dressed, the debacle in New York was underway. <p> Surprisingly학ut, as things turned out, appropriately핪he panicin New York did not infect the companies I was going to see.No one canceled on me. The investor-relations folks were calm,brushing aside the mayhem to discuss their businesses. At Clorox,the company rep talked about cleansers and the competition, thoughhe did pause every so often to look at his Quotron machine. <p> When I got back to New York, the chaos on Wall Street had begun.Equity research analysts at my firm were fired one by one overthe next few years. (I lasted until 1989.) The crash destroyedthe Wall Street job market, killed the New York City real estatemarket, and generated gobs of introspective articles in Barron'sand the Wall Street Journal. But for investors who stayed calm,Black Monday was simply a one-day bear market. True, some stockslost half their value that day. But most came back by the endof the year. As a group, stocks were up slightly for 1987.  <p> Today a lot of people are nervous about the stock market's highvalues, rising interest rates, and the effect of higher taxeson the economy. If there were another crash하nd a crash is lesslikely now than in 1987 because of additional trading safeguardsinstalled by the exchanges핪he best advice would be: Don't panic.In fact, savvy investors would probably snap up the bargainsthe next day, just as they did in 1987.   <p> A more troubling concern is whether investors can insulate theirportfolios against a far worse calamity하 prolonged bear market,the likes of which we haven't seen in 20 years. Sure, there havebeen some bad stretches since then: the months leading up tothe Gulf War and the mini-crash of October 1989, to name two.But there hasn't been a grinding bear since 1973. In that downturnthe market lost half its value in two years, and recovery tookanother eight years.   <p> Like 1987, the years 1973 and 1974 were not good ones to beworking on Wall Street. But unlike 1987, they were disastrousfor investors. On January 11, 1973, the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage reached a new all-time high of 1052. By December 6, 1974,thanks to the first OPEC oil shock, Watergate, inflation, anda recession, it had sunk to 578.   <p> What equities got clobbered the hardest in the '70s? Growthstocks. The so-called Nifty Fifty stocks, which were bid up toinsane multiples of earnings. "You had guns and butter from Vietnam,inflation getting out of control, and a gross overvaluation ofgrowth stocks핪he reverse of today," recalls Graham Tanaka, presidentof Tanaka Capital Management in New York, who was employed atMorgan Guaranty at the time. "Morgan was a major proponent ofthe Nifty Fifty. They helped create it. You had companies sellingat three or four times the market multiple. And then the NiftyFifty unraveled."   <p> Stocks such as Polaroid, whose price-to-earnings ratio approached100 in 1972, plunged from $150 to $15. By the end of the 1970s,Polaroid managed to reach $30, a pale image of its former self.Honeywell fell from $140 to $21; by the end of 1974 the companywas selling at just four times earnings. Disney stock tradedin Fantasyland before the bear market할ts stock pushed up to$122. Two years later the stock was mired in the low $20s, andit didn't recover until 1987. General Motors, which previouslypeaked at $115, plummeted to $45하nd never really recovered.It was a time when stocks on average sold for seven times earnings,the Dow languished below 1050, and many cheap stocks got a lotcheaper.  <p> Today's economy is completely different from that of the mid-1970s.There is no oil crisis, no double-digit inflation, no Vietnam.But there is a bulging mutual fund industry full of customerswho will bolt at the first hint of trouble. There is an averageprice-to-earnings multiple that's triple what it was in 1974.There is a huge budget deficit. And there's the specter of highertaxes. "Excessively high tax increases would choke the economy,"warns Tanaka. Adds a broker who lost his shirt in 1973, "Everybodyalways thinks that this is the bull market that won't ever end,but it always does."  <p> In 1993 there's no Nifty Fifty, but the current market has plentyof excesses of its own: biotechnology stocks that sell at $50when there are no earnings하nd sometimes not even any revenues.Hot software stocks selling at 40 times earnings. Multimedia,CD-ROM, telecommunications, local-area networks, wide-area networks.Five hundred channels and nothing on.  <p> If the great bear market of 1973 taught us anything, it's thata bear market can appear with no warning. And once investorsfind themselves in one, it's tough to make adjustments. That'seven more true today because of the speed of information: It'svery hard to realize that something is happening before everyoneelse has realized it, too.   <p> All of this means that investors who believe that a bear marketis looming (and that should be just about everyone) need to takesteps now. What to do? The old bear gave us a few hints. Forone thing, lighten up on the current hot stocks, those that aretrading at tremendous premiums to the market. If the Dow JonesIndustrials are selling at 20 times earnings today, a stock at50 times earnings should raise a red flag.   <p> Instead, buy stocks that have low price-to-earnings and price-to-bookratios (available from any stock reporting service, includingStandard & Poor's and Value Line). "Almost everything I own isgoing to go down less than the market as a whole," says ScottBlack, president of Delphi Management, "because we've got stockswith low P/E's and low book values." How low is low? The market'scurrent price-to-earnings ratio is about 20 times 1993 earningsand its price-to-book ratio is about three. So look for saferstocks with price-to-earnings ratios below 15 and price undertwo times book.   <p> For many investors, this creates an opportunity to sell stocksthat have run up fast and use the money to buy stocks that haven't핦rbetter yet, to buy stocks that have already had their own littlebear market. "The first thing investors should do is take profitson stocks that have done well for them," says Steven Carvell,a professor of finance at Cornell University. Because the marketas a whole, as measured by the Dow, hasn't moved much since mid-1992,investors should look for sales among stocks that have risenmore than a third in the past year.   <p> But resist the temptation to sell the entire portfolio in afree fall하 few stocks may never come back, but most of themwill. "Investing is far less an intellectual exercise than itis an exercise in guts," says David Hunter of Hunter Associatesin Pittsburgh.  <p> That means this is no time to be buying stocks on margin (borrowingfrom a brokerage house to buy more stock, usually to a maximumof 50 percent of a portfolio's value). A lot of people were wipedout in 1974 when the stocks they bought on margin dropped invalue and the erosion in the collateral value of the stocks forcedthem to sell at the bottom of the market.   <p> Investors should also be wary about the company they keep. Stocksheld by a lot of institutions, which are notoriously quick tobail out in bad weather, can be more volatile than those heldby wealthy families or even individuals. "Often the upside gainis not worth the downside risk for money managers," says Carvell."If they make good money, they'll get a pat on the back. Butif they lose money when nobody else did, they're gone." Hereutilities offer an advantage, because of their proportionatelyhigh ownership by long-term investors. To check out other stockowners, refer to S&P's research reports or call company investor-relationspeople.  <p> The balance sheet provides additional clues about which stocksstand the best chance of surviving the next bear. Steady andconsistent earnings, revenues, and cash flow are especially important.Particularly in times of trouble, the market tends to view companieswith steady growth far more favorably than those with erratichistories, even if they've been profitable. On the other sideof the balance sheet, a lot of debt is even more troublesomein a bear market as interest rates rise and business conditionsworsen. Investors should worry about companies with a lot ofmerger-related or leftover leveraged-buyout debt, such as RJRNabisco, Safeway, and Time Warner. And stocks that get additionalprice support from high dividends score big points with a nervousmarket. Dividends above 3 percent are a nice bonus, consideringthat savings accounts and money market funds pay 2 percent. That'sanother reason to look favorably on utility stocks; they generallypay 4 to 5 percent.  <p> A company's industry or product can also make an important differencein how it is perceived on Wall Street. Is the company's stapleproduct a big-ticket item or is it a small portion of a householdbudget? Is it necessary or discretionary? A bear market usuallymeans a recession is on the way or already here, so low-pricedand necessary items are better. That's why utilities hold upso well핥o matter how bad things get, people want that A/C ona July day in New York City or Dallas. Drug companies, food companies,and discount retailers historically do well when times are tough.These days it looks like personal computers may be added to thatlist: We've become so chip-dependent that there seems to be amarket for new innovation regardless of what the economy is doing. <p> On the downside, investors will do well to cut back on holdingsin banks and brokerage houses. A bear market driven by higherinterest rates tends to hurt banks because the spread betweenthe rates they pay and what they lend shrinks. And stock brokerssuffer in a bear market as the demand dries up for lucrativenew issues of stock. Banks and brokers have ominously high earningsmultiples today; they've gone up a lot in the past year or twoas interest rates have come down and the Gulf War break in themarket recedes further into history. At the same time, inflation-hedgestocks such as gold and real estate tend to do very well in toughtimes.  <p> Finally, today's investors should lighten up on mutual fundsand boost their holdings of individual stocks. Why? Mutual fundsare bursting at the seams with novice investors who will wantto pull their money out at the first hint of trouble. (One exceptionis in the international arena, where funds offer geographicaldiversification. Plus, it's often tough to buy individual issuesin foreign countries.)  <p> Of course, it would be virtually impossible to find a stockthat fits all of these criteria. But investors still can constructa nearly bear-proof portfolio with the goal of staying investedbut losing less money in the event of a bear market. Here areten stocks, in alphabetical order, that could help accomplishthat. If there's another 1987-type correction, there'll be nowhereto hide"Everything's going to get blown apart," in the wordsof Scott Black, "especially the over-the-counter stocks." Butin a more-likely bear market these ten stocks should hold upbetter than the market as a whole. And, best of all, if there'sno downturn, investors will continue to do better in stocks thanjust about any place else.   <p>  <p>A former Wall Street analyst, Stuart Weiss has written for BusinessWeek and CFO.  <p>  <hr>  <p>Copyright 1993 Capital Publishing Limited Partnership.

 STOCKS AT THE CROSSROADS 
<p>
With interest rates bottoming, mortgage stocks are in a period
of transition. It's time to look for opportunities.  
<p>
 By Derrick Niederman  
<p>
 One of the basic tenets of investing is that a stock should
be sold if the original reasons for owning it are no longer valid.
But what happens when new reasons to own are right around the
corner?  
<p>
 That's what's happening today for investors in mortgage banking
stocks. Some of the forces that have made these stocks such outstanding
investments over the past few years are surely receding. Yet
for those with the courage to weather the turbulence of transition,
some of these stocks have tantalizing silver linings.  
<p>
 It's no secret that long-term interest rates have been declining
for several years. Lower rates on long-term Treasuries have translated
into lower mortgage rates, prompting the largest wave of refinancings
in history and creating a bonanza for the mortgage banking industry.<p>
<p>
 Savings and loans didn't reap anywhere near the windfall that
mortgage banks did. Whereas S&Ls both originate mortgages and
hold at least some of those mortgages in their own portfolios,
a mortgage bank typically sells the mortgages it originates to
one of the government agencies Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie
Mae. But the mortgage bank retains servicing rights on the sold
mortgages, sending out monthly statements, collecting payments,
and the like.   
<p>
 In the 1980s, as the S&Ls foundered and the mortgage-backed
securities business of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae
boomed, the mortgage bankers' share of the mortgage origination
market vaulted from 20 percent to almost 50 percent. This tremendous
growth in market share has continued as rates have gone down
in the last couple of years; competing savings and loans have
concentrated on adjustable-rate mortgages to insulate themselves
from interest-rate swings, and these have become less popular
as fixed rates have reached record lows. Today mortgage banks
account for more than 60 percent of all new loans.  
<p>
 Perhaps the greatest beneficiary of these gains has been Countrywide
Credit, the nation's largest independent mortgage banking company.
In fiscal 1991 the company originated $4.6 billion worth of mortgages.
In 1992 that figure jumped to $12.2 billion. And in fiscal year
1993 (Countrywide's fiscal year ended on February 28) it hit
$32.4 billion. During this time earnings quadrupled, and Countrywide
stock moved from $5 to its current level of about $27 per share.<p>
<p>
 Today, however, the stock market appears worried about lenders
in general and Countrywide in particular, and not without reason.
Long-term rates can't come down indefinitely. More than 85 percent
of Countrywide's earnings are derived from the writing of new
loans, and 75 percent of that comes from refinancings. These
levels look dangerous. Anyone who bought the stock because of
the refinancing boom has plenty of reason to bail out now.  
<p>
 By all accounts, many investors have done just that긊he stock
now trades at just nine times earnings, cheap by any standard.
In the words of the redoubtable Jonathan Gray, financial services
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, "Countrywide's stock price seems
to have inherited the S&Ls' historic role as the ballot box into
which interest-rate votes are cast."  
<p>
 Here's where the opportunity lies. Countrywide isn't nearly
as vulnerable to higher interest rates as conventional wisdom
would have it, and the same goes for competitors such as Margaretten
Financial and North American Mortgage. It may be hard to believe,
but even if interest rates flatten out or go up slightly그nd
refinancing volume therefore dries up considerably근arnings at
these mortgage banks still have the potential to go up.   
<p>
 The paradox is explained by a couple of accounting wrinkles.
The first wrinkle is the loan servicing business. Although refinancing
has been a bonanza for the origination side of the business,
it also reduces the number of old loans being serviced. (The
mortgages that are being repaid have to come from somewhere.)<p>
<p>
 This "runoff" for Countrywide in 1992 was about 30 percent of
its portfolio, well above the 10 percent figure that a normal
year might bring. Not only does that cost the company servicing
revenues, but the run-off also reduces earnings. As with most
companies, Countrywide spreads the costs of acquiring a loan
over the life of the loan; but if those loans are refinanced,
these charges are accelerated and subtracted from current earnings.
Although this risk can be partially hedged, it can produce charges
against earnings that are far bigger than the servicing earnings
themselves.  
<p>
 When refinancings are down, however, these charges are reduced,
and servicing margins then go up. Best of all, servicing all
those new loans can produce a large, reliable income stream as
long as the volume of refinancings stays low. Even if rates completely
flatten out, earnings could move from $2.28 in 1992 to more than
$3.00 in 1993, and could continue to grow at a 10 percent-plus
pace for years to come.   
<p>
 Think of it this way: When a basketball team averaging 100 points
per game loses a player averaging 30 points per game, the team
doesn't then go out and score 70 points. Sometimes other factors
can more than make up the difference그nd that is where Countrywide
stands today.  
<p>
 The other accounting wrinkle is quite different, and so are
its potential beneficiaries. To understand this one, consider
the differences between Countrywide and Margaretten Financial.<p>
<p>
 Countrywide is the industry's low-cost producer, with origination
costs running about 1.5 percent of the amount of the mortgages;
Margaretten, though not the highest-cost producer, has origination
costs almost a full percentage point higher. In a world where
margins are everything, that's a huge difference.  
<p>
 In addition, a big percentage of Margaretten's earnings (90
percent in 1992) comes from the sale of mortgage servicing rights.
Countrywide, by contrast, simply doesn't sell servicing rights.<p>
<p>
 But that doesn't make Margaretten a bad investment; there is
one difference that could work in its favor. Only 14 percent
of Countrywide's new mortgages are generated through its retail
operations (that is, writing mortgages directly to homeowners);
the rest come primarily from mortgage brokers. Margaretten, on
the other hand, produces 77 percent of its mortgage originations
through its retail operations, by far the highest such figure
for any mortgage banker.  
<p>
 This isn't an inherent advantage글n fact, it contributes to
the high cost of originations극ut it could become an advantage
if the Financial Accounting Services Board (FASB) ever decides
to level the playing field for mortgage servicing rights. Under
current regulations, the cost of originating servicing rights
is an expense that must be accounted for at the time of the transaction;
by contrast, the cost of purchased servicing rights can be spread
over a ten-year period. This dramatically understates the earnings
of Margaretten (as well as those of North American Mortgage).<p>
<p>
 If originations and purchases were accorded the same accounting
treatment, earnings at both Margaretten and North American would
more than double. Even if the FASB doesn't act, the fact remains
that actual cash earnings are being understated, which is reason
enough for these companies to buy back stock or for some outside
party to take a keen interest in them.  
<p>
 Are there risks in owning mortgage banking stocks? Of course.
One possibility is a price war on the origination side, which
could happen if vast amounts of mortgage money become available
and go chasing after a smaller pie. And the low valuations are
by themselves no consolation. If the mortgage business ever did
enter such a shakeout period, price-to-earnings ratios would
go up only because earnings had gone down. Fortunately, there
aren't any signs of such a price war starting.  
<p>
 A more realistic concern for investors is the wait for the transition
from refinancing to servicing. Servicing could become the dominant
force, but that doesn't mean the market is ready for it yet.
At this point, it appears that Wall Street is, quite reasonably,
taking a "show me" attitude toward mortgage bankers and their
ability to thrive in a flat-rate scenario. That's a standard
market response for times like these. But when rates do eventually
flatten out그nd when the earnings reports produce gains anyway긊he
stocks should move appreciably higher, rewarding those who invested
during this tricky transition period.

						 <p>By Andrew Feinberg<p>Pssst, want a loan that's cheap (rates as low as 4.5%), a cinch to get, and often tax-deductible? That doesn't use the house as collateral? How about a margin loan? <p>Seriously.<p>Hundreds of thousands of investors who have never considered margin loans could benefit by reexamining their prejudice against this type of financing. Margin loans can be marvelously convenient and efficient, and they're often a smart alternative__or supplement__to home-equity debt. They may be especially appealing for short-term borrowing needs, such as paying taxes or an emergency. <p>But why borrow against a securities portfolio at all? Why not simply sell assets now and restock the larder later? For at least three reasons. A sell-and-replenish strategy may subject investors to capital gains taxes (in theory, those stocks were bought low and are now selling high). It'll cost more in commissions (for another buy-and-sell ticket). And then there's the opportunity cost if the assets rise sharply after they are sold.<p>Of course, those assets might go into a cataclysmic tailspin, causing a strong desire to shoot the person__in this case, me__who ever told you about the virtues of margin indebtedness. <p>So let's pause here for some words about the mayhem margin can cause and further warn you that margin borrowing generally seems cheapest and most prudent during a bull market. <p>Margin debt can cause major, and potentially irrevocable, damage to psyche and portfolio if not used properly. Ask a market pro about margin and he'll invariably tell at least one stomach-churning tale about leverage's dark and wretched downside. Surprisingly often, the story will be about the market pro himself.<p>Or herself. "Thirty years ago I ran $500 into half a million on margin," says Muriel Siebert, president of Muriel Siebert & Co., a discount brokerage. "Soon afterwards, the half a million turned into $20,000. I said I would never let that happen to me again."<p>And she hasn't. But Siebert__as a creditor__knows firsthand how badly the Crash of '87 bloodied some of her highly margined customers. "We still have liens against people's homes because of '87," she says. <p>The best way for investors to benefit from margin borrowing is to view it as a cheap credit alternative rather than a speculative weapon.<p>Essentially, there are two ways to borrow on margin. Investors can buy on margin__putting up as little as $50 to purchase $100 worth of stock__or can borrow against the assets already in their portfolio.<p>In either case, investors can borrow up to 50% of the value of eligible stocks, mutual funds, and convertible bonds; up to 85% of the value of municipal bonds; and up to 95% of the value of Treasury securities. But the fact that they can doesn't mean they should. Margin makes the most sense when much less leverage is used; borrowing, say, 3%, 5%, 10%, or maybe 15% of the value of a balanced portfolio. (No, balanced doesn't mean owning eight biotech stocks.) Borrowing this way will prevent a margin call, even in a crash.<p>What does the privilege cost? Discount brokers offer discount loan rates__for as low as 4.5% on loans of more than $100,000 from some deep discounters. Other brokers will charge from 5.75% to 8.5%. Typically, investors can get cash instantly, and without a fee by means of a credit card, debit card, or check. (If used to buy securities, the interest on a margin loan is usually deductible against investment income. Investment deductions can be carried forward indefinitely.) <p>"I think people should certainly use margin to refinance higher-interest debt, especially credit-card debt," says Mark Griege, a partner with Robertson, Griege & Thoele, a financial advisory firm in Dallas. "The taboo against using margin__the sense that all margin is bad__is almost an old wives' tale. Margin is an important tool in our toolbox."<p>When might it make sense to reach for this particular tool? <p>* For a short-term bridge loan.<p>* To make a down payment on a home (particularly if it's an extraordinary deal).<p>* To meet an immediate one-time expense that can soon be paid off.<p>* To avoid selling a security prematurely.<p>* To defer taxes on the sale of an investment into the following year.<p>Margin borrowing has been growing as the bull market rumbles along. In February, margin debt hit $44.3 billion, finally eclipsing the previous record, which (what a surprise) was set right before the '87 Crash. Yet there are no hard numbers to prove that conservative use of margin is growing. <p>In recent years, some brokers, most notably <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>, have been pushing margin debt as a credit-management tool (Merrill's margin brochure doesn't even mention the notion of increased leverage until page five.) Merrill is trying hard to rehabilitate the image of margin accounts, partly by toying with the language. Investors don't open a "margin" account at Merrill. They get an Investor CreditLine. And don't worry; no matter what calamities befall a portfolio, they can't possibly trigger a "margin" call. It's now a maintenance call instead. <p>"We're trying to tell our clients that they can do a far better job of managing credit," says Charles A. Humm, senior vice president at Merrill Lynch Credit Corp.<p>Brokers, though, are frustrated that more consumers haven't used margin loans to get rid of other debt that may be 10 or 12 percentage points more expensive. Why is this such a tough sell? Fear and lack of familiarity are two reasons, but there are others. <p>"When people think of loans, they think of banks, not brokers," says John J. DeMarco, a senior vice president at PSI, a Tampa-based financial-services research and consulting firm that regularly surveys affluent households' attitudes toward margin. "Forty percent of the most affluent households carry credit-card debt, but only 6% have margin accounts."<p>Paradoxically, consumers say that paying higher interest rates on their debts makes them feel richer rather than poorer. "Customers like to keep their borrowing separate from their investing, and they feel they're earning more if they don't have a debit balance against their investment accounts," says David Diefenbach, vice president of investor lending services at Prudential Securities. "It's a completely perceptual thing."<p>Although margin borrowing can sharply reduce annual debt-service costs, one potential pitfall of using margin is that the new debit simply accumulates, so there's a temptation never to pay it off. "Before borrowing on margin, investors should have a plan for paying off the debt," advises William G. Brennan, head of the personal financial counseling group at Ernst & Young's Washington, D.C., office.<p>Despite such appeals, margin borrowing sometimes works better in theory than in practice. So says another broker at a major wire house, a man who temporarily left the securities business after seeing the 1973-74 bear market maul his margin clients. "I'm not against using a little margin to buy a blue chip," he says, "but my experience is that people generally use margin to buy garbage. And even if they buy something good, they really start to worry if the stock drops 10%. Because if they're on 50% margin, that's really a 20% drop__and 20% is a magic number that causes some people to go crazy. Buying on margin accentuates the pressure on decision-making." <p>And that can't be a good thing from either a mental-health or an investment perspective. One way to deal with the anxiety is to use margin borrowing only as a short-term, cash-management strategy.<p>Investors, though, can start off using margin intelligently and conservatively and eventually become addicted. "I've seen people start small and then the next thing they know they're leveraged to the hilt," says Jim Rogers, a professional investor and co-host of CNBC's "Your Portfolio." "And then they're wiped out. Investors have to be very, very sure that they know what they're doing."<p>With the market near its all-time high, any investor who uses margin should be very careful. Leverage is the ultimate double-edged sword.<p>Andrew Feinberg, a contributing editor to Worth, is the author of Downsize Your Debt: How to Take Control of Your Personal Finances (Penguin).<p>-----<p>FEAR OF MARGIN CALL<p>Let's address the dread directly: What can I lose? If a Merrill Lynch client buys 100 shares of a $60 stock for $3,000 (that is, on 50% margin), he'll get a margin call if the stock falls to $4278, which represents a 29% decline. In the event of such unpleasantness, he either has to sell some of the stock or put up additional cash or securities as collateral. Use 30% margin, however, and he won't get a margin call until the stock hits $2534, having dropped 57%. Put up 90% cash and use only 10% margin, and the call won't come until the stock hits $9, after a free-fall of 85%. <p> <p><p><p>

						Leman could share her outrage at the system with these people. They'd discuss principled, constructive ways to resist. They were maybe a shade too straight and old-time religious for her taste -- she was more into Native Americanstyle spirituality -- but they were definitely on the beam as far as the government was concerned. Most important, they weren't a bunch of macho jerks, running around the hills with guns, talking about overthrowing the government when they didn't even have the brains to complete their own tax forms, let alone figure out that income taxes were illegal in the first place.<p>The group would get together at Rocky's and talk, kick around ideas. But it all might have just stayed talk, and they might have all fragged off into their own little worlds, if Jeffrey Thayer hadn't arrived in Austin in the summer of 1994.<p>Thayer was one of the hottest speakers on the sovereign lecture circuit. It was Thayer, a Dartmouth grad and former top-gun lawyer in L.A., who'd helped formulate the elaborate language state citizens use to ward off the feds. "Jeffrey ben Richard, House of Thayer, Sui Juris, Ingenuitas juris et de jure" was how his business card read. It might be flowery and stilted, he explained, but in the shadowy world of laws and contracts, the specific meaning of each word, each letter, was crucial. The so-called normal phrasing of names and addresses and zip codes was in fact a lure to suck unwitting U.S. citizens deeper into a web of lies, deceit, control, and slavery. This language explicitly, unequivocally declared your status to be sovereign. It served notice to the authorities that you weren't buying into their word games.<p>Thayer had also helped devise the idea of jural societies or townships, chartered communities of sovereigns that were totally self-governing and truly republican -- all decisions were made by unanimous vote. In 1992, he'd left L.A. for Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he'd organized one of the country's most successful jural societies. Ultra-enlightened, cosmic-muffin Santa Fe was the furthest possible psychic distance from Bo Gritz territory. Now Thayer wanted to start a township in similarly progressive Austin.<p>Leman and the group went to hear him talk. He looked like an Austin guitar player, with his long gray-streaked brown hair tied back in a neat ponytail, his well-kept spade of a goatee, his hip vest, and his easy manner. Thayer started out by attacking the stereotypes. "We're not gun nuts," he said. "We're not white supremacists. We're not woman-haters or -subjugators. We're not evangelical Christians. We're not even America-firsters. Is a black kid in South Africa sovereign? You bet he is. I'm not interested in continuing something that isn't more inclusive. I'm not interested in being angry or confrontational. I'm not interested in running around waving guns. There are too many people waving guns around already.<p>"Have you ever noticed that it's the men who are all gung ho on state citizenship, who make a show of giving up their license plates?" Thayer said. "But that it's usually the wife driving home with a bunch of screaming kids who gets stopped by the police and has the car towed out from under her?"<p>Talk like that persuaded Leman to spend $2,000 on Thayer's House of Common Law course. He handed out a six-inch-thick stack of laws to read, letters to write, forms to file. Thayer said that if it looked difficult and imposing, good. It was imposing. It was difficult and could even be dangerous, if you made a mistake, if you left an opening for the government to come and get you. Sovereign citizenship wasn't for everybody, he warned. He quoted Carlos Castenada: You had to be impeccable. A warrior. You had to follow a path with heart. You had to adopt a different state of mind. You had to realize that you weren't disobeying any laws. You were simply declaring that, through a careful reading of the government's own codes and statutes, you had determined that the laws duplicitously enslaving 14th Amendment, corporate, U.S. citizens simply didn't apply to you. By rejecting a Social Security card, voter registration, a driver's license, a marriage license, a regular bank account, a credit card -- all of it -- you were declaring yourself beyond them.<p>But it was frightening, the idea of cutting loose -- although Leman, of course, was much less hooked in than others in the group. She was single, had no kids, was not paying income taxes, and had never vested herself in the Social Security scam. She wasn't like the Lusks with their house and legal troubles, or Rocky with his family, or the Murrills with their disability pensions and advancing age. If they had the guts to do it, why shouldn't she?<p>She found the sovereign life in general exhilarating and interesting. It was like a knob had turned in her brain, and everything that had been murky and confusing suddenly snapped into focus. Oklahoma City, for example. There was no question in her mind that Oklahoma City was a giant, ghastly setup by the feds. How else could you explain all the FBI and Treasury agents' being "out of the office" that morning? It had all been orchestrated to discredit the movement, to make the mainstream think that they were all gun nuts. Leman still wasn't drawn toward the militia, but the idea didn't intimidate her either. She wasn't afraid of guns. She owned guns herself, a shotgun and a pistol. If more people had guns, like in Switzerland, then people would act better toward one another. They'd show more respect.<p>So now, on a cold Friday evening in early spring, Leman sits in an office-park conference room with Rocky and the Lusks and the Murrills and Jeff Thayer and the other 20 members of the Austin township. They've reached a crucial point in the community's development: their first common-law jury trial. A common-law jury, Thayer explains, is a rightful function of a freestanding township. It's a jury of peers -- real peers, personal acquaintances of the party involved, not the sullen, sad-sack crew of distracted strangers that lawyers stacked in supposedly legitimate courtrooms.<p>Their first case involves the Lusks. Over the past year, the Lusks' legal problems have deepened. The IRS foreclosed on their house and sold it at auction. They impounded Tom's car. These actions were blatant crimes against the jural society's common law, of course -- theft and trespassing, as clear as cable reception or a baby's conscience. The IRS had no jurisdiction, because the Lusks weren't U.S. citizens. They'd declared themselves outside the federal district.<p>Of course, so had the Freemen in Montana. The Lusks were in the same situation as those cowboys, really: rightfully occupying property unlawfully foreclosed. Unlike the Freemen, however, the Austin township wasn't going to seize TV cameras or frighten reporters -- as much as those lying lackeys deserved it -- or antagonize their neighbors. No, they were going to respond in a principled manner, according to the Old Testament Mosaic law, in the true spirit of the Constitution. They would use words as weapons.<p>For hours on end, the words flow. Computer engineers, yoga teachers, a former attorney, a retired civil servant, a real-estate agent, all weighing and parsing and polishing and chiseling the words, hammering out unanimously agreed upon republican truths instead of coerced, diluted, democratic "justice." Leman, characteristically, sits at the edge of the room, away from the table, letting Thayer and the others do most of the talking. Every now and then, she chips in with a bit of real-estate expertise.<p>Breaktimes come and go, and not until Rocky's kid comes in with a pizza does Leman realize nobody's bothered with dinner. Now they're discussing damages -- to be paid out by the criminal government in troy ounces of gold, not the Monopoly money printed by the Federal Reserve -- when suddenly Leman remembers her early days as a sovereign, when she was still haunted by doubts about the path she'd chosen.<p>For an instant, she even imagines how this trial might appear to an outsider: a bunch of lunatics arguing about what Solomon would've done if his house had been foreclosed on. Grown women and men demanding with straight faces that the government own up to its sins and pay for them in gold. Who are they trying to kid? Some bought-and-paid-for judge would take one glance at this writ they were slaving over, laugh, and toss it into the trash. They might as well be home with the rest of the losers in front of their V-chipped TVs.<p>What's going to happen to the Lusks? What's going to happen to all of us?<p>But Thayer keeps taking them through the writ, word by word. "If the judge refuses us, we'll just take it to the Court of Appeals," he says quietly. "If Appellate won't hear us, we'll take it to the Supreme Court. And if the Supreme Court refuses to hear us, we'll just keep going. We'll go to the World Court at the Hague, if we have to. We have the law on our side. We will be heard."<p>Leman relaxes, letting herself fall back under the spell of the words. For a fleeting moment, it's as if she were back at the club, waiting to step onto the stage, sensing the eyes raking her, pushing the edges, tasting pure freedom building into pure energy, no one else to hang onto, no one else to blame.<p>A bitter, massive, mutual denial fuels the war between the sovereigns and the government. Just as sovereign citizens refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of the federal government, so the government refuses to acknowledge the sovereigns' very existence. In the taxonomy of the IRS, for example, state citizens don't rate their own category but are lumped in with the larger classification of tax protesters. And tax protesters, IRS spokesman Anthony Burke insists, raise barely a blip on the agency's screen.<p>"Over and over, the courts have held that the tax protesters' arguments are spurious and without merit," Burke says. "And traditionally, tax protesters have represented a very small, almost minuscule percentage of the tax gap -- the difference between what taxpayers owe and what the service collects."<p>When I describe the extent of the sovereign operations in Austin and Los Angeles and how rapidly the movement appears to be growing, Burke seems unimpressed. "You can lose perspective," he cautions. "It even happens with our own agents sometimes. They get wrapped up in an especially challenging case, and they come running to tell us we've got to put together a task force to deal with this huge, urgent, nationwide problem. But then they calm down and examine the facts. They see that, when you take a national perspective, as the service must, their case isn't really such a huge problem after all."<p>Sovereigns respond to the government's seeming dismissal with increasing boldness. In general, state citizens regard government representatives less as bogeymen to be feared than as symbols of a beleaguered, fraying, surprisingly ineffectual empire. A rapidly widening gulf separates the sovereign island from the establishment mainland. "One of my big challenges," says Steve Jones, a state citizen who works closely with Richard McDonald in Los Angeles, "is not to be too condescending toward people who, whether out of ignorance or fear, still choose to be U.S. citizens."<p>This growing contempt, ironically, has led to a decline in what has been state citizens' signature characteristic: paranoia. Sovereigns, for instance, despise reporters nearly as much as they do IRS auditors. They assume that mainstream journalists serve as direct mouthpieces for the establishment and that if by some miracle an unbiased story got written -- if a reporter told the "truth" -- it would never get published or broadcast. Yet throughout my travels in sovereign country, sources spoke with unvarying candor about their flouting of the law. In dozens of interviews, my credentials as a journalist were challenged only once.<p>"I never lock my doors," Richard McDonald says. "Why should I? I've got nothing to hide. Everything we're doing is perfectly lawful. I'd say the same thing to you whether you're an undercover agent or a reporter or someone who's really interested in becoming a state citizen."<p>"We don't waste a lot of energy looking up in the sky for black helicopters," agrees Alan Bird, a close associate of McDonald's in Los Angeles County. "Personally, I've gotten away from worrying about conspiracies or trying to puzzle out the big picture. I don't know if we're in this mess due to people being deliberately evil or if it's just been a matter of business as usual, of people in power naturally wanting to perpetuate their power. What difference does it make? I'm not concerned about how well organized the cabal is. I'm just concerned about my own response."<p>Alan Bird is a 39-year-old husband and father of three young children. He is crisply articulate and has a sharp, analytic turn of mind. The rigidity in his character is softened by his surfer's dirty-blond hair and the offhand ease of a longtime Californian. In 1993, he abandoned a prosperous career in mortgage banking to commit himself to the sovereign movement.<p>Bird graduated from Pepperdine University and worked in the aerospace industry before moving into mortgage banking. He married and started a family. All the while he felt a political restlessness, a dissatisfaction that led him to study but ultimately reject mainstream conservatism, the John Birch Society, and the Libertarian Party. "I swore to myself if I ever found a system of beliefs that answered all my questions, that provided a legal basis for effective action, that I knew in my heart to be true, then I would follow it completely, no matter what the consequences," Bird says. "I've found that system in state citizenship."<p>Bird began studying with Richard McDonald. He quickly became fascinated by the intricate workings of the law and by McDonald's rough-hewn but seemingly brilliant grasp of it. He even developed a fondness for McDonald's ornery style. When Bird had a question, McDonald would answer by throwing a law book at him and snarling, "Here, look it up yourself!" Undaunted, Bird kept grilling his mentor. He felt at times like a squirrel gathering nuts. But the nuts, Bird soon became convinced, had sprouted into a towering forest of deceit, coercion, and encroaching enslavement.<p>Bird makes his specific stand on the most hallowed of Southern California ground: the highway. In 1992, he mailed his driver's license and plates back to the Department of Motor Vehicles. For two years, he roamed the roads and freeways like a sovereign Flying Dutchman, with a bill of sale displayed in the window of his '65 Mustang in lieu of license plates. He says he was stopped twice by the authorities but never ticketed or arrested. Finally, in September 1994, Bird was driving in Ventura County. In his rearview mirror, he watched a patrol car do a U-turn, hustle up on his tail, and follow him for seven miles. Finally, the siren blipped and the roof light began to spin.<p>"Sorry, I don't have one," Bird said when the deputy asked for his license. "I sent it back to the DMV. Would you like to see the documentation?"<p>The deputy smiled as he wrote out the citation. "No thanks." He ripped off the ticket and handed it to Bird. "Sign this, please."
"If I don't, will you take me to jail?"<p>The deputy's eyes flickered as he checked the angles of the windows and the positioning of hands, trying to guess Bird's intent. "If it comes to that, sir."<p>"Very well. I'll affix my seal to it" -- only unwitting United States citizens "sign" documents, thereby surrendering their rights -- "but I am only doing so under duress."<p>The deputy relaxed. "Tell it to the judge, sir."<p>Bird, who had studied every California motor-vehicle law dating from the turn of the century, did so. He argued that the state required a Social Security number for an individual to be issued a driver's license, but that the Social Security system was voluntary. Therefore, if he declined a Social Security number because of his political and religious convictions, it was a legal impossibility for him to be penalized for not carrying a driver's license. To his amazement and delight, the court agreed. After a half-day trial, Ventura Municipal Court judge Thomas Hutchins found Bird not guilty -- on grounds of insufficient evidence -- of driving without a license, driving without registration, and having no registration in his possession. The acquittal made news throughout Southern California and raised jubilation in state-citizen communities nationwide.<p>"The district attorney tried to shrug it off, saying that an inexperienced, overworked prosecutor got sandbagged and made a technical error," says Bird proudly. "They wanted to contain the damage by writing me off as a loose cannon, a guy with too much time on his hands. They tried to trivialize what had happened. But that prosecutor never proved I needed a license. The truth was I simply argued my case better."<p>Four months later, Bird was again cited. This time he was convicted of failing to display front and rear license plates, and his car was impounded. Heartened by his earlier victory and still flushed from facing down the prosecutor in his own courtroom, Bird appealed the judgment. He lost again. He is appealing to a higher court.<p>Alan Bird's existential leap against the Power seems in some ways admirable; his dedication, high-mindedness, and rigor represent whatever good sovereign citizenship might have to offer. But at the same time, he represents what's most pernicious and wildly wrongheaded about the movement. Bird claims little interest in conspiracies, for instance, when in fact his tacit faith in the Big Evil informs all his actions. For without that evil -- the existence of which can ultimately be neither proved nor disproved -- Bird's resistance loses all honor and validity. He becomes just another cranky citizen with a grievance, taking easy, constitutionally guaranteed shots at a sprawling system deeply, perhaps inherently, but not criminally flawed.<p>As with fundamentalist Christians whose love of God is rooted in hatred of the devil, state citizens stake their salvation on the presence of a shadow. And, as with many fundamentalists, the sovereigns' image of hell is far more vivid than their conception of heaven. State citizens spit out rapid, well-prepared ripostes to every challenge I threw at their teachings. When I asked what the world would look like if they prevailed, however, they turned strangely tongue-tied. Some stammered platitudes about small utopian communities in which untrammeled personal freedom would be balanced by unending personal responsibility. They were clearly relieved, however, when the conversation returned to the abominations of government, against which they were pitted in a grim yet glorious holy war. Hell seemed infinitely more familiar, authentic, and interesting.<p>Jared Held, a 42-year-old recording engineer and Internet consultant in Studio City, California, tells a state-citizen bedtime story. <p>A genially schizoid blend of music-industry longhair and practicing Mormon, Held claims not to have paid federal taxes since 1974. The story starts with Held sitting in his apartment one day in 1993, talking with a friend. Suddenly his door buzzer sounds.<p>"I press the intercom, and it's officer so-and-so from the Internal Revenue Service," recalls Held with a gleeful glint. "My friend says, 'I better go,' but I tell him, 'No, no, it's okay.' I say into the intercom, 'Please state your business in writing and mail it properly. I will read it and make a timely and appropriate response.'<p>"A minute later, the buzzer rings again. I push the button. 'Mr. Held, I am here on extremely urgent IRS business, and it would be very much within your best interest if you come down and discuss it with me.' I say no again. But by now, my friend is getting really uncomfortable and wants to leave.<p>"So we're walking downstairs, and there's this agent. The building manager has buzzed him in. My friend leaves. The agent's confident, he's coming on strong. I tell him I want to tape-record our conversation. He says, 'You have to notify us ten days in advance if you want to tape-record our conversation.'"<p>Held slaps his knees and rocks forward, laughing. "So, of course, I answer, 'How can I notify you ten days in advance if you show up unannounced?' Then he changes his tack. 'Is that your Volvo parked in front?' I say, yes, that's my Volvo, but it's not registered in my name. That quiets him down. Then I start playing with him a little.<p>"'You've sworn to uphold and defend democracy, right?' The guy puffs up his chest and says, yeah, sure, damn straight. And I say, 'Have you read the Constitution lately? Our form of government is a republic, not a democracy. It looks like you've been defending the wrong government.' The guy backed off after that. Before he left, he told me that I'd be dealing with another agent from then on. He said he was going to resign from the service. I haven't heard a word from the IRS since."<p>A sovereign citizen could delightedly imagine the loutish evil revenuer and Jared Held as Grasshopper. The evil man attacks, and Grasshopper, the sovereign, uses nifty kung-fu moves to induce the revenuer to defeat himself with his own dark energy. Afterward, Grasshopper kindly and humorously instructs his vanquished opponent. The revenuer goes away enlightened. Grasshopper bows and walks back upstairs to his computer.<p>A burdened, taxpaying, fully licensed, and insured U.S. citizen might envision a different script. In this version, the action is ongoing. Jared Held is still living on borrowed -- more accurately, stolen -- time. A better-prepared IRS agent simply hasn't gotten around to him yet. The story ends not with Grasshopper bowing and heading back up to his computer but with a tax chiseler being led off in handcuffs, watching his Volvo slowly rise on the tow-truck hook.<p>"Our government's gotten so big," says Gail Reese, deputy secretary of taxation and revenue for the state of New Mexico, "that if you decide you don't want to play along with it, you can go for a long time before anybody catches on."<p>Reese has recently begun the protracted, delicate, and difficult process of settling New Mexico's business with the Santa Fe jural-society township. She explains that she's received a respectful letter from the township requesting a "dialogue" with her agency. <p>"Maybe the most sincere and ethical of these people really consider themselves utopians, not so different from the Amish or Quakers," she muses. "They picture themselves living out on the frontier, taking care of themselves and each other, neither expecting anything from the government nor owing it anything. A nice picture. Except where's the frontier today? America used to have all this room. We just don't have that much room anymore."<p>Kristi Daniell, a 40-year-old telemarketing executive for a major West Coast bank, drives up Box Canyon Road on a bright Sunday morning in midwinter, bound for the weekly state citizens' introductory meeting at Richard McDonald's house. The gleaming flagships of the great retail chains are just opening for business on Topanga Canyon Boulevard. Along the arroyos and dry washes, soft-
bellied middle-aged men in blinding shades of Lycra pedal thousand-dollar mountain bikes. High above, hawks drift the thermals, and coyotes drowse on ridgelines in the early sun.<p>Daniell drives distractedly, trying to follow the cryptic directions she scribbled down the day before. Follow Box Canyon Road to the carcass of the old school bus parked on the right....<p>There's the bus, and there's the rutted dirt road, the oak trees tucked into a cleavage between steep brown bluffs. A long, low stone-and-beam building pokes out from the trees. Daniell's throat tightens as she climbs out of her car. The enormity of what she's considering -- giving up the taxes, the licenses, the Social Security, the whole tangled nest of plastic and accreditation and identification that she knows is the problem, but from which she also draws such comfort, such deep American confidence that everything ultimately will be all right -- suddenly strikes. <p>In her mind's eye, she jumps back into her car, cranks into reverse, and fishtails away from this whole creepy scene. Tomorrow morning it'll all just be a funny story she can tell her friends at the office.
Daniell shakes off the vision and continues walking tentatively across the dry creek bed to the spooky sign -- you are entering a sacred place -- and into the, well, compound. She keeps walking because everything isn't all right. Because the Stars and Stripes that John Wayne died for in all those late shows flies, in fact, over a land of shadows.<p>Daniell enters the dark book-lined house to meet Citizen Richard J. McDonald, Sui Juris -- to take her first free, halting steps toward certainty and sovereignty.<p>

						It has problems, and the politicians have moved on. But the flat tax makes sense. Let's make it work.<p>By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>In march, while waiting to testify before Congress about tax reform, I watched as a panel of experts discussed the federal tax system's problems. Four gold-leaf eagles loomed silently over the House Ways and Means Committee hearing room. Rachel Wildavsky, senior staff editor of Reader's Digest, took the microphone to tell Chairman Bill Archer and his colleagues about a nationwide poll conducted by her magazine. I sat up to listen.<p>The poll asked 1,015 taxpayers for their opinions about the fairness of the current tax system. The most compelling finding: Americans from all income levels and nationalities resoundingly agree that the maximum tax rate for a family of four with $200,000 in income should be 25 percent. "If you asked whether the ocean was wet, you'd probably find this kind of unanimity," she told the committee.<p>Wildavsky also reported the less surprising news that most Americans believe not only that they are overtaxed but that their neighbors--both rich and poor--are overtaxed, too. She concluded that the poll found no support for the myth that many middle- and working-class Americans believe rich people are not paying their fair share. Wildavsky then sat back in her chair. There was a pause.<p>Representative Sam Gibbons blinked his swollen eyes, cleared his throat, and harrumphed, "The needs of government are greater than 25 percent of the American citizens' income." Next, Representative Charles Rangel piped up to ask Wildavsky, "What annoys taxpayers most about their taxes?"<p>"High rates," she replied.<p>"That's never going to change," declared Rangel.<p>There. They said it. It was a moment of shocking candor, breathtaking stupidity, or both. The members of the most powerful congressional committee had just revealed their true cynicism (and a reason for term limits) about the tax dollars they collect from citizens like you and me.<p>I was a little surprised at how angry I felt as I left the hearing room later that day. When I got back to my desk in Manhattan, I did more research and talked with tax experts across the country about the best ideas to fix the tax system. The outcome: Although I'm still skeptical about some of its tenets, I'm now a believer in the concept of a flat tax.<p>I'm convinced that Congress has become too adept at obscuring its every costly move in a fog of multiple tax rates and a spiraling budget deficit. The complexities of the tax system make it hard for us to know not only exactly when our taxes are going up or down--but whose fault it is. The cruelest trick of the current system is that many people end up blaming their steep tax bills on themselves. For example: "If I had just planned my finances better, I could have taken a few more deductions."<p>Along with making ample cuts in unnecessary spending, Congress should seriously consider a tax system with one flat rate--or one of several compelling new proposals (based on the principles of a flat tax) that would at least reduce rates and curtail deductions.<p>Yes, I did write last October about the problems associated with a flat tax: namely, the elimination of certain deductions and the possible loss of employer-provided health benefits. Yes, I did poke fun at the flat tax proposed by Representative Dick Armey and Senator Richard Shelby for proclaiming to kill all deductions when, in fact, it would allow a 100 percent write-off for business-entertainment costs.<p>These negatives, however, don't outweigh the positives of converting the federal income-tax system to a flat tax.<p>The current tax system is unfair and polluted with unnecessary complexity. It costs taxpayers tens of billions of dollars just to comply with its arcane rules and regulations. It costs the economy tens of billions of dollars in wasteful investments. It fosters an environment in which more than four million people don't file tax returns each year, including 26,883 federal workers (956 of whom work for the Treasury, according to the weekly Tax Notes). Thanks to artificial subsidies, it makes housing and health care more expensive than necessary.<p>This country needs a saner, simpler, cheaper, and, most of all, fairer tax system. The Kemp Commission stated the principle of fairness in this way: If a taxpayer earns ten times as much as his or her neighbor in taxable income above a personal exemption, he or she should pay ten times as much in taxes. Not 20 times as much, as he or she does (give or take the input of a good accountant)  with multiple tax rates.<p>The single greatest benefit of the flat tax would be that everyone could easily anticipate how much they'd be expected to pay each year--including years in which Congress decided to raise or lower the overall rate. Of course, this is also the biggest reason politicians and other Washington insiders dislike the idea, regardless of what else they might say in public. With a flat tax in place, Congress could no longer raise taxes without Americans' understanding exactly and immediately how it would affect their family budgets.<p>The flat tax would also strip self-serving Washington insiders of much of their power to award favors. It's no coincidence that the chairmen of the two tax-writing committees, the Senate Finance and the House Ways and Means, are routinely among the leaders in attracting campaign contributions--and that their fellow committee members typically rake in above-average contributions as well.<p>The complexities of the current tax code are also part of the reason there are more lawyers in the D.C. bar (65,000) than in the New York City bar (45,000), even though the capital's population is a third smaller than New York. The tax-preparation industry is a $35 billion business that owes its very existence to the current system.<p>Merton H. Miller, a Nobel Prize winning professor emeritus of economics at the University of Chicago, noted recently that a flat tax "may well strike politicians as nutty because they would lose their main tool for handing out hidden subsidies--deductions, credits, and exemptions for favored constituents and special interests. And, of course, armies of tax lawyers and accountants would lose their jobs and be forced to enter productive employment."<p>Then there's the Internal Revenue Service--America's museum of mass confusion. The federal income tax chews up 6,439 pages of fine print covering some 336 feet of shelf space. Each year, the IRS churns out about eight billion pages of forms and instructions to about 114 million taxpayers--a paper load for which 293,760 trees pay the ultimate sacrifice.<p>Not surprisingly, the code leaves many a taxpayer in a swivet every spring. Individuals annually spend a collective 1.7 billion hours and more than 100 billion nondeductible dollars embroiled in tax-related paperwork. (Even Albert Einstein needed help with his income taxes.) The tax man is often stumped, too. A retired IRS agent from Michigan recently told the Kemp Commission: "When people who are employed to enforce the tax laws have difficulty understanding its complicated and sometimes incomprehensible provisions, it's time for a change."<p>Furthermore, the current system is a disaster when it comes to helping people save and invest. Say a family in the 28 percent tax bracket finds a way to earn an additional $1,000. They'll pay $280 in taxes on that amount. If they invest the $720 they have left over in a company's stock, their share of any profits will be reduced by federal taxes on corporate earnings (up to 35 percent). If the stock pays a dividend, the family has to pay tax on that at the 28 percent rate. If the stock rises in price, the family will pay the 28 percent capital-gains rate upon sale. If they hold the asset long enough, the government will eventually take its bite when it collects estate taxes (up to 55 percent).<p>Dale Jorgenson, a professor of economics at Harvard University, estimates that household income and wealth in the U.S. would be $1 trillion  higher than it is today without these multiple layers of taxation. That's an increase of about 13 percent, or $6,500 a year for typical middle-income American families.<p>At the moment, the only extant flat-tax proposal is the one sponsored in the House by Armey and in the Senate by Shelby. Their flat tax mirrors a plan introduced in 1981 by Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, senior fellows at the conservative Hoover Institution. The Armey version starts with a 20 percent tax rate but drops to 17 percent in the third year. (The Treasury Department says a 20.8 percent rate would be revenue neutral.) It doesn't tax estates, gifts, capital gains, interest income, dividends, or Social Security benefits. 
It also offers hefty standard deductions. At its 17 percent rate, these deductions amount to $11,350 for singles and $22,700 for married couples, with dependents at $5,300 each. Because of these fat deductions, not only would poor people not be hurt, as many have protested, but many would not have to pay any taxes.<p>Armey says his plan is progressive, too, because its low effective rate (total tax divided by total income) rises with income. A family of four with $50,000 in income would pay an effective tax rate of 5.7 percent; one earning $100,000, nearly 11.3 percent; and one pulling in $200,000, 14.2 percent.<p>Still, the ArmeyShelby plan is encountering stiff opposition for two reasons: It wipes out the deduction for the payment of home-mortgage interest, and it would allow a rich person living off interest and dividend income to escape paying a fair share of the cost of government services.<p>Adding any deductions to a flat-tax plan causes the rate at which revenue remains constant to increase. Still, they're worth considering, since the resulting rates are generally lower than what we face now. William Gale, an economist at the liberal Brookings Institution, says adding payroll-tax deductions to the flat tax would boost the base rate to 23.5 percent. Adding a mortgage-interest write-off on top of that would raise the rate to 24.8 percent. Adding a further deduction for charitable contributions would hike it up to 25.2 percent.<p>However, J. D. Foster and Art Hall, economists at the Tax Foundation, suggest a possible solution: a flat tax that offers a choice. Taxpayers could either take the personal exemption or choose the mortgage-interest and charitable deductions. This choice would produce effective tax rates along the lines of the ArmeyShelby proposal.<p>As for the second problem, Foster and Hall offer another solution: Levy the flat-tax rate on all personal capital acquired before the enactment of the tax, but provide a $1 million exemption and give taxpayers ten years to pay up. This onetime tax on only old--as opposed to new--capital (which amounts to $11.5 trillion after the million-dollar exemption) would actually enable government to set a revenue-neutral flat-tax rate as low as 16.2 percent. Although revenue from this old-capital tax would be exhausted after ten years, Foster says it's possible a flat tax could boost economic growth enough to make up the difference.<p>This flat tax would also give the middle class a sizable tax cut--a political necessity for enacting true tax reform.<p>Any transition to a new system is bound to cause problems--a lot of problems. It will unwind and undo every weird anomaly Congress has legislated into the economy--against the better judgment of a free market. It won't favor wealthy, middle-aged home owners over young adults who are just beginning their careers and can afford only to rent. It won't provide tax advantages to couples who decide against marriage or those who decide to divorce. It won't favor cheaters over honest folks. It won't discourage investing, hard work, or pursuing the American dream.<p>It will, however, require politicians to tell us exactly how much they plan to charge us for the cost of government. It will make it cheaper and easier for us to do our taxes. And it will make it less costly for the government to collect them. <p><p><p><p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> GIVING FAMILIES THE BUSINESS <p>The estate-tax bill comes with more strings than an orchestra <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald  <p> The estate-tax bill introduced last July by Senator Bob Dole is still kicking around in Congress -- but is it a good thing? As it stands, the proposal would gradually increase the amount excluded from estate tax from $600,000 to $750,000. It would also give some relief to family-owned businesses, exempting the first $1 million in certain holdings and 50 percent of the next $1.5 million.   <p> So far, so good. But take a deep breath. To qualify, the value of a family-owned business must represent at least half the deceased's estate. No stock or debt of the company can have been publicly traded over the previous three years. The deceased must have materially participated in the business for at least five out of eight years before death. And each heir (or a member of his or her family) must materially participate in the business for five out of eight years within ten years after the death -- or the tax break would be lost retroactively.  <p>  <p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> PUTTING ON A FACE OF FEAR <p>Behind the terrifying, all-powerful Internal Revenue Service are real live human beings. If you can't love them, respect them. It may help you survive an audit.   <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald  <p> As a faceless bureaucracy, the Internal Revenue Service knows no peers. No agent has risen to national prominence. no commissioner has garnered much public attention. Although Americans find the agency frightening and secretive, it has yet to capture the imagination of Stephen King or Tom Clancy. Buck Henry played an agent in the movie Grumpy Old Men, but big deal: Buck Henry is hardly Arnold Schwarzenegger or Harrison Ford. Nor do agents get clever monikers. They aren't G-men or T-men or spooks or narcs. Even the IRS accountant who nailed Al Capone is a virtual unknown. What's his name? Elmer Irey. But who cares!   <p> Deep down inside, we think that no single individual put away Capone. We think he was brought down by the whole kit and caboodle-- the IRS itself, in all its glory. So successful has the IRS been at convincing us of its utter anonymity that we quake before it, like some sort of bewildered Kafka character. Without stretching our imaginations much, we become this infernal machine's pitiful victims.  <p> A pretty picture, but incomplete. Yes, the IRS is indisputably powerful, and yes, taxpayers find it hard to extricate themselves once the IRS's gears begin to turn. But the agency is made up of thousands of agents and auditors -- more than 19,000 in all. And they probably have more individual power than any other government workers, with perhaps the exception of Supreme Court justices. They are cop, prosecutor, and judge all rolled into one. They gather facts, analyze them, and mete out punishments.  <p> Agents are instructed to make audits as crisply professional-- i.e., anonymous -- as possible. But as much as an agent may hope to make the audit seem like a bunch of numbers (the taxpayer) meeting a body of law and a computer (the agent/auditor), itis really one human being sitting down with another, a bunch of biases, points of view, and backgrounds coming together over a steel desk. (Agents know what people think of them: Whenever someone asks what she does for a living, Manhattan auditor Jacqueline Wright says, "I work with lawyers." Auditor Ed Carroscio says,"I tell people I work for the Treasury Department.")  <p> Agents can make you or break you; they can be nice or they can be mean. So save yourself some money: Get to know them. You'll find they are just like the rest of us. Some just want to get through the day. Others are looking for promotions. None wants to be messed with.  <p> Meet Etta Owens. She's a wry, somewhat world-weary agent of 48 who works out of a Manhattan IRS office. She began life in Birmingham, Alabama, in a big old house with her parents and six brothers and sisters. Her father made metal pipes at the local American Cast Iron Pipe Company until the 1950s, when he was almost killed in an explosion that left a train track of stitches across his forehead. Etta's mother ran a beauty shop over the garage.  <p> Growing up black in Birmingham during the 1950s and 1960s put Owens square in the center of the civil-rights movement. She lived under Jim Crow laws and found a hero in Martin Luther King Jr. "What he was saying was true," she says. "We couldn't get jobs, we saw what our parents were going through, we were tired of being poor, of being told where to sit, where to walk, where to drink교nd I thought, Enough is enough."  <p> On the morning of May 3, 1963, King's associates turned up at the doors of A. H. Parker High School, Owens's school. With the rest of her schoolmates, she went to the rally at the 16th Street Baptist Church. Then she marched downtown. She was there when police commissioner Bull Connor jumped into a white army tank, and she watched as his men turned water cannons, police dogs, and billy clubs on the marchers.   <p> She left Birmingham in l967, because, she says, "it was time. I had become a radical in attitude; I didn't believe in saying 'Yes, ma'am, No, sir' to white people day in and day out. They didn't show my parents the same respect. Then I was a little ornery, a little headstrong." Bowing to the wishes of her mother,she enrolled in college, Hudson County Community College in New Jersey, and graduated in 1972, a part of the first huge wave of black women to go to college. Her relatives in Birmingham, she says, "are proud of me now, considering that they thought I was radical."  <p> Today, Owens is divorced and lives with her 16-year-old daughter, Azur宓, whose photograph she keeps on her desk along with a sign that reads: a closed mouth catches no flies. She sings in a church choir on weekends and meets once a month for a hand of bid whist with her buddies, half of whom have had run-ins with the IRS. She says she never talks about her job because her friends consider the agency a "nuisance." Her Birmingham days are "a lifetime away," she says. "You'll see no hint of retribution from me. You grow, you get older. I've become shrewd, astute, thick-skinned. I've learned how to deal with people."  <p> As a practical matter, Owens has had no choice. In her 25-year career, she has audited about 10,000 returns, some in the office, some in the field. She started out auditing individuals; today, she goes after bigger fish -- businesses in the underground economy. She compares outside audits to "going into an abyss" and remembers one taxpayer who had strewed anatomically correct male dolls all over his apartment. "I thought that was in really poor taste," she says. <p>It was also just another lesson in human behavior. "Being an auditor makes you street-smart," she explains. "I know now exactly when a person is B.S.'ing me. I can pick up the stench of a dishonest taxpayer."  <p> Etta Owens is one of seven New York City examiners we interviewed to find out where agents come from, what they're like, and how they spend their days. In Manhattan, many auditors and agents are female and minorities. Nationally, 35 percent of all agents are female; 20 percent are minorities.  <p> All agents are required to have a minimum of three years of college study, appropriate business experience, or a combination of both. Auditors earn from $20,617 to $40,614; revenue agents such as Etta can make up to $70,032. (A number of the agents we talked to worry about job security, mostly because of the recent discussions of the flat tax and the downscaling of the IRS's latest budget requests.) <p>Every year, agents must attend several seminars on integrity. In New York City, employees go to either a conference room at headquarters or an auditorium at New York University. There they are dutifully told not to take bribes, not to snoop into taxpayers' returns (like those of a neighbor or a former girlfriend or boyfriend), and not to use their personal lives as a yardstick when auditing taxpayers. The first two are relatively easy to avoid. The third can be more difficult.  <p> Rosalee Chin-Young, 29, is a voluble, bright woman with a powerful memory, the fifth child of a family of ten who emigrated from Jamaica to the United States at the age of 16. Her mother, Joyce, is a nurse; her father, Watson Fook Chin-Young, is a barber. Rosalee came to the IRS in October 1990 with a degree in marketing from the State University of New York at New Paltz. "I always dreamed of being a doctor or a dancer," she says wistfully. "But I always liked business." After just two years as an auditor, she has already completed 3,000 examinations.  <p> Chin-Young's day begins when she and about 20 other auditors arrive at their desks at 8:30. They work in a midtown office roughly the size of a football field, with lowish ceilings, fluorescent lights, and the omnipresent hum of paper shredders (five in all). Each morning Chin-Young pulls up her standard-issue black metal chair to her standard-issue black metal desk and plugs in tax-return information on a Gridcase 1520 portable laptop computer. Leafing through her desk drawers -- stuffed with awards and certificates the IRS hands out for reasons such as "patriotic service" --she pulls out 1 of the 12 forms she may need to complete an audit. Overhead are three shelves of income-tax regulations and the Internal Revenue code.   <p> Chin-Young is expected to close each case the day of the audit, preferably within five and a half hours. When she's free, she spends hours going through records, filling out forms, writing reports and letters, and researching IRS manuals, publications, and data on the IRS computers. She must also meticulously track each and every thing she does for an audit -- from making phone calls to assessing penalties -- by using as many as three different logbooks. At 4 p.m. she fills out her "activity record." Twice a week she completes a record of the hours spent on each audit, how much money she assessed, and how much she collected. Most days Chin-Young leaves at five sharp.  <p> She now dreams of working in the national IRS office in Washington,D.C., on a congressional task force where she can make recommendations on how the IRS can simplify its tax forms and procedures. It is a long way from Swan Lake.   <p> According to a 1993 survey of 2,000 taxpayers conducted by Roper Starch Worldwide and sponsored by Worth, 7 percent, or 140 people, had been audited by the IRS. Of those, 35 percent said they felt "just terrible" about their experiences, 40 percent said they were only a little upset, and 17 percent said it was no big deal. Is this surprising? Not really. Just the notice in the mail --the dull white efficiency of the stationery, the plain black typeface, the little plastic address window, and the return address, "Internal Revenue Service" -- can bring on heart palpitations. <p> Chin-Young keeps magazine clippings of Naomi Campbell and Cindy Crawford on her bulletin board along with a sign that reads: maturity is the ability to control anger and settle differences without violence or destruction. In her office, letters and packages are routinely scanned for mail bombs; occasionally, a taxpayer will show up with a weapon. "Usually men," she says matter-of-factly. "They come in with a knife or gun. We try to get them to reschedule without it."  <p> Numbers and law are important in an audit, but so is the relationship established between the auditor and the "client," the euphemism the IRS uses for an alleged tax cheat. IRS auditors are allowed to search computer records compiled by the post office and the Social Security Administration; by divorce, probate, and bankruptcy courts; and by banks, insurance companies, and, sometimes, credit agencies. They can summon employer personnel records, subscriber-information services, and local and state public records showing ownership of cars, boats, and airplanes. In short, they can probe into the most intimate details of a taxpayer's life.   <p> The IRS recently decided that an auditor is supposed to audit "the taxpayer, not just the tax return," according to IRS auditor training materials. At the same time, comparisons of lifestyles are not supposed to be made. The auditor is not supposed to reflect on the differences between her client and herself. Once that happens, says Etta Owens, "you're no longer a professional." <p> Yet is this always possible? Of course not. Owens recalls an incident early in her career when "a taxpayer came in with a little pushcart filled with nothing but 1099s. Her interest income was $65,000 alone. Of course, she wasn't paying any estimated tax. She owed a few thousand dollars, and she asked me, 'Where am I going to get the money to pay it?' I'm sitting there saying to myself, 'I'm making $20,000 in total wages annually and you got $65,000 in interest?' All I said was 'I don't know what to tell you.'"  <p> The IRS estimates that about one in six taxpayers does not comply with tax regulations. (Of course, even the IRS can't audit that many people, so it settles for fewer: In 1994, 1.2 million people were audited, with about 87 percent owing a total of $6.2 billion.) And our seven auditors believe that rich people are less likely to comply than poor people are. "Higher-income people definitely cheat more than lower-income people," says one auditor. Another says, "Just as most children don't lie because they have to learn how, the same goes for the majority of the higher-income people. They learn to manipulate the tax system."  <p> Chin-Young says that establishing a good relationship eases all differences. "We have reasonable allowances and a certain latitude in an audit. For example, depending on the rapport I have with the taxpayer, I'll pick out the largest three or four expenses and maybe not look at the others. Or if a taxpayer verifies 75 percent of their return, I may give them the remaining 25 percent based on their credibility. But for those who try to push me around, then it's going to be a firm by-the-book audit, and we'll go through all of the lines on the return."   <p> The message here is pretty simple. Says Owens, her eyelids resting at half-mast, "The point is not to make us feel small. That's a big mistake."  <p>  <p>STUPID TAX TRICKS  <p> It's not surprising that Ralph Kramden lapsed into his signature stammer -- "hummuna hummuna" -- when the IRS scrutinized his tax return on a Honeymooners episode. Taxpayers often give themselves away with twitches, nail biting, lowered eyes -- signs IRS training materials instruct auditors to look for.  <p> Our seven auditors, who have seen all this and more, share some of the more ridiculous stunts taxpayers use to flummox agents and reduce fines. They offer this advice:  <p> Don't delay. Rescheduling audits or getting the case moved to another IRS office is a dumb taxpayer tactic. Stalling increases interest charges, which run until the auditor closes the case. And anyway, auditors can close out an audit even without the taxpayer's cooperation.  <p> Don't look for sympathy. It doesn't work. Auditor Rosalee Chin-Young explains: "Many taxpayers use crying as a tool to eliminate their taxes. Sometimes they'll cry to intimidate you, and they'll cry loud." Auditor Etta Owens adds: "That's when you say, 'Yeah, right,' and give them a tissue to get on with it."  <p> Owens recalls another sympathy ploy that failed. In January 1995, a Chinese-restaurant owner and Atlantic City gambler came limping into Owens's office wearing a body brace outside his clothes. "I'm very sick," he moaned. Indeed, he went on to say that he had been unable to earn money as a result of a bad fall. Owens asked, "When did you fall?" He replied, "The other day." She deadpanned, "I'm auditing your 1993 return."  <p> Bronx auditor Yvonne Ramos, 38, has knocked off 18,000 audits in her 17 years. During one, she asked about $20,000 in medical expenses. The taxpayer "opened up his shirt to show me his open-heart-surgery scar as if that was proof of his deduction," she says. She did not feel sorry for him.  <p> Don't try to be friends. After auditing 10,500 taxpayers, Manhattan auditor Pamela Lewis, 34, is hip to such behavior. She says,"Some tax professionals figure they should try to get close to me or talk on a first-name basis. They'll say, 'What's your first name?' I'll say, 'It's Miss Lewis -- you don't need to know my first name.'" Some taxpayers go much further. One, who was claiming fake dependents, showed up at Owens's desk with an open shirt exposing his chest and gold chains. He asked Owens where she went socially. When she asked for proof of his dependents, "he pulled out his black book," she says, "and asked, 'Which one do you want to know about?'" implying that a harem of women and their kids would back him up. Owens said, "I have two words for you: 'Sign here.'"  <p> Don't try the paper shuffle. Taxpayers and tax pros often try to clutter up an auditor's desk with their records -- hoping to obfuscate the facts. Lewis says, "You have to say, 'Okay, let's make two piles. Whatever records I haven't seen, I'll put here, and those I have seen will go over here.'" It then becomes clear if the taxpayer is trying to use the same documentation for different write-offs. <p>Don't doctor deductions. Lewis said one taxpayer tried to dupeher by altering a check. "The amount in actuality was $75," she explains, "but he put a 'five' in front of the 'seventy-five'on the amount line and another '5' in front of the '75' in the check amount box." Surprise! The correct amount is found at the end of a string of numbers below the signature line in the bottom right-hand corner of every canceled check. (Beware: The auditors say the most popular spot for cheating is Schedule C, where taxpayers can fully deduct business-related expenses.)  <p> Don't be high and mighty. Some taxpayers and pros think arrogance can help whittle a bill down to zero. Wrong. Ed Carroscio, 37,who has audited 3,700 taxpayers in his four and a half years as an auditor, says, "When taxpayers or tax pros are arrogant, there are problems on the return." Plus, it annoys the auditor. Taxpayers should also beware of tough-talking pros -- some couldn't care less about their clients. "Some reps will say to us, 'Do what you have to do,' even if it means sending taxpayers to bankruptcy court," says Chin-Young. She advises clients to accompany their tax pro to the first session at least, though they can let their accountant answer the questions.  <p> Don't follow Frederick Daily's advice. In his guidebook Stand Up to the IRS, he suggests that "bad B.O. may work," i.e., repel the auditor so that he or she will get you out quickly. Says Chin-Young: "One guy came in smelling like ammonia. Maybe that was his way of getting me to hurry up and get off his return."Of course, she didn't. <p>The best strategy? Just answer the auditor's questions: "Yes,""No," or "I'll get back to you." That's the advice from our experts. <p><p>

						March 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Review  <p> SOFTWARE FOR TAXING TIMES  <p>  <p>TURBOTAX   <p><a name="NASD:INTU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16001"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intuit</b></a>?, $39.95 <p>Available in all formats  <p> KIPLINGER TAXCUT  <p>Block Financial Corporation, $39.95 <p>Unavailable for DOS  <p> PERSONAL TAX EDGE  <p>Parsons Technology, $19 <p>Available in all formats  <p> SIMPLY TAX  <p>4Home Productions, $19.95 <p>For Windows only  <p>  <p>By Andrew Gluck  <p> There's a reason turbotax is the tax-preparation software you should buy for 1996, but it's not that TurboTax makes filing much easier and faster than working by hand (all the programs do that). And it's not that TurboTax is a better program than the competition (they're all good, and more a like than different).TurboTax is the best vehicle because it's made by Intuit, the same company that makes Quicken, the mother of all personal-finance software.  <p> Someday, other tax-software companies may challenge Intuit for sheer reach, but Intuit is constructing a virtual financial supermarket now. It's already possible to buy mutual funds over the Internet through the Quicken Financial Network, and it won't be long before you and I can download all our investment transactions and bank statements directly into a tax-software package, thus leap frogging the biggest hurdle of personal-finance software: all that tedious data entry.   <p> Not that it's easy to go wrong with the other programs. TaxCut, Personal Tax Edge, and Simply Tax are all good programs, as I discovered with the help of Ira Somach, a CPA and president of ARC Personal Financial Planning in Jericho, New York. They do the math correctly, offer lots of filing tips and tax-planning advice, and allow entire returns to be recalculated with just a few key strokes. Also, because in the past few years their makers have copied the best features from one another's programs, these things are now mostly similar. All employ an interview format, for example, to probe a user's tax situation and guide him orher through filing. Their makers all have on-line or Internet sites for updates and information. They even look alike, except for Simply Tax.   <p> There are differences among the programs, of course, and SimplyTax suffers the most from comparisons. It doesn't offer much hand-holding, and its interface, nowhere near as pleasing as that of the others, does nothing to make up for this shortcoming. Worse, Simply Tax, which was written for Windows 95, has a tendency to crash in Windows 3.1.  <p> Differences of style matter, too, in software, and here they're most important in the multimedia versions of the programs (SimplyTax doesn't come in a multimedia version). TurboTax and Tax Cutin corporate a lot of video clips of tax experts and, in TurboTax, actors delivering advice. Personal Tax Edge has fewer video but more audio clips they can be turned off, thankfully which are deployed to guide users through the program itself.  <p> Other distinctions? Personal Tax Edge is strongest for those lucky enough to know their way around the tax rules and forms and for those who fill out multiple returns, because users work more closely with tax forms here than they do in the interviews of other programs. TaxCut handles some routine data entry, such as W-2 numbers, in the simplest way.  <p> But overall, TurboTax has the most going for it: a lot of state versions (45, a couple more than Personal Tax Edge and many more than the others); easy access to cyber-space; the best interaction with Quicken (naturally); and a new phone system that's ready and waiting with 451 people (up from 200 last year) answering calls to provide technical support. All systems are go: Rev up TurboTax.  <p><p>

						March 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Review  <p> SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT TO LOOK IT UP  <p> By Kathleen Murray  <p> Even those doing a return by computer or paying a preparer may occasionally want to get informed the old-fashioned way. Here's the lowdown on those hefty, printed tax guides.   <p> J. K. Lasser's Your Income Tax 1996  <p>(Macmillan, $14.95). The most comprehensive. A step-by-step trip through the income-tax-preparation process with information for almost every imaginable circumstance.  <p>  <p>Consumer Reports Books Guide to Income Tax 1996  <p>(Consumer Reports, $14.99). A god send for its organizer worksheet. Forces even the most disorganized filers to get their acts together.   <p> The Ernst & Young Tax Guide 1996  <p>(John Wiley & Sons, $14.95). Thorough. A good place to turn for those who know exactly what they need to learn.  <p> H & R Block 1996 Income Tax Guide  <p>(Fireside Books/Simon & Schuster, $14). For those who don't mind wading through jargon: Sections on taxpayer rights and IRS audits, for example, sound as if written by the tax agency.  <p> Taxes for Dummies,  <p>1996 edition, by Eric Tyson and David J. Silverman (IDG Books,$14.99). The best of these books for tax novices. Substitutes simple English for tax-code complexities. Notable for its attitude (feisty but agreeable) and helpful icons. <p>   <p>The Complete Idiot's Guide to Doing Your Income Taxes 1996, <p>by Gail Perry (Macmillan/Alpha Books, $14.99). Too cutesy (chaptertitles include "What's So Gross About Income?"). Best tip isa notice to taxpayers: If you're using a Form 1040A or 1040EZ, scan but don't buy this book.<p>

Worth magazine/Features<p>COURT MUSICIANS
To help win their case against the IRS, violinists Richard and Fiona Simon played Bach for the tax judge.<p>By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>Richard and Fiona Simon would eventually win their case against the Internal Revenue Service and, in the process, overturn decades of tax-law precedent and create some fanfare in the nation's largest daily newspapers. But on a bitter December day in 1993, victory seemed a long way off. After three years of battling one of the nation's most powerful and intimidating bureaucracies, the Simons had finally made it into U.S. tax court in lower Manhattan, where Richard was trying to explain their side of the case to Judge David Laro. <p>As 2 of 18 first violinists with the New York Philharmonic, the Simons believed they had every right to depreciate their rare, 200-year-old violin bows as tools of their trade__which they had done on their 1989 tax return and which the IRS had disallowed in l990. The Simons contended they needed the bows to earn a living. Richard Simon, a big, eloquent 59-year-old, told the court that he and his wife were "damned" if they didn't use the bows. "The critics will damn us, the audience will damn us, and our own players will damn us." He asked permission to demonstrate various bows to show their differences in quality. IRS attorney Pamela Cohen objected. <p>But Laro overruled her and asked Simon to proceed. <p>Simon nervously picked through an assortment of bows and plucked out a $30 fiberglass one used for teaching and warming up. He squeaked out several notes. The courtroom flinched.<p>Next, Fiona lifted her 245-year-old Tassini violin to her chin and, with a $1,000 French bow, performed an excerpt from a Paganini caprice. This bow was "very clumsily made" and had a weak sound, Richard told the court. Fiona then performed excerpts from works by Mozart, Handel, and Tchaikovsky, using increasingly higher-quality bows, even one valued at about $12,000. <p>Finally, Fiona picked up one of the two bows at issue in the case__simple, dark wood "sticks" crafted by the master French bow maker Franois Tourte in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. "This bow has a beautiful, bright sound," Richard told the judge, and is "wonderful for...Bach." It cost $21,500. The other, more valuable one, he said, has a "sound suitable for any kind of music." It cost $35,000.<p>The baroque sounds of Bach soon sang out through the courtroom. The IRS attorneys were still. As for Laro, he was leaning back in his chair, his arms folded across his chest, a smile spread across his face.<p>"Can you do a little Beethoven?" he asked.<p>Richard and Fiona Simon's brilliant courtroom performances capped an artfully executed battle against the IRS to reinstate a $3,000 tax break. The IRS had killed the write-off for two reasons. First, the IRS argued, the Simons couldn't depreciate their bows as tools of their trade because they couldn't determine a period of "useful life"__how long the bows would last. Second, taxpayers couldn't take deductions on antique instruments that increased in value as collectibles__such as Stradivarius violins or, in this case, Tourte bows.<p>"This is the way we at the IRS saw it," says Richard Farber, a Department of Justice tax attorney who represented the IRS in court. "It's our job to interpret the law and enforce our interpretation in court." Richard Simon, of course, viewed it differently. "Buying instruments is the most expensive financial investment musicians can make in their careers," he says. "We felt their position was an injustice."<p>The Simons' odyssey took them from the IRS's Manhattan headquarters to U.S. tax court and finally to a federal appeals court in New York, which, in a landmark decision last October, upheld the couple's tax-court victory. But Richard L. and Fiona Simon v. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is more than just a victory for the Simons and for the professional musicians across the country who will now be able to depreciate certain antique instruments. It also casts a spotlight on the IRS--a complex behemoth, obdurate and sometimes dense__and how its arguments can be unraveled by a taxpayer's grit, determination, eloquence, and ability to play Bach. Still, looking at the Simons' situation today, it is amazing that they continue to say the fight was worth it. <p>**DECK**
The case began, however, not with fugues and dreams of justice but on a prosaic note: the need to increase their household income. In the fall of 1985, Richard was playing under Zubin Mehta, who was then maestro of the Philharmonic. Two years earlier, Fiona, a fine-boned woman with quick, nimble hands, had failed an audition for a full-time position in the orchestra, but was asked to freelance (Fiona declined to comment on the case, deferring to her husband in this matter). A part-time schedule fit with her desire to stay at home with their young son, Michael. <p>One day, Richard recalls, he and Fiona sat down in the living room of their apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side to talk about finances. "I was really in deep straits for money [because of a previous divorce], so I was eager for her to get a job," Simon says. He pressured Fiona again to apply for a vacated position at the Philharmonic. This time she made it and was told to be onstage at Lincoln Center that September.<p>Elated, Richard decided to buy his wife a gift__a new violin bow__and soon came across two largely unused Tourte bows. Neither Richard nor Fiona could resist the Tourte's design features__the special curve of the bow and the flexible qualities of the bow's Pernambuco wood, stripped from Brazilian trees. "It was as if you'd been driving a Volkswagen all your life, then got to drive a Maserati," Richard says. "We weren't going to let them go."<p>Richard bought Fiona the more expensive bow, and a month later bought the less expensive one for himself, financing the $56,500 bill with a loan from the Philharmonic's revolving instrument fund and a line of credit from their musicians union. In September 1985, with her superb new bow in hand, Fiona joined her husband in the first-violin section of the Philharmonic, where Richard had been playing since 1965. Fiona signed on for a $42,000 base salary. Richard's salary was $44,000, supplemented by $4,000 in teaching fees.<p>Soon after, the couple consulted their tax adviser, Milton Sherman, to see if they could take a tax break on their bows. At the time, taxpayers could fully depreciate business assets as "recovery property" under the Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. To deduct depreciation for an instrument before 1981, a musician had to calculate how much the instrument would decrease in value__essentially figuring how long the instrument could be used to generate income, a term tax pros call "useful life." In 1981, Congress abolished these complex calculations and set up depreciation time periods for various types of property. <p>Under both tax regimes, however, the IRS frowned on depreciating antique instruments__mostly violins__that increase in value as collectibles. But that didn't seem to worry Sherman, a blas human tax encyclopedia. Although the bows were likely to increase in value as collectors' items, he told the Simons to depreciate them as tools of their trade over a five-year period. <p>During the next four years, the Simons could not be parted with their Tourte bows. In 1989, Mehta loaded the orchestra's repertoire with Mahler, Beethoven, and Mozart symphonies. That same year, the Simons depreciated their two bows by a total of $10,815__for a tax savings of roughly $3,000.<p>Although the Simons were no strangers to the IRS__the agency had audited their 1985 and 1986 returns for business expenses and found nothing wrong (the depreciation write-offs were not questioned)__Richard was still unprepared for the shock he received when he arrived home after rehearsal on a December day in 1990 and discovered an IRS envelope in the mailbox. He tore it open and gasped__there was a notice saying that the couple owed $39,000 on their 1989 return. The IRS had gone ahead and disallowed all their deductions, including the write-off for the bows, because the Simons had never responded to an earlier audit notice. Richard says they never received it. <p>Richard faxed the notice to Sherman's office in midtown Manhattan, and Sherman quickly arranged a meeting with the IRS.<p>One gray, dismal morning in January 1991, Simon and Sherman met with Fay Vulcan, an IRS appeals officer, in a tiny conference room at the agency's Manhattan headquarters on Church Street. (Vulcan declined to comment.) The IRS maintained a hard line at the appeals meeting. Fully exercising her authority to sanction or deny write-offs, Vulcan axed the Simons' travel deductions, reportedly remarking, "You don't need to take cabs, you can take the bus." Next she torpedoed 75 percent of the couple's business entertainment write-offs. According to Richard Simon and Sherman, she said, "People take you out and you take them out, it's a fair trade." At a second meeting in April, which lasted five hours, Vulcan handed Simon a bill for $8,000. But she said she still wasn't finished. "She was hung up on the depreciation," says Simon.<p>Vulcan sent them on their way and reportedly went to the Lincoln Center library to look up "Tourte" in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, which says that the Tourte is regarded as the Stradivarius of bows because of its "extraordinary beauty and superb playing qualities." According to the IRS, Stradivarius violins couldn't be depreciated because they increase in value as collector's items.<p>At the beginning of the Philharmonic season, on September 15, 1991, Sherman called Richard. "I have a little present for you," he said jokingly. Vulcan had refused the depreciation. The Simons owed the IRS $11,000.<p>Richard Simon wasn't having any of it. He ordered Sherman not only to get the bill down to zero but to get his refund back, which amounted to a couple thousand dollars. Sherman did get Vulcan to zap everything except the $3,000 write-off. But Simon still wouldn't back down. "I deserved the write-off, and so does every other musician," he says. The IRS refused to budge. <p>DECK**
Each year, the IRS sends out roughly 40 million notices, demanding more money or ordering taxpayers to attend an audit. Some taxpayers quietly pay up or settle at the agency's appeals division. But a few intrepid souls refuse to pay. When this happens, they can either take the matter to U.S. tax court (where penalties and interest pile up until the case is resolved), or pay the tax and file a refund suit in either U.S. claims court or U.S. district court. The Simons decided to go to tax court, where their case would join 32,491 others. "Our backs were to the wall," says Richard. First, though, he wanted to find out whether other musicians had depreciation problems with the IRS. <p>Early in 1992, Richard mailed an informal survey to roughly 1,500 string musicians in major U.S. orchestras. After looking at about 1,200 replies, Simon discovered that 25 percent of the respondents had been audited by the IRS; of those, about 40 percent had been audited on their depreciation write-offs. Tax experts say that such a large number is not unusual. "The IRS thinks the entertainment industry is a fertile audit ground," says Andrew Blackman, a New York City certified public accountant. <p>Knowing their case could benefit musicians nationwide__and needing some financial help__Richard and Fiona arranged to have about $11,000 in donations collected by Local 802 of their musicians union and the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians. They hired New York tax lawyer Arthur Pelikow, who, besides having worked as an attorney for the IRS, had made a mark representing musicians in the Metropolitan Opera orchestra before the tax court. <p>In December 1993, about three and a half years after filing their disputed return, the Simons finally arrived at the hearing room in the U.S. courthouse. At roughly 10:40 a.m., Judge David Laro swept in. Although Pelikow knew little about Laro before the case, it quickly became clear to him, he says, that Laro "was very knowledgeable, very businesslike and...good. He was an activist judge who frequently directed his questions to those testifying." Pelikow stepped up to the lectern first. He argued that the Simons rightfully deducted depreciation for their Tourte bows because they needed them to keep their jobs. "The Tourte bows, which are used by Petitioners [the Simons] on an almost continuous basis, produce the superior tonal quality which meets the demand and expectation of the music director, presently Kurt Masur, and the listening audience," he told the court.<p>IRS attorney Kevin Kilduff spoke on the government's behalf. He argued that the Simons must establish a determinable useful life for the bows, despite the fact that the law had changed: "The Petitioners [the Simons] argue that the useful-life requirement was abolished by ACRS [Accelerated Cost Recovery System]. Respondent [the IRS] disagrees with this position. It is our position that a useful life must still be established by Petitioners." <p>Pelikow then introduced the Simons' case. "I wanted to put them on the stand to get the point across that these bows were working tools, not works of art," he explains. "Calling the Simons as witnesses would engender sympathy, too."
It turned out to be an excellent strategy. Fiona demonstrated the various bows, then she and Richard took the stand for their final courtroom performance. "This is an excerpt of the last movement of the Bach Double Concerto, and I'm using the earlier of the Tourte bows," Richard told the court. After the last notes of the concerto echoed through the room, the judge responded. "That was superb," he said.<p>The IRS was not about to give up, however. Attorney Pamela Cohen assailed the write-off, using two lines of attack. First, she argued that bows do not suffer wear and tear. Furthermore, because works of art, including violin bows, have indeterminable useful lives as collectibles, they cannot be depreciated. 
But violin bows do deteriorate, Simon told the court. They get knocked against music stands and become warped when clutched in sweaty hands: "The air-conditioning system of [Avery Fisher Hall] is one of the most atrocious...you could imagine," said Simon. With frequent use, Simon said, a violin bow will eventually become "played out"__that is, lose the ability to vibrate properly. He held up a page of color pictures from a book by Etienne Vatelot, who is considered by many the world's authority on bows. The pictures showed "what can happen to a bow if you abuse it and you don't take extreme precautions," Simon explained. 
Cohen then blundered. "Present day, do your Franois Tourte bows look the same as that photograph?" she asked. Richard replied, "You mean do they look absolutely identical to that? No. But they look partly like that, of course, because they suffer wear." <p>That afternoon, the government began its case, calling Wiley Grant, the IRS's fine-arts appraiser, to establish that the Simons could make a profit by selling their bows as antiques. Grant, a 21-year IRS veteran who testifies in hundreds of IRS cases each year, ticked off his qualifications__he has a degree in English literature from George Washington University and has taken some basic real-estate-appraisal courses. <p>Under Pelikow's questioning, Grant admitted that his only experience in valuing musical instruments came from evaluating charitable contributions and inherited property in estate settlements. Moreover, he said that he was only slightly familiar with the depreciation rules the Simons had used to write off their bows. Later, in response to questions from Laro, Grant also conceded that the value of the violin bows was limited to their use as tools of a musician's trade, thereby refuting the IRS's position that the bows had no determinable useful life. Says Pelikow, "After the Grant testimony, I felt that the case began to move in our favor."<p>The judge then confirmed Pelikow's optimism, concluding the hearing with a quote: "As early as 42 b.c., it was said by Publius Syrus that the bow too tensely strung is easily broken, and it's not unnatural, therefore, to find that these bows are subject to wear and tear."<p>Outside the hearing room, Pelikow and the Simons chatted with the opposition. Richard says one member turned to him and said, "I want you to know I had dinner with my mother in New Jersey last night, and she said, 'Listen, we've been subscribers to the Philharmonic for 15 years.... Go easy on him.'" Another IRS lawyer said that her father had admonished her, too, saying, "Don't you dare hurt these guys."<p>The case was sent for review to the 16 other tax-court judges, a routine procedure in U.S. tax court for decisions of major importance. 
Roughly eight months later, while the Simons were touring in England__ playing Beethoven's Leonore Overture no. 3 and Barber's Second Essay for Orchestra__10 out of the 17 tax-court judges ruled in their favor. The judges agreed that determinable useful life was not a sine qua non for depreciation. Moreover, they ruled, since Congress eliminated the determinable-useful-life requirement in 1981, it left as the sole criterion for depreciation substantial wear and tear. The court concluded that the Simons' bows were not works of art but tools of their trade subject to wear and tear.<p>Neither the case nor the IRS's interest in it stopped with that court. On December 23, 1994, the agency appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York. IRS watchers throughout the country understood that the Simons had a major battle on their hands. "We all knew there was a decision from the top at the IRS, that the agency would not let this issue stand any longer," says tax expert (and French-horn player) Dan Braden. For the appeal, the Simons hired former U.S. district-court judge Marvin Frankel as lead attorney, with Pelikow acting as counsel.<p>In June of 1995, a panel of three appellate judges heard the case. "Our strategy was to reiterate that the tax-court decision was correct," says Frankel. "We emphasized that the question was not whether the depreciation statute as Congress rewrote it was a wise statute, but whether Simon was entitled to the deduction as the law was written." Assistant attorney general Loretta Argrett and Justice Department attorneys Gary Allen, Richard Farber, and Edward Perelmuter stuck to the tack used by the IRS in tax court. However, when the government attorneys started referring to IRS regulations that predated the changes Congress made in 1981, Frankel says, the judges threw out their arguments.<p>As the case made its way through the appeals court, Richard and Fiona continued their high-profile careers. Then, in July at Avery Fisher Hall, while playing The Gypsy Baron, a Johann Strauss operetta, Richard began hemorrhaging out of his mouth, forcing him to leave the stage. Since then, he has undergone surgery for thyroid cancer, and he has stopped playing with the Philharmonic.<p>On September 8, the Simons received good news: The federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled in favor of Brian P. Liddle, a Philadelphia musician who had claimed a 1987 tax deduction of $3,170 for his 17th-century Ruggeri bass viol, which he had bought for $28,000 and depreciated on the grounds of wear and tear. (Interestingly, this case had nearly the same cast of characters__Grant testified as an expert witness, and Laro wrote the decision.)<p>A month later, on October 3, the appellate court rendered its judgment. The federal appeals panel agreed that the Simons were entitled to a tax deduction for depreciation of their antique violin bows, in much the same way as companies depreciate the cost of factories and equipment. <p>The government has decided not to appeal the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court, says Wilson Fadely, an IRS spokesman. But that doesn't mean the IRS can't eventually have its way. "There are various options we can consider," Fadely says, showing why the agency is a law unto itself. "We can write a revenue ruling that says we'll follow the appeals-court ruling only in the New York circuit but not in other circuits. We can continue to litigate a different but similar case in other circuits. Or we can ask Treasury for a legislative remedy, too." <p>The case rests now in the Philharmonic's archives, along with programs, scores, and recordings of the great maestros__Leonard Bernstein, Arturo Toscanini, and Bruno Walter. But as much as the Simons' case is now a footnote in musical history, it has devastated their finances. After paying $15,000 and collecting $11,000 in donations, the Simons still owe more than $42,000 in legal bills. Says Richard: "I'm now considering taking out a loan to pay off this case. Or I may have to sell our Tourte bows."<p>Additional reporting contributed by Maxwell Dale.<p>
IF YOU HANG IT ON A WALL, IT'S ART<p>Richard and Fiona Simons' appellate victory worried at least one participant: Appeals Court Judge James Oakes. In his dissent he wrote that taxpayers could start playing fast and loose with depreciation deductions. "A car buff in the trade or business of buying, collecting and selling antique automobiles, who drives his autos to auto shows, may obtain a depreciation deduction, or the law office that buys fine Sheraton or Chippendale desks or chairs for office use can take a deduction, though in each case the auto or furniture is actually appreciating in value and has no determinable useful life."<p>But the majority opinion signed by the two other judges acknowledged Oakes's problems and also dashed the hopes of some art buyers: "Paintings that hang on the wall of a law firm merely to be looked at__to please connoisseur clients or to give the appearance of dignity to combative professionals__do not generally suffer wear or tear." <p>The judges noted that some latitude in interpretation may result from the ruling but wrote that that was the price Congress was willing to pay to simplify depreciation rules. Congress did so, they said, "to stimulate investment in business property generally." That comes with a caveat, Judge Ralph Winter warned:"One should not exaggerate the extent to which our holding is a license to...depreciate valuable property that a taxpayer expects to appreciate in real economic value."<p>So what's deductible? Says Marvin Frankel, the Simons' appeals-court attorney: "Under the statute, whether you like it or not, there are two main requirements to depreciate something: First, is it used in the trade or business? And secondly, is it subject to wear and tear? The contrast is with a work of art that you could hang on the wall of your office, which in a sense is using it for a trade or business, but it's not subject to wear and tear. So if you took a Stradivarius and hung it on a wall, you couldn't depreciate it."<p><p>

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>IS YOUR CPA A SNITCH?
Tax secrets aren't always safe with an accountant.<p>By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>Nothing is more intimate than a tax return, and taxpayers trust no one with the details of their financial lives like they do their tax accountant. Right now, millions of taxpayers are confessing their every boneheaded financial move, their every fudge and cut corner, to their tax pros, expecting them to maneuver their returns through the system while keeping mum about what they know.<p>But anyone considering crossing the line from corner cutting to out-and-out criminality should think again. Unlike communications with lawyers, communications with tax accountants are not recognized as privileged under federal law. <p>Nervous now? You should be, because bestriding this situation like a green-eyeshade-wearing colossus is the Internal Revenue Service. The IRScan subpoena an accountant to turn over every receipt, every canceled check, and notes from every conversation from a client's file. "When CPAs are subpoenaed by the IRS, there are no confidences," says David Doran, associate professor of accounting at Penn State University at Erie. "They are obligated by law to testify against their clients." <p>Here's another surprise: Accountants don't necessarily know the rules. In a study Doran conducted in 1992, 18 percent of the accountants surveyed incorrectly said that information shared between a CPAand a client is privileged.<p>If all that isn't disheartening enough, consider this: According to the book Lost Rights, by James Bovard, the IRS admitted in 1989 that it was using 900 controlled informants (that is, double agents), 40 of whom were accountants. The use of double agents continues today.<p>Fortunately, there's a little good news here. CPAs boast of a proud tradition that doesn't includeturning tattletale, and they do resist the IRS when they can. "Rather than being privileged, like lawyer-client talks are privileged, CPAs' contacts with clients are confidential," says Herb Finkston, director of the professional-ethics division at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. "For a CPA to respond to a subpoena, it has to be validly issued and enforceable. If the CPA believes the subpoena is a fishing expedition, such as an IRS request to hand over every piece of paper the taxpayer accumulated in the past five years, the accountant can get the subpoena quashed in court." What's more, a significant minority of states recognize client-CPA conversations as privileged__which could protect those involved in local tax disputes.<p>The IRS maintains no data on how often it subpoenas accountants' files, but taxpayers need worry only if they fear their fudging has turned felonious. "This is something that usually only comes up in a criminal investigation," says Carol C. Markman, a CPAin Westbury, New York. <p>"The best thing to do is to not be dishonest from the beginning__that's the government's message," says Doran. "Because if you aren't honest, there's no safe harbor."<p>
FILER BEWARE:THE IRS'S HOT BUTTONS
Every year, the IRS supplies its agents with a list of fire-engine red audit flags tose in scrutinizing returns. Taxpayers should tread carefully in the following areas:<p>*Underreported income The IRS will check to see if there is enough income to support a taxpayer's financial lifestyle as reflected in such items as the mortgage-interest deduction.
*Suspicious gross profit marginThe IRS is particularly interested in small- business owners who report low profit margins and high expenses in excess of gross receipts.
*Inflated business write-offsTaxpayers often deduct unallowable job expenses such as questionable business meals.
*Suspicious child-care credits The IRS will nix this credit__and may impose a $50 penalty__if it sees no Social Security number reported for a nanny.
*Deductions for miscellaneous write-offs on Schedule CTaxpayers can deduct miscellaneous expenses only if they exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income. Some taxpayers wrongly shift these deductions to Schedule C, which is strictly for business profits and losses.
*Failure to pay early-withdrawal penalties on retirement accountsTaxpayers who receive retirement money before age 5912 must turn in a completed Form 5329 along with the 10 percent excise tax.
*Missing self-employment taxTaxpayers often neglect to include this for partnership income or miscellaneous income reported on Form 1099.
*Suspected fake dependentsThe IRS will check reported income to see if the taxpayer earned enough money to support a flock of claimed dependents.
*Hobby losses deducted as business expensesIf a hobby, such as dog breeding, is to be considered a business (and thus have its expenses qualify as deductible), it must turn a profit for three out of five years. If the hobby/business involves horses, it need turn a profit only in two out of seven years.
*Erroneously deducted passive-activity lossesTaxpayers sometimes try to avoid the limitations on passive losses by not reporting whether a loss comes from a passive or active investment.
*Payroll-tax evasion Employers often report employees as independent contractors in order to avoid paying Social Security levies.<p><p>

						January 1996--Special issue <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> HEADS UP, TAXPAYERS! <p>It's time to stop thinking about Congress--they'll get to those cuts eventually--and start thinking about April.  <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald  <p> Don't wait. That's what the experts at Ernst & Young, Price Waterhouse, KPMG Peat Marwick, and tax publisher CCH Inc. are saying about the congressional tax breaks that are apparently eventually coming down the road. The House and Senate's seven-year omnibus budget bill includes numerous tantalizing breaks. GOP conferees recently reached a tentative agreement on a number of changes to the tax code. But President Bill Clinton, Senator Bob Dole, Speaker Newt Gingrich, and other politicians great and small aren't done slugging it out. Dole says the high-level tax harangue will last through December, which means taxpayers may have to sit tight for a while.  <p> Not that that's anything new. As a practical matter, "tax planning" is an oxymoron, given that the tax code has changed just about every year since1980. That's why, according to the best minds in the field, the smartest plan is to adopt a long-term strategy and update it as changes come down the pike from D.C. Here are the experts' best ideas all of them useful right now on how to lower income taxes.  <p> BULLETPROOF INCOME. Many mutual fund investors over pay their capital-gains tax when they sell shares. Generally, equity funds report distributions in December, and investors pay tax the next April on those distributions. The problem is that when investors sell, they often forget to increase their cost basis by the amount of the distributions. For example, suppose you put $1,000 into an equity fund in 1992, and in each of the following three years, you get a $50 distribution. When you cash out of the fund, you should report a basis of $1,150, not $1,000.   <p> Stock investors tend to make a related mistake: They fail to double-check the accuracy of their 1099s, which report dividend income, and to look for any distribution that's a partial return of capital. The distribution isn't taxable, but taxpayers must remember to adjust their records, reducing the basis, or cost, of the investment by the amount of capital distributed. (And don't forget to include the commission paid for purchasing stock when figuring a gain or loss.) Also, government sources say IRS computers in five of ten service centers are now misreading 1099s. So if you get a notice saying you misreported interest and dividends, don't assume the IRS is right.  <p> Upper-income investors should compare the yields on tax-exempt and taxable bonds to get a higher tax-free return. To figure out a comparable yield on a taxable bond, divide a municipal bond's yield by 1 minus your tax bracket, then multiply that number by 100. So an investor in the 28 percent bracket who owns a municipal bond yielding 5 percent would need an equivalent taxable yield of 6.94 percent (5 percent divided by 0.72 times100). Investors in the 39.6 percent bracket would need an 8.28 percent yield to equal the tax-free 5 percent.  <p> Parents should consider transferring assets that generate ordinary income, such as dividends and interest, to dependent children to take advantage of their lower tax bracket. Parents in the39.6 percent tax bracket who shift $10,000 in investment income to a child in the 15 percent bracket (as most children are) will save $2,460 in taxes (the parents' tax of $3,960 minus the child's tax of $1,500). Caution, though: "Children will then have control of that money, so parents can't prevent them from spending it," says Jim Shambo, a tax expert in Colorado Springs, Colorado.If the dependent child is under 14, parents can take advantage of the so-called kiddie tax, which exempts a child's first $650 of unearned income.   <p> Retirees should take note of Congress's recent rejection of a proposal that would have allowed senior citizens to earn more income without losing Social Security benefits. The law still taxes up to 85 percent of Social Security benefits received when what's called "provisional" income (tax-exempt income plus half of Social Security benefits plus adjusted gross income) surpasses $44,000 for joint filers and $34,000 for single filers (who are then taxed at their marginal tax bracket). Retirees who face this scenario should realize income carefully, says Nadine Gordon Lee, a tax expert at Ernst & Young. Senior citizens can also shift some of their investments from income-producing assets to assets that favor capital appreciation.  <p> While it may seem that the government has found a way to dun everything in sight, not all income is taxable. It's worth any taxpayer's while to review the list of nontaxable sources of income in J.K. Lasser's Your Income Tax 1996.  <p> Finally, a quick but important exception to the recommendation against trying to anticipate coming tax changes: Do plan for a capital-gains rate cut, which experts say will be effective January 1, 1996. If possible, avoid selling assets you've held for more than a year until after the first. It could save you a lot.  <p> SCROUNGE FOR DEDUCTIONS. Rare is the write-off in an increasingly stingy tax land. For example, taxpayers can deduct medical expenses only for the part that tops a stiff 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. Miscellaneous expenses, too, get stuck under a 2 percent floor. But did you know you can get a write-off for hair-transplant operations? Strange but true. To jump that 7.5 percent hurdle, taxpayers can deduct as medical expenses the cost of removing lead-based paint from a home, contact lenses, birth control pills, teeth straightening (including clarinet lessons advised by adentist), doctor-prescribed visits to a health spa, metabolism tests, sacroiliac belts, and air conditioners necessary for relieving an allergy or difficulty in breathing. For a full list, consult the Lasser guidebook. Taxpayers should also count payments made on behalf of their children, parents, and other dependents for whom they provide more than half of the total support (more than10 percent if the parents qualify under a multiple-support agreement). Also, self-employed taxpayers can now write off 30 percent of the cost of their health-insurance premiums, up from 25 percent in 1994.  <p> Besides write-offs for things like mortgage interest, investment deductions abound, too. They include set up charges and annual custodial fees for IRA and Keogh accounts (the fees must be paid separately); safe deposit box fees, so long as the box is used for share certificates and similar items; investment books, newspapers, and magazines (including this one); fees for investment counseling; tax-planning fees; postage and telephone costs related to investing; and part of the cost of a personal computer used to manage investments. On that last one, strict rules apply the IRS will let you take this write-off only if the computer is used 50 percent or more of the time for investing.   <p> Even though a total of 38.4 million taxpayers took a record 220 million business trips during 1994, according to Official Airline Guides, the tax law restricts most business travel and entertainment write-offs. But there is still some relief available. Taxpayers who lease their cars can deduct the part of the lease payment that is for the use of the car for business or work. Normal operating costs and maintenance may also be deducted (specialrules apply, though, so check with a tax pro). Taxpayers can deduct travel expenses for attending conventions or similar meetings in connection with a trade or business, but they can't write off those costs if they went to increase their investment income. Also, beginning last October 1, the IRS increased the threshold at which receipts are required for deductions for business travel, gift, and entertainment expenses from $25 to $75.  <p> Taxpayers can reap a double tax advantage by donating appreciated property to a charity. They get a hefty deduction for the full, appreciated value of the asset, and they avoid the capital-gains tax they would have paid if they had sold the property. Say a taxpayer in the 39.6 percent bracket wants to donate a $10,000 stock, bought for $5,000, to a charity. By donating it outright rather than selling it and donating the proceeds, the taxpayer will save $3,960 in federal taxes and avoid $1,400 in capital-gains tax. Remember, the IRS says a charity must give you a receipt for any contribution over $250.  <p> If an asset tanks, taxpayers should probably sell it first, then donate the proceeds. That way, they'll generate both a charitable deduction and a deductible capital loss against any capital gains and up to $3,000 in ordinary income. This is one move taxpayers may want to make soon. Congress now wants to reinstate a rule, in effect before the 1986 tax reform act, that says an individual must have two dollars in long-term capital losses to offset one dollar of ordinary income. So taxpayers would need $6,000 in net long-term losses realized after January 1, 1996, to get the maximum $3,000 deduction against ordinary income.  <p> And finally, don't forget that interest on up to $100,000 in home-equity loans is still tax deductible. "Taxpayers should consolidate their debt with one and get a 35 to 40 percent subsidy from the government," says Nadine Gordon Lee.  <p> WATCH OUT FOR THE DREADED AMT. With any of these moves, taxpayers should avoid triggering the alternative minimum tax, a specialrate that snares taxpayers who have lots of itemized deductions and untaxed income. Basically, the AMT is there to make sure everybody pays his or her fair share. Taxpayers typically trigger the AMT if they have started up a new business or if they own large tax-sheltered investments. Those stung by the AMT will pay either the higher of their AMT, which can be as much as 28 percent, or their regular rate.  <p> SIGN UP FOR COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS NOW. Not everyone is taking advantage of flexible spending accounts, which are now available at close to 70 percent of all companies. This is just plain foolish. These plans let taxpayers set aside a percentage of their pretax money each pay period for dependent-care expenses or medical costs not covered by insurance, typically up to a maximum of $5,000 for each plan. By using pretax dollars, taxpayers effectively shave the cost of their unreimbursed expenses by 40 percent or more (they can pare down their Social Security taxes, too). In1994, however, only 20 percent of eligible employees contributed an average of $707 to a health care FSA, and just 4 percent of eligible employees contributed an average of $2,979 to a dependent-care FSA, according to Hewitt & Associates, a benefits-consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Illinois. Taxpayers can use pretax dollars to pay for insurance deductibles and co-payments, medical supplies, and even contact lenses. Child-care plans can cover the cost of after-school care and camp for children up to age 12. The beauty of these plans is that at any point in the year you can spend more than you've put into your FSA (though not more than you're scheduled to contribute by year's end). As a matter of fact, if you leave your job before your contributions catch up with your spending, the company must pick up the bill, says IRS spokeswoman Jody Patterson. Careful, though: The IRS will grab any portion left unspent in the account at year-end.  <p> If there's one thing worse than not taking advantage of FSA plans, it's not making the most of a 401(k) plan. More than 80 percent of all companies will match contributions, usually one dollar for every two dollars taxpayers set aside out of pretax earnings. Some employers allow contributions of as much as 20 percent of pretax income, to a maximum of $9,240 in 1995. Again, despite such hefty benefits, workers are putting away just 5 percent in these plans, down from 6 percent in 1994, according to a recent survey by KPMG Peat Marwick.  <p> FATTEN UP OTHER RETIREMENT PLANS. Taxpayers still seem to prefer not to know how much money they'll need in retirement. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 60 percent of 1,000 workers polled recently said they put aside some of their money for retirement, but only 35 percent of those with retirement savings said they have tried to determine how much they will need to save.  <p> You have until April 15, 1996, (later if you get an extension) to get a 1995 deduction for an IRA worth as much as $2,000 (up to $2,250 for a spousal or joint IRA). The earlier the contribution, the better. For example, say two taxpayers each invest $2,000 annually in an account yielding 8 percent. The first taxpayer invests each year on January 2, while the second does so on April15 of the following year. After ten years, the first taxpayer will have $33,794 in the account, while the second will have just $30,498.   <p> Self-employed taxpayers have until the last day of the year to open a Keogh plan and until April 15 to open a simplified employee pension plan. Taxpayers can put away as much as 13.043 percent of their self-employment income into these plans, up to $19,564, even if they're already covered by a 401(k) or other employer-provided retirement plan at a separate company. Contributions are tax deductible.   <p> Depending on their income, some taxpayers can't fully fund their 401(k) plans. The law puts a $150,000 limit on the amount of compensation that can be considered when calculating contributions to qualified 401(k) and pension plans. Since maximum 401(k) plan contributions are determined by complicated formulas that balance the contributions of high-income workers at a company with those of lower-income employees, the new ceiling may also slam those earning as little as $66,000, says Howard Edelstein, a principal at the Cleveland office of the Todd Organization, a retirement consulting firm. To make up for this shortfall, companies have increasingly offered nonqualified plans (plans that don't qualify for tax-deferred status) to even midlevel executives. In a recent ruling, the IRS approved a nonqualified plan that lets employees defer part of their salary into a nonqualified plan first. After the end of the year, when the maximum amount of permitted 401(k) contributions is known, the deferral amounts and matching employer contributions (without earnings) are then transferred into the qualified 401(k) plan. <p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Experts  <p> TAX REFORM UNPLUGGED  <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald  <p> It's a political fact of life that partisan clamor over tax-law changes always drowns out the truth, and that's certainly true of the current tax-reform debates now gripping Washington. Congressmen Dick Armey and Richard Gephardt have each introduced plans to overhaul the income-tax system. Senators Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici share authorship of another plan, which they've given a patriotic name. And because America's general hatred of the income tax makes for good campaign fodder, Republican presidential hopefuls Richard Lugar and Arlen Specter are working up tax-reform positions. All this has pressed Bill Clinton into considering his own proposal. <p> None of this should be surprising. Would-be tax reformers rightly complain that the current income tax is riddled with $500 billion worth of loopholes that permit some millionaires to pay no income taxes whatsoever. Cheats rip off the government by roughly $127 billion each year, while honest taxpayers spend more than $100 billion a year to figure out what they owe. Ben Franklin was right when he said the two things that are certain in life are death and taxes, but another wag captured the true mess: The major difference between death and taxes is that Congress can't make death any worse than it is.   <p> Various tax-reform proposals have been floating around Washington for a number of years. The two most widely discussed proposals lately are House Republican leader Armey's flat-tax plan and Nunn and Domenici's Unlimited Savings Allowance plan, a consumption tax they'd like you to remember as the USA Tax.  <p> Most Americans don't know a lot about either of these plans  except that one of them has to be better than what we have now. But is that even true? The current debate draws more on emotion and intuition than on empirical evidence about how either proposal would actually affect taxpayers. Let's try some of the latter. It can't do much harm to inject facts into the Great Tax Reform Debate.  <p> The flat tax. Politicians of all stripes have spent time on the flat-tax wagon, from 1992 liberal presidential candidate Jerry Brown to White House chief of staff Leon Panetta to, lately, Dick Armey. Armey's flat-tax plan is based on one introduced in 1981 by Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, senior fellows at the Hoover Institute, a conservative think tank.  <p> All flat-tax champions say the same thing: that although the name suggests otherwise, a flat tax is progressive that is, its tax bite moves higher with income, because flat-tax proposals first give each taxpayer a fat personal exemption and then tax all income above that amount at the flat rate. And they do mean all income: Armey proposes to eliminate virtually all the deductions, exemptions, and credits that help make the current system so convoluted.  <p> Armey proposes a tax rate of 20 percent, dropping to 17 percent in the second year of implementation. The standard deductions, which Armey dubs "family allowances," are $13,000 for singles and $26,200 for married couples, with dependents worth $5,300 each. These deduction figures would rise with the cost of living.  <p> Armey says his plan is fair because its effective rates move higher with income. A family of four with a wage income of $50,000 would pay an effective tax of 5.7 percent; one earning $100,000, nearly 11.3 percent; and one pulling in $200,000, 14.2 percent.  <p> And yet the tax bite rises for taxpayers at middle and lower income levels, largely because of the lost deductions, exemptions, and credits and the taxation of fringe benefits (more on that below). Roughly $843 billion in deductions would vanish under Armey's plan, including $51 billion in mortgage-interest deductions. A recent Treasury Department study concluded that under the flat tax, families with incomes under $200,000 would see their after-tax incomes drop by 3 percent or more. Families with incomes of $200,000 or more would see their after-tax incomes rise 8 percent.  <p> There's more good news for the well-off. Under Armey's plan, investment income would not be taxed. If you made your money at a job, you'd pay 17 percent on it. If you lived off investment income or inheritances, you wouldn't owe a cent. "It is an obvious mathematical law that lower taxes on the successful will have to be made up by higher taxes on average people," Hall and Rabushka state in a report for the journal Tax Notes. "Tax reform will be a tremendous boon to the economic elite from the start." <p> One thing you have to appreciate about the various tax-reform plans is that they're going to get people thinking about the social agendas tax policies promote and the way tax policies are priced into economic transactions. The mortgage-interest deduction, introduced with the first income tax in 1913, was designed to open up home ownership to more people. By this point, flat-taxers argue, it's merely propping up prices. Take away the prop, they say, and prices will be reestablished at truer levels after a period of adjustment.  <p> There would be winners and losers, though, during the adjustment. A flat tax would be good news for first-time buyers, who typically finance three quarters or more of the price of a house. That's because the flat tax wouldn't touch a lender's interest income from loans, so mortgage rates could be expected to fall by a point or two. And homes would be about 15 percent cheaper, according to a recent study by DRI/McGraw Hill. Of course, this is going to distress the people who bought homes under the old rules. <p> Employees who enjoy hefty company-provided fringe benefits, from medical coverage to fitness counseling, would lose big under Armey's proposal, because businesses would no longer be able to deduct benefits and could be counted on to be stingier about offering them. Worse, employees would pay the flat tax on the value of the benefits, which in 1993 equaled 18 percent of total compensation. Again, Hall and Rabushka see things sorting themselves out after a bit, with employers offering workers "higher pay in exchange for lower fringes." You might find it difficult to support that kind of optimism in today's business environment.  <p> More losers: Divorced spouses would not be allowed to deduct alimony payments under a flat tax, which could affect some people's ability and willingness to live by the terms of their divorce decrees. And no longer would the blind and the elderly get extra exemptions of $950, because, Hall and Rabushka say, "Many of the elderly and a few of the blind are well-off." Armey's plan also axes the child-care credit, though Rabushka and Hall happily predict that "more people will join the labor force or work longer hours, especially two-earner households." (Ponder that in terms of family values.) Strangely, the only write-off to survive under Armey's flat-tax plan would be a 100 percent deduction for business meals.  <p> Labor-intensive companies in the service sector would be flattened by Armey's tax, since it wipes out the deduction of half the Social Security tax. This would clobber the self-employed, who pay all their Social Security taxes themselves. The manufacturing industry would win big, thanks to extensive write-offs of capital equipment.  <p> Is this, in sum, a plan that's likely to go down easily with taxpayers? Perhaps not. Armey and Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama couldn't have been overwhelmed by the results of their own recent poll of 800 homeowners: Just 38 percent said they supported the flat tax.  <p> The USA tax. How do you like the sound of "Schedule S"? If Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici's consumption-tax plan goes through, Schedule S will be a big part of every taxpayer's life. The goal of Nunn and Domenici's USA plan is to encourage savings. Anything you save or otherwise invest, you defer taxes on. Anything you spend  including your own savings you are considered to have consumed, and you pay now. Schedule S is for tracking it all.  <p> Here's a basic example: Joe Smith earns $100,000 in 1998. He puts $20,000 into the stock market. So his taxable income is $80,000. The next year, Joe Smith earns $100,000, but he doesn't invest a thing. In fact, he takes $10,000 out of the stock market. His taxable income is $110,000.  <p> The USA plan employs a progressive tax-rate scale. Married couples filing jointly would pay 19 percent on amounts up to $5,399,27 percent up to $23,999, and 40 percent on up. Nunn and Domenici expect to be able to lower rates a few years down the road. <p> This plan would shake things up less dramatically than the flat tax would. Nunn and Domenici continue to extend favorable treatment to IRAs, pensions, owner-occupied housing (the mortgage-interest deduction wouldn't be touched), and tax-exempt debt such as municipal bonds.   <p> Baby boomers, though, would find things changed in important ways. Boomers are getting the lion's share of the blame for the worrying decline in the national savings rate, from 7.1 percent of gross domestic product in the 1970s to 3.8 percent today. They're thought to be selfishly spending all the money they should be investing and thereby making available to the capital markets. <p> There's a problem with this. Studies show that senior citizens are actually doing the spending. Seniors typically spend a truckload of money, much of it from Social Security and Medicare, on housing costs, leisure activities, and medical expenses. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office says the decline in the savings rate is attributable directly to the elderly who rely on entitlements. Economist Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University has studied the national savings decline and concludes: "Today's 70-year-olds are consuming, on average, roughly one fifth more than 30-year-olds."  <p> Nevertheless, the idea here is to control the spending of boomers,and that means controlling their borrowing. The USA plan discourages borrowing by counting it, except for the first $35,000, against any savings credit. If, for example, in the year Joe Smith saved $20,000 he also borrowed $50,000 to buy something other than a house, his Schedule S would show a savings credit of just $5,000. <p> But Lee Sheppard, a columnist for Tax Notes, has discovered a gigantic loophole for debt-happy boomers. It still allows consumers to write off interest on $1 million in mortgage debt. The inevitable result, Sheppard believes, would be high-income earners succumbing to an urge to run out and refinance. This is something they do now: They buoy their consumption levels by refinancing their mortgages.  <p> The big winners under this plan, then, are taxpayers wealthy enough and smart enough to exploit the rules on financing savings accounts with debt. The losers are middle- to lower-income families who can't afford to set aside money.  <p> If your first impression is that Schedule S doesn't sound like the keystone to a simpler tax system, you're right. The USA Tax would be of staggering complexity. Taxpayers would have to keep a running record of any nondeductible and debt-financed savings. It's also worth asking whether it would in fact improve saving.William Gale, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank, says his research shows the USA plan would increase the national savings rate by only 10 percent.  <p> what, then? Neither the flat tax nor the USA tax (nor any other proposal out there) would fix the real problems with the currentincome tax namely, the underground economy, the low savings rate, and the quantity of rich people who don't pay. That's one reason Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin says the Clinton administration has looked at all the reform plans and found "none of these are clearly better than where we are today." Clinton wants to simplify, not overhaul, the tax code. Plenty of people can show him good places to start.  <p> One argument alone is enough to support preservation of the current income-tax system: Experts widely agree that the transition to any new tax system would be an expensive, messy nightmare. Most of the problems with the income tax are administrative, largely because the current system has transmogrified into anenormous social experiment. Today, tax law is used to support everything from housing policy to R&D of better ketchup bottles. <p> In the end, Congress will probably streamline the current system in a way that acknowledges the goals (and influence) of the flat tax and USA proposals. Expect changes that encourage savings and investing, such as raising income levels for IRA deductibility and excluding more capital gains from taxation the longer an asset is held. These are the kinds of changes that are least likely to jolt the economy, and the taxpayers.   <p><p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU <p>So you're thinking about retiring to one of the seven states that don't tax income, like Florida or Nevada, where you can bask in the sun and in the knowledge that your money is safe from the state taxman. Think again.   <p> By Liz Macdonald  <p> In 1974, Howard Smith quit as a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department after 25 years and moved with his wife to the town of Friday Harbor, Washington. Four years later, he retired from the local police force, after his accountant had confirmed with a California Franchise Tax Board official that he would owe no taxes on his monthly LAPD pension.   <p> Then, in December 1988, Smith received a demand from California for 14 years' back taxes on his LAPD pension, plus a 55 percent late penalty and a 12 percent annual interest charge compounded daily. And since California, like 20 other states, used Smith's total income before deductions to calculate his taxes, he moved into a higher tax bracket.   <p> In 1992, the state began seizing $683, or 27 percent, of his $2,553 monthly pension. Smith has lost $18,188 to California and owes another $35,000. Tax officials put a lien against any property he should ever buy in Sacramento County. "They're just squeezing me to death," says Smith. "If I'd known about this, I would never have moved."  <p> Numerous retirees, whether former civil servants or from the private sector, find themselves in the same boat the same thing is happening to an estimated 100,000 retirees in Nevada. Other states, too, have grown more aggressive in pursuing retired former residents, says the Retirement Savings Network in Washington, D.C., a group of employers and organizations battling this tax. For example, former New Yorkers who take a lump sum from their retirement accounts or receive more than $20,000 annually from their plan must pay a nonresident tax (taxpayers who take the money as an annuity aren't liable). New York also claims it is owed taxes on all the earnings growth from these accounts. Thus, a person who opened an IRA while a New Yorker for one year and then lived elsewhere for 29 years would pay New York income taxes on the first year's contribution plus the compounded interest over the 29-year period.  <p> Thirteen states in all carry laws that allow them to collect source taxes on pension income from former residents, though some choose not to, says Sally Adams, a tax analyst with CCH,Inc., a tax publisher in Riverwoods, Illinois (see table). Conceivably, retirees could be taxed on retirement income by every one of these 13 states in which they ever worked. And with many states scrambling to balance their budgets, "source states that have not here to fore taxed the pension income of nonresidents might decide to go after these funds," says Adams.  <p> State officials say pensions are deferred income. "States have the right to tax benefits earned while the person lived and worked in the state," says Harley Duncan, executive director of the Federation of Tax Administrators. However, some argue that pension taxes are levies on intangibles, not wages, and are properly assessed where the money is received. Taxes "should be paid by those who get state services," says William Hoffman, president of RESIST, an anti-source-tax group in Carson City, Nevada.  <p> California actually hires collection agencies to find ex-residents, among them Ellen and Bert Wight, who in 1994 were found in Arizona and dunned $4,799 because they took $6,000 from an IRA to pay Bert's doctor bills (he later died of colon cancer). Part of the tax bill was for an earthquake tax.  <p> With its heavy debt load, California can't afford not to pursue this revenue. If it did, the state would lose more than $1 billion annually, says Gerald Goldberg, a California Franchise Tax Board official.   <p> Pension-source laws are a potential nightmare for employers,too. Some retirees must show how much of their pension is due to each state in which they worked. To do this, employers may ultimately be required to track employees' benefits over their careers. But more than 70 percent of 401(k) plans accept rollovers from other plans, according to the Profit Sharing Council of America's 1994 survey of retirement benefits. If employers are responsible for employees' retirement-account histories, they may bar rollovers.   <p> Some have suggested that states tax only those retirees who move to escape taxes. But this would be virtually impossible to prove. Representative Barbara Vucanovich of tax-free Nevada, who calls source taxes "unjust," has proposed a bill to limit the amount a retiree could shield from these levies to $25,000 a year. In 1993, however, nearly one million Americans received lump-sum retirement distributions larger than $30,000, according to the U.S. Current Population survey. Representative Owen Pickett of Virginia has proposed a bill to eliminate the source tax, but it would exclude state and federal civil servants and members of the armed forces.   <p> Any bill to curtail nonresident taxes faces stiff opposition; states that collect it compose roughly a third of the House of Representatives. And Republicans, champions of states' rights, may refuse to set states' tax policies.  <p> Before taking your pension, know the law of the state where you earned it, and file for tax credits in your present state for any payments you must make. For information, call RESIST at 702-887-1296, or your state's department of taxation. Arizona, Colorado, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, and Washington stop other states from seizing assets of newly arrived retirees, according to CCH. Also, New Jersey and Iowa have repealed their nonresident pension tax in the last decade.  <p>  <p>  <p> STATES THAT CAN  <p>TAX NONRESIDENT PENSIONS  <p>  State IMPOSE TAX?  <p>  Arizona  No <p> California  Yes* <p> Colorado  No  <p> CONNECTICUT YES**  <p> Kansas  Yes <p> Louisiana  Yes***  <p>  Massachusetts Yes**  <p> Minnesota  Yes**    <p> New York  Yes***  <p> NORTH DAKOTA NO   <p> Oregon  Yes* <p> Vermont  Yes**  <p> Wisconsin  Yes**   <p>  * Withholds an income tax on nonresident payouts.  <p> ** Taxes only nonqualified plans.   <p> *** Exempts government plans.  <p> Source: CCH.   <p><p>

						October 1995   <p>Worth  magazine/Advisor  <p> A TAX BREAK WORTH DWELLING ON  <p> By Kenneth R. Harney  <p> Money-wise homeowners are generally well versed in the basic tax write-offs available to them. These include mortgage-interest deductions, local property-tax write-offs, capital-gains treatment of resale profits, and, for those 55 or older, the one-time $125,000 exclusion on gains.  <p> But even the most astute homeowners are often unaware of what could be the biggest tax break of all: the qualified personal residence trust. In 1992, the Internal Revenue Service issued regulations establishing these trusts, which are expected to mushroom as aging baby boomers begin serious estate planning.Those with total estates above the $600,000 federal estate-tax credit threshold particularly families with second homes are good candidates for qualified residence trusts, say tax professionals. <p> "Given the sheer numbers of people who qualify," says David Gerson, tax partner with the accounting firm of Ernst and Young, "I expect [residence trusts] to really take off in popularity. After all, if you can save taxes on your largest asset, why wouldn't you?"  <p> Residence trusts allow you to move your primary or second home or both out of your estate, transferring the current value to designated family members at some predetermined future date, free of gift or estate taxes. That date can be 10 years down the road, 15 years later, or whenever you choose. Once the property is in the trust, its value is frozen for tax purposes, allowing your children to take over the real estate tax free, despite years of appreciation.  <p> Until the transfer date, you continue to live in the property, rent free. You still control it, and you're responsible for it. When the designated date arrives assuming you're still alive ownership shifts to your designees. You can then either move or continue to live in the house indefinitely for a fair-market rent. Alternatively, you can repurchase the property just before the transfer date. The price will be the same as the property valuation when you created the trust, even if the house has since doubled in value. <p> The key to the concept is that you are making a gift but retaining a quantifiable interest in that gift before turning it over.What's left in the property after your term of use what the IRS calls the "remainder interest" will be a fraction of the house's market value and the only part of the gift subject to taxation. All appreciation from the date of the trust escapes gift and estate taxation, provided you don't die before the transfer date specified in the trust.  <p> Consider this example provided by Ameek Ashok Ponda, a tax attorney with the Boston law firm of Sullivan and Worcester. You're 60 years old and own a debt-free $400,000 home. You want to minimize estate taxes, so you put the house into a qualified residence trust with a term of ten years. According to IRS annuity interest and mortality tables, the remainder interest after ten years will be just $172,076. That amount eventually gets charged against your $600,000 estate-tax credit limit but is $227,924 less ($400,000 minus $172,076) than it would have been without the trust.  <p> Your children, meanwhile, stand to take over a piece of real estate that could be worth $500,000 or more after a decade. If they retain it, there is no tax; if they sell, they are liable only for capital-gains taxes on profits in excess of the tax basis in the property at the time it was placed in trust. That's not so bad, considering that the maximum capital-gains rate is currently 28 percent, compared with the much higher rates (upto 55 percent) on estate taxes.  <p> There is no cap on the value of the house that can be contributed to a trust. In fact, because of the generous IRS discount computation rules, the more costly the home and the larger percentage of the estate it represents, the bigger the tax savings.  <p> Only personal residential realty qualifies. If you own an expensive vacation home that you rent out, you must make personal use of it for at least 14 days a year or 10 percent of the total rental days. <p>Most residential trusts specify that the property will revert to the donor's estate if he or she dies before the transfer date. That could expose the property to full estate-tax treatment. So choose a term you feel confident about (Ponda calculates that the ideal term for a 60-year-old male in good health is about14 years).  <p> If, while living in a house after gifting it to the trust, you make capital improvements a new bathroom, say you are adding value to your gift and may face gift-tax liability. So, too, with principal payments on a mortgage. Ponda advises clients to pay off the debt on a home if possible before putting it into a trust to simplify the deal. As with all estate-planning issues, consult your tax advisor before moving ahead.  <p><p>

						September 1995
Worth Magazine/Advisor<p>EXORCISING THE DEMON AUDIT<p>By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>Thirty years ago, the internal Revenue Service audited more than 5 percent of taxpayers. That number has fallen steadily, until today the IRS audit rate is 0.7 percent. As a result, many taxpayers have concluded that they can safely underpay their taxes. The annual revenue lost because of this cheating has risen to $127 billion (including $33 billion owed by corporations) from $60.1 billion in 1981.<p>This October, Big Brother strikes back. For the first time since 1988, the IRS will drag taxpayers--153,000 of them--through its Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program, a super audit in which every line of a return must be documented. <p>The IRS won't just audit returns; it will also introduce its computer-aided examination of taxpayers' personal lives--so-called economic reality and market segment audits--to uncover discrepancies between their returns and "economic lifestyles," as estimated by their "market segment" (an industry, profession, or tax issue--there are about 80 in all). The IRS is particularly curious about the self-employed, who it says evade $35 billion in taxes each year.<p>The agency expects this technique will yield an additional $7 billion or so each year, though House Republicans and tax pros have criticized it as costly and invasive. "The new program could triple the costs of hiring a tax pro for audit preparations," says Claudia Hill, a tax expert at Tax Mam in Cupertino, California. Hill also says her colleagues oppose these audits because regular individuals are being dragged through fraud probes.<p>The super audit will target 33,000 filers of forms 1040A and 1040, 59,000 small businesses, and 61,000 partnerships and corporations. As in other TCMP audits, once selected, taxpayers must answer up to 367 questions and prove every item reported, even the existence of spouses or children. However, this time the IRS will assiduously hunt for economic-reality clues before the audit by tapping the records of the Social Security Administration; banks; divorce, probate, and bankruptcy courts; and insurance agencies. It will also examine employer personnel records, subscriber-information services, and newspaper articles and will interview landlords, employees, employers, ex-spouses, and neighbors.<p>Here's how taxpayers who receive audit notices can prepare:<p>DON'T SHOW. Ignore IRS notices that say "You will be present at the initiation of the audit." Such demands are in violation of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. As with other audits, "it is not mandatory for the taxpayer to be present at a TCMP examination," says IRS spokesman Don Roberts. Instead, hire a tax pro with extensive audit experience to represent you and assemble your documentation. Enrolled agents charge $100 to $200 per hour for an audit. For referrals, call the National Association of Enrolled Agents at 800-424-4339. If you're self-employed, have your pro persuade the agent that a home audit would be too disruptive. <p>DON'T BE INTIMIDATED. The IRS is telling taxpayers to bring a completed Form 4822, "Reconstruction of Expenses," to the audit. Tax experts say you don't have to fill it out. The form, which asks taxpayers to explain how they paid for personal expenses during the year in question, "is an old internal worksheet the IRS uses to lay the groundwork for criminal-fraud inquiries," says Hill. When she recently refused to complete 4822 for a client, arguing it was an invasion of privacy, the IRS withdrew the demand.<p>Similarly, don't answer questions such as "What cash did you have on hand in 1993 usually, personally or for business, not in a bank, in a safe deposit box, or hidden somewhere?" Says Michael Knight, a CPA in New Canaan, Connecticut: "By law both the CPA and the IRS must shut down the audit when these questions are asked because they can lead to civil or criminal fraud inquiries." Raymond J. Smith, an official with the IRS Office of Compliance Specialization, recently told a group of CPAs that taxpayers needn't answer questions about their education or health: "We're not going to subpoena the taxpayer for that information." <p>BE HONEST. "IRS examiners are trained to ask for information they already have in order to test credibility," says Hill. One training manual for examiners cites the case of a taxpayer who admitted to three bank accounts, when the auditor already had divorce-court records listing 62.<p>DON'T BE A JERK. Read "Your Rights as a Taxpayer," included with audit notices. But keep in mind that your auditor, probably burdened with 35 other returns, may make life easier if you are cooperative. You can request a delay at any time in order to seek help. <p>IF YOU LOSE, APPEAL. Auditors use cost-of-living data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to see if reported income matches residential profiles. However, critics, including Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, say these statistics are inflated. If you disagree with the final bill, appeal. If you don't sign the audit-adjustment agreement, your case will automatically go to an IRS appeals officer. The average appeal results in a 40 percent decrease in taxes, penalties, and interest. In fact, you may owe nothing; IRS statistics show that about one in five audited returns had nothing wrong with them. <p>THE IRS'S REALITY CHECK

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> TAX BREAK?  YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK FOR IT <p>It's getting harder to please the IRS on home-office deductions <p> By Carol Marie Cooper  <p> Dallas accountant James Hopson tells of the local housepainter who always counted on a hefty tax deduction for the office space he had set aside in his home. After all, the painter arranged jobs and billed clients there and stored paint and ladders elsewhere on his property. That was before 1994, when the IRS audited him, ordered him to pay back taxes, and went so far as to contact his clients during the dispute.  <p> Like a lot of other Americans, the painter will resist taking that juicy write-off again. While increasing numbers of Americans are working in their homes, the IRS has gotten downright stingy in granting the deduction.  <p> A 1993 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Soliman, made the business of writing off home-office expenses even trickier. In that case, an an esthesiologist had to cough up back taxes and interest after the court decided his home office, his only office, was not his principal place of business because his patients were all in hospitals.  <p> Some accountants advise clients to forgo the deduction, even if it's deserved. It just isn't worth the risk of an audit, says Hopson.  <p> Home-office deductions once ranked in the IRS's top ten most frequent audit issues, says IRS spokesman Don Roberts. But that was before the 1991 tax year, for which the IRS introduced Form 8829, which allowed the agency to see how self-employed filers calculated the write-off.   <p> Until then, "there was no clear way to delineate the expenses," Roberts says. "The only way we could question whether or not a taxpayer had correctly completed the deductions was to conduct an examination [IRS-speak for audit]." Now, Roberts says, home-office audits rank 34th.   <p> The IRS has long insisted that home-office space be used exclusively for business and that the office meet one of three criteria: that the taxpayer sees clients there, that the office is in a separate building, or that it is where the principal work effort takes place. The Soliman decision narrowed the definition of principal work effort so that a traveling salesman or plumber, say, would be hard put to write off a home base under this rule. <p> If you have a home office, you are allowed to deduct a percentage of household expenses equal to the fraction of space the office occupies. In a 2,000-square-foot home, a 300-square-foot office would allow deductions of 15 percent. That 15 percent is applied to mortgage interest, property taxes, or rent. But remember, mortgage interest and property taxes are already deductible for people who itemize. Only a renter gets an unadulterated gain. <p> The office deduction does count toward otherwise nondeductible items like utilities, homeowners' insurance, security systems, and maintenance. If you're paying $3,000 a year for home insurance, the 15 percent can be written off. The same is true for utilities, although the IRS says that since you won't be showering in your office, you should reduce the water deduction accordingly. And you'd have one phone line anyway, so only additional lines count. <p> You can also depreciate 15 percent of the value of your home and home improvements over 39 years. But this write-off gets complicated. You can't depreciate the ground below. A $300,000 house sitting on a $100,000 lot is worth only $200,000. Depreciating15 percent, or $30,000, gives a deduction of about $770 a year. <p> Be careful, though. If you depreciate part of your house as a business expense, you lower the amount you have invested in it, increasing the chance of capital gains later. Worse, the business portion of your home won't fall under the usual rules that allow you to defer or avoid capital-gains taxes.  <p> If you sell at a loss, the rules could work in your favor. Suddenly, part of your loss from home ownership becomes a business deduction. <p> Whether it makes sense to risk the hassles depends on your situation. Richard Joyner, a CPA in Price Waterhouse's Dallas office, says clients with large homes and big mortgages and utility bills more often take the deduction. The self-employed have more to gain than the guy whose boss insists he telecommute, because an employee can deduct only expenses left after subtracting 2 percent of his or her adjusted gross income. But if you're self-employed, the deduction doesn't just pare income on which you would pay15 to 39.6 percent in federal income taxes; it also reduces the amount subject to 15.3 percent in Social Security and Medicare taxes for the self-employed.  <p> Hopson says his typical home-office client saves about $1,300 if he or she doesn't get audited and wind up paying Hopson to represent him, as the painter did.  <p> Even without claiming a home office, you can deduct or depreciate computers and other office equipment from self-employment income. If you're an employee and need the equipment for your job, you can write it off on Schedule A, subject to the 2 percent income rule. Here again, the amount to be deducted is based on the percentage of its use for business. Only $17,500 can be deducted in a single year. And some items like computers and printers, must be depreciated over several years unless they're used more than 50 percent of the time for business.  <p> Hopson knows first hand the perils of home-office deductions. He worked from home while starting his practice. The first two years, fearing IRS scrutiny, he didn't claim the deduction. Then, for 1988, he did. "Guess what happened? I got audited."  <p> Hopson was able to convince the IRS he was entitled to the deduction. But the $700 or so he saved in taxes cost about $1,500 in billable time.   <p><p><p>

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> ENSURE THAT YOUR CAPITAL GAINS  <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald  <p> Few tax rules change as often as those on capital gains, the difference between an asset's purchase and selling price. The House's recently passed tax bill reduces the long-term capital-gains rate to a maximum effective rate of 19.8 percent on assets sold after December 31, 1994. For assets purchased since then, the government would tax only profits realized in excess of inflation. The tax cut would amount to $31.9 billion over the next five years and $119 billion over the coming decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. This is a huge change from the current law, under which investors who sell or exchange assets held for over a year face a maximum 28 percent federal tax on long-term net capital gains (the gain minus long-term and net short-term capital losses).  <p> The prospects for the House bill are unclear, but investors should be aware that one thing that isn't likely to happen is a reduction in the rate for short-term capital gains. The penalty associated with this high rate can be severe. Currently, gains on assets held one year or less are taxed as if they were ordinary income, which can mean a rate of 39.6 percent or higher.  <p> Another thing that is not likely to change is the complexity of figuring out capital gains in certain situations. Here are some tips on keeping your tax tab as low as possible:  <p> Property received from an estate. The fair market value of inherited property is automatically adjusted to its worth at the time of the benefactor's death. Some people forget this when calculating capital gains, says Janice Johnson, tax director of Coopers & Lybrand in New York. Suppose an individual inherits $10,000 worth of stock that was purchased for $1,000 in the 1950s. Then suppose that taxpayer sells it 13 months after inheriting it for $12,000. The important thing to remember is that long-term capital gains are due on just the $2,000, not the entire $12,000.   <p> Gifts. If a taxpayer receives property as a gift and sells it for a gain, he or she can include in the holding period the length of time the donor held the gift. "So even if the gift was given to you last week, if the donor had held the property for more than one year, you get long-term capital-gains treatment if you sell it now," says Johnson.  <p> Mutual fund distributions. How long you own the fund isn't what's important. Capital-gains distributions are taxed at long- and short-term rates depending upon the time frame for the fund's investments.  <p> Futures contracts. Today, 60 percent of capital gains from certain futures contracts, such as nonequity options and foreign currencies, are taxed at the long-term rate, no matter how long a taxpayer held the investment. "If you buy a broad-based stock index such as the S & P 500 today at $1,000," says Johnson, "and you sell that index next week for $1,500, 60 percent of your $500 gainis treated as long-term capital gain."  <p> Convertible bonds and preferred stock. If a taxpayer converts a corporate bond into common stock of the same corporation, the bond-holding period carries over to the stock. However, if a taxpayer converts a bond into stock but needs to pay additional cash for that stock, says Johnson, "the holding period for the portion of the stock acquired with cash begins the day after the cash purchase is complete."  <p> Property received in a tax-free exchange. The holding period of property given up in certain tax-free exchanges can be added to the holding period of the new property. "If a taxpayer swaps a vacation house in the Poconos for one in Aspen," says Johnson, "no gain is realized for tax purposes, and he or she gets to tack on the holding period for the Poconos property to the one in Aspen."  <p> Personal residences. Taxpayers can roll over all of their gain into a new residence, so long as the new one costs more than the old one. "They can also tack on the holding period of their old residence to the new one," says James Hegel, a tax expert in McLean, Virginia.   .0<p> Property distributed by a partnership. The length of time a partnership holds property distributed to a partner, such as stock or real estate, is added to the taxpayer's holding period. "However, taxpayers who sell inventory within five years of receiving it from that partnership cannot include the partnership's holding period to get long-term capital-gains treatment," says Hegel. <p> Real estate sales involving indebtedness. Suppose a taxpayer buys a piece of land and sells it to an investor, who purchases it with a mortgage. Then the buyer defaults and the land is repossessed. If the original seller repurchases the property, he or she can add the prior holding period to the holding period starting with the date of reacquisition (but not the time when the mortgage holder held title). "It's as if the property was never sold, ignoring the time it was in the hands of the buyer," says Hegel. <p><p>

						May 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> A SMALL VICTORY OVER TAXES  <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald  <p> With the trauma of tax time still fresh in both memory and wallet, we offer this strictly legal list of tax breaks to stick on your refrigerator door. We hope it will help make next April a little less painful.   <p> The exemptions and deductions below come from the Office of Management and Budget in Washington, D.C., which annually delivers a list of tax expenditures tax breaks that cost the government billions to congressional tax-policy analysts. We also consulted Commerce Clearing House, a tax publishing firm in Chicago, andcertified public accountants Janice Johnson of Coopers & Lybrand and Sidney Kess, both of New York City.   <p> "By paying attention to these breaks," says Johnson, "an individual who earns $100,000 annually in adjusted gross income could save an extra $3,000 a year." Other incidental breaks exist in thelaw핝or a more complete list, consult your tax pro.  <p> Non taxable distributions.  <p>If you receive a dividend that includes a return of your capital,typically the case with utility shares, you may owe no tax onthat amount. Ask the company you invested in to separate the taxable and nontaxable dividends. Also tax free: Dividends paid as stock, stock rights (which let shareholders buy newly issued stock at a discount), stock received in a split, mutual fund dividends that represent tax-exempt interest, and dividends on insurance policies (so long as they don't exceed your net premiums).  <p> Retirement plans.  <p>This year, the retirement-plan exemption will cost the government $66.22 billion, and experts say the deficit will eventually force Congress to tax these benefits. So max out while you can on 401(k)contributions, individual retirement accounts, Keoghs, and simplified employee-pension (SEP) plans, and consider after-tax contributions.These retirement plans are not all equally suitable for every taxpayer. Lump-sum distributions from Keoghs qualify for five-year averaging, which may result in lower taxes, and SEPs do not. But, Kess says, "the IRS requires no annual reporting and plan documentation for SEPs, plus they can be opened any time before taxes are filed, unlike Keoghs."   <p> Life insurance.  <p>Money received by the beneficiary of a life insurance policy is not taxed. However that rule applies to the principal amount only not interest. Also, up to $5,000 in death benefits from company-provided life insurance is tax-exempt (the same rule applies to the estate of the deceased employee). That amount must be prorated if there are multiple beneficiaries.   <p> Legal settlements.  <p>This is a complex, evolving area, but in general, you don't have to pay taxes on awards from lawsuits filed for personal injury, sickness, libel, damages, or race, sex, or age discrimination.  <p> Employer-provided benefits.  <p>The IRS will forgo an estimated $60.7 billion this year by not taxing these. However, "if you get better health benefits because you're a top executive, but other employees have to self-insure or get less coverage, you'll have to pay tax on the difference between the annual benefit payments," says Kess.   <p> Dependent care.  <p>A growing number of companies are offering on-site child care. Such benefits are tax-exempt up to $5,000 in value. Ask your employee-benefits department for a year-end statement of the value of the services you used. Also, taxpayers who furnish more than half the total support for a parent, child, in-law, or other household member who earns less than $2,500 annually may claim a $2,500 exemption for 1995. That applies even if your parent resides in a nursing home, so long as you are head of your household and provide over half of the support, including nursing-homefees.  <p> Gifts and inheritances.  <p>No income tax is owed on property received from a gift or inheritance.  <p> Real estate.  <p>Two breaks stand out: If you are age 55 or over and have lived in your principal residence three out of the last five years,you are eligible for a one time exclusion of up to $125,000 inprofits from selling your home. The OMB says this rule will save taxpayers $4.7 billion this year. Also, income from renting a residence for less than 15 days each year is tax free.   <p> Scholarship and fellowship grants.  <p>You owe no tax on scholarship and fellowship grants awarded bya nationally accredited educational institution for tuition and course-related fees, books, supplies, and equipment.  <p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - <p>A field Guide to Lower Taxes  <p> Start documenting these write-offs:  <p>  Capital losses  <p>  Medical expenses (including cost of travel to medical care, telephone calls made to out-of-town physicians, contact lenses, and even birth-control pills)  <p>  Mortgage interest   <p>  Charitable donations   <p>  Home-office deductions   <p>  Furniture used in home office   <p>  Business equipment  <p>  Depreciation of home computer required by a job  <p>  Dividend reinvestment plan fees  <p>  Investment management and advice fees   <p>  Investment publications, books, and newsletters   <p>  Appraisal fees to figure out a casualty loss  <p>  Fees to administer collectibles acquired with intent to make a  profit   <p>  Passport fees for business trips  <p>  Certain attorneys' and accountants' fees  <p>  Certain employee education expenses  <p>  Job-search fees    <p>  Professional club dues, publications   <p>  Union expenses  <p>  Safe-deposit-box rentals  <p>  Medical exams required by a job  <p>  Cost of uniforms and cleaning expenses  <p>  Work supplies and tools  <p>  Work-related convention and seminar fees  <p><p>

						By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>This year, the irs will audit less than 1 percent of the nation's 115 million individual taxpayers after they file their returns on April 17 (April 15 falls on a Saturday). Those are good odds if you're worried about facing an auditor. But there's a catch. "Your chances of an IRS audit rise or fall depending on where you live and how much money you earn," says Marvin Michelman, director of IRS practice and procedure at Deloitte & Touche LLP in New York City.<p>The table below shows the IRS's audit rates according to the agency's domestic district offices. Located in 63 different cities, these house the IRS's audit army. (Seven states have more than one office.) The audit rates posted are for individuals who earn $25,000 to $49,999, $50,000 to $99,999, and $100,000 or more. <p>As the table shows, the IRS is more likely to audit those who live in the western United States than those east of the Mississippi. Furthermore, the probability of being called in by the IRS increases as your income rises, no matter where you live. By far, the worst audit area for high-income individuals is Montana, where the IRS audits a whopping 9.31 percent of the well-off. In contrast, just 1.27 percent of high-income individuals in Chicago can expect to be audited. <p>Why do some offices audit more taxpayers than others? "Basically it's because some districts have more auditors," says Michelman. "Also, in more urban areas, agents have to deal with corporations, whereas in rural areas they're dealing with a taxpayer population composed mostly of individuals."<p>Wherever you live, if the IRS sends you the dreaded audit notice, don't be bullied; you have rights. For instance, you can request a postponement and a second appointment if you need more time to prepare for the audit. Consider hiring a so-called enrolled agent, an individual certified to represent taxpayers before the IRS. Certified public accountants are automatically entitled to this privilege, too. Next, assign power of attorney to that person. That way, he or she can represent you at the audit, so you don't have to worry about making costly blunders.<p>If your auditor disallows deductions based on an interpretation of the law and you don't agree with the final audit bill, "your tax pro can haggle the amount down for you," says Shelly Jacobson, an enrolled agent in New York City. "Just because they give you a bill doesn't mean it's etched in stone." Auditors would much rather settle rapidly, given their huge workload. <p>Roughly 10 percent of audits leave tax bills unchanged or result in a refund. If you get stuck with a bill and can't pay up, your auditor can help you get an installment plan. But you'll be paying an effective annual rate of 15 percent, after interest charges and late penalties. "If you can get cheaper money elsewhere, then do so," says Jacobson. <p>

						The nation's tax collector can't keep up with Congress. Its slow-moving bureaucracy continues to hurt innocent taxpayers and botch federal deficit-cutting plans. Current social and economic trends are now threatening to push the agency over the edge.<p>By Elizabeth MacDonald<p>"Taxes are what we pay for civilized society," Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote in a 1904 legal opinion. He was right. Taxes built it, after all--the whole impossibly complex grid of modern life. Holmes felt so strongly about this that he even spoke of the pleasure he took in writing out his tax checks each year.<p>How times have changed.<p>Today, the cultural consensus supporting the system is teetering. Taxes don't seem to buy personal safety, much less civility, and the national infrastructure raised by generations of accreting revenue--airports, bridges, dams, roads--is crumbling.<p>The purest expression of that breakdown is the Internal Revenue Service, to whom Holmes would have tithed a small percent of his income in the days when it was called the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Back then, only the well-heeled paid federal income taxes and the maximum rate was 10 percent.<p>The IRS was as big as big government ever got, a faceless bureaucracy that knew everything about us and operated according to its own laws. When Richard Nixon, seeking to escape the Watergate noose, threatened to use the service to punish his political "enemies,'' the country wasn't just shocked, it was frightened.<p>Today, however, the institution is seen less as awesome than awful. It can't keep up with the demands of politicians, who change tax laws with alarming regularity. The latest bunch of would-be reformers--House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his Republican colleagues--plan nothing less than a complete overhaul of the income-tax system, at a time when the IRS has trouble handling its most basic function: collecting taxes. It can't spot the $127 billion in taxes evaders annually hide from it or nab the 10 million individuals who don't file each year. And when returns flood in each spring, IRS employees err on one of every ten they enter into the agency's computers, contributing to the monumental disarray of its records. According to the General Accounting Office, the IRS now has more than $200 billion in misstated taxpayer payments and refunds on its books.<p>What's more, the IRS mainframe computers, some more than three decades old, are obsolete and in some cases literally crumbling. A huge effort to upgrade the system is failing, according to both the GAO and the National Research Council, a branch of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. Last April at a Cato Institute debate in Washington, Shirley Peterson, IRS commissioner under President Bush, called the current income-tax system "an unwieldy, inefficient, ungodly mess" that cannot be fixed by "tinkering." <p>Government officials say the IRS's problems now jeopardize the funding of the government. The IRS's difficulties are so severe that the GAO had to warn Congress, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Department of the Treasury, and the Office of Management and Budget that they all harbor "an exaggerated idea" of IRS's ability to help the government slash its $3.6 trillion deficit through improved tax collection. According to a 1992 NRC report to Congress, "a major breakdown of the nation's tax system'' could occur before the year 2000.<p>The accelerating transformation of the U.S. economy, which grows daily more decentralized and international, is moving the IRS closer to that reckoning. Moreover, the developing cashless economy of the Internet and the declining proportion of people employed by large corporations will make the job of collecting taxes far more difficult in the near future.<p>The IRS, with 110,656 people--a full-time workforce greater in size than <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a> combined--is like Gulliver pinned down by the Lilliputians, caught in the massive shift of technological power from the public to the private sector.<p>The cold war, the space race it engendered, and the cost of computation power once kept government at the leading edge of technological progress. But the development of the personal computer in the late 1970s began to push the pendulum in the other direction. Access to data and the power to manipulate it became virtually universal, a commodity, and the private sector proved far more clever and nimble in its application than government. George Orwell's dystopian vision of state control receded.<p>That still leaves the problem of how to administer society, which begins with funding government--$1.2 trillion annually--and includes providing the financial data required to assess the impact of its tax policies. An incompetent IRS diminishes the ability of lawmakers to govern and punishes taxpayers, upon whose uncoerced consent the tax collector ultimately depends.<p>Yet incompetence is rife in the IRS--a conclusion supported by interviews with IRS officials, members of Congress, and former IRS commissioners, as well as an examination of 55 confidential IRS studies, GAO reports, and reviews conducted by the NRC.<p>Some of the IRS's difficulties have been well publicized, such as its plummeting audit rate, down to 0.7 percent from a high of 5 percent in the mid-1960s, and the 1992 scandal in which the IRS caught 368 of its employees snooping through taxpayer returns. Some 132 of them were disciplined, with varying degrees of severity, but just six were fired.<p>The full extent of the IRS's troubles, however, are still emerging--partly as the result of the first-ever audits of the tax agency, conducted by the GAO in 1992 and 1993. These audits paint a picture of a very leaky ship. Among other things, the GAO concluded the IRS can't even document how it spends its own $7.2 billion budget, nor does it have accurate records for nearly $800 million in assets, such as cars and homes, seized from taxpayers.<p>Findings like these and others shed new light on the emerging debate over the merits of the present income-tax system. Although current arguments for abolishing the income tax are generally ideological, the sorry state of the IRS raises more practical considerations. Foremost among them: Is it even feasible to continue collecting an income tax?<p>One cause of the problems at the IRS has been inconsistent leadership. Over the last 42 years, the average tenure of the IRS commissioner has been one and a half years. The pattern continued over the last six years, as four different people have held the job. This turnover in the top post allowed the IRS bureaucracy to mushroom, while making it impossible to pursue long-range planning.<p>The current commissioner is Margaret Richardson, a native of Waco, Texas, and friend of First Lady Hillary Clinton. Richardson snared the appointment after taking a leave of absence from her position as a partner in the Washington, D.C., law firm of Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan to campaign for Bill Clinton in 1992. Between 1969 and 1977, Richardson worked in the chief counsel's office at the IRS in D.C., first as an attorney, then as an administrator. <p>Several months after her confirmation, Richardson told a congressional subcommittee: "Prior to l989, there was no comprehensive effort devoted to improving financial management at the IRS. At that time, we were operating with outdated accounting systems that did not allow us to adequately account for the operations of our organization. We knew there were problems but did not know to what extent.... The audit of our financial statements by the GAO was a watershed for the IRS.''<p>Richardson responded to these problems by abolishing seven assistant-commissioner positions and taking an energetic, hands-on approach to the job. She regularly bursts into subordinates' offices demanding updates on IRS problems. While away on vacation, she called audit manager Eva Williams and discussed the IRS's problems for three hours. <p>This approach, however, has served to mostly alienate IRS bureaucrats throughout the ranks. Her habit of publicly dressing down people is so feared that employees often avoid going to staff meetings with her. <p>Management style, though, probably isn't the real problem. It's unclear whether anyone could halt the agency's decline. For instance, Richardson is now presiding over a much-ballyhooed replacement of the IRS's computer hardware. The new technology, including networked workstations, is expected to reduce paperwork through electronic filing and optical scanning of all tax returns. Richardson told Congress in the fall of 1993 that the modernization program will save taxpayers billions in lower tax-preparer fees and a billion hours spent in contact with IRS. <p>The computer upgrade, begun in 1986, is one of the most expensive civilian computer projects ever. It is projected to cost $23.3 billion through 2008. Of this amount, $7.8 billion is for new computers. The remaining $15.5 billion will go toward keeping the IRS's current computers running. <p>Already, however, the program is well behind schedule. Partly because of the red tape of the government procurement process and partly because of technical snafus with some of the first new computer systems it received, the IRS has to date spent just 17 percent of the money earmarked for the hardware upgrade.<p>Problems with new equipment last year contributed to an alarming number of refund scams that slipped through undetected--particularly those associated with electronic filing. When Congress learned that the IRS had paid out as much as $5 billion in bogus refunds for 1993 tax returns, it slashed the agency's computer budget for 1995 to $650 million from $989 million in the fall of 1994.<p>Last November, the NRC said it "continues to have very serious concerns about the IRS's ability to successfully complete the upgrade on time and within budget." The NRC's skepticism is well-founded. Twice before, in 196878 and in 198286, the IRS started to overhaul its computer system, but then abandoned each attempt. Eight years into the current upgrade, with no end in sight, Robert Clagett, a professor of business at the University of Rhode Island who chairs the NRC committee that reviewed the IRS, says, "I don't think any of us who work in the computer industry would have organized a computer upgrade like the IRS."<p>Still, the system must somehow be fixed. Otherwise, there will only be more incidents such as the one in the Philadelphia service center in 1985: After a computer crash, officials found employees stuffing tax returns into the ceiling and in drawers in an effort to keep up with their work quotas.<p>At the IRS, a computer crash is not always a metaphor. Former commissioner Peterson recalls the time a service-center system went down in 1992: "When we sent a technician out to fix the computer, the broken part was so old and rusted it crumbled in his hand."<p>
The IRS's problems in processing tax returns begin at its ten service centers, where thousands of IRS employees toil in chaotic, football-field둅ize offices, seeking to deal with an ever-rising mountain of work.<p>This year, more than 200 million businesses and individuals will post their returns to one of these centers, roughly triple the number filed in the 1950s. If the IRS taped together all the pieces of paper it receives annually, the trail would wrap around the earth roughly 36 times. "Both the IRS and taxpayers are drowning in a sea of paper," IRS commissioner Richardson told Congress in 1993.<p>Each filing season, thousands of IRS employees sit hunched over gun-metal gray, government-issue desks in offices that look like something out of an anxiety dream. Before them are stacked wooden cubbyholes, called Tingle tables after Jim Tingle, an IRS man who invented them in the 1960s. These employees shove different schedules and tax forms by hand into different Tingle slots. The contents of these boxes then go to part-time IRS keypunchers, paid roughly $18,000 a year, who enter 40 percent of the information on each return--feeding the data into old Unisys and Sperry computers. Each of these workers is expected to plow through 29 to 35 returns per hour.<p>(Some service centers use even more antiquated technology. The IRS center in Austin, Texas, for example, has Gould and Perkin Elmer mainframe computers that were built in the late 1950s and early 1960s. According to Clagett, old returns processed by the Austin center are crammed into the top floors of empty military airplane hangars 190 miles away in Fort Worth.)<p>Clerks at the various centers dispatch the keypunched data to the main IRS data-processing facility in Martinsburg, West Virginia, where computer operators merge the information into the agency's master file. This gigantic repository houses the nation's tax-return data.<p>Martinsburg then matches income-reporting documents from financial institutions with this tax-return data. If these computers discover a mismatch between these documents and income and deductions reported on a tax return, it notifies the service center. The service center then issues notices of underreported income to taxpayers.<p>The IRS says 21 percent of the 1040 returns entered by its clerks contain some sort of error. "About half of the mistakes are IRS, half are taxpayers," says Lawrence Westfall, the IRS official in charge of the agency's computer-modernization program.<p>That means the IRS processes about one in five returns erroneously. The IRS contends it fixes a large percentage of the mistakes before the data ever leave the service center, but the GAO asserts that many types of errors slip through. For example, it says IRS workers incorrectly typed 450,000 addresses into the agency's computers for 1988 tax returns, the latest year for which these data are available. Because of these mistakes, the IRS that year sent approximately 300,000 notices demanding $49 million in additional taxes to wrong addresses.<p>
What happens when the IRS drops the ball on a return? In 1990, Michael Peak, 59, an executive vice president of Sukut Construction in Santa Ana, California, found out.<p>Peak at the time was legal guardian for his 17-year-old niece Yulena, who earned a few thousand dollars working in a senior citizens' residence. In 1990, Peak filed Yulena's 1989 income-tax return, enclosing a $14 check dated April 14 for taxes owed. Peak dutifully wrote Yulena's name and Social Security number on the check, which the IRS cashed on April 24, 1990.<p>That fall, the IRS service center in Fresno spit out a notice saying that Yulena hadn't paid her taxes. In reply, Peak sent the IRS copies of the canceled check, front and back, with a letter explaining Yulena's situation. Two months later, the IRS service center in Fresno sent a second notice demanding payment, this time $16.<p>Peak again sent the Fresno service center copies of the relevant documents and an explanatory letter, but in August 1991, a third notice arrived from the IRS district office in Laguna Niguel, California. Peak placed a telephone call to Laguna Niguel to argue his case, but the agent who fielded the call told him to pay his bill--now $18--or she would garnish Yulena's wages and slap a lien on her property. He duly sent off a new check to the IRS.<p>Ultimately, Yulena didn't lose any of her salary, and the IRS sent Peak a $20 check. Soon after, an IRS ombudsman from Laguna Niguel called and apologized. Nonetheless, it took a year and wasted who knows how many IRS man-hours to resolve a petty goof made worse by the agency's thuggish behavior.<p>
Experts on the IRS point out that one of its problems is its inability to deal with the mobility of Americans--not exactly a recent sociological development. The seven regional offices, 63 district offices, and ten service centers rarely communicate with each other, and their computers aren't networked. As a result, taxpayers who move routinely run afoul of different IRS offices across the country.<p>Frank and Ann Cook were two such people, harassed for ten years by the IRS, largely because it didn't register the Cooks' move from the West to the East Coast. In autumn of 1983, the Cooks, living in Seattle, paid a modest amount in back taxes after an IRS audit of their 1981 return. Two years later, they moved to Hartford, notifying the IRS in writing of the change of address.<p>That year, the IRS audited the couple's 1982, 1983, and 1984 returns and eventually sent to the old Seattle address a bill for $6,300, which the Cooks never received and hence never responded to. The IRS interpreted their silence as tax delinquency and ultimately attached the bulk of Ann's wages as a hospital technician from 1987 to 1989. Not until 1989, despite repeated phone calls and letters to the Hartford office, did the couple receive written notice of the audits the IRS conducted. Ironically, Frank Cook claims he had complete receipts for the deductions the agency disallowed back in 1985.<p>Ultimately, the IRS seized $35,000 in salary and savings. The Cook family, including three children, was reduced to living for an entire year on $150 per week. "You'd think in the United States a simple taxpayer would be able to ask the IRS, 넹hy are you doing this? We didn't owe all of this money,'" Ann Cook says today. Had an agent checked the Cooks' file or wondered why they hadn't responded to the audit notices or the liens, the agonizing process that left a family impoverished and embittered would have been unnecessary. Why didn't this happen? The probable answer is sheer bureaucratic rigidity.<p>
This same quality shows up in the way the IRS responds to women, who pose a particular challenge at an agency that has yet to acknowledge women's liberation or the demographic changes it created.<p>The distaff problem is a sizable one. Every year at least 3 million women change their last names because of marriage or divorce. According to the GAO, these women are all at risk of receiving wrongful penalty notices stating that they did not file their returns. This occurs because the IRS's computer system is the same "as it was in 1962," according to a confidential IRS report, and cannot immediately fix a mismatch between its records and the taxpayer's new last name.<p>The IRS stores joint returns under the name of the first spouse listed, usually the husband. If the wife gets divorced or remarries, the IRS often assumes she is not filing tax returns because it can't match her new name to the one on file. Instead, it sends out a failure-to-file notice, often a lien on her property.<p>Worse, the GAO says these notices are sent to the last known address of the spouse of record on the old joint return, meaning the husband. According to the confidential report, IRS computer programs make a number of comically outdated assumptions about women and our society. They assume "women would report their income on joint returns, husbands would prepare joint returns, and husbands would be the primary taxpayers." They also expect women to report name changes to the Social Security Administration themselves and, in any case, that they will only marry once and will not revert to their maiden names if divorced. IRS inspectors concluded that the agency has yet to acknowledge that "over the last 31 years, women accounted for 60 percent of all new workers entering the workforce, the number of divorced women quadrupled, and remarriages increased 60 percent."<p>Even when wrong, the IRS can be a bad enemy, according to a Pittsburgh woman who asked to remain anonymous. She and her husband filed jointly in New York City for many years before moving to Pittsburgh in 1991. That year, she received a notice from the IRS service center in Holtsville, New York, stating she never filed her 1984 income taxes and demanding $7,598.12 in ten days, under threat of losing her house, car, and wages.<p>The IRS relented only after she provided a copy of the disputed return. One year later, the Philadelphia service center dunned the couple for taxes on the same "missing'' return. Though the couple eventually fixed their problem, "every time I get a letter that says Internal Revenue Service on it, I cringe," says the woman.<p>Six years ago, IRS inspectors suggested that simply by including a line on returns for maiden names, or keeping a separate file under the second taxpayer's surname and Social Security number, everyone could stay matched to their tax records. Officials in the returns-processing division rejected the recommendations as too expensive. <p>
Today, the halls of Congress resound with brave GOP talk about tax cuts and government waste. If a new tax law is enacted this year, it will mark the 32nd time elected officials have changed the tax code in 41 years, according to the Tax Foundation, a public-policy research group in D.C.<p>"On more than one occasion Congress made a tax change, but before the IRS had finished reprogramming its computers, it changed the law again," says former commissioner Peterson. This endless revision makes administering the tax code still more difficult. Each year the IRS must revamp its computer programs for 80 percent of its 400 forms. The antique IRS hardware must be programmed using "assembler'' language, in which each letter of every word and each digit is separately written. Thousands of IRS workers must spend hundreds of hours learning new laws, codes, revisions. The 1986 Tax Reform Act hardly accomplished its mission of simplifying the law. And now the Republican Congress is talking about upending the law once again.<p>The IRS's problems often come back to haunt Congress. Lawmakers, in deciding how much income to tax, rely chiefly on estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office. When Congress publicizes how much money it will raise from certain tax-law changes, it bases that information on IRS sample studies of 194,000 tax returns.<p>That sample, the GAO says, is too limited and often flawed. IRS computers can only indicate how much in gross taxes people pay in various income brackets. They don't show how much revenue is raised by different components of the income tax. Plus, the information is often two years old. The IRS operates "with no forethought to setting up records that would let Congress compare its budget numbers to actual, real-time numbers," says Gregory Holloway, director of civil audits at the GAO and the person who headed up its IRS audit. "Because IRS's records are so poorly set up, nobody can accurately tell what the impact of new federal tax policies will be."<p>In 1989, the Office of Treasury Analysis, which also relies on IRS data for budget estimates, included this disclaimer in briefing materials sent to congressional staffers: "More often than not the effect of tax law changes cannot be adequately quantified by the use of tax return data. Estimates frequently involve novel ideas where there is little or no data, no previous experience to draw upon, no studies to refer to, indeed, nothing available but the estimator's past experience."<p>Then too, the IRS has on occasion ignored its own inadequate data to make exaggerated claims about future revenues in response to congressional pressure to bring in more money. In 1991, for instance, the IRS told Congress it could collect as much as $105 billion in outstanding taxpayer fines. Yet when the GAO later examined the IRS's own records, it found piles of duplicate entries and incorrect bills. Eventually, the IRS concluded that only $28 billion in fines could be collected--either because taxpayers didn't actually owe what the IRS thought, couldn't afford to pay, or couldn't be located.<p>Again in 1989, the IRS promised to raise $666 million between 1990 and 1991 by auditing 12,000 small-business pension plans--retirement plans at small law firms, auto body shops, hair salons, and the like. Based on the IRS's assertions, Richard Darman, then director of the Office of Management and Budget, logged an additional $666 million into President Bush's proposed budget for fiscal year 1990, which Treasury sources say Congress promptly began to spend. <p>In reality, however, OMB says the IRS probably won't collect more than $80 million from those funds. In 1990, when the American Society of Pension Actuaries challenged the IRS's calculations, it discovered that the IRS intended to penalize pension plans that calculated benefits based on interest rates of less than 8 percent or a retirement age of less than 65. The IRS apparently had decided that these estimates were too low, even though the IRS's own retirement plan carried a 7 percent rate and a retirement age of 55 at the time.<p>Pension administrators challenged the IRS in court and won six straight cases. The IRS "did not do their homework and they lost resoundingly," says John Woyke, a principal at Towers Perrin, a benefits consulting firm based in Valhalla, New York.<p>
For an agency that demands numerical exactness from the taxpayer, the IRS puts little faith in its own numbers. The GAO says it is an unspoken IRS policy to amend the cash records it gives to Congress representing taxpayer payments or refunds so they jibe with the Treasury Department's fiscal year-end financial statements. Despite the fact that the Treasury's books documenting the government's revenues have never been audited, the IRS routinely uses Treasury's numbers to resolve cash differences between these records instead of figuring out whose numbers are correct. This procedure violates IRS and Treasury regulations.<p>In September 1993, the GAO reports, IRS officials in the chief financial officer division in Washington, D.C., which is in charge of the IRS's bookkeeping, recorded a phantom $79 million in revenue on its books in order to square its accounts with Treasury's. In 1992, the GAO says, IRS officials in the agency's National Revenue Accounting Unit in D.C. ordered IRS accountants at the Brookhaven, New York, IRS service center to type in their records that they received $55 million from taxpayers in January, even though they really got that amount in March, again to match Treasury's cash records.<p>Of course, if taxpayers amended their returns to coincide with, say, erroneous bank records, the IRS would be quick to penalize them. <p>
The fiddling extends to all levels of the bureaucracy. According to a January 12, 1993, confidential report by Donald Kirkendall, then Treasury Department inspector general, 24 employees in Buffalo filed 65 complaints with his office, charging that IRS managers there "manipulated" audit statistics to "receive merit pay awards," especially in tax audits that target small-business excise payments for gasoline and tobacco taxes. IRS managers, according to Kirkendall, were "gaming the numbers." <p>Kirkendall concluded that statistics compiled by the Buffalo office "are routinely inflated by all levels of management." He also warned that this practice has "service-wide implications," especially for the veracity of the IRS's numbers. With bracing candor, Kirkendall concluded, "We are building a house of cards."<p>
The IRS, still behind the curve of decades-old demographic trends, certainly isn't ready for new changes on the horizon, such as the advent of electronic money. Already, an estimated 30 million people and 20,000 companies around the world log on to the Internet computer network. Users in the first wave of online shopping can buy books and clothes, paying for them electronically via credit cards with the help of companies such as First Virtual Holdings in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the first entirely electronic bank. The number of Internet users is expected to reach 200 million by the turn of the century. By then, experts say, Net surfers will be able to conduct virtually any kind of commercial transaction through cyberspace.<p>Digital cash that requires no credit card is also coming, and soon. "Already, there's an estimated $100 to $200 million sold annually on the Net, and this figure is expected to balloon to anywhere from $2 billion to $600 billion by the year 2000," says Richard K. Crone, a senior manager at KPMG Peat Marwick's Center for Electronic Banking in Los Angeles.<p>Furthermore, anyone with a computer and a telephone line can become a small business (the number of small businesses rose from 15 million in 1984 to 21 million in 1992). As more taxpayers conduct business and get paid via the Internet, experts say the day will soon come when electronic income and assets online can easily be hidden from the IRS.<p>Crone says the IRS could track electronic transactions and that tax payments could be automatically sent to the IRS via computer, but the IRS will have to count on what merchants report and the sophistication of its auditors and computer systems. Crone is pessimistic. "The IRS is still behind the Berlin Wall in terms of computing power,'' he says.<p>Lee Stein, president of First Virtual Holdings, agrees. The electronic transactions will be "as untraceable as any merchant wants them to be," he says. "A person can rent space on a local computer system in a U.S. domain such as the island of Tonga, which has liberal tax laws, and conduct all financial business through it.'' You can live in Maine and run your Tongan business online, with no one the wiser. Beyond that, says Crone, "the Net will make it easier for a merchant to evade taxes, say, by setting himself up with a foreign E-mail address. There's no border control on the Net, and it is averse to any government intervention, which will also make it harder for the IRS to impose rules." <p>As the IRS nurses its computer systems into the next millennium, no one knows whether the agency's manifold problems can be fixed, or patched, in time to prevent an agency meltdown. Congressional apathy only adds to the problem. When Senator John Glenn conducted a hearing on the GAO's audits last July, 10 of the 14 congressmen on the committee didn't show up. The four who did stayed for ten minutes, then left.<p>Glenn, who orbited the earth alone in a space capsule, is still flying solo. At some IRS hearings, he says, "I sit up there taking testimony all by myself." <p>Additional reporting by Kathleen Murray and Bruce Upbin<p>
YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS COULD GET TRAPPED<p>By Elizabeth MacDonald<p>Like it or not, the government's problems are your problems, and they affect more than your taxes. The GAO says at least 10 million workers could miss out on thousands of dollars in annual Social Security benefits because the IRS and the Social Security Administration aren't cooperating in crediting roughly $25 billion in contributions owed to workers.<p>The affected workers' last names or Social Security numbers were incorrectly entered on their W-2 earnings statements, so the SSA cannot match their Social Security contributions to their accounts. Also, the GAO says thousands of defunct businesses failed to send in W-2s for their former employees.<p>The GAO says the IRS, because its records are constantly updated, could help resolve this problem. The agency tries to keep its records current by holding onto refund checks until taxpayers whose records are faulty provide correct information. The IRS also penalizes businesses if they don't provide accurate tax records on their workers. <p>The IRS, however, "does not give the Social Security Administration its updated taxpayer name and Social Security information so we can correct our benefits records for individuals," says Paul Russin, the SSA's IRS liaison. It is hard to understand why the IRS doesn't cooperate with the SSA, particularly as it willingly shares its taxpayer information with more than 200 state and local taxing authorities across the country. To catch criminals, certain state agencies, such as the Oregon Public Utility Commissioner and the Washington Department of Fisheries, also get IRS tax-return information on request. In its defense, the IRS says it tells taxpayers to correct their name and Social Security numbers with the SSA when the IRS notifies them about a mismatch in its records.<p>Another problem arises when companies go bankrupt and don't provide the IRS or SSA with current and correct information. In 1992, the IRS drew up proposed regulations that would force shaky businesses to report employees' earnings to SSA quarterly instead of annually and to send a W-2 form to SSA within 30 days of shutting down. But the IRS only followed through on the first of the two ideas, and did so just this past December.<p>Until these problems get resolved, you must do your own Social Security benefits checkup. The SSA keeps a lifetime record of employee contributions going back to 1937, and to 1951 for the self-employed. To get your Social Security benefits statement, call Social Security at 800-772-1213 and ask for Form SSA-7004, "Request for Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement." After you send back the form, in about a month and a half you'll get a statement of the contributions, or earnings, Social Security has recorded under your name. The statement will also show your estimated monthly benefits if you retire at age 62, 65, or 70. <p>To check Social Security's math, gather your old W-2 forms, tax returns, and pay stubs. If your current employer reported the wrong wage amount to Social Security, contact your payroll office and ask them to alter the figure to match your W-2. If you don't have your tax return, get a certified copy from your IRS service center by sending in a form 4506 and a $14 check. The IRS should take about a month to send you one. Next, report the mistake to Social Security by sending copies of your correct earnings, W-2s, pay stubs, and tax returns. From February to October of this year, Social Security will also mail its benefits estimate to those taxpayers age 60 or older who are not yet receiving Social Security checks. Younger taxpayers will receive a free benefits statement when they turn 60, and by the year 2000, Social Security plans to send this statement to everyone age 25 or older.<p>
OR MAYBE MOONSHINERS HAD THE RIGHT IDEA<p>By Joel Slemrod<p>Fueled by a widespread belief that the current income-tax system is too complex and curbs incentives to work, save, and invest, Capitol Hill is abuzz with talk of abolishing the income tax. But what are the alternatives, and how do they stack up against the current system? Here are four:<p>THE VALUE-ADDED TAX<p>A staple of most European countries' revenue systems since the 1960s, a VAT doesn't require individuals to file tax returns. April 15 would thus be a day like any other day. Businesses would remit a flat percentage of gross sales receipts minus most material and supply costs other than labor. The effects of a VAT are much like a sales tax, raising the prices of everything we purchase by the rate of the tax--probably about 25 percent if it replaced the income tax entirely. A VAT would eliminate taxation on savings and investment, but it would also raise taxes paid by low-income households. Congress could try to reduce the impact on the poor by levying lower VAT rates for goods such as food, shelter, and medical services, but such measures wouldn't make up the difference and would also make administration of the tax far more complex. Conservatives have long been wary of the VAT, fearing it would become a "money machine" providing painless revenue for a ballooning government.<p>CONSUMPTION TAXES<p>People would still have to report their income on tax returns but would be allowed to deduct all net new savings, such as money placed in a savings account or new investments in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. A graduated rate structure would help maintain the current distribution of the tax burden by income group.<p>Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and Pete Domenici of New Mexico plan to introduce a personal consumption둆ax bill (at press time, their target date was mid-February). A preliminary version retains home-mortgage deductions and the earned-income credit, allows credits for charitable giving, and permits limited deductions for education. This option offers neither simplification nor lower rates. Because no country operates a personal consumption tax, there could be unforeseeable glitches in its administration. The switch to such a system might also require taxpayers to report their total financial assets--a potential paperwork nightmare.<p>THE FLAT TAX<p>Flattens the income tax in two distinct ways: by applying a single, uniform rate to taxable income and by eliminating most, if not all adjustments, deductions, and exemptions.<p>House Republican Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas has been pushing a 17 percent flat tax that eliminates deductions for mortgage-interest payments, charitable contributions, and state and local tax payments. It features a standard deduction of $26,200 for joint filers but excludes interest, dividends, and capital gains from the tax base. A flat tax could simplify the tax code enormously, while lightening the tax load on households earning more than $200,000 a year. It would increase the tax burden on middle- and lower-income households. The exclusion from tax of all capital income undoubtedly would strike many as inequitable. The person paying a flat 17 percent tax on his or her $50,000 salary won't be pleased that next door, a taxpayer who receives $50,000 in interest and dividends doesn't have to pay a dime.<p>SUPPLEMENT THE INCOME TAX<p>Replacing the income-tax system with any of these three proposals would make the Tax Reform Act of 1986 look like fine-tuning in comparison. Instead of replacing the income tax, Congress could add, say, a VAT to its arsenal of federal taxes and use the revenue to cut income-tax rates or increase the standard deduction. In the current tax-cutting environment, however, neither party is likely to embrace this approach. <p>
BEST DEFENSE: HOW TO USE THE IRS'S OWN WEAPONS AGAINST IT<p>By Elizabeth MacDonald<p>If you're like most taxpayers, you probably can't wait to loll on a faraway island once you get your refund check. But don't pack your steamer just yet: The IRS may not be done with you. Last year the agency demanded over $1 billion in extra payments from taxpayers, mailing intimidating notices to millions of filers who--the IRS says--calculated their returns wrong.<p>What taxpayers should know is that such notices often result from sloppy bookkeeping. Yet the IRS does little to vet its work. According to a confidential agency report, only demands for $25,000 or more are checked by humans for mistakes. IRS computers spit out bills charging lesser amounts with reckless abandon--and taxpayers often pay up without a peep. That's too bad, because with a little effort you can challenge such an assessment, or even the result of an audit. Says New York City accountant Nancy Gallagher: "Many don't realize that taxpayers can beat the IRS at its own game."<p>Unfortunately, the IRS's main game is record keeping, not writing, and its notices and records might as well be written in Sanskrit. Still, don't panic. If you receive what you believe is a bogus bill from the IRS, there's a sensible procedure to follow. First, call the telephone number on your notice and get the IRS's taxpayer service division on the line. Ask for a printout of the past two years' worth of your records from the IRS master file. This is the governmental equivalent of your TRW credit report and will serve as a Rosetta stone in your campaign for justice. Of course it's written so only a computer could understand it, so be sure to ask for a glossary of IRS codes, too.<p>Your transcript will take about three weeks to arrive. When it comes, you'll see that it shows your name, the dates you filed your returns, any money you paid or still owe, and any bills the IRS sent you. There will also be a bunch of weird alphanumeric sequences: Remember, you're dealing with mainframe computers. Each time the IRS pokes into your tax account, it enters a "transaction code" in your file. On your printout you'll see this activity identified by the letters TC, followed by a three-digit number. There'll be a brief explanation to the right of every entry. This is where to look for information on what the taxman is doing to you--and for ammunition to fight it.<p>For example, if the IRS says you owe more taxes, you should be on the lookout for liens (TC 582) that the agency may have filed against your bank account without telling you. That's important, since the IRS has confiscatory powers. If you've been asked to say interest (TC 190 or 196), you can use your transcript to argue for an abatement. Compare the printout to your own records and note every error or delay in recording payments. This will serve as powerful evidence that the IRS itself contributed to your problem.<p>If you find mistakes in your transcript, write to the tax examiner listed on your original delinquency notice. These workers can correct IRS errors and will decide whether your fines should be abated. Remember, be polite. Many IRS workers are underpaid and overwhelmed. Tell them the year of the tax you're disputing, describe the mistake clearly, and explain what you think the IRS should do. Include copies of any documents that support your case. Supply your Social Security number and the 14-digit locator number found in the upper right-hand corner of your notice. Also include your daytime phone number. And remember: Keep your printout, records, and all IRS correspondence in a safe place. Fight paperwork with paperwork.<p><p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> TAX SAVINGS FOR BIG PAYCHECKS <p>Why firms are offering nonqualified retirement plans   <p> By Rebecca Lewin  <p> Top wage earners have begun finding new ways to supplement their retirement savings--tax free. Current tax-law limits set the salary cap for contributions to so-called qualified retirement plans--such as 401(k)s--at $150,000. (The pre-Clinton limit was $236,000.)  <p> But new types of nonqualified plans let participants set aside more income, tax-deferred, than the qualified-plan limits allow. Some of the new arrangements, however, are tricky. All also come with one major drawback: They don't provide outright controlor ownership the way typical 401(k)s do. If they did, the assets in them would be taxable--and deductible to employers--now. "A lot of people don't know that," says Robert Scharff, principal of the Todd Organization Inc., a consulting firm in St. Louis. The trick is to make sure that control does change hands after retirement. The new nonqualified plans include:  <p> Deferred-compensation plans. These relatively straight forward setups let participants contribute, tax-deferred, as much of their salary and bonus as they wish. The company then invests funds to meet the minimum returns promised to the employee. Avariation on this is the so-called mirror 401(k), a nonqualified plan that invests in the same mutual funds or other vehicles as the company's qualified 401(k).   <p> Supplemental executive-retirement plans. Suppose a company's qualified pension plan pays lower-level workers 50 percent of their salaries on their retirement. Those with heftier incomes, however, may be limited to receiving, say, 20 percent because of the tax laws. In such cases, management can create and contribute to a nonqualified "excess" or "restoration" plan. These plans ensure that the higher 50 percent figure comes to executives at retirement.  <p> Target supplemental executive-retirement plans. These vehicles set a target percentage of an employee's final compensation--say, 60 percent. The plan takes into account what the employee will receive in qualified pension and Social Security payments and antes up to meet the target.  <p> These plans are unsecured and thus vulnerable to three major dangers. First is change of control, in which a new management takes over and stops the nonqualified-plan payments. Then, there's change of management heart. This is what happens when the company's chiefs decide to stop funding executives' futures because the company needs the money for something else. Finally, there's bankruptcy, in which creditors may snatch up retirees' savings. <p> There is some protection from the first two threats, called the Rabbi Trust. Originally created to safeguard a rabbi's retirement funds, this trust becomes irrevocable and a trustee becomes responsible for paying the benefits if a change of control or management commitment to the plans takes place. Rabbi Trusts, however, do not provide protection from creditors' claims in bankruptcy. <p> <p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> PICKING THE BEST TAX SOFTWARE <p>We liked all four products, but our favorite was...  <p> By Andrew Gluck  <p> Our pick for the best tax-preparation software this year: Turbo Taxby <a name="NASD:INTU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16001"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intuit</b></a>. After examining and testing four of the top tax programs on the market, we chose Turbo Tax because we liked the simple--even friendly--way it takes users through the other wise pencil-chewing process of completing a tax return.  <p> Actually, we thought all four of the programs we tried were pretty good. The other three: Tax Cut by Block Financial Software(our top choice last year), Personal Tax Edge by Parsons Technology, and Simply Tax by 4Home Productions.  <p> Each of these products can help save time in completing a 1994 federal tax return. They also eliminate errors in arithmetic (Pentium chips notwithstanding). According to the Internal Revenue Service, math mistakes are the most common problem on taxpayer returns.   <p> The software programs also make it possible for users to change a single entry on a return--for example, to boost a charitable donation--and then recalculate the entire return with a single keystroke.  <p> Advantages like these have helped make tax-preparation software immensely popular. During the last tax season, software companies sold a total of 3.4 million tax preparation packages--a 50 percent jump over the previous year, according to the Software Publishers Association in Washington, D.C. Federal tax programs sell in the discounted range of $20 to $35; state versions go for $20 to $25.   <p> We examined the Windows versions of the four top sellers and also looked at CD-ROMs for Turbo Tax, Tax Cut, and Personal Tax Edge. The latter were identical to the Windows products except for some additional audio and video features that we sometimes found silly, such as when the computer merely voiced the samething that appeared on the screen.  <p> Each of the programs works essentially the same way: They are set up as personal interviews, asking the user questions. Depending on the answer, the programs then ask follow-ups. The process goes on like this until the return is complete.   <p> In our tests, we prepared a number of sample tax returns using the programs and invited each company to give us a tour of its product to ensure we'd see the best features. We also enlisted the help of tax expert Robert Lipsky, a certified public accountant in Jericho, New York. We ran the programs on a computer with a 386 processor running at 33 MHz and another with a 486 processor running at 66MHz.   <p> One of the things we liked about Turbo Tax was the way its interview format helped keep work to a minimum. Lipsky found that Turbo Tax was the only program savvy enough to automatically transfer data from a Schedule C to a Schedule A. When Lipsky allocated 20 percent of the mortgage interest and property taxes he paid in 1994 to his home office on Schedule C, Turbo Tax automatically put the other 80 percent of his mortgage interest and property taxes onto a Schedule A.   <p> Turbo Tax also handled other common tax scenarios better. For instance, during the demos, we asked each company to show us how someone with a small business could depreciate a computer. Turbo Tax's interview was the only one that immediately selected the right depreciation method--using a first-year expensing as allowed under Section 179 of the IRS Code.  <p> Our second favorite program for preparing a1994 return is Tax Cut. It received our No. 1 pick last year mostly on the strength of its easy-to-read help screens. But this year Tax Cut's help screens blasted us with so many instructions that we found them confusing. There was simply too much to read. In contrast, Turbo Tax improved its tax advice by translating tax-speak into plain English. Users get help screens only when they instruct Turbo Tax to provide one. Tax Cut also has abandoned the cartoon like icons we liked so much last year.   <p> Simply Tax gave us the most problems. It ran so slowly on our386-33 MHz machine that we lost patience in the middle of the company's demonstration. An official said the program was built to run on machines people are buying today, which use 486 and Pentium microprocessors. But data from SPA indicates that no more than 23 percent of the households that own computers in the U.S. have machines with 486's or Pentiums.    <p> Personal Tax Edge is a fine product for accountants and other professional preparers because its interview prompts users to enter data directly onto IRS forms. Its format, however, isn't nearly as pleasant as Turbo Tax and doesn't provide enough hand-holding to guide a tax know-nothing through a return.  <p> Computer and software companies make a lot of promises about the advantages and utility of their products. Some day, they may even live up to some of their more outlandish claims. At the moment, however, tax-preparation software is one of the few categories that really does help to make life a little simpler. Only those with the most complicated returns need fear a dissatisfying outcome--at least with the software, that is.

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> ADVISOR BRIEFS  <p> By Peter G. Miller and Deborah Pont  <p> DEEP DISCOUNTERS GO DEEPER  <p> Brokerage commissions have been rising at both full-service and discount brokerages but falling at the so-called deep-discount firms, according to Mercer Inc., a New York셕ased research firm that keeps an eye on discount brokers. A Mercer survey of 90 brokerage outlets found that full-service firms charged customers an average commission per trade of $246 in September 1994, up3 percent from $239 in February 1993. The three largest discount firms--<a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab</b></a>, Fidelity Investments, and Quick & Reilly--charged an average of $102, up from $101 in 1993.  <p> But deep discounters charged an average commission of $50 last year. Mercer says that represented a drop of 6 percent from the average $53 a trade assessed by the deep discounters in 1993. <p>  <p>THE RADON PANIC   <p> Rising concern about radon--a harmful, invisible, and odorless gas produced by radioactive decay--has led to an increase in in-home testing nationwide. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, estimating that 1 in15 homes has elevated radon levels, already has trained more than 3,000 radon testers. But thousands more testers are active because most states don't require a license to do such work.  <p> The problem: Many of the inspectors are using unreliable short-term tests--ones that attempt to measure radon levels in a home in just a few days. The EPA found that positive readings for radon on two common short-term tests were false 49.9 percent of the time.  <p> "You can't be sure what the atmospheric pressure will do during any given week, and so the results are not reliable," says Thomas P. Sheahen, president of Western Technology in Derwood, Maryland. Sheahen was certified as an EPA radon inspector but says he left the business because staying would have meant "becoming a crook." <p> Tests that measure for radon over at least a 90-day period are much more accurate but are often viewed as impractical in real-estate transactions. The solution: When buying a home, require the sellers to create an escrow fund for radon repairs. Then do a long-term test. If it shows a harmful level of radon, the fund can be used to pay for repairs. The cost for repairs generally runs from $500 to $2,500 per home, according to the EPA.  <p>  <p>WATCH THOSE FUND FEES  <p> Beware of hidden mutual fund fee increases--or so we've read in a number of recent press accounts. But are fees really rising? Not according to data collected by Lipper Analytical Services. Lipper says the average fees on general equity funds rose a scant 0.8 percent last year. On the other hand, given the sort of year most funds had in 1994, even that seems like a hefty increase to us.  <p>  <p>THE LOVE TRUST  <p> What's the most widely used form of trust fund? Possibly the credit-shelter trust, which helps married couples take advantage of the credit that allows $600,000 in every estate to pass from one spouse to the other free of federal estate taxes.   <p> Say a couple has $1.2 million and has not established a credit-shelter trust. Each spouse can will everything to the other without triggering estate taxes. But if the value of the estate is still $1.2 million when the survivor dies, the tax collector gets $235,000--the estate tax on the amount in excess of $600,000. When each spouse puts $600,000 into a credit-shelter trust, however, the survivor can use the money and eventually pass it on to the children tax-free. Another advantage: Investments in a credit-shelter trust can continue to appreciate free of taxes.  <p><p>

						February 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> LENDERS EAT CROW ON ESCROW <p>But new federal rules may not go far enough  <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald  <p> Paul and Nancy Griffin of Pocatello, Idaho, are livid. They figured their mortgagor, First Security Bank of Idaho, should know full well that property-tax payments are remitted when due, not when past due. They thought wrong.    <p> Each month Paul, 58, and Nancy, 55, dutifully send their bank a prorated $110.56 escrow payment equal to one twelfth of their annual property tax bill for their $59,000 fixed-rate mortgage. The bank then pays the couple's full $1,326.72 annual property-tax payment each year by December 20. Mortgage lenders typically collect escrow money along with mortgage payments to pay property taxes and homeowner's insurance.   <p> But instead of mailing the Griffins' annual property-tax payment by the December 20, 1992, deadline, First Security mailed their property taxes two months later, in February 1993. When the couple sat down that April to deduct this payment on their 1992 tax return, their anticipated $500 refund check turned into a $464 federal and state tax bill.  <p> As the Griffins' tale shows, this little account can cause enormous headaches. Besides bigger tax bills, borrowers have been slapped with liens, credit-report blemishes, and even foreclosure proceedings because of lender tardiness, according to the Consumer Federation of America.   <p> First Security said the glitch happened because a supervisor at its escrow servicer, Transamerica Tax Service, was out sick. In addition to the Griffins, another 107 borrowers may have been stuck with tax bills totaling $50,000 because of late property-tax payments. Although the bank offered to pay these borrowers interest for any delinquent amounts, it also told them it was not liable for any "inconvenience" it caused. Says Paul Griffin: "It would have been slightly more than an inconvenience if we had falsely deducted these taxes--we would have violated the law." First Security, though, did not break any federal laws because there are no federal laws to break. Experts say state laws governing escrow accounts are lax, too.  <p> Homeowners are also getting stung by lenders who ask for a bigger escrow cushion in these accounts than necessary, which is then used interest-free by lenders. In 1975, Congress tried to fix this problem when it amended the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act to prohibit lenders from holding on to more than two months' worth of escrow funds. Since then, lenders have largely ignored this ceiling. The amounts involved could be steep--according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, an estimated 36 million mortgages have escrow accounts. The New York Consumer Fraud Bureau, which has extensively investigated escrow problems, reports that some $30 billion is now sitting in these accounts.   <p> New regulations from the Department of Housing and Urban Development taking effect April 24 will require lenders to make timely escrow payments. The rules also will restrict lenders to two months' worth of escrow payments on loans originated after that date (the rules are not generally retroactive). Plus, lenders must now conduct an annual analysis of every escrow account and reimburse homeowners within 30 days for any surpluses in excess of $50. HUD says at least $1.5 billion will be returned to borrowers who were overescrowed, beginning this April. Says Sarah Rosen, a special assistant in HUD's housing division, "They're very strong and dramatic changes."  <p> Yet these rules are often in reality a slap on a lender's wrist. For one, the HUD regulations governing escrow accounts are enforced by civil penalties, not by more powerful court injunctions. Furthermore, just one HUD penalty is in force against lenders--a $100 civil penalty for intentionally failing to send a borrower a copy of his or her annual escrow analysis ($50 per borrower for unintentional violations). Lenders get off lightly for other major infractions, such as the more expensive overescrowing. "If the lender keeps too much escrow money, we don't have the ability to penalize them," says Rosen. And banks still don't have to pay interest to borrowers on these accounts. Today, only state-chartered savings banks and savings and loans in 14 states require such interest. "We would have liked to see [HUD] go further," says Mel Goldberg, spokesman for the New York Consumer Fraud Bureau.  <p> Additionally, HUD's six investigators are sorely underequipped to handle the nation's 36 million mortgage-escrow accounts. To fix the problems not addressed by the HUD regulations, Congress will consider tougher escrow-account measures in a bill, H.R.27, this year. Among the provisions is a requirement that lenders pay borrowers interest on escrow accounts. However, the mortgage industry is threatening to hike interest rates and fees paid by borrowers at the time a loan is originated if mortgage lenders have to pay borrowers such interest. Says Stephen B. Ashley, spokesman for the Mortgage Bankers Association: "The bottom line for borrowers is that H.R. 27 would add an average of at least one-quarter discount point [on a $100,000 loan] to the up-front cost of getting a mortgage." As borrowers continue to get stung while mortgage lenders get tough on these seemingly benign accounts, homeowners may want to consider investigating exactly what is happening to their escrow accounts. Otherwise, this little account could cost you.  <p> SOME HELPFUL HINTS  <p> In light of lender threats and inadequate regulations, what can borrowers do?  <p> * Many homeowners believe that escrow money belongs to the lender. Not true. The bank's requirement of an escrow account is bank policy, not law. Homeowners can opt out of a lender-based escrow account, because they are a negotiable part of a mortgage contract in every state. Before signing on the dotted line, homeowners who want to set up an escrow account in their name should make sure their mortgage contract allows it. Borrowers now stuck with lenders who make tardy payments should take a cue from Paul Griffin:"We would never have had this problem if we had taken care of this payment ourselves."  <p> * Since the new rule requiring lenders to give borrowers an annual audit statement of their escrow accounts is not retroactive, and given the weak enforcement of the rules, borrowers who are told by lenders that they have not been overcharged may want to consider getting an escrow checkup. For a fee ranging from $99 to $269, Mortgage Monitor in Stamford, Connecticut (800-283-4887), will audit an escrow account. In over 70 percent of the cases analyzed so far, the borrower was due a refund, ranging from $400 to more than $2,000.  <p> * When negotiating a mortgage contract, borrowers should ask their lenders to pay a standard savings rate on escrow accounts. Although such payments are not required of most lenders, it doesn't hurt to try.  <p> * Homeowners who refinance their loans must bug their lender to transfer old escrow accounts to their new loans. Otherwise, they may end up paying money into two escrow accounts for the same loan. Eventually, borrowers can get reimbursed, but they could be out several thousand dollars while the problem gets fixed.  <p> <p>

Institutional clients have long gotten the best deals on Wall Street. Now the little guy has a crack at them too.  <p> By Gretchen Morgenson  <p> Among all the arcane practices of Wall Street, the one that has caused the most consternation for individual investors may also be the one that has been the most entrenched: the bigger the account, the better the treatment. For retail investors, separate and unequal is the way that the financial world has always worked.  <p> Who gets first grab at hot initial public offerings? Big, institutional clients, who often leave nothing for small fry. If a broker offers an individual a crack at an IPO, you can bet it's because no one else is buying.   <p> Who can participate in those lucrative leveraged buyouts? Only the big bruisers. Ditto for sophisticated equity-hedging strategies,such as short-selling, and access to privately held real estate turnarounds.  <p> Although a couple of mutual funds have begun dabbling in short-selling and some real estate investment trusts claim to be turnaround experts, pure plays in these areas are very tough to find for folks with less than $1 million to invest.  <p> These investments fall into one of two categories: outright private placements and deals that are typically offered only to institutional clients. Spotting the good ones requires a combination of serious spadework, a deep understanding of the industry involved, and extreme patience--not to mention access. Unlike mainstream Wall Street analysts who are basically spoon-fed information by the companies they follow, the top-drawer professionals who survey the investment scene for undiscovered gems are independent thinkers who reject the conventional wisdom. They pride themselves on research that is proprietary.  <p> But before investors can even think about venturing into this exclusive arena, they usually have to get a foot in the door of a firm's private client group. Doing that at Goldman, Sachs requires $5 million in securities held in the account. At <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>, high rollers typically have $5 million of investable assets in their accounts. Once they're inside, however, a world of investment alternatives opens up, including equity arbitrage, real estate deals, privatizations, leveraged buyouts, even derivatives. <p> Over the years, smaller investors have grown so used to being left with the financial equivalent of table scraps that most have accepted it as the way business is done. Yet some of the barriers are finally breaking down. A few firms and investment professionals are blazing the way. As these firms prove to the rest of the Street that more sophisticated deals can be done for retail folk, and done well, others may follow.  <p> For those early to the game, the timing couldn't be better. After getting hammered in equities and bonds last year, investors are searching for profitable alternatives. Financial assets have had such a run for so many years--stocks have returned a compound average of 14.4 percent for the past ten years while Treasurys have averaged 9.8 percent--that now may be a very good time to consider diversifying into newly available private investments. <p> "With the stock market perceived by many as overvalued now, private deals are a way to get higher returns," says Jeffrey Lynford, chairman of the Wellsford Residential Property Trust, a real estate investment trust listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Lynford has spent years in the private-investment arena. Early on, he was backed by former Treasury secretary William Simonand investor Ray Chambers, two men credited with starting the LBO movement in the 1970s with their company Wesray Capital. <p> But diversifying from plain-vanilla financial assets is tricky. For one thing, investors must find a professional or firm that specializes in the obscure and risky environs of LBOs, equities just out of bankruptcy, private companies, or distressed real estate. Stock pickers--whether at your local brokerage, favorite mutual fund, or neighborhood bank--are a dime a dozen. Tougher to locate are professionals who know how to do the research necessary to navigate the choppy waters of short-selling, distressed bank debt and mortgages, and other off-the-run issues. These are investments whose merits--and shortcomings--are not always evident to the untrained eye.  <p> Firms now at the forefront of the private-investment arena are providing clients with genuine opportunities identified by hardnosed research analysts, not the tax-avoidance tricks that characterized private deals in the past. Happily, too, the minimum account size required of investors has been reduced in some cases, widening the field. Today, at Dabney/Resnick Inc., a Beverly Hills셕ased leader in giving individuals access to private deals, the minimum account size needed for decent diversification is $250,000. At Trilling Partners, a division of <a name="NYSE:PWJ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11148"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Paine Webber</b></a> in Los Angeles that offers sophisticated equity-hedging strategies to individuals,the account minimum is $100,000. Hedge funds that specialize in shorting usually require $250,000 to begin.  <p> Because LBOs, real estate deals, and other private placements remain largely the purview of institutional clients or extremely wealthy individuals, information about them remains scarce. Billionaire investors like Revlon owner Ronald Perelman and Hollywood's Merv Adelson employ scores of staffers to hunt down assets worth acquiring and companies to buy, but smaller investors have no one to perform this due diligence.   <p> Yet it is just this niche--providing proprietary and what was once purely institutional research to retail customers--that a few firms are now trying to fill. Both founders of Dabney/Resnick--chairman and chief executive Judy Resnick and president Neil Dabney--are escapees from Drexel Burnham Lambert's high-yield institutional sales department. Of her experience there, Resnick says, "We saw extremely wealthy clients being offered all the good stuff and making very good returns and thought, Why couldn't individuals get this too?" So they left Drexel and set up their own shop. That was in July 1989; seven months later Drexel collapsed. <p> Another bit of good timing by Dabney/Resnick came in late 1990, when the junk bond market went into free fall. The firm was among the first to call the turn in high-yield securities, its specialty. The next few years saw junk bonds surge in value. Between May '91 and September '94, Dabney/Resnick Asset Management returned 70 percent for its clients. That translates to a 20 percent compounded annual return. The numbers are audited by accounting firm BDO Seidman.  <p> Trilling Partners, a boutique within the Paine Webber brokerage, is another group that brings institutional research to individuals. Headed by veteran broker Stan Trilling, the firm's five professionals scour the equity markets for small-capitalization stocks to buy and sell short, creating hedged portfolios that historically outperform long-only or short-only accounts in both good and bad markets. A broker since 1969, Trilling established his boutique in 1988 and has $85 million under management. Of that, $35 million is dedicated to small-cap longs and shorts. "I began offering my proprietary short ideas to institutions only in 1987," he says. "Now I have a 50-50 split between institutions and retail. "Between November '92 and February '94, one of the most woeful periods for short-sellers, Trilling's portfolio of ten picks and pans was up 169 percent.  <p> What are these firms recommending to clients now?   <p> LBOs. Since 1991, Dabney/Resnick has done ten LBOs of smallish companies. After the firm has toured company facilities, put management through the wringer, and pored over the financials, it uses client money to buy an equity stake in the outfit, typically investing between $1 million and $5 million. The firm takes a seat on the board and goes over budgets with management each week.   <p> Glenn Boschetto, head of Dabney/Resnick's LBO group, says: "We look for high current yields of between 11 percent and 13 percent and a kicker on the end when we sell the company. Total returns should be around 30 percent a year."   <p> Example: The buyout of Technicarbon, a manufacturer of carbon paper, in 1992. Dabney/Resnick invested some $3 million in retail investors' funds in the company, then sold it in 1994. Investors earned total returns of 29 percent a year.  <p> Surprisingly, the firm has little competition in the small end of the LBO market. Boschetto explains: "Most LBO funds have $200 million in assets and are looking to invest no less than 10 percent in each deal because they can't be spread too thin. These institutions won't look at an equity investment of less than $5 million, which works well for us." Investments are made with four- to five-year holding periods in mind. No short-term money is allowed.  <p> Clients' costs in a typical Dabney/Resnick LBO are roughly 1.5 percent of the value of the deal. The firm also invests some of its own money alongside investors'. This gives it exactly the same goals as its investors; the higher the returns, the better the payout.  <p> DISTRESSED REAL ESTATE. A newer area of opportunity for investors: office buildings in foreclosure or held by owners who want out. Dabney/Resnick's clients have bought four buildings in Florida and eight in Los Angeles, and the firm is looking to buy another three buildings in L.A. early this year. One of the deals, involving three office buildings in California, was conducted in December1993 for $46 million, with close to 90 percent financing by the sellers. Two of the structures were in foreclosure, and the other was held by a partnership eager to exit. Dabney/Resnick bought the buildings along with a new management team and almost immediately began increasing occupancies. One building, only 80 percent rented when the deal was done, now has more than 90 percent occupancy. In one year, the cash flow on it jumped from $2.8 million to $3.2 million.  <p> Jason Reese, who runs the firm's real estate group, says: "We're already in negotiations to sell for about $11 million a building we bought in the deal for roughly $8 million. Our annual rates of return should be 25 percent."  <p> The fees levied on investors in real estate come out this way: Dabney/ Resnick gets 7 percent of the money it raises from investors, but this money ends up being such a small percentage of the total deal size, almost all of its investors' funds go to work for them. Before any profit goes to the operating sponsor, the firm's investors must receive a full return on their capital and a 10 to 15 percent annual yield on top of that. When annual rates exceed 15 percent, the management partner that runs the buildings begins to participate in profits, on a sliding scale. If investors get, say, a 20 percent annualized return, the operating sponsor gets 20 percent of any profits on top of that. "That way," says Reese, "we align investors' interests with the operating sponsors'."  <p> DISCOUNTED BONDS. Because interest rates have gone up, a lot of high-yield bonds that were trading at 100 now trade at 70 or 80 cents on the dollar. Not all of them deserve such treatment, says Neil Dabney. Example: Trump Castle, whose bonds are trading around 50. With a coupon of 11.75 percent, the bonds' yield to maturity in 2003 is 26 percent.  <p> Dabney recommends them to his firm's clients because their prices declined precipitously on bad news. "The news on Atlantic City has been known for a year--that increased competition from Philadelphia gambling may hurt business," he says. "All of a sudden, the herd woke up, panicked about gaming in Pennsylvania, and got out."Why do the bonds look good? Pennsylvania gaming is no sure thing; it may come to ballot and be voted down, as happened last November in Florida. Even if gaming comes to Pennsylvania, Dabney believesthe Trump Castle bonds will recover from current levels if only because investor selling has been so overdone. Meanwhile, an almost 12 percent coupon, translating to a 23 percent current yield, is hard to beat.  <p> BACK-END EQUITIES. <a name="NASD:CITI"></a><b>Citicasters</b>, a TV-and radio-station company that has come out of bankruptcy, is another Dabney/ Resnick idea. The firm recommended Citicasters to clients last June when nobody on Wall Street followed the company; its stock--known as a back-end equity--was then trading around $18 a share. Now, First Boston is publishing favorable reports on Citicasters and the stock is around $22.  <p> Back-end equities, so-called because they come out of the end of a bankruptcy proceeding, can be good propositions because they're usually unfollowed by Wall Street and unloved by investors. Citicasters used to be known as Great American Communications, a company acquired by financier Carl Lindner in 1986. Enormous debt forced the company into bankruptcy negotiations in 1992. While there, it sold assets, turned a lot of its debt into equity, and reduced its borrowings from $640 million to $120 million. Most radio-station companies trade at 10 to 11 times broadcast cash flow; Citicasters trades at 7.5 times. For this reason, and because advertising at radio stations is up some 14 percent this year, the shares could trade between $30 and $34 per share in 18 months.  <p> SHORT-SELLING AS AN EQUITY HEDGE. The folks at Trilling Partners are well acquainted with the perils of short-selling; that's why they've spent the past ten years honing a system that limits the downsides in shorting while allowing for plenty of profits. "You can't let your ego get in the way about being right on a short," says Trilling. "You've got to have hard-and-fast rulesto limit your losses." Such as? If a stock goes against Trilling by 20 percent, he'll eliminate his position or buy equal amounts of the stock to "box" his trade. "Years when my performance was hurt were when I didn't protect myself from overzealous bulls," he says.  <p> Trilling's short and long picks are his own, not Paine Webber's. On the short side, he looks for stocks brought public by underwriters with a history of launching troubled deals; he also hunts for what he calls incongruities. These may include companies in an industry underwritten by firms with no expertise in a particular area or turnover in management just before an offering. "A company called Education Alternatives had a chief financial officer in its preliminary prospectus but no CFO in its final offering statement," Trilling says. "That looked suspicious." For this and other reasons,Trilling's clients began shorting Education Alternatives; the stock hit $48 in 1992 and is now $18.  <p> Trilling won't short a stock unless he can identify a trigger event that will force it to decline by 50 percent within 18 months. This makes him an "investing short" rather than a "trading short" and has helped protect his clients from the whipsaws experienced by other short-sellers in what has been a mighty dicey market. <p> Just over a decade ago, big firms were much more involved in offering private deals to investors than they are today. Oppenheimer & Co. and <a name="NYSE:BSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10191"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bear Stearns</b></a> were two of the key players in the field, raising money among investors in private placements. But as with many investments in the early '80s, these deals were driven by the need to reduce investors' taxes, not by especially promising returns. As a result, all manner of questionable real estate, equipment leasing, and oil and gas investments were created. Most ended up causing clients and firms big losses.  <p> This time around, things are different. The investment opportunities are genuine, not tax tricks. Best of all, smaller investors are no longer excluded.  <p>
