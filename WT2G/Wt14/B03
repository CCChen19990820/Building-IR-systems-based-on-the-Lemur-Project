					<font size=4>
						<br>The government has set up a number of Web sites which may be of great use to the 'Net-surfing investor. What's more, these sites tend to be clearly laid out, easy-to-use, and chock full of really useful content.<p>
Though not a source of direct investor information, the <a href="http://www.house.gov/armey.flattax/">The Flat Tax Home Page</a href> site, sponsored by Republican Congressman from Texas, Dick Armey, is worth a passing look for the true capitalist. In a few clear paragraphs and links, the Flat Tax site describes the crisis we face ("Our government is too big, and it spends, taxes, and regulates too much."), piquantly criticizes our current system of taxation ("perhaps the greatest ball-and-chain on America's freedom and prosperity"), and proposes a 17 percent flat tax "so simple [that] Americans can file their taxes on a form the size of a postcard." No kidding; the site shows a sample flat tax return form. Its brevity makes it look like a joke, but it ain't. The site also features links to the Constitution and Declaration of Independence. <p>
Another great source of Web info from the feds may be found at the <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) World Wide Web Home Page</a href>. The FDIC was established in 1933 to insure bank deposits and thereby "maintain stability and public confidence in the nation's banking system." The FDIC Web site, in addition to providing a range of information resources for the individual banking consumer, gives good, clear statistics on the state of the U.S. banking industry. These stats may be helpful for the investors following the banking sector, or as an indicator of the nation's overall economic status.<p>
The <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a href> has also set up a useful and easy-to-navigate Web site. The FTC is the government's main watchdog for unfair commercial practices. The site recently featured information on how to avoid being drawn in by pyramid marketing scams, phony scholarship hawkers, and specious "wealth-building" rackets in real estate. Link to the government's <a href="http://www.financenet.gov/">FinanceNet</a href> page for a summary of how various agencies are spending your tax dollars.<p>
You know all those public information brochures that emanate mysteriously from Pueblo, Colorado? Well, they come from the <a href="http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/">Consumer Information Center</a href>, which now has its own Web site. This comprehensive clearinghouse of consumer info documents--most of which are either cheap, free and/or online--has a lot of useful stuff for the would-be investor. Click on the "money" button to see documents on how to invest in Treasury securities, how to choose a broker, and how to avoid investment swindles. You might spend hours at this site looking at communiques on everything from credit cards to funerals. Oddly, there's even a rather thorough chronology of the U.S. Civil War! <p>
Perhaps the most useful source of macroeconomic data may be found at the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a href> (BLS) Web site.  Click around the site for "economy at a glance," which gives key indicators like statistics on unemployment, earnings, productivity, and regional labor market data. Nifty lime-green maps pop up to accompany regional data. The BLS page is also a good place to get consumer price index (that is, inflation) data.<p>
No investor will want to surf the Web without at least glancing at the home page of the SEC--<a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities & Exchange Commission</a href>. Novice investors will want to click on "What Every Investor Should Know," while the EDGAR Database of Corporate Information will be useful to newcomers and wizened market players alike. The "Investor Education and Assistance" area contains an array of useful items. Would-be Warren Buffetts may access dense, full-text filings at a click.<p>
The <a href="http://www.occ.treas.gov/">Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)</a href> has a multifacteed site on the Web. For those brave few who invest in derivatives, the OCC site offers a good overview of the derivatives market, though it's best if you're familiar with some of the derivative market jargon before diving in here.

						<br>Most of the major securities exchanges have set up Web sites. These are often good places for the novice stockpicker to begin sifting around for investing information. Quotes, news advisories, educational areas, and abundant links are all pretty common. <p>
The New York Stock Exchange's <a href="http://www.nyse.com/">NYSE NET </a href> is more comprehensive than others and goes further in their mission to "educate and inform individuals about the capital raising process." (Click on "Visitors Center" for a look at the bustling trading floor!) Also check out the <a href="http://www.amex.com/">American Stock Exchange </a href>, and the <a href="http://www.cme.com/">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</a href>, which has a good glossary of futures and options terms (under the "About the Exchange" area).<p>
<a href="http://www.optionscentral.com/">OIC</a href> is the Web site of the Options Industry Council. The Council, which was formed in 1992, seeks to "educate brokers and investors on listed equity options" and includes five exchanges: Amex, Nysex, CBOE, Pacific Stock Exchange, and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The options world can be a confusing one so the OIC page is a useful place for newcomers to learn more.  <p>
Investors following Canadian companies should hook into the <a href="http://www.visions.com/">Canada Net Pages</a href>, which contains end-of-day quotes from the Toronto, Vancouver, Alberta, and Montreal stock exchanges (click on "Stocks & Bonds").

						<br>There are a couple of good mega-sites out there that either house or link to a vast amount of financial and business information.<p>
The <a href="http://www.cob.ohio-state.edu/~fin/">Ohio State University Department of Finance</a href> home page  not only hooks you into all the usual assortment of quotes and company profiles, it gives lots of free advice on where to go if you're engaged in advanced financial or economic research. "Couch Potato Investing" is worth a look for the less adept investor. Click into the "Financial Data Finder" to peruse the virtually limitless resources available via the Ohio State site.<p>
Canadian business journalist Mathew Ingram's <a href="http://www.want2know.com/invest/">High-Tech Investor</a href> provides quotes, news, and other predictable linkage, as well as lots of useful caveats and suggestions for the armchair security-picker. As Worth put it in <a href="/articles/Z960W02.html/">"Get There From Here"</a href> (April 1996), High-Tech leads you to a plethora of "interesting finds that many are likely to miss," such as the <a href="http://www.web.net/ethmoney/">Canadian Ethical Investment Web Site</a href>.

Knowing what to look for on a financial statement can help you spot troubles with your investment before it's too late. In Part 1, Worth walks you through three critical items--accounts receivables, inventory, and gross margins.<p>
By Jonathan Burton<p>
Had Andy Warhol worked on Wall Street, he might have predicted every stock would get 15 points of upside. Kendall Square Research, a supercomputer maker based in Waltham, Massachusetts, had its moment of glory in 1994. Between April and October, its share price nearly doubled, helped by positive earnings estimates from analysts and speculation that the company might become a high-tech star.<p>
But when Kendall Square announced in late October that it would report a third-quarter loss, the stock began a hasty retreat. The shares, which had closed at $24.25 on October 28, fell 32 percent the next day. Then, shareholders discovered that Henry Burkhardt III, Kendall Square's chief executive and founder, had dumped $1 million of his own holdings back in August. The share price kept skidding as more bad news hit: restated earnings--lower than originally 
reported--and withering revenue. By mid-April, the stock was down to $2.88 a share, and Burkhardt had departed as chief executive.<p>
The crash of this highflier shouldn't have come as a complete surprise--at least not to investors who know how to examine a company's financial reports and follow up with the right questions. As far back as August of 1993, Kendall Square's publicly available financial statements flashed a warning: The company was taking as long as five months to get paid by its customers. Shareholders could have spotted this red flag in quarterly reports and acted on it in time to avoid the beating the stock would take months later. But they had to know where to look.<p>
Trouble on a financial statement is not always easy to uncover. Some companies are better at explaining away accounting cosmetics than they are at selling their products. And not every number that raises a question is a sign of impending disaster. But the more an investor knows about how companies present their financial results, the better, and reading the public reports that companies prepare should be part of every investor's homework.<p>
Doing this doesn't require an accounting degree. A diligent investor can, in fact, gain essential information--the kind that could protect against a Kendall Square and some other recent flameouts--by concentrating on several critical lines in the public documents that any investor-relations office will mail out for free.<p>
But isn't this a job for securities analysts? Well, yes, but Wall Street doesn't catch everything--at least not right away. The Street also doesn't always say what it thinks, even if it knows. Brokerage-firm analysts are caught between a stock and a hard place. A Chinese wall theoretically separates securities analysts from the corporate-finance department, which helps companies issue new stock and debt. Supposedly, an analyst could blast a corporate-finance client with a negative report, but it doesn't happen too often. Analysts tend to dig deeper once a company or an industry has tanked, turning into investigators at the crash site who hope the morning after can offer clues about what happened and why.<p>
Yet, for obvious reasons, it's much better to ask why a stock is hot when it still is. Is its popularity sound or just a fad? Many factors can drive a stock up, but only fundamentals will keep it there.<p>
In Part 1, we'll zero in on three crucial entries in the financial statements that companies compile for Securities and Exchange Commission regulators in Washington and that current shareholders get regularly--quarterly 10-Qs and annual 10-Ks. The three lines cover accounts receivable, inventory, and gross profit margins. In Part 2, we'll take a look at three other important categories. Knowing how to interpret these items is fundamental to guarding against unexpected trouble in a stock. The flipside: Investors also can turn up buying opportunities when they discover balance sheets with strong numbers in these categories.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Accounts Receivable: The snare at Kendall Square</font></b><p>
Henry Burkhardt III was exuberant about Kendall Square Research, the supercomputer maker he started in 1986 with the backing of William Koch, millionaire yachtsman and America's Cup winner. Enthusiasm came naturally to the 49-year-old president and chief executive, who first made his name as a cofounder of Data General. His reassuring manner proved valuable when dealing with Wall Street's restless stable of stock analysts and investors. But on a cloudy day last August at the company's headquarters outside Boston, Burkhardt didn't have to sell anyone; Wall Street had done that for him. Analysts saw the company earning 45 to 50 cents a share in 1993, eclipsing 1992's $1.22-a-share loss. Revenues would nearly triple, to $60 million, they felt. They forecast a third-quarter profit of between 8 cents and 13 cents a share.<p>
Was Burkhardt comfortable with these estimates? A Wall Street Journal reporter asked him that in an August 12 interview.<p>
"Quite comfortable," Burkhardt replied. The next day, Kendall Square's stock spiked up 75 cents a share to $19.75.<p>
Nevertheless, a glance at Kendall Square's quarterly Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended June 26 would have revealed a disquieting element in this scene. It could be found on a single line on the balance sheet, the one that said "accounts receivable."<p>
Receivables tell how much customers owe a company. Veteran financial analyst Thornton O'glove, author of <i>Quality of Earnings</i>, says accounts receivable is a particularly important figure, one that can reveal a great deal about a company and its payment terms. "Watch it over consecutive quarters," he advises. <p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Computer maker Kendall Square Research showed this big jump in accounts receivable--a troubling sign.</font></b><p>
The same day Burkhardt was meeting with the Journal reporter, Nasdaq officials received Kendall Square's second-quarter filing. It showed that the company's accounts receivable had jumped 57 percent in the first six months of the year, to $20.9 million from $13.3 million. The increase was partly explained by the fact that the company's reported sales, or revenue, had also risen sharply. (These numbers looked even gloomier when they were later restated by the company. But for the purposes of this article, we want to focus on information available to shareholders at the time.)<p>
In addition to telling how much the company expects to collect from its customers, however, receivables reveal another important thing: how long the company is waiting to get paid. Investors can make this calculation through a two-step process. First, divide revenue by the number of days in the period. Then, divide the amount listed for receivables by this result. In Kendall Square's case, this calculation would have shown that the company was sending out bills and then waiting an average of 154 days to get paid--about five months.<p>
Faced with that answer, an investor might want to ask a few questions: Are customers disappointed in the product? Is the sales force extending payment schedules in an effort to inflate revenue? <p>
Michael Murphy, who as editor of the Overpriced Stock Service newsletter in Half Moon Bay, California, earns a living watching such things, says companies show this kind of patience with customers for only two reasons: "Either the product's not working, or the company has granted the customer extraordinary terms." Leniency, he says, lets some companies "maintain their revenue-growth pattern so Wall Street will keep their stock up." <p>
Kendall Square did have more to say on the subject in the June 1993 10-Q, attributing its growing receivables in part to "the granting of extended payment terms to certain customers." The company declined to answer further questions from Worth about its receivables, saying that officers familiar with the issue have left the company and are not available for comment. <p>
Allowing receivables to build is not uncommon among aggressive, expanding companies like Kendall Square. Also, receivables may fluctuate more at a company that sells relatively few big-ticket products, like supercomputers--because a single sale may represent as much as 5 percent of revenue.<p>
Still, an investor who notices that a company is taking a long time to get paid has reason to be wary and should investigate further. Is the company managing its credit well? What do customers and competitors think of the company's products? Are soft credit terms an attempt to make up for prices that are too high? Rising receivables are an especially important red flag for companies that sell products based on rapidly evolving technology or fast-moving fashion. For these reasons, receivables always merit close scrutiny.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Inventories: Riding the Merry-Go-Round</font></b><p>
Merry-Go-Round Enterprises, the clothing retailer for dedicated followers of young men's and women's fashion, was looking natty as a company. It was March of last year, and the Joppa, Maryland-based outfit had just announced the acquisition of Chess King, a rival clothing chain, a move that would give it the biggest share of the young -men's clothing market. Merry-Go-Round told brokerage-firm analysts that the purchase would add $13 million, or 15 cents a share, to profits for the year. So some Wall Street analysts raised their earnings estimates for Merry-Go-Round. <p>
The company's stock rose $2.25, or 15 percent, to $17 on the day of the Chess King news. Merry-Go-Round was hot--$100 of its stock in January 1988 was worth $804 five years later. Last year, the chain owned 1,460 stores in 44 states, mostly under the Cignal, Chess King, and Merry-Go-Round names.<p>
But Merry-Go-Round spun out. The company lost $544,000 in the first six months of 1993, compared with earnings of $13.5 million in the first half of 1992. Last fall, Leonard "Boogie" Weinglass, Merry-Go-Round's flamboyant founder and chairman, who started the company in 1968, boarded up his Merry-Go-Ranch in Aspen, Colorado, and returned to management after a 12-year hiatus. But the ponytailed, shirtsleeved entrepreneur--the inspiration for the character Boogie in the movie Diner--couldn't save his company from bankruptcy. In January of this year, the company filed for Chapter 11 protection in Baltimore. Shares crumbled below $3. <p>
Was there any advance warning of all this? In Merry-Go-Round's annual report for the fiscal year ended January 30, one balance sheet item in particular stands out: "merchandise inventories." Inventory is unsold goods and considered an asset. As a rule, inventories should rise in tandem with sales. If inventories rise faster, it may be because the goods simply aren't selling. This is particularly true of companies in faddish or seasonal businesses--Merry-Go-Round's world.<p>
<p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>Inventories at fashion retailer Merry-Go-Round grew substantially in fiscal 1993. The annual report was a warning.</font></b><p>
The company's report showed that inventories on January 30 were $82.2 million, up 37 percent from $60 million a year earlier. That's well above the 15 percent sales growth in the same period, to $877.5 million from $761.2 million. This alone should have been a major cause for concern. It indicated the company's goods simply weren't selling as rapidly as it expected, causing its inventories to bulge. <p>
Merry-Go-Round officials don't see it that way. At that time, "the company was doing quite well," says a Merry-Go-Round spokesman. "We were anticipating additional stores and additional growth." But the spokesman also acknowledges that the company "bought for expected sales that did not develop."<p>
The inventory problem was more obvious a quarter later. Merry-Go-Round's May 1, 1993, 10-Q showed a 48 percent increase in inventories over its January 30 level and a 49 percent rise over the level a year earlier. Sales over the year, however, had gone up just 8.5 percent. <p>
Publicly available financial statements had confirmed a trend, but not the kind that Merry-Go-Round usually set. In the case of a retailer, an investor who spots rising inventories might consider a little field research. A trip to a store might provide some clues. Are customers buying? Is the merchandise on sale? With other kinds of companies, checking out the trade magazines may help, especially those issues that rate products against each other. If the quality, features, or price of a company's product are coming in for criticism, then the cause of rising inventories isn't exactly a mystery. <p>
<p><a name="SUB5"><b><font size=+1>GROSS MARGINS: The worm in the Apple</font></b><p>
War came to the personal-computer industry in June 1992, and prices of machines soon were dropping to bargain levels. <a name="NASD:APPL"></a><b>Apple Computer</b> watched this battle from its base in Cupertino, California, feeling reasonably confident that the war would have a much greater impact on <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> and the makers of IBM clones. Apple considered itself special, out of the fray. Consumers readily paid a premium for its products. <p>
But Apple wasn't as safe as it thought. Given a chance to buy less-expensive IBM-style machines, customers balked at high-ticket Apples. The uprising forced Apple to cut prices for its signature Macintosh computers. <p>
Shareholders, confident that Apple could withstand any challenge, remained loyal even when customers weren't. On June 1, 1993, Apple's stock closed at $57 a share, not far off its 52-week high of $65.25. Yet eight days later, when Apple said its earnings for the rest of the year would be lower than predicted, Wall Street finally pulled the plug. <p>
By the end of June, Apple's stock had lost almost one third of its value. In mid-July the company posted its first quarterly loss in two years--a bigger-than-expected $188.3 million shortfall. By then, shares had fallen to $27.50 each.<p>
Under normal conditions Apple might have offset the premium loss with aggressive cost cutting. But the PC wars had become so intense that Apple was being forced to lower prices faster than it could trim expenses.<p>
The result: A textbook case of shrinking gross margins. This was evident on Apple's financial report for the quarter ended on March 26, 1993--and made publicly available about two months before the stock began its spectacular decline.<p>
Gross margin is a standard measure of corporate health. It shows how much of a company's revenue is left over after manufacturing costs are subtracted. What remains is partly eaten by salaries, advertising, taxes, and other expenses as it sinks to the bottom line to become earnings, the kind of profit that investors care most about. Gross margins will often shrink if the company's cost of making its products goes up or if a company has to cut prices. Other things, like product mix, can also affect gross margins.<p>
<p><a name="SUB6"><b><font size=+1>Apple Computer was a surprise casualty of the PC wars, but rising costs and slow sales should have been a tip-off.</font></b><p>
But price cutting was what was happening to Apple, as its March 1993 10-Q showed. "I should have seen it," grumbles Michael Murphy, editor of the Overpriced Stock Service newsletter. "I looked at it and said, 'Well, they do have to get more aggressive about following these prices down,' but I didn't think they'd have to give up the premium." <p>
Apple's March 1993 10-Q showed revenues of $3.97 billion for the first half of its fiscal year versus $3.58 billion the year before, a gain of 11 percent. Directly beneath net sales, under the heading "costs and expenses," is the line "cost of sales." This shows what the company spent on materials and equipment to produce the goods it sold. Apple in this six-month period earmarked $2.4 billion to generate sales of $4 billion. The difference is the gross margin. 
The quick approach is to figure gross margin as a percentage of sales. To do this, subtract cost of sales from net sales, then divide by net sales. In Apple's case, the result is 40 percent--the gross margin as a percentage of sales for the first half. <p>
How did this compare with the company's gross margin a year before? A right-hand column gives matching figures for the six months ended March 27, 1992. Then, Apple's sales were $3.58 billion, and cost of sales was $2 billion. Using the same calculation as before shows a gross margin as a percentage of sales of 44 percent.<p>
The drop in Apple's gross margin as a percentage of sales alone wasn't a reason to dump the stock. But it did signal danger. William Slakey, director of investor relations at Apple, says that at the time, Apple gave up its price advantage to lift sales. "We altered our pricing strategy accordingly, and it did impact our gross margins," Slakey said. <p>
Indeed, sometimes a company will deliberately squeeze margins and lower prices in an effort to build market share. Apple set this goal, and for a time it worked. But this strategy succeeds only if costs come down, too. Investors who see this happening need to know whether the company plans to do anything to trim expenses or whether it expects increasing sales to offset the price cutting. Unless one of those things happens, the bottom line will suffer, with the stock price not far behind. At the end of the day, it's more important to make a buck than to make a sale. <p>
Sometimes, of course, financial deceit is so polished that even the most cynical analysts are duped. Reading financial statements isn't a certain defense against outright corporate fraud. If management is determined to lie, investors who read the financials won't catch it.<p>
But that's the uncommon case. More often, stocks fall because managers make business mistakes--mistakes that leave tracks in their corporate disclosures. Spotting the tracks is not a command to dump the stock and run. It is, however, a strong signal to telephone the company, its competitors, and its vendors with pointed questions, and to check on management by reading the annual proxy statement and news coverage. Then a decision to hold or fold can be an informed decision. Otherwise, investors will find that from a certain trusting distance, drowning and swimming look remarkably alike. <p>
In DUE DILIGENCE, Part 2: Even audited financial numbers can hide a host of troubles. Worth focuses on three critical items in a company's financial statement: quality of earnings, depreciation, and expenses.

						Even audited financial numbers can hide a host of troubles from the sharpest accountants. Here's how to evaluate three critical items--quality of earnings, depreciation, and expenses.<p>
By Jonathan Burton<p>
The infamous accounting high jinks that took place at a company called MiniScribe back in the late 1980s fooled even the sharpest of accountants. The computer-diskdrive maker, run by Quentin Thomas Wiles, a well-known turnaround artist, appeared to be flying high in 1987. With the company racking up record sales and earnings, the stock reached an all-time peak of $18.25 a share in May of that year.<p>
Unfortunately, MiniScribe's books were a complete fiction. As detailed in a 1991 complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company had counted unsold product as revenue. Employees had even gone so far as to place bricks in cardboard cartons and ship them as finished disk drives. In 1988, MiniScribe's directors, alarmed by the company's mounting accounts receivables and inventories, launched an investigation. After they discovered the ruse, Wiles resigned. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1990. By then, the company's stock had dropped to 25 cents a share.<p>
As the MiniScribe case shows, even audited financial numbers don't always mean what they seem to mean. But that's no excuse for tossing out your calculator, either. Although it isn't possible to catch everything, investors should still closely examine the public financial data that companies publish. Important signals are often there to be spotted. Are earnings as strong as the company has been boasting? Will the trend continue? Or are there unexpected land mines on the road ahead?<p>
In Part 1 of "Due Diligence," Worth reviewed three lines on a financial statement that help answer these questions--accounts receivables, inventory, and gross margin. We also gave examples to show how an investor who knew what to look for could uncover trouble before it was too late. This month, we return to the subject by dissecting three other important items: expenses, quality of earnings, and depreciation. Understanding all six items should provide a solid start for any investor who wants to perform due diligence on a stock. The payoff is often well worth it, as the following examples show.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Expenses: The inner Chambers</font></b><p>
As the decade began, Chambers Development had all the clear markings of a stock to own for the '90s. In 1991, the developer and operator of landfills, based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, reported that earnings rose 45 percent, to $49.9 million, or 83 cents a share. Net sales approached $322 million, a tenfold increase from just five years earlier. This growth was powered by the acquisition and rapid development of new landfills.<p>
Wall Street did not let this performance go unnoticed. Brokerage-firm analysts widely recommended the company through most of the year, and its stock began to rise in price, leaping from $16.13 in January 1991 to $37 a year later. Yet, on March 17, 1992, in a tersely worded statement, Chambers revealed that its profit growth had been overstated. As it turned out, the highly profitable company was not so profitable after all. In October 1992 Chambers restated income for 1991 and several prior years, wiping out $362 million in earnings and retained earnings.<p>
What happened? The rapidly expanding company had been spending money to buy and develop land for future landfills and had recorded the costs as capital expenses. In other words, it treated these costs as money spent to create long-lived assets. That had the effect of pushing a substantial portion of these expenses into the future, rather than treating them as current costs to be charged against income.<p>
This can be a murky area in accounting. Typically, companies and accountants say that anything that is used up in a period is an expense that should be deducted immediately from the bottom line. Nevertheless, as the stockholders of Chambers would learn, the company had been capitalizing items that clearly should have been treated as ordinary expenses, things such as, as the company's statement says, "executive administration, public affairs, and financial services." <p>
In the wake of the March 1992 disclosure, Wall Street trashed the garbage-processing company. On March 18, the price of Chambers's class A shares fell more than 60 percent, closing at $11.13 a share from $30.50 the day before. Shareholders sued, and the dust still hasn't settled. A company spokesman declined comment on the matter.<p>
Was there a way an investor could have seen this coming and jettisoned the stock before it got crunched?<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Chambers Development didn't go into much detail about its deferred costs; investors should have asked.</font></b><p>
Chambers reported in its annual statements that it capitalized costs, but all companies do that. Few companies, however, capitalize costs to the extent that Chambers did--a fact ignored in the management discussion that accompanied the company's financial statements. But there were other clues.<p>
Tucked near the bottom of Chambers's balance sheet under the heading "other assets" is a line called "deferred costs." This nebulous category is often a dumping ground for expenses that companies want to delay. "Whenever you see an asset called 'deferred anything,' hold on to your pocketbook," says Loren Kellogg, publisher of Financial Statement Alert, which analyzes companies and their accounting methods. <p>
In Chambers's report for the quarter ended September 30, 1991, filed with the SEC on November 8, deferred costs totaled $32.7 million. This number was 32 percent higher than it had been a year earlier, when deferred costs amounted to $24.8 million.<p>
Investors curious about what costs were being deferred could have found some cursory answers in a footnote to the 1990 annual report. Deferred costs, the company said, included "development costs for waste collection and security guard service contracts." It added that these expenses were being spread over three to ten years. Security-guard contracts? Remember, this is a category on the balance sheet that is supposed to describe long-lived assets. <p>
Another reason for investors to worry was the sheer size of these charges compared with Chambers's earnings, which totaled $35.3 million in the first nine months of 1991. Had the company charged the entire $32.7 million in deferred costs against current earnings, its net income would have been only $2.6 million.<p>
Moreover, Chambers's deferred expenses were rising at a rate that eclipsed the 22 percent growth in the company's revenue. This is important to note because, as Greg Drahuschak, first vice president at the Pittsburgh branch of brokerage house Janney Montgomery Scott, explains, "If the revenues don't continue, eventually you're going to have earnings difficulty because the [deferred] expenses are going to come home to roost." <p>
In a healthy company, revenue growth usually should match or surpass growth in deferred costs. If not, then the company could be understating current expenses and padding its bottom line. As long as revenue increases, a company has a good chance of keeping this ball in the air. But a dip in growth can bring the ball crashing down. No investor wants to be there when that happens.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Quality of Earnings: The lesson of Education Alternatives</font></b><p>
In July 1992, the Baltimore City school District took a radical step in an effort to revive eight of its public elementary schools and one middle school. It hired <a name="NASD:EAIN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16075"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Education Alternatives</b></a>, a young Minneapolis-based company, to manage them. Under the five-year contract, the school board agreed to pay the company what it would have spent to run the schools--$27 million per year, or about $5,550 for each child enrolled. In return, the company promised to spruce up the schools, cut class sizes, and improve teaching methods. Profits, the company claimed, would come from the efficiencies it could bring to public education.<p>
At the time, Wall Street viewed Education Alternatives as a company poised to ride a crest of civic displeasure over public schools. The company itself certainly didn't discourage this view. "The potential for the future success of Education Alternatives continues to be phenomenal," chairman and chief executive John Golle wrote shareholders in the company's 1993 annual report. <p>
This optimism, incidentally, was also reflected in a story in Worth's December 1993 issue. "EAI is a good long-term speculative buy," we wrote in an article about companies that promise to improve the world.<p>
The company's financial statements also painted a rosy picture. For its fiscal year ended June 1993, Education Alternatives reported earnings of $1.1 million, or 18 cents a share, against a loss of $1.5 million a year earlier. In response, investors bid up shares last November to a 52-week high of $48.75. At that lofty price, the company had a market value of more than $300 million.<p>
Then the bottom dropped out. This spring, the price of Education Alternatives stock plummeted, falling to as low as $9.75 a share before rebounding to around $15 a share in mid-May. <p>
Despite the suddenness of this drop, investors who had continued reading Education Alternatives' financial statements could have seen the roller-coaster ride coming before it was too late.<p>
Keep in mind that a stock's price, especially the price of a share in a young, hot growth company, is influenced more than anything else by its earnings and expected earnings. Investors need to know not only the amount of the earnings, but also where they are coming from and how reliable they are. <p>
On November 15, 1993, Education Alternatives filed its quarterly report for the period ended September 30, 1993 with the SEC. Among other things, this document disclosed that the company had earned $330,000, or 4 cents a share. This was a sharp reversal from a year-earlier loss of $186,000. But an investor who probed just a little further could have discovered that the day-to-day operations of Education Alternatives were still actually losing money--to the tune of $383,000 during the quarter. This number was listed under the line "operating loss" in the company's financial statements.<p>
<p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>Education Alternatives showed an operating loss, offset by income from other sources.</font></b><p>
So how was it that Education Alternatives had been able to report a profit? Looking at a section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" would have revealed that Education Alternatives had received $728,000 in investment income from the proceeds of a May 1993 public stock offering. In other words, its profit had come largely from investors--not as the result of any improvement in its operations.<p>
In the absence of any earnings from operations, an investor might wisely ask whether the company's high stock price was justified on other grounds, such as revenue growth. But here, again, there was reason to suspect that Wall Street had overvalued Education Alternatives.<p>
Yes, the company had signed service contracts for big numbers like $27 million. But a $27 million service contract isn't the same as $27 million of revenue generated by a company selling a product. For one thing, a service contract can be canceled on short notice--90 days in the case of Education Alternatives' arrangement with the Baltimore schools. For another, Education Alternatives was passing most of this revenue on to pay such things as salaries for teachers previously paid by the school system. It could count this money on its own books, but it wasn't as if the company had actually done something to create this revenue. The teachers, still technically employees of the school system, were the ones doing that. "That's not revenue," contends Howard Schilit, an accounting professor at American University and author of Financial Shenanigans: How to Detect Accounting Gimmicks and Fraud in Financial Reports. "Revenue is what they earn by providing their consulting service."<p>
Education Alternatives may yet become a major force in an emerging new industry, charged with reforming the nation's public schools. But Wall Street clearly jumped the gun on the company's stock, bidding it up to heights justified by neither the company's earnings--of which there were none--nor its revenue growth--which was less substantial than it appeared to be.<p>
The lesson: When it comes to earnings, understand how a company is counting its chickens. If the bulk of its net income is from sources other than the business itself, the company should be asked how it plans to turn this onetime gain into long-term performance. If the bulk of the revenue could disappear when a single customer walks out the door, an investor needs to decide how that risk should be figured into the price of the stock. If the company counts revenue differently from the typical company, an investor should ask hard questions about why. If a company can't provide convincing answers, it's probably because there aren't any.<p>
<p><a name="SUB5"><b><font size=+1>Depreciation: A distorted image for American Shared</font></b><p>
Why buy when you can rent? That was the premise behind an innovative San Franciscobased company called American Shared Hospital Services: Offer mobile magnetic-resonance-imaging machines and other diagnostic equipment on a shared basis. Doctors and hospitals rushed to sign up. In 1990 total revenues hit $61.5 million, up from $42.1 million two years before.<p>
Finally, the company, which had gone public in 1984, looked ready to soar. True, a $30 million junk-bond offering in 1988, done with the help of financier Michael Milken, had increased its debt load. And losses in 1989 and 1990 reached a combined $6.3 million. But 1990's revenue growth made it look like the company's risky bet might be on the verge of paying off.<p>
The third quarter of 1991 brought another positive sign. The company had earned a profit, reporting a net income of $30,000, or 1 cent a share. The one analyst who ventured a prediction at the time, according to Institutional Brokers Estimate System, forecast per-share earnings of a penny in 1991 and 20 cents in 1992. By October, the stock had risen to $5.13 a share from $1.63 in January 1991. In February 1992, it was at $9.63 a share. <p>
The company's 1991 10-K (the "annual report" filed with the SEC), publicly available at the end of March 1992, reported that American Shared had earned nearly $2 million, or 70 cents a share, in 1991. That was certainly good news. Yet in the same report, management declared "substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern." Once that bit of information was digested, it's surprising only that the stock didn't sink faster. It ended 1992 at $3 a share. Recently, the shares traded at 69 cents.<p>
Once more, it's time for us to say that investors could have seen all this coming. The tipoff appeared in an earlier financial statement prepared by the company: its September 30, 1991, quarterly report. The critical item: "Depreciation and amortization." <p>
When a business acquires inventory, property, or a piece of equipment, it books the item on the balance sheet as an asset. The company then depreciates the cost of this asset over the number of years the item is expected to maintain its value. Thus, a $10,000 car with a useful life of five years would be depreciated annually at $2,000. Each $2,000 would be charged as an expense --deducted from total income. And each year, the car's value as an asset would decline accordingly on the balance sheet.<p>
But depreciation is another one of those accounting areas that comes only in shades of gray. What is the useful life of an asset? A company that writes off the cost of an asset over a longer horizon is trading a current hit to earnings for a future one. If a company assumes a $10,000 car will last 10 years, for example, then it deducts a depreciation expense of only $1,000 every year for 10 years. Conservative companies generally depreciate assets faster than average. <p>
<p><a name="SUB6"><b><font size=+1>Lower quarterly depreciation expenses at American Shared Hospital Services spoke to internal troubles.</font></b><p>
Note this: Changing depreciation accounting in midstream can radically alter a company's financials. And that's exactly what <a name="AMEX:AMS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11714"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Shared</b></a> did in 1991. In fact, this change in how it handled depreciation was equivalent to 80 percent of its $2 million profit for the year.<p>
The company's September 30, 1991, quarterly report provided the tipoff that the company had decided to make this move. It showed a 12 percent decline in depreciation expense for the third quarter. This was a bright red flag.<p>
In a note accompanying the financials, management explained that certain of its MRI units were now being written off more slowly. Management, however, did not spell out the change or how it had affected net earnings. This omission itself should have raised another red flag. The company had actually decided that equipment formerly depreciated over five years would now be expensed over seven and eight years.<p>
American Shared, though silent about this back then, now defends the change as being simply prudent. "As we reviewed our depreciation policies, it became apparent to us that we were depreciating the equipment too quickly, and it was realistic to depreciate them over a longer life," says Richard Magary, a company spokesman. "It wasn't done to change earnings; it was done to more appropriately express the life of the equipment."<p>
But a former company insider tells the story a bit differently. "The real reason for lengthening depreciation was so they would not be in default with the bondholders," he says. And indeed, the company's 10-K covering all of 1991 credits the accounting change as helping boost stockholders' equity to a point just above the minimum net worth needed to satisfy creditors. The accounting change didn't keep American Shared above the minimum for long. A 1994 reorganization plan would give bondholders effective control.<p>
Depreciation is one of the easiest places for a company to turn when it needs a boost to earnings or balance-sheet assets. Any change in depreciation accounting will add a onetime gain to net earnings. Most companies list that gain as an "extraordinary item," although American Shared did not. Sometimes, such moves are completely justified. But management should be able to make a good case. A change in depreciation may mask deeper problems in the business. If so, investors will soon find one of their own assets unexpectedly depreciating--their stock.<p>
Before MiniScribe tossed a brick at his reputation, Quentin Wiles told an interviewer for California Business how he came to be known as Dr. Fix-It, a miracle worker raising sick high-tech companies from the dead.<p>
"Most entrepreneurs can't tell when their companies are getting in too deep," he said. "I don't blame them. After all, you have to be somewhat of an egomaniac to start a company."<p>
In ways, though they wouldn't want to admit it, shareholders have similar qualities. They believe in something--a rumor, a perception, a hunch--and they lay their money down. After that, they often close their eyes and go to sleep, only waking up when a noisy decline in the stock's price alerts them that something has gone wrong. That's no way to be the part owner of a business.<p>
Reading the financial statements won't always help an investor spot trouble. Some disasters just can't be dodged. But making money in the stock market is hard enough. Why not use the tools that are available?

						How much are you paying to share in a company's profits? Use the price-to-earnings to evaluate a stock's value.<p>
By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>
If asked to select just one tool for evaluating a stock, most securities analysts undoubtedly would choose the price-to-earnings ratio--the number you get by dividing a company's share price by its profit or net income per share.<p>
The p/e, also known as the multiple, gives investors a single number that allows them to compare the values of stock prices. The higher a stock's p/e, the more investors are paying to share in that company's profits.<p>
Price-to-earnings ratios are driven, to a large degree, by earnings expectations. If investors are highly confident a company will improve its profitability or remain profitable, they are usually willing to pay more for its shares, raising the p/e. If profits are threatened or weak, the p/e will probably drop as investors demand compensation for the risk of disappointing returns.<p>
Price-to-earnings ratios also depend on how stocks compare with other investment opportunities. For instance, p/e's generally fall when interest rates rise, because bonds, CDs, and other fixed-income investments yield more and so become more attractive.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Different p/e ratios can tell you actual, estimated, or forward results.</font></b><p>
Analysts use different p/e ratios to gauge a company's prospects. There's trailing p/e, which is the stock's current price divided by the company's reported earnings per share for the most recent four quarters. This is the most widely quoted figure in newspaper stock listings. It reflects actual results, as opposed to estimated, or forward, p/e, which is arrived at by dividing a stock's current price by analysts' forecasts of earnings per share for the next four quarters.<p>
These two numbers may vary widely. Consider the current share price of <a name="NASD:OXHP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15344"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oxford Health Plans</b></a>, a managed-care company in Darien, Connecticut. Based on trailing earnings for the year ending 1994, this company has a p/e of 54, compared with 17 for the average stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. The stock's forward p/e, however, is 35. Is the stock way overpriced, slightly ahead of itself, or accurately priced? Often, the answer depends largely on the attitude of the analyst or investor toward Oxford's prospects. The forward p/e is often used by brokers pushing a particular stock.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Looking for a cheapie--check out a stock's relative p/e.</font></b><p>
The price-to-earnings ratio also allows an investor to analyze a stock's valuation on a historical basis. Divide the stock's p/e by the p/e of the overall market; that's the relative p/e. Compare this with the stock's relative p/e over the past five to ten years. When a stock is trading below its historical relative p/e, that's often a sign that it's a cheap buy.<p>
Rick Pucci, director of research for IBES, a stock-research firm in New York City, says, "Investors can get a more accurate gauge of how expensive a particular stock is by comparing its p/e with that of other similar companies in the same industry." Also, Pucci notes, "for cyclical companies, there's the opposite effect." Such firms--producers of machine tools, cars, and steel--generally reach their highest p/e's when earnings have struck bottom and investors believe the business cycle is about to turn around, raising profits. <p>

						Is your latest stock hunch genius or garbage? The numbers and charts of the technician can help you make the call. In this installment (the first of two), Worth looks at the tools of the trade and how techies use them.<p>
By Jonathan Butler<p>
What to buy, when to buy it, and when to sell it--these are the basic questions facing every investor. The pros have two answers: fundamental and technical analysis.<p>
Fundamentalists scrutinize balance sheets, talk to chief financial officers, and evaluate product lines to predict a company's performance and, by extension, its stock price. Technicians, on the other hand, don't care whether a company builds cars or roasts coffee or whether its bottom line is red or black. Instead, they use historical statistics of investor supply and demand to extrapolate future stock-price patterns. "I can put my feet up on my desk while all the analysts are out there digging away because I don't need to know what the story is," says Justin Mamis, chief market technician at Hancock Institutional Equity Services in New York. "All I care about is how people feel about those particular stocks as shown by their putting money in and taking their money out."<p>
Few people are as faithful to a single approach; most market professionals use both fundamental and technical analysis daily and recommend that amateurs do the same. "The individual has to use them both in common," says Edward Nicoski, director of technical research at Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. "Because the market is an anticipatory device, you're typically going to see the turns in stocks more quickly looking at charts than by being a fundamentalist and reading the front page. However, if there's really something fundamentally wrong that nobody knows about yet, the chart's not going to help you."<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>You don't need to pick the absolute highs and lows to make a lot of money.</font></b><p>
Entire books have been written on the subject of technical analysis, and some people spend their lives learning the trade, but there is a basic core of information and tools--accessible and intelligible to the individual stock picker and 401(k) participant--that no investor should be without.<p>
Technical analysis dates back to the rice markets of 17th-century Japan. It tries to reduce the apparently random character of markets to statistical patterns predictive of future price trends among individual stocks, industry sectors, and market averages (it also applies in other markets, such as bonds, currencies, and commodities). The technician's premise, say Robert D. Edwards and John Magee in Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, the industry's bible, is that "prices move in trends and trends tend to continue until something happens to change the supply-demand balance."<p>
While the ultimate goal of technical analysis is to identify changes in the direction of stocks, Mamis notes that investors don't need to pick the absolute highs and lows to make a lot of money. "If you've made a Faustian pact with the devil to get out within 10 percent of the high all the time, that's all you need," he says.<p>
CHART WORSHIP
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Line, bar, and point-and-figure charts are the tools of the trade. But don't ignore the big picture.</font></b><p>
The technician's most important tool is the chart, which allows him or her to identify trends and patterns in a single stock or average, as well as to compare the two. There are three ways to graphically represent stock-price movement. The familiar line chart uses one number--usually the closing price-- to reflect the day's price movement. The bar chart, perhaps the most frequently used, shows the high, low, and closing prices within a given time frame, usually a day, week, or month. Most bar charts also include corresponding trading volumes along the bottom.<p>
Both of these charts plot the price at specific time intervals, whether or not prices have changed. The third type of chart, the point-and-figure chart, records a price only when it fluctuates by a predetermined amount, usually one point or more. Upward movements are plotted using the letter x, while downward movements are denoted by the letter o. This is a good way to track price momentum, but since point-and-figure charts disregard time and volume and are difficult to interpret, professionals recommend that amateur investors focus on lines and bars.<p>
In deciding to buy or sell a specific stock, technicians attempt first to fathom the big picture by assessing market sentiment and momentum. One key statistic they look at is the put-to-call ratio, which divides the number of puts (options to sell an asset at a specified price by a certain date) by the number of calls (options to buy an asset at a specified price by a certain date). Because a put is a bet that the underlying security will decline in price and a call a bet that it will rise, a low put-to-call ratio means that the consensus is optimistic--a negative sign for a contrarian. A high put-to-call ratio shows that the consensus is negative--a signal to start buying. Because calls typically outnumber puts, the ratio averages well below 1, usually around 0.8. Small fluctuations from this norm are not important, warns James Stack of InvesTech Research in Whitefish, Montana. "It's only meaningful when it's at an extreme reading," he says. This means a ratio below 0.7 or above 0.9.<p>
Another key measure of market psychology is the advisory-sentiment index, issued weekly by Investors Intelligence and available in Barron's and Investor's Business Daily, as well as in Worth (see Market Radar in the Need to Know section). The contrarian principle applies to this index as well: Last December, for example, before the recent market run-up, 59 percent of managers surveyed were pessimistic, the most negative reading in 13 years. Like the put-to-call ratio, advisory sentiment is most significant at extremes, particularly when the pessimistic reading is above 55 percent.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Look for key signals that the trend is going to change. If the army's out of step, watch out.</font></b><p>
Next there is the question of market breadth. A rise in the Dow could be driven by a big jump in one or two major stocks, masking small declines in many other stocks. An investor needs to understand the underlying stock movement in an index because, as Martin J. Pring writes in Technical Analysis Explained, "generally speaking, the fewer the number of issues that are moving in the direction of the major averages, the greater the probability of an imminent reversal in trend."<p>
To get an idea of the breadth of a market move, there are two important indicators. The first is the advance/decline line, which tracks the number of stocks advancing over a given period (usually one day) minus the number of stocks declining. Since this measure includes thousands of stocks, depending on the market, it gives a more detailed picture than does a particular index, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks only 30 stocks.<p>
What technicians worry about is divergence, when a market average is going one way and the advance/decline line the other. Alan R. Shaw, technical research manager at Smith Barney and author of the section on technical analysis in the Financial Analyst's Handbook, sees this relation in military terms. "As long as the army [the overall market] stays in step with the generals (e.g., the Dow industrials), then the trend, by definition, is healthy and should sustain," he writes. "It's when the army shows signs of retreating that the technician becomes concerned about the viability of the underlying trend."<p>
<p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>Don't be fooled by mixed signals. Connect the dots for a clear picture.</font></b><p>
In August 1984, for example, the Dow hit several successive lows, but the New York Stock Exchange advance/decline line was hitting successive new highs. Investors attending to this data could have gotten in at the start of a three-and-a-half-year upward move that saw the Dow more than double.<p>
Measuring the difference between the number of stocks making new highs over a 52-week period is a good way to assess underlying support for the market's direction. When a market index hits a low (in the context of its recent trading levels, not necessarily an all-time low) but the number of individual stocks making new lows is not rising, a turnaround may be imminent. Conversely, when a market index rises without a corresponding rise in the number of new highs, a correction is likely. This occurred in April 1971: The Dow hit a two-year peak, but the high-low differential dropped dramatically and the market fell more than 15 percent over the next seven months. One year later, with the Dow again rising, the high-low reading headed south again, and a few months later, the market went into a two-year tailspin, losing about 45 percent of its value.<p>
"The lesson is that such divergences are never to be ignored," says Justin Mamis. "Time and time again, such divergences have represented key signals that the trend is about to change." Investors should remember that the new-high/new-low reading is meaningful only on a relative basis, that is, compared to recent levels.<p>
In the end, of course, investors want to know where a particular stock (or sector, or market average) is headed. The simplest way to come up with an answer is to use a ruler to draw a trend line. By connecting either the significant peaks or low points in a chart, an investor can visually assess whether the trend is up or down. The trick, or the art, lies in deciding which points to connect. Remember that the longer a trend has been in place, the harder it is to reverse. That is, the more points composing a trend line and the more gradual the slope, the more meaningful it is.<p>
<p><a name="SUB5"><b><font size=+1>It's all in the timing: The pros reveal how they decide it's time to sell.</font></b><p>
After determining the direction of the stock's price, the investor needs to figure out its trading range. Most stocks have periods in which they trade consistently within a certain price range, establishing lower and upper bounds between which a large turnover of shares occurs. These bottoms are known as "supports," and tops are called "resistances." For example, the investor who notices that a stock regularly moves between 20 and 40 can do well by buying in the low 20s and selling in the high 30s.<p>
Although these levels are determined initially by supply and demand, they can, as James Stack points out, become self-perpetuating as investors pick up on the pattern. "Support and resistance levels are most meaningful if they are perceived to be support and resistance levels by the investing public," he says.<p>
Stocks tend to stay within their trading ranges until something occurs to change the balance between supply and demand. When this happens on the downside, the previous support level becomes the new resistance level; on the upside, the previous resistance level becomes the new support level. Such is the case with the Dow Jones average reaching 4000, which before last February was a point of major market-level resistance. While a new resistance level has yet to be established as the market has continued to achieve new highs, 4000 is now the Dow's new support level. Its violation would spell big trouble.<p>
<p><a name="SUB6"><b><font size=+1>Good things come to those who wait--at least until a stock trades above its 200 day average.</font></b><p>
One benefit of charts is that they allow investors to view one variable in relation to another--usually a price index in relation to its moving average. (The moving average creates a smooth price history by tracking the average closing price over a given time period, dropping the earliest piece of data and adding the most recent one for every time interval.) While the trend of a moving average is important on its own, it is most useful as an indicator of support and resistance for the stock. Some pros recommend that investors sell as soon as a stock's line chart crosses below the moving average line, and buy when the stock rises above the average. Others recommend that investors wait until the average itself has changed direction.<p>
Because the moving average trails actual stock-price movements, the shorter the time period of the average, the more volatile it will be; the longer the period, the more meaningful the breakthrough. While traders use anything from 5-day to 500-day moving averages, most technicians recommend using a 200-day moving average. In fact, says Edward Nicoski, buying a stock trading above its 200-day average typically leads to positive returns, while buying it below this average leads to negative results. A 1992 Journal of Finance study of the Dow Jones Industrial Average between 1897 and 1986 found that when the market crossed above its 200-day moving average, it returned about 12 percent a year. When it fell below it, it lost 7 percent.<p>
<p><a name="SUB7"><b><font size=+1>The four-month mark is the most attractive to techies. Don't simply rely on highest relative strength.</font></b><p>
Still another important technical tool is relative strength, the measure of how an individual stock is faring versus the overall market. "Very often changes in trend, from good to bad or from bad to good, will be preceded by a change in the stock's relative performance," says Richard T. McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York City.<p>
Relative strength is derived by dividing the price of the stock by the price of a market index. An upward-sloping line shows that the stock is outperforming the market over time; a downward-sloping line denotes underperformance. A stock is most attractive when its relative strength has improved for four months or longer, says William O'Neil, chairman of William O'Neil and Co., a stock-research firm in Los Angeles. But he cautions that investors shouldn't just jump on the stock with the highest relative strength, because by then it's likely to have gone too far. Rising relative strength does not necessarily mean a stock is going up--it may simply be declining less quickly than the market. For example, if General Electric were dropping by 5 percent while the S&P 500 were falling by 10 percent, GE's relative strength would be rising. "Thus it's inadvisable to use relative strength as a sole technical tool," writes Alan R. Shaw.<p>
Many technicians use the relative-strength line to identify attractive industry sectors before picking individual stocks. This information appears Mondays in Investor's Business Daily. Analyzing sector performance is an effective way to narrow the number of choices. And while it certainly doesn't ensure picking a successful stock, it does improve your chances. As Shaw puts it, "It's a lot easier [to pick a stock] if the tide of the group's behavior is supportive."<p>
This technique also can help you steer clear of the wrong stocks. For example, investors who noticed in 1992 that the restaurant sector violated a relative-strength uptrend in place for 12 years could have saved themselves dramatic losses over the next 3 years.<p>
One problem with using group charts to find individual stocks, says O'Neil, is that by the time you have identified a strong group, its leading stock is likely to be overextended. The leader, Mamis notes, may also distort the potential for the rest of the group. Still, he says, "group charts are helpful as a confirmation that your individual stock is not floating in thin air." In addition, McCabe, who uses group selection, warns that if the overall market is weak, the few groups that remain strong could be the next to capitulate to the trend.<p>

						Think of a chart as a map: It shows you where you can and can't go. There are seven key patterns technicians use to navigate the market.<p>
By Jonathan Butler<p>
Technicians have identified numerous price patterns--far too many for the amateur investor. But a few prominent ones can help an individual decide when to buy and when to sell. According to Piper Jaffray's Nicoski, it can be as simple as asking whether the chart is smiling or frowning at you.<p>
The typical price cycle has four phases. The first is accumulation, or consolidation. At this point, there is no positive news on the company, and only the first long-term investors are starting to buy. The stock price often dips slightly before going back up, creating a "smile" on the chart.<p>
The markup phase happens as business starts to pick up and more analysts and investors start paying attention. This interest becomes euphoric, driving the stock price up dramatically. As a rule, the longer the accumulation phase, the longer the mark-up period will last.<p>
At this point, some investors realize that the price has gotten ahead of itself and start selling. This is called the distribution phase, characterized by a frowning line. Pretty soon, the consensus catches on and starts selling, initiating the markdown phase.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>A price cycle is a long and bumpy road. Try to avoid the potholes.</font></b><p>
No cycle will be as smooth in practice as the diagram suggests. Instead, the cycle will be made up of shorter and choppier price patterns that can be divided into two types--reversals and continuations. A reversal--like the distribution and accumulation phases above--is a turnaround in the direction of a trend, while a continuation is only a temporary interruption in the larger trend.<p>
There are a few additional patterns all investors should understand. The head and shoulders pattern (see graph) consists of a series of three rallies and reactions, with the middle one being the most extreme. At the top of the chart, the uptrend is reversed only when the "neckline"--the line connecting the bottoms of the two shoulders--has been broken by the third downturn. The same pattern can be seen in reverse at the bottom of the cycle. At the top, the volume should fall off in the righthand shoulders; at the bottom, it should increase.<p>
The other kind of reversal to watch for is the double top and bottom (see graph), which looks like the letter M. The tip-off that it is reversing the trend is that the second top is accompanied by much less volume.<p>
To avoid selling a stock that is still in a broad uptrend or buying a stock that still has far to fall, the investor needs to watch for what are called continuation patterns. Instead of looking at these continuations as reversals, the investor should think of them as a period when the stock is catching its breath. Take triangles, for example: The right-angled descending triangle is composed of a series of descending peaks, the bottoms of which stay constant. This shows that support for the stock is not eroding and suggests that it will shortly continue its upward trend.<p>
The last two continuation patterns--the wedge and the flag--contain upper and lower trend lines heading in the same direction. The falling wedge is an interruption of an uptrend, while a rising wedge is an interruption of a downtrend. The formation of a wedge, which commonly takes two to eight weeks, is usually accompanied by a decline in volume.<p>
A flag, really a parallelogram shape, usually occurs during a sharp move in price and is preceded by heavy trading that quickly evaporates over the life of the countercyclical trend, usually one to four weeks. Martin J. Pring warns that if the volume does not ease, the larger trend may be reversed.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Other sources can help steer you in the right direction.</font></b><p>
Once you have identified a company that interests you, technical analysis of the stock and the overall market can help you determine whether and when to buy and sell. As McCabe puts it, the stock is the car and the technical chart is the map that tells you where you can and can't go. "You may have the greatest Ferrari or Lamborghini in the world," he says, "but if you have to go from New York to London, it won't do you very much good."<p>
There are several sources of chart information. The first is Investor's Business Daily, which has technical data on over 8,000 companies. To access these charts on-line, net surfers can sign on to Prodigy, which carries most of IBD's charts. Finally, TeleChart 2000, a CD-ROM product for home computers, provides access to 8,500 charts for only 99 cents a day.<p>

						Neglected and barely respected, convertible securities provide a profitable way to reduce portfolio risk. Here's how they work.<p>
By Jonathan Butler<p>
If the market teaches anything, it's that nobody is infallible and that the prospect of rising returns carries the certainty of rising risk. Still, there is a way to get high yields and equity-like returns with relatively low risk--through the hybrid financial instruments called convertibles. <p>
Convertibles (the term covers convertible bonds and convertible preferred stocks) are securities that can be exchanged for a set number of shares of common stock. For example, the owner of Alaska Air 6.5 percent convertible bonds due in 2005 has the option to convert each bond into 46.5 shares of common stock. When they were issued at par on June 21, the common stock was trading at $17.63, making the conversion value of the convertible bonds $820.<p>
According to Ibbotson Associates in Chicago, convertible bonds had annualized returns of 11.8 percent between 1973 and 1992, half a percentage point better than stocks and more than 2 points above bonds. Merrill Lynch estimates all convertibles yielded the same 11.8 percent annually from 1988 through March of 1995. And a March 1995 Salomon Brothers study found that, since issuance, convertible securities have realized 118 percent of their underlying stocks' gains and only 50 percent of their losses.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Although they're the Dangerfields of the market, convertibles are perfect for diversifying most portfolios.</font></b><p>
While converts, as they're called, have grown more attractive to investors (between 1991 and 1994, the market value of outstanding convertible issues rose 44 percent), they are still the Rodney Dangerfields of asset classes. Brokers don't like them because they're complicated and illiquid. Wall Street firms don't like to spend a lot of time (and money) researching them because they're generally issued in relatively small amounts. Consultants and financial advisors shun them because they don't fit neatly into traditional asset-allocation models.<p>
But since convertibles' returns do not correlate closely with those of stocks and bonds, they are an excellent way to diversify most portfolios. And despite the low credit ratings assigned to most of these securities (more than half are below investment grade), shifting money to them from stocks actually increases the security of a portfolio, because converts are higher in the capital structure--meaning they will be paid off before stocks in the event of bankruptcy.<p>
Most convertibles yield 1 to 2 percent less than straight corporate bonds of the same maturity. Because they are exchangeable for common stock, convertibles move in the same direction as the underlying stock. They're usually less volatile, however, in their price swings: On average, convertibles match up to 70 percent of the common stock's price appreciation, but because the price of the convertible is unlikely to fall below its value as a fixed-income investment (called the investment value), convertibles rarely suffer more than 40 percent of a decline in the common stock.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>The downside protection of convertibles tilts the odds in the investor's factor.</font></b><p>
This positive risk-reward relationship is known as favorable leverage. As a rule, unless the common stock goes up more than 40 percent over the life of the convertible, you're better off owning the convertible.<p>
The downside protection of convertibles allows you to invest in a more speculative or volatile company with less risk. Let's say that back in September 1993 you wanted to invest in the technical-training company National Education but were nervous about the stock's recent slide. Instead of buying the stock, which at the time was at $6.75--down from over $30 five years earlier--you could have bought the 6.5 percent convertible bond due in 2011. This would have looked smarter in hindsight: While the stock fell 44 percent over the next 20 months, the convertible lost less than 10 percent of its value and, after factoring in its 9.25 percent current yield, turned in a flat total return over the period.<p>
Most firms that analyze convertibles do so through models that estimate their potential upside and downside. For example, Value Line Convertibles Survey is currently recommending Air Express International's 6 percent convertible bonds, due in 2003. According to Value Line's calculations, the Air Express convert is a good bet because it should share in 80 percent of the common stock's rise but in only 38 percent of a drop. "This tilts the odds greatly in your favor," says Value Line convertibles research director Barry Nelson.<p>
The Air Express converts are also attractive, says Nelson, because of their low conversion premium. This is the percentage by which the price of the convertible exceeds its conversion value, its value when converted into common stock. It usually reflects the convertible's yield advantage over the common stock. As a rule of thumb, the smaller the premium, the more closely the convertible tracks the movement of the stock (see "The Typical Convertible" at right). At 7 percent, Air Express's premium is far below the average convertible's premium of 30 percent. With the bond currently yielding about 5.5 percent (the mean for converts), the investor needs to hold on to the bond for just over a year to break even, assuming the stock remains flat.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>The down side is that most converts are callable. But only about one quarter ever are.</font></b><p>
In case this all sounds too good to be true, investors should keep in mind a couple of potential problems. First, most convertible bonds are callable: The company has the option to buy back the bonds at a fixed price after a set period of time, usually three years. The Air Express bonds, for example, are callable in January 1996 at 104.2. Since the bonds are currently trading at 110, the holder would give up the 5.8 point spread if the company called the bonds, earning only the coupon yield over the remaining months.<p>
Only about a quarter of convertible bonds are called and redeemed for cash, however. "Most managements don't want to cough up the cash required to buy in the bonds," says Nelson. Instead, they prefer to have investors exchange bonds for stock, which they may do only when the conversion value is above the call price. In fact, most companies wait until the conversion value exceeds the call price by at least 20 percent to guard against the possibility of stock declines during the 30-day redemption period.<p>
<p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>Set the right atmosphere for converts to grow.</font></b><p>
The ideal environment for converts is falling interest rates and rising stock prices. This meant double trouble  for the group in 1994, when Fed hikes and stagnant corporate profits gave the group its worst performance, down almost 4 percent, since 1987. But for the same reasons, converts, already up 7 percent this year, are a good bet right now, says Michael Rosen, manager of the Rochester Bond Fund for Growth.<p>
Since converts are less liquid and less closely followed than stocks--only about a third of the converts in Value Line's 585-company universe of convertibles are listed on an exchange--they are often priced less efficiently. For example, the bid-ask spread (the difference between the price at which buyers are willing to buy and sellers are willing to sell) on California Microwave stock rarely gets wider than three quarters of a point. The convertible bonds (5.25 percent, due 2003), however, recently traded with a 5-point spread. This means that if you bought $10,000 of the convertibles one minute and wanted to turn around and sell them the next, you would have an immediate loss of $500.<p>
Individual investors may have a hard time finding buyers and sellers of small lots and, as a result, will have to pay higher prices than the larger traders. For these reasons, unless you have a lot of time and money to devote to convertibles, experts recommend sticking with one of the 32 convertible mutual funds out there. But make sure you know what you're buying: Many funds own common stocks as well as converts.<p>

You could ask your broker or money manager for help in answering this question. Or you could do as the pros do and divine where to stash your cash yourself with the help of the yield curve. Understanding this tool and how it works can help you make the best choice in buying bonds--one that provides the optimum combination of yield and maturity.<p>
Those who know how to look at the curve and read its meaning also can glean information important to all investors. For the yield curve is the bond market's oracle: It tells how the bond market views the future at any given moment.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>The yield curve is full of ups and downs. But mostly ups.</font></b><p>
The yield curve is actually the name for a simple line on a graph that plots the interest rate paid by bonds of similar types but different maturities. There are many yield curves, but the most widely followed is the one for Treasury debt, which lists three-month bills to 30-year bonds. The horizontal axis of the graph measures the length of time until each bond matures. The vertical axis, meanwhile, measures the yield of each bond. The higher the points on the line, the greater the interest paid by the bond.<p>
Normally, the line slopes upward. That's because longer-term investments (the ones plotted on the right side of the graph) carry more risk and thus must pay higher rates of interest as compensation. In the case of Treasurys, which are guaranteed by the U.S. government, the primary risk is inflation, which reduces the worth of a bond's coupon payments as well as its eventual redemption value.<p>
Occasionally, the curve slopes downward and is said to be inverted. Such an event took place in 1981, when short-term yields approached 20 percent but 30-year bonds yielded only 14 percent. This inversion occurred primarily because the market believed the long-term risk of inflation was much less than the short-term threat. The last time this happened was 1989.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>This curve can be flat or grow shoulders.</font></b><p>
When both short- and long-term interest rates are roughly the same, the curve is said to be flat. That is how most of the line looked when we began the new year. Two-year Treasurys yielded 7.63 percent, 30-year bonds 7.86 percent. That's a tiny spread, and it means that the market currently sees little difference between the short- and the long-term risks of inflation. So investors who buy longer-term bonds currently receive only a slight premium.<p>
A year ago, the spread between the 2-year note and the 30-year bond was over two full percentage points, or 200 basis points. The spread between the 3-month bill and the 30-year bond exceeded 300 basis points. Thus, the yield curve looked much different: sloping more steeply.<p>
But then an overheated economy and inflation fears caused Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan to become alarmed. To cool things down, the Fed moved to increase short-term interest rates, making borrowing more expensive for consumers and businesses. The Fed hiked rates six times in 1994, starting in February. Yields on the 3-month Treasury bill jumped to 6 percent from 3.03 percent, and the long bond went from 6.23 percent to around 7.86 percent in a year. This is what gave us the predominantly flat curve we had in January.<p>
Notice, however, that the January yield curve has a bend between the two- and three-year maturity mark. This is called a shoulder, the place where the curve turns from steep to flat. Typically, the shoulder is where investors can find the ideal combination of the highest yield with the least maturity. "The curve is cheap just now for short maturities," said Rich Suttmeier, yield strategist at Smith Barney, earlier this year. Two-year and three-year notes were thus smart buys.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>One effective strategy is to buy at both ends of a flat line.</font></b><p>
The curve changes daily, of course, as investors trade billions of dollars worth of Treasurys. What will the curve resemble in the coming months? That depends largely on the prospects for inflation.<p>
When the curve is mostly flat, another effective strategy is to buy at both ends of the line. "It's the barbell effect--heavy on two ends," says Ashok Varikooty, Treasury strategist at First Boston. The effect allows for what essentially is a hedging tactic. By buying both of the ends, short and long, investors can ensure that their total bond holdings will remain balanced whatever happens with interest rates in the future.<p>
<p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>Plan ahead: Buy a bond that matures when you want to cash it in.</font></b><p>
The yield curve can be especially valuable for longer-term investors. Those with shorter time horizons should place more emphasis on their own needs. For instance, someone who plans to cash in a bond in three years for a down payment on a home should buy one with an equivalent maturity. That way, the home buyer will know exactly what to expect upon redemption of the bond. <p>
The other option, buying a bond with the intention of selling it on the open market prior to redemption, carries an additional level of risk--the threat that interest rates will rise and undercut the underlying value of the bond. Of course, rates could drop and produce a nifty profit. But such speculation is chancy. The bond markets are probably the most efficient in the world--meaning that at any given moment the probability that rates will rise or fall are equal.<p>
The yield curve is published every day in Investor's Business Daily and The Wall Street Journal. Buy Treasurys through a mutual fund, a broker, a bank, or a commission-free government program called Treasury Direct. For information, call (202) 874-4000, or write Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt, Washington, D.C. 20239. An account will be opened in your name, and you'll be given an auction schedule.<p>

						Inflation is perhaps the most important influence on any portfolio. Here are seven measures you can use for inflation insights.<p>
By Manjeet Kripalani<p>
Trading in U.S. treasury securities--$200 billion worth every day--makes up the world's biggest and most liquid market. Yet this huge global bond bazaar, around which all other debt and equity markets orbit like moons around a sun, itself obeys only one master: inflation.<p>
"Inflation and growth are the biggest things; the market reacts to inflation," says Debra Packman-Landis, Treasurys strategist at Smith Barney in New York City.<p>
Bond yields, in fact, are set at Treasury auctions to reflect inflation expectations, and they in turn affect the flow of money into global stock markets. All this makes inflation perhaps the most important influence on any portfolio. The problem is that inflation is a lagging indicator--it doesn't show up until well after it has begun to ravage the economy and our bank accounts. Prognosticators, therefore, must analyze leading indicators, tea leaves pointing to hidden pressures in the economy.<p>
For example, December inflation was a modest 2.7 percent, down from 3.1 percent last summer, yet the Fed raised interest rates in January, after six increases in 1994. "The economy is expanding at an inflationary rate," says Anirvan Banerji, an economist at the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University. "Those signs are seen in the leading indicators."<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Unless you have a lot of free time, there's no way an individual investor can track every inflation indicator. Instead, use these seven measures.</font></b><p>
Some investment houses track hundreds of indicators in their search for inflation insights. Obviously, this sort of scrutiny would be impossible for an individual. It may also, however, be unnecessary. CIBCR's inflation barometer, a standard for most economists, uses only seven measures, all of which investors can easily track. A majority of these measures, listed below, must fall in concert for inflation to decline in six to nine months, as it has 11 times since 1949.<p>
1. Journal of Commerce Industrial Price Index, created by CIBCR, comprising prices of 17 commodities like textiles and metals.<p>
2. Import prices, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.<p>
3. Federal and nonfederal debt, as measured by the Treasury Department.<p>
4. BLS's ratio of employment to the overall population, which shows how tight the labor market is.<p>
5. National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly report, which measures the percentage of managers reporting increased prices at the wholesale level.<p>
6. NAPM's delivery-time report, which measures the percentage of managers reporting longer delivery times, suggesting changes between supply and demand.<p>
7. A quarterly Dun & Bradstreet survey measuring the number of businesses expecting to raise prices in the coming quarter.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>The Fed has been proactive in raising interest rates for the first time ever. You can get inflation data daily.</font></b><p>
These anticipatory numbers are more important than ever. Under chairman Alan Greenspan, Banerji says, "for the first time, the Fed has raised interest rates in response to the leading inflation indicators, rather than waiting for inflation to hit first."<p>
CIBCR's indicators have been rising for a year, signaling that inflation could begin to accelerate at any time. However, some minor relief arrived in early February, when the percentage of purchasing managers reporting slower deliveries declined.<p>
"We expect inflation to reach about 3.5 percent by the summer," says Banerji. "It won't look like runaway inflation to Main Street, 2.7 percent to 3.5 percent, but the value of bonds on Wall Street might drop."<p>
Since 1979, the center, founded by Geoffrey Moore, Alan Greenspan's college statistics professor, has been unerring in anticipating the business cycle, give or take six months, Banerji says. Recorded inflation data are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (202-606-6994). An annual subscription to NAPM's monthly Report on Business is $150 (800-888-6276); CIBCR's daily fax (212-280-4420) is $4,500 annually.<p>

The answer could be "Not so hot." A first-ever rating of the 50 biggest plans, plus a strategy for getting better results.
By Jeff Blyskal<p>
Are some companies' 401(k) plans better than others? What's the best way to invest in one? Will my 401(k) be sufficient to make my retirement comfortable?<p>
These are crucial questions for at least 16 million working Americans. This type of corporate retirement plan held some $410 billion in assets at the end of 1992, almost as much as the investor dollars in all stock mutual funds. <p>
But not all 401(k) plans are created equal. These plans vary wildly from company to company, and while the plans provide some information to investors, it's hard to get a complete picture. <p>
Consider the 401(k) plans sponsored by <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears, Roebuck</b></a> and Amoco Oil. From 1990 through 1992, Sears employees could have put their 401(k) money into either Sears stock, a money market fund, or a balanced fund that split its investments between stocks and bonds. A Sears employee making $60,000 in 1990 and $70,000 in 1993 who kept roughly 75 percent of his retirement money in stocks and 25 percent in bonds or other fixed-income investments would have earned $5,547 on his 401(k) money during these three years. Much of that was due to a 97 percent return in Sears stock since 1990.<p>
An Amoco employee who followed a similar strategy would have earned just $1,783, largely because the oil company's stock returned just 1.7 percent since 1990. But it would be dead wrong to conclude that the Sears 401(k) was better. At the end of those three years, starting from zero, the Sears worker would have ended up with $23,375 in total 401(k) accumulations, versus $38,314 for the Amoco worker. <p>
So it goes in the Byzantine world of 401(k) plans. Rarely has the management of so much money been so misunderstood by so many. Investors who would never dream of buying shares in a mutual fund without monitoring the fund's performance and management techniques remain in the dark about the quality of their own very substantial retirement plans.<p>
Until now. Our exclusive survey of the nation's largest 401(k) plans is the first attempt to rate the quality of what is becoming the country's leading retirement- investment vehicle. The differences among plans are astonishing. For instance, some plans seem positively stacked against investors. Others make it surprisingly easy for an investor to reach retirement nirvana. The bottom line is this: How a plan is structured determines whether an employee's 401(k) will produce a comfortable retirement.<p>
Structure is what made the Sears and Amoco plans so different. Amoco allowed its employee to contribute about $9,500 more during three years than Sears did. On top of that, Amoco matched employee contributions with $11,349 in company money, about $9,000 more than Sears pitched in. <p>
Our study dissects the structure of the 50 largest 401(k) plans, clearly showing strengths and weaknesses. For example, some companies' plans take better care of the company than they do of the folks saving for retirement. Fully 40 percent of the plans required that the company's matching contributions be invested in company stock. That's great for a company interested in supporting its stock price with employee dollars, but it's not such a good deal for investors trying to lower their risk by diversifying. At least one company seems to be using 401(k) plans as a smoke screen to disguise cutbacks in the retirement plans of its workers.<p>
But our survey also demonstrates how attentive employees can make even a mediocre retirement plan work to their advantage. The fact is, most workers do themselves a disservice with their 401(k) plans. They put too little into the program, and they put their contributions into the wrong kind of investments.<p>
Tax-deferred savings plans of one form or another have been around since the 1950s, but the 401(k) as we know it today was created in 1978 when section 401(k) was added to the Internal Revenue Code. The previous generations of workers didn't have to think about savings plans as serious retirement vehicles, because most company pensions simply guaranteed a set monthly stipend for retirees. The onus in these plans--called defined-benefit plans --falls largely on the employer. The employer has to put aside enough money to meet its future pension obligations.<p>
Today, in many retirement plans, the onus has shifted to the employee. In what are known as defined-contribution plans--401(k)s are the best-known type --employees contribute their own pretax dollars (which compound on a tax-deferred basis), and companies may or may not match that contribution. The company has no obligation to provide any specific amount upon retirement; future benefits depend largely on how much money the employee contributes and on how profitably the money is invested. This is up to the employee, who picks from a menu of investment options offered by the company plan. <p>
Defined-contribution plans are now a big business. Today, 16 million employees contribute $36 billion a year to some 185,000 plans. Defined-contribution plans climbed from 30 percent of all pension assets under management in 1987 to 36 percent in 1992. By 1997, they're projected to grow to 43 percent, according to Access Research, a Windsor, Connecticut, market-research and consulting firm. "We expect another round of defined-benefit pension-plan terminations over the next three to four years, and any kind of government-mandated health care will lead to even more terminations," says Robert G. Wuelfing, president of Access. <p>
No one joins a company just to participate in the retirement plan, of course. And although a company may have to provide some kind of reasonable plan to maintain its competitive edge in hiring, the plans themselves don't compete with one another.<p>
As a result, 401(k) peformance has never been given the kind of scrutiny routinely given to mutual funds or stocks. Yes, companies are legally required to provide employees with such details as annual performance and matching contributions in their plan, but information about what's available elsewhere? Forget it.<p>
Understanding the numbers will get even more important in January when new U.S. Labor Department rules will all but require plan sponsors to give employees a variety of investment choices within their 401(k) plans. Stripped of their legalese, the rules say that a company offering its workers a minimum of three choices with varying risk and return profiles--such as a stock fund, a bond fund, and a money market fund--will avoid legal liability for disappointing investment results. The good news is, these new rules will give those who actively manage their plans a solid chance at beating the mediocre returns that 401(k) plans have traditionally delivered.<p>
To find the benchmarks of 401(k) quality and performance, we sent a detailed questionnaire to the corporate sponsors of the 50 largest plans in a database developed by Judy Diamond Associates, a Washington, D.C., publishing firm. Almost 85 percent of the companies provided the information we requested for 1990 through 1992. Eight companies failed to respond, with four--Kraft General Foods, American Stores, Abbott Laboratories, and <a name="NYSE:EK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10500"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Eastman Kodak</b></a> --refusing to cooperate. Information on their plans was obtained from public documents on file at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Labor and from inside sources. The 50 plans, with combined assets of some $134 billion, manage one third of all 401(k) money in the U.S. They cover 2.2 million workers. <p>
After applying each plan's myriad rules, fees, and returns, we ranked them on one simple factor: how much money they would have accumulated over three years for a participant representative of many high-income Worth readers. (We assumed an employee whose salary was $60,000 in 1990 and steadily grew each year to approximately $70,000 by 1993. The median Worth reader had an individual income of $66,000 in 1993 and a household income of $108,000.) We also assumed that this representative reader was an intelligent investor who put 75 percent of plan assets into equities and 25 percent into fixed-income investments.<p>
Our methodology enabled us to compare plans on a level playing field for the first time. The results were surprising. Take the case of an IBM employee who follows our income and investing guidelines. By year-end 1992, starting from zero and making the maximum contributions to the 401(k), the employee's retirement nest egg would have grown to an estimated $22,261.<p>
Nothing shabby about that--until it's compared with what other employees at other companies could have amassed in their plans over the same period of time. With identical objectives, investment principles, salary, and economic and market conditions, an employee at Bellsouth could have made a nest egg grow to $34,993; at <a name="NYSE:GE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Electric</b></a>, to $38,265; and at Conoco it would have become a $45,007 jackpot.<p>
Why the wide range? We found from our study that most of the difference in total accumulation is attributable to the design of the plans themselves. IBM's simply makes achieving a comfortable retirement harder.<p>
We intentionally removed from our assessment most of the effects attributable to perfect hindsight. A plan investor who knew that this stock or that fund was going to go up could certainly have shown stupendous returns. Stocks have been stellar performers of late and have rewarded those plan participants who were smart enough to overweight their portfolios in equities. But tomorrow's investment returns aren't predictable on the basis of the past, so no investor should count on beating the averages when planning for retirement. For this reason, we put all of our model 401(k) participants into a sound portfolio of the kind we'd recommend for any investor saving for retirement. It's important to recognize what our study doesn't aim to accomplish, too. Many 401(k) investors have other corporate pension plans. Measuring complete corporate benefit packages is beyond the scope of this study. <p>
Since a plan's design has so much to do with its ultimate performance, we examined how the plans vary. There are two basic elements common to 401(k) plans: how much the employee can contribute to the plan and how much the employer will match.<p>
The IRS limits how much money an employee can contribute to a tax-deductible 401(k) plan each year. Three years ago, the maximum was $7,979; in 1991, it was $8,475; and in 1992, it was $8,728. The maximum in 1993 is $8,994. <p>
Many plans, however, cap an employee's contribution far short of the IRS maximum. <a name="NYSE:DAL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10448"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Delta Air Lines'</b></a> plan, for example, straitjacketed our model participant with a 10 percent maximum employee contribution. That meant a contribution that was $6,267 less than that allowed by law over the three years. This is a crucial element in the Delta plan. A dollar barred is a dollar not earning a tax-deferred return. And a dollar not tax-deferred this year is an allowable contribution lost forever, because it can't be rolled into subsequent tax years.<p>
The ideal plan should allow an employee to hit the IRS ceiling. "Employees should put as much as possible into their plan to take advantage of the last government tax shelter available to them," says James H. Gately, senior vice president at mutual fund company the Vanguard Group.<p>
Similarly, the employer matching contribution should be as large as possible, because this amount is not subject to IRS limits. "Employers should be matching dollar for dollar at least 8 percent of salary," says Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefits Research Institute, a nonprofit think tank in Washington. "And if the company intends the 401(k) to be the stand-alone retirement plan, that employer contribution should be made without regard to what the employee puts in."<p>
How generous are corporate matches? Nationwide, most plans match the first 4 percent to 6 percent of employee contributions. But that's not dollar for dollar. The cash value of matches ranges from less than 25 cents to a match of more than a dollar. The largest group, 36 percent of our companies, fell in the 25-to-50-cent range, according to Buck Consultants, an employee-benefits consulting firm in New York. The stingiest of plans--14 percent of the companies surveyed by Buck--provide zero match. Add up all the numbers, and on average, employers kick in a not-very-impressive 25 cents for every dollar employees contribute.<p>
Some experts, however, argue that even a mediocre match should be put in proper perspective. "If you put in 4 percent and the company matches only 2 percent, you've just made a 50 percent return on your money," says Mike Bostler, a principal in Chicago's Performance Analytics investment-consulting firm. "What market will top that?"<p>
The best 401(k) plans of the 50 we surveyed climbed to the top not only because they let our model participant achieve the maximum annual contribution allowed by law but also because of truly generous employer matching contributions. Number-one-rated Conoco, for example, allowed deferral of up to 15 percent of income. Conoco also generously matched employees dollar for dollar on the first 6 percent of contributions.<p>
Delta's plan, on the other hand, earned its low ranking because management is tight with the buck on matching contributions and because it capped employee contributions prematurely. Delta matched only 50 cents on the dollar and only up to the first 4 percent of employee contributions. Thus, over the 1990 through 1992 period, Delta provided only $3,783 in matching contributions--one third of Conoco's $11,349.<p>
"We realize our plan was a little outdated," says Delta's plan administrator, Harvey King, "which is why we've made major changes. We're going from a plan developed in 1972 to a state-of-the-art plan." As of July 1, 1993, employees earning less than $55,000 were allowed to contribute up to 15 percent of salary, and ten new mutual fund options--including the Twentieth Century Select, Fidelity Contrafund, Merrill Lynch Capital, and Templeton Foreign funds--have been added to the list of available investment options. However, the paltry company match is unchanged.<p>
Participants in a plan that stringently restricts contributions don't have to roll over and play dead. Although getting an employer to boost the company match may be a pipe dream in today's belt-tightening environment, employees can and should lobby for the freedom to maximize contributions of their own money. <p>
Our study points up the value of that freedom. Compare the <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a> and McDonnell Douglas plans, for example. Motorola makes no matching contribution, while McDonnell Douglas matched the first 8 percent of employee contributions with 37.5 cents to 75 cents on the dollar between 1990 and 1992. Yet the Motorola plan's total accumulation bested McDonnell Douglas's by more than $5,500. <p>
Blame it on McDonnell Douglas's 8 percent limit on employee contributions. That meant our representative participant could put only about $15,000 over three years to work in the McDonnell Douglas plan versus $25,000 at Motorola.<p>
The structure of McDonnell Douglas's plan also threw another curve at employees. The company match had to be invested in McDonnell Douglas stock. That funneled 37 percent of total contributions into a single investment. Our model shows just how bad this can be. McDonnell Douglas stock took investors on a ride guaranteed to send them straight for the airsickness bags: down 23 percent in 1990, up 53 percent in 1991, and back down nearly 29 percent in 1992. By 1993, the company's $9,000 in matching contributions was worth only $8,026. <p>
The problem here goes beyond the performance of just one stock, however. Forty percent of the plans in our survey required that the company match be put in the company's stock. Some 24 percent of all 401(k) assets are invested in the sponsoring company's stock. That much concentration adds unpredictable risk to a retirement portfolio. <p>
"An overconcentrated position in the employing-company stock is a very bad idea, because even very good companies can experience significant changes in financial position," says Chris McNickle, a principal in investment-management practice with the Greenwich Associates market-research firm in Greenwich, Connecticut.<p>
Want more evidence? Shed a tear for the poor folks in the Kraft General Foods plan. The stock of parent company <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a> had been going great guns since 1989, and at year-end 1992 more than 53 percent of the 401(k)'s assets were invested in the company stock. This year, after the company was forced to slash prices on its brand-name cigarettes to defend against discount-priced competitors, Philip Morris stock plunged 39 percent. In just four months--and after our 1990-1992 rating period--participants at Kraft watched $320 million of their money go up in smoke.<p>
It's pretty clear why so many companies encourage 401(k) investors to hold the company's stock--but very few companies admit it as directly as General Dynamics. The company encourages participants to put all their eggs in the one-company stock basket. Starting in April 1991, the company began matching dollar for dollar if an employee put 100 percent of his contributions into General Dynamics stock, but only 50 cents on the dollar if the employee allocated his contributions to a diversified investment mix. <p>
"This was part of a concerted effort to revive the company stock value," says spokesman Al Spivak. The stock certainly needed reviving: General Dynamics suffered $639 million in losses in 1990.<p>
Nearly 11,000 participants--31 percent--took the bait. The extremely high-risk gamble paid off handsomely for the short term--during our study period--with the stock fund rising 63 percent in 1991 and another 69 percent in 1992. But General Dynamics stock--vulnerable to defense-spending cutbacks--has been on a roller coaster. It traded at $18.75 in 1982, rose to $89.25 in 1986, crashed to $19 in 1990, hit a high of $107.86 in 1992 and recently traded at $97.75. Talk about white knuckles. <p>
Companies benefit from 401(k)s in less obvious ways as well. Corporations have a lot to gain by switching from a defined-benefit pension plan to a defined-contribution 401(k), says Gary Blank, vice president at the Wyatt Company, an international employee-benefits consulting firm. Companies that replace the pension with a 401(k)--generally smaller firms and corporations in reorganization--can slash their retirement benefits costs by two thirds. A typical pension plan costs a company 4 percent to 6 percent of payroll, versus just 1.5 percent to 2 percent of payroll for a 401(k) plan.<p>
Large corporations such as those on our list can realize proportional cost savings even without terminating their traditional defined-benefit plans. For example, if a company is spending 6 percent of payroll on the pension plan and beefs up the benefits of that plan by 10 percent, the cost increase would be 0.6 percent of payroll. But 401(k) benefits can be boosted 10 percent at a cost of only 0.2 percent. On a $6 billion annual payroll, the savings come to $24 million a year.<p>
As the size of the 401(k) market has grown, plan administrators--banks, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, and accounting firms that invest these dollars--are all looking for a larger piece of the pie. "It's not the cola wars, but plan administrators are looking at each other and trying to be more competitive," says Rachel Farrell, vice president at Bankers Trust, which manages some $25 billion in 401(k) assets. <p>
Choice is the current battleground for the companies selling 401(k) plans. For the most part, plan administrators, the press, and mutual fund publicists have focused on the value of increasing the number of investment options. "Most of the newly diversified 401(k) plans are much more powerful than the 401(k)s they replace," U.S. News & World Report said earlier this year. However, most plans already offer four or more investment options, according to Buck Consultants.<p>
Our study found no evidence that simply adding more options to 401(k)s will increase return to investors. The real problem at most plans is that employees misunderstand and misuse the options they have.<p>
Of course, there are plans that absolutely offer too few choices. The Abbott Laboratories plan, for example, offered only two not-great options: a high-risk undiversified gamble on the company's common stock and a low-rate return on insurance-company fixed-interest investment contracts.<p>
In our view, 401(k) plans at a minimum should give investors enough options so that they can construct a balanced and diversified portfolio. That means providing at least one diversified general-stock fund, one growth-stock fund, and one fixed-income fund. (To see how the 50 plans on our list measured up on this score, see the Grading the Options column in "How the Biggest 50 Stack Up," on page 64.)<p>
But pure choice is not enough. Fully 28 percent of the employees who are eligible to participate in 401(k) plans simply never sign up. The remainder contribute far less than the maximum allowed by the IRS. Nationally, the average is just 4 percent to 5 percent of salary. More choice won't address these workers' biggest problem.<p>
Nor does a host of options necessarily lead to smart asset allocation. Most 401(k) participants put too much money into fixed-income instruments. Guaranteed investment contracts (GICs), an insurance industry product with a fixed return and high costs, account for 30 percent of the whole 401(k) pie. In individual plans the numbers can be significantly higher. At Du Pont, for example, 86 percent of plan assets are in GICs.<p>
The popularity of this instrument is easy to understand but wrongheaded. Insurance companies, the traditionally dominant plan advisor in the 401(k) market, sell GICs on the promise of a guaranteed return. An employee can buy a GIC that promises an 8 percent--or whatever--return.<p>
But 401(k) investors shouldn't even worry about the validity of these promises or exactly what is guaranteed about these contracts. There's no reason to be in GICs in the first place, given their low annual returns, currently about 7 percent. "That won't give you the growth you need," says Farrell at Bankers Trust, "and over the next year you'll see [new] GICs take a dive to 5 percent, making them even less attractive."<p>
An incredible 9 percent of all 401(k) plan assets sit stagnant in money market funds, at best barely matching inflation. "Plan participants invest way too conservatively," says Wuelfing of Access Research. "Over the last five years, professionally managed defined-benefit pension plans got a 12 percent average annual return while defined-contribution plans, which are managed by employees, got only a 9 percent return. That's because the pension plans are more heavily invested in equities."<p>
The proof is in the historic record of the last 67 years. According to Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago-based financial-data firm, between 1925 and 1992, U.S. common stocks provided an average 10.3 percent annual return--and that's accounting for the crash of 1929 and the plunge in 1987. Long-term corporate bonds returned only 5.5 percent annually over the same time span--not much when inflation gets subtracted.<p>
Despite this evidence, many employees avoid stocks because they fear risk. "If you're uncomfortable, you can reduce your exposure to stocks, but you have to recognize that you're making an emotional decision, not a financial one," says Greenwich Associates' McNickle.<p>
So how much of your 401(k) plan should be in stocks? The experts we polled recommended that at least 50 percent and as much as 100 percent of plan assets be invested in stocks. The conventional wisdom recommends that younger employees should be heavily in stocks--to take advantage of greater returns and the reduced risk over the long term--while workers with less than ten years until retirement should have their assets weighted toward fixed-income investments. That way, they won't get caught needing to withdraw funds in retirement just as the down end of an equity cycle hits.<p>
The conventional wisdom strikes us as too conservative, and it certainly ignores recent demographic trends. Employees should be planning not for the end of a working life at 65 but for a phased retirement that includes significant employment income that could well stretch to 85. It's premature, therefore, to convert from equities to fixed-income investments using 65 as a benchmark. And thinking about income instead of total return is a mistake anyway. A retiree can spend a dollar earned by selling an equity as easily as a dollar earned by collecting interest.<p>
But the kinds of stocks held in a 401(k) should change as 65 approaches and after. Older workers should have a smaller portion of their holdings in more aggressive equities, such as small-company stocks. <p>
Our 401(k) analysis conservatively aimed for 75 percent in equities, with 55 percent to 60 percent in a truly diversified portfolio and 15 percent to 20 percent in a growth-stock portfolio. We tried to put the remaining 25 percent in fixed-income investments. This mix will improve the performance of the average real-life 401(k) investor.<p>
Growing up as a stepchild of the investment industry, the 401(k) business has traditionally been dominated by insurance companies and money managers offering proprietary products. Historically, the managers of these products have generally charged more to manage money than is now the norm in the mutual fund industry. Those charges eat into an investor's return.<p>
We suspect that higher fees are still the norm in the 401(k) field, but it's hard to compare fees in this industry with those charged by publicly traded mutual funds. The two types of investment are under different regulatory agencies that enforce different standards. We certainly intend to pursue this question further.<p>
Whatever the case, additional options will mean that investors who correctly compare plan alternatives will be able to do better than in the past--if they wisely manage their 401(k) choices. The real payoff will come in retirement, when those annual returns add up to financial independence.<p>

						<br>Have you ever found an unexplained service charge on your bank statement, or discovered that an overzealous bank employee had sold unwanted mutual funds to an elderly relative? If so, you probably registered a complaint and a request for redress. But what if you couldn't come to a satisfactory resolution?  <p>
The answer is an appeal to a higher authority: the FDIC, which regulates state banks, or the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees interstate banking.  <p>
Before you open an account at a state bank, check out the <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/">FDIC</a>'s site and look over the consumer-rights files. You can also call the FDIC Consumer Hotline at (800) 934-3342 for information about deposit insurance and consumer-protection matters, and to get an institution's financial report.   <p>
If you wish to file a formal complaint, our list of <a href="/articles/I0101.html">Banking Authorities</a> includes the 50 state bank commissioner offices, as well as those in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. E-mail addresses, where available, are also included, although you cannot file a complaint online because a signature is required.  <p>
 <a href="http://www.occ.treas.gov/">The Comptroller of the Currency</a> also has a home page with general information about the agency and the banking system, as well as public documents and news releases. Complaints and questions can be E-mailed to the office at consumer.complaint@occ.treas.gov.The consumer hot-line telephone number is (800) 613-6743.  <p>

						<br>Have you unwittingly abandoned money that's rightfully yours? Contact the Unclaimed Property office to find out.   <p>
By Dayana Yochim  <p>
Aunt Ida may be only a loving memory--but her portfolio has yet to be laid to rest. Unfortunately, before Ida passed she forgot to tell her relatives where to find it.  <p>
Short of conjuring up her spirit, you'll have to rely on the local unclaimed-property office to help you regain Aunt Ida's memory--and her money. Last year, according to the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators (NAUPA), more than $2 billion in abandoned goods was collected. Yet only one-third of it was claimed by heirs or other legal claimants, says NAUPA president Randy Ross.  <p>
It's not just stock certificates or silver dollars that are sitting in property offices around the country. Everything from false teeth and Swedish porn films to the patent for brass knuckles has been abandoned.   <p>
States are required to make a diligent effort to reunite rightful owners with their unclaimed assets. (How diligent may depend on the value of the property and the office's workload.) Some post a list of people with unclaimed property at the county courthouse or in the newspaper. Others set up booths at local fairs and run public-service announcements on TV. Or you could simply contact the appropriate state office using our list (click at right).  <p>
Here are a few things you should know before you set out on a treasure hunt for unclaimed goods:  <p>
1. Utility deposits, the contents of safe-deposit boxes, andmoney in checking and savings accounts are the most common abandoned items, according to unclaimed-property administrators.  <p>
 2. States will keep abandoned property--such as fur coats and silver sets--for about a year. Then the goods are sold at a public auction (stocks are sold on the open market). The proceeds are put in an escheat account until a rightful claimant comes forward. Few states pay out interest.   <p>
 3. To make a claim you must provide proper ID. If you contactan unclaimed-property office in a state where you formerly lived, an old utility bill or tax statement will do. Some offices accept a Social Security card as proof.  <p>
 4. If you are claiming a deceased relative's property, you'll have to provide information that will substantiate your familial tie. That done, the state will turn the property over to the administrator of the deceased's estate, who will determine which heirs are entitled to the property.  <p>
 5. Never pay a service charge. Some shifty characters will offer to track down abandoned property for you, charging a percentage (as much as half) of what they recover. There are also third-party treasurers who legally match claimants to their goods. If you contact the state office directly, however, there is no service charge.

						Answers to readers' questions about Au Bon Pain (don't give up!), Fannie Mae, and more<p>
By Peter Lynch<p>
Letters have been piling up on my desk since December 1995, the last time I devoted a column to readers. Again, I want to thank everyone who took the time to write. The volume of correspondence makes it impossible for me to respond personally to all your questions and comments, but I have chosen a few to answer here.<p>
On your recommendation, I purchased <a name="NASD:ABPCA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13703"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Au Bon Pain</b></a> for $26.25 a share in January 1994. As of October 1996, the stock has fallen to six dollars. Is it worth holding, or should I sell and take the loss?
Robert Schnell, Goshen, Indiana<p>
Au Bon Pain has been a pain in the wallet -- although, if it's any comfort, I've made several recommendations over the years that were worse. The stock in this bakery-style caf chain got off to a good start: from $9 a share at the initial public offering in mid-1991 to over $26 a year and a half later. Now it sells below the IPO price. Since I bought some for $22.75, you and I made the same mistake. Both of us should have paid more attention to earnings, which at one point were estimated at 80 cents a share for 1994. This gave the company a price-to-earnings ratio of almost 30, which readers of this column will recognize as on the high side.<p>
If a company manages to increase earnings at 25 to 30 percent a year, then a p/e of 30 isn't too much to pay. But here's the catch: Au Bon Pain's earnings came in at 67 cents in 1994, then disappeared into a loss of 14 cents a share in 1995. Two things went wrong: Starbucks showed up as competition, along with all its clones and a zillion bagel shops, and at the end of 1993, Au Bon Pain acquired St. Louis Bread, a chain of bakery/restaurants where the costs rose faster than the loaves.<p>
Whenever a company does as poorly as this one has, and you own it, the first thing you want to check is its finances. Can it survive the bankers and creditors long enough to turn itself around? On that score, Au Bon Pain gets a B minus -- not great, but okay. It has borrowed $75 million, but the balance sheet shows about $94 million in equity. More equity than debt is comforting. So is the eight-dollar-a-share book value.<p>
Next, you check what the company is doing to solve its problems. Au Bon Pain has been successful in downtown areas but not in suburbs, so management is concentrating on the former. Of the 281 outlets, less than 5 percent have been duds, and these are closing. The others have worked out. Whenever I go into one, it's crowded. <p>
St. Louis Bread has been the real source of trouble because the chain grew too fast and expenses got out of control. But people seem to like these family-style restaurants, which feature fresh-baked breads. The same-store sales are growing at double-digit rates. This year, an experienced restaurant team was brought in. A new bread factory (where raw dough is made) should be up and running by the time this article hits the stands. Getting the factory on line is costly in the short term, but once the bugs are worked out, the factory has the potential to reduce costs substantially and add to earnings.<p>
Finally, you want to ask: What's the upside here if all goes well? Au Bon Pain is adding new outlets abroad, but St. Louis Bread is the key to the company's future. If that franchise can expand from 33 restaurants to 250 or even 500, it's not hard to imagine Au Bon Pain as a very big winner. To buy this stock now, or to hold on to it, you have to believe in St. Louis Bread.<p>
Put me in the believer camp. I still really like the dedication and skill of top management. I bought more shares in August, September, and October.<p>
I must take exception with a few of your comments with respect to market timing. Market timing, as it is practiced by the majority of investment advisers, is a risk-management approach to investing. It enables risk-averse investors to participate in the superior returns of the stock market at a reduced risk level.
Jerry C. Wagner, Aurora, Colorado 
Society of Asset Allocators & Fund Timers<p>
The only problem with market timing is getting the timing right. I haven't met many people who've done it successfully. Maybe once in a row, but not consistently. There's no telling how many timers miss big gains in stocks by making ill-timed exits. Look at the number of hedge-fund managers who've left the business since 1990.<p>
If you had missed the 40 biggest up months on the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index in the past 40 years, your return from stocks would have dropped from 11.4 percent to 2.7 percent. That's how important it is to be invested in those key moments: 40 months on the sidelines out of 10,000 days of trading and you'd have been better off keeping your money in a savings account.<p>
I've gone through this before, but let me give you another example based on actual stock-market performance from 1965 through 1995, a period with good years and bad. Imagine three investors, each of whom puts $1,000 into stocks annually over these three decades. Investor 1, who is very unlucky, somehow manages to buy stocks on the most expensive day of each year. Investor 2, who is very lucky, buys stocks on the cheapest day of each year. Investor 3 has a system: She always buys her stocks on January 1, no matter what.<p>
You'd think that Investor 2, having an uncanny knack for timing the market, would end up much richer than Investor 1, the unluckiest person on Wall Street, and would also outperform Investor 3. But over 30 years, the returns are surprisingly similar. Investor 1 makes 10.6 percent annually; Investor 2, 11.7 percent; and Investor 3, 11 percent. Even I am amazed that perfect timing year after year is worth only 1.1 percent more than horrible timing year after year.<p>
The only thing that might convert me into a one-shot market timer is if the Dow suddenly rose from 6,000 to 18,000 and the market was selling for 45 to 50 times earnings, so far beyond the pale of valuation that a huge correction would be inevitable. In such an extreme case, I might wait it out in Treasury bills. But as long as stocks continue to sell in the normal range of 10 to 20 times earnings, I'm staying in. <p>
Ask yourself this: If stock prices dropped 10 to 25 percent, would you add to your positions in stocks and mutual funds, or would you cash out and cut your losses? If the answer is that you'd cash out, then do it now and avoid the misery that is sure to come later. Stocks are a safe bet, but only if you stay invested long enough to ride out the corrections. Remember what makes them a safe bet: corporate earnings. If earnings on the S&P 500 quadruple over the next two decades, as they have in the past two, stock prices should rise at a corresponding rate.<p>
How do you feel about bonds? Is it okay to stay with them?
Worth OnLine Reader<p>
After having written three books and numerous articles, I'm sure my feelings about bonds are hardly a secret. All things considered, I prefer stocks. People worry about the riskiness of stocks, but bonds can be just as risky. Look at what happens to the price of a bond fund the next time interest rates go up 2 percent.<p>
If you could make the right call on interest rates five times in a row, you could buy $10,000 worth of bond futures, roll over the profits, and become a billionaire in short order. But the ranks of interest-rate billionaires are as thin as the ranks of billionaire market timers, which tells you that interest rates are tricky to predict.<p>
If you stick with T-bills or money-market funds, you think your money is secure, but once you pay taxes on the interest, your return might not be enough to keep up with inflation. That's how people lose money on a "safe" investment. If you buy bonds with longer maturities, you get a better interest rate, but it's fixed. This exposes you to the risk of rising rates and falling bond prices. In that situation, you can either sell the bond at a loss or wait until it matures to get back the full amount of your principal. That's why, if I bought bonds, I'd go for the intermediate maturities -- three to five years. Who wants to be stuck with a 20-year bond in a period of rising rates?<p>
Over the past six decades, with inflation running hot and cold, long-term government bonds have earned 1.9 percent over the inflation rate, versus 7.5 percent for stocks, according to Ibbotson Associates. What is this 5.6 percent difference worth? With $10,000 invested over 25 years, the difference becomes $38,000.<p>
Only once in this century have bonds had a clear advantage over stocks: during the depression of the 1930s. If you're expecting another depression, then buy Treasurys.<p>
That said, I'm going to keep an eye on the new inflation-adjusted bonds the Treasury Department will issue in January. The return on these bonds will be pegged to the consumer price index, so if inflation heats up, bondholders will be protected. Of course, if inflation cools off, these bonds may lose their advantage, but they have the potential to be better than money-market funds.<p>
How do you see <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a>?
Worth OnLine Reader<p>
This is the colossus of retail, with $93.6 billion in sales in 1995, more than <a name="NYSE:KM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10830"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kmart</b></a>, J. C. Penney, and <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears</b></a> put together. In an average week, 60 million customers visit Wal-Mart stores; Wal-Mart takes in an annual $360 for every man, woman, and child in America. But after 35 years of rapid growth, 27 of them as a public company, how can this hulk maintain the pace? Lately, we've seen a letup in the earnings momentum: $1.02 a share in 1994, $1.17 in 1995, $1.19 in 1996.<p>
The stock price has dropped from an all-time high of $34.125 a share to the mid-$20s, reflecting the slowdown in earnings and Wall Street's falling out of love with the company. Mark Husson at J. P. Morgan explains the problem of rekindling the relationship:<p>
"I think that the growth guys look at it now and say, 'This isn't the old growth story we used to know. It's got a high-teen growth rate, below the 20 percent we once got from this company.' So the growth guys are not really interested anymore.<p>
"If you're a value guy, you say, 'Wal-Mart is trading at a premium to its growth rate.' So the value guys aren't interested either.<p>
"The momentum guy says, 'The chart looks awful. I'm not going to touch this.'"<p>
Husson thinks of Wal-Mart as a proxy for retail in general, so if we have a good Christmas season in 1996, the stock might benefit. Beyond that, the company's fate is tied to the new Wal-Mart supercenters, which sell everything from appliances to groceries.<p>
The first supercenters were rolled out in the heartland, where Wal-Mart began, but now they're moving into more densely populated areas, where the competition is tougher. The company opened 100 of these mega-sites in 1996 and plans to open another hundred or so in 1997, for a grand total of 420. It remains to be seen whether consumers will buy TVs, socket wrenches, and chicken soup under the same roof and whether Wal-Mart will get enough return on this investment to boost its profits overall.<p>
Based on analysts' estimates for 1997, Wal-Mart will earn $1.36 a share, giving it a p/e of 20 at the current stock price of about $27. The company isn't the fast grower it was, but neither does it carry a fast grower's lofty price tag. If Wal-Mart can regain some of its earnings momentum, shareholders who buy at these levels can expect to be rewarded.<p>
Do you prefer to look at a stock as a growth investment or as a source of income?
Worth OnLine Reader<p>
That depends on the stock. A stock that pays no dividend is obviously not an income investment. But in general, dividends are a more important part of the total return from stocks than people might think. According to Ibbotson Associates, the S&P 500 returned 10.6 percent annually from January 1926 to September 1996, but only if you reinvested the dividends. Remove the dividends, and these companies returned only 5.8 percent. <p>
Today, dividends are much lower across the board than they were a few years back: 2 percent on the stocks in the S&P 500, versus 4 to 6 percent in the early 1980s. That's one reason some people are saying stocks are overpriced. <p>
Fast-growing young companies, such as technology firms, don't generally pay dividends, which for them is a plus: They can invest in their own expansion instead of handing the money to shareholders. With slow-growing companies, a dividend becomes part of the attraction. Companies that continually raise their payout have proved to be excellent investments, but they can't prosper in the long run if the earnings aren't there. <p>
Do you still recommend <a name="NYSE:FNM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10553"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fannie Mae</b></a>?
Worth OnLine Reader<p>
Fannie Mae, the leader in the home-mortgage business, tops the list of my favorite companies of all time. I've owned it since the first Reagan administration. Lending money to home buyers is by its nature a boom-or-bust proposition, but Fannie Mae has figured out how to protect itself from the vicissitudes of interest rates.<p>
In 1997, Wall Street analysts expect Fannie Mae to earn $2.80 a share, whereas a decade ago, the stock sold for $2.55 a share, adjusted for splits. That's what I call a remarkable investment: when a company's per-share earnings in a single year exceed the price you paid for the stock. No wonder the stock is up tenfold since 1987.<p>
In spite of that incredible rise, Fannie Mae is still relatively cheap. The stock is selling at 13 times the 1997 estimated earnings, and profits are growing at 14 percent a year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 is selling at 16 to 18 times earnings, while the historic growth rate of the average company is 8 to 9 percent. So you can buy Fannie Mae at its growth rate, whereas you have to pay twice the growth rate to buy shares in the average company in today's market.<p>
Fannie Mae is far from your average company. For ten years in a row, it has posted record earnings -- the only major financial stock in the S&P 500 ever to have done so. And the gain from the previous year has always been in double digits.<p>
Fannie Mae isn't hurt by changes in interest rates, but a lot of people on Wall Street still worry that it will be. That's why the stock tends to drop whenever there's speculation that interest rates will rise. Another chronic worry is homeowners' defaulting on their mortgages, but Fannie Mae's delinquency rate is a negligible 0.56 percent.<p>
A third worry surfaces from time to time: The government will ruin a good thing. Fannie Mae had its start in the depression, lending money to buyers who otherwise couldn't afford a home. Its original charter gave it a status much like a government agency, and though Fannie Mae is now a private corporation, it still is able to borrow money more cheaply than other companies. A faction in Congress periodically makes noises about altering the terms, imposing a Fannie Mae tax, or ending the relationship altogether; earlier this year, Congress held hearings on the subject.<p>
Personally, I can't see how it would help anybody to reform Fannie Mae. The company pays more than $1 billion a year in taxes, which makes it one of the five biggest taxpayers in the U.S. In March 1994, it announced a program to finance $1 trillion worth of low- and moderate-income housing by the year 2000, and the program is right on track.<p>
Ultimately, homeowners would pay the price for any change in Fannie Mae's status. As it is, the company is continuing to do good by doing well. Along with Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae is a prominent resident of the Lynch-family portfolio.<p>
Peter Lynch writes "Investor's Edge" with John Rothchild and is vice-chairman of Fidelity Management and Research. Lynch and Rothchild's third book, Learn to Earn, was published earlier this year by Simon & Schuster.<p>

						Difficult as layoffs are, they happen for good reasons -- and produce results we wouldn't want to live without<p>By Peter Lynch<p>Has the invisible hand ever been so invisible as it is in our country today? I'm referring, of course, to Adam Smith's notion that the market forces of capitalism will produce the best results -- economically and socially -- if they are simply left alone. These days, everyone seems to have forgotten Adam Smith. The press is fixated on layoffs and business avarice.<p>"Call it 'in-your-face capitalism,'" Newsweek barked. "You lose your job, your ex-employer's stock price rises, the CEO gets a fat raise." The sentiment was echoed by Business Week. And The
New York Times logged in with a seven-part series that focused on two groups of people: those who had gotten the ax and those who still had jobs but were worried the ax would fall on them next. The employed and the unemployed alike were depicted as victims of corporate greed. CG has become such a hot campaign issue that even the Republicans have been denouncing it.<p>It goes without saying (although I'll say it anyway) that there's nothing happy about somebody losing a job, especially if that somebody has no immediate prospects for finding another one. 
Only an ice sculpture would not feel compassion for the thousands of workers getting pink slips from <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>, or the three million who were let go by the 499 other Fortune 500 companies in the 1980s, or the next three million who will be idled by the end of the 1990s. That these widespread layoffs have created widespread financial and emotional hardship is beyond doubt. What I doubt is the conclusion that some people appear to be drawing from all this -- namely, that capitalism is evil and exists to spread misery by separating people from their livelihoods.<p>Job insecurity has been a problem for as long as people have depended on a paycheck. In the last century, half the U.S. population lived and worked on farms, so we've already lost two-thirds of the farming jobs. At one time, there were more than 200 manufacturers in the auto industry; at another point, the steel industry employed one of every 100 workers. Today, we have a handful of auto companies and two-thirds of the steel jobs have disappeared, but somehow the country has managed to survive and prosper.<p>Many companies can and should do more to help the recipients of pink slips get the training and referrals they need to catch on someplace else. But the pessimism aroused by layoffs per se simply isn't justified. We got a similar dose of pessimism in the late 1940s and into the 1950s, after the war was over and 10 million to 20 million Americans lost their war-related jobs in the defense industries. More than a third of the workforce had to find employment elsewhere. Life looked bleak for millions of workers.<p>Today, there's also an ominous sense that the recent pace of layoffs in the big-name companies will continue. More likely, we are closer to the end of the dismissals at places like AT&T. These companies can't run on zero employees. Moreover, most of the reductions are not as heartless as they look, because they are accomplished through normal attrition: People retire, they change careers, they move elsewhere.<p>Again and again, new opportunities have arisen to take the place of the lost opportunities. This is the way the capitalist ecology works. Industries decline, old companies wither away, and young companies rise up to replace them. This process is hard on many, but ultimately, it is healthy.<p>The strength of our economy is that it is dynamic and always adapting to changing conditions. That's our advantage in the world. That's the reason we're as creative as we are as a nation. We're number one in music, television, and movies. We're the low-cost producers in forest products, paper, aluminum, and chemicals. We're tops in software, robotics, cellular phones, pharmaceuticals, electronics, telecommunications, and farm equipment. We excel at genetic engineering, microprocessing, and networking.<p>Helped partly by a falling dollar and also by a revived domestic business climate, our share of the export market is rising. We ship steel to Seoul, transistors to Tokyo, cars to Cologne, spandex to Siena, and bike parts to Bombay. Seven hundred million men and women worldwide shave with <a name="NYSE:G"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10655"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gillette</b></a>. The skies are filled with <a name="NYSE:BA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10221"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Boeing</b></a> aircraft. Japan may have been the master of memory chips, TVs, and fax machines, but the Japanese can't keep up with the brainstorms coming out of U.S. companies like <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:TXN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11462"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Texas Instruments</b></a>, <a name="NASD:CSCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13494"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cisco Systems</b></a>, <a name="NASD:SUNW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14833"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sun Microsystems</b></a>, <a name="NASD:NOVL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14287"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Novell</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:BAY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15419"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bay Networks</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>. We dominate every phase of computing, from software and hardware to printers and workstations.<p>The improvements in productivity achieved by business in this country have benefited nearly everyone in some way. Consider what's happened to the telephone industry. In 1983, AT&T was a monopoly with a million employees. Today, among Ma Bell and the seven Baby Bells, there are 750,000 employees. These 750,000 are handling twice as many calls as their counterparts did in 1984 -- plus all the data, fax, and cellular exchanges that didn't exist in 1983. People are paying less for phone calls and getting more for their money.<p>It's amazing that the basic cause of the downsizing is so rarely acknowledged: These companies have more workers than they really need -- or can afford to pay. CEOs aren't callous Scrooges shouting "Bah humbug" as they shove loyal workers out the door; they 
are responding to a competitive situation that demands they become more productive. Would we be leading the world in so many industries if capital and labor were trapped together in outmoded, inefficient businesses with millions of workers holding down unnecessary jobs only for the paycheck? That was the situation that helped cause the collapse of the Soviet Union.<p>In spite of the continual process of certain industries' shedding their excess workers, America has been expanding the workforce at a record rate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we've added 54 million jobs in this country since 1965, so nearly half the jobs that exist today didn't exist 30 years ago. The nations of the European Union, with nearly a third more people than the U.S., have added a fifth as many jobs over that same period.<p>That means we're about 40 million jobs ahead of the Europeans, who for the longest time were held up as a model of efficiency and humanity in labor. Yet they've got 11 percent unemployment to our 5.6 percent, and nearly 20 million Europeans are now out of work. The United Kingdom's job rolls have barely grown (and by some accounts they've actually shrunk) since the Beatles cut their first album. What do these numbers tell us about the comparative strength of our economy versus theirs? <p>There's no doubt some people have been forced into lower-paying jobs, and one group is clearly worse off than it was in 1965: the people whose education stops at high school or below. That's because steel companies and other heavy industries are no longer hiring high-paid unskilled labor. Much of the assembly-line work has been automated.<p>But the myth that corporate chieftains squeeze labor to fatten their own paychecks is just that: a myth. When health-care and other benefits are added to the equation, U.S. workers are paid a bigger share of corporate revenues than they were in the 1950s and the 1960s, which are regarded nostalgically as the heyday of American labor. Meanwhile, corporate profits are actually lower now than they were then by a large margin: 10 percent of revenue in the 1950s; 5 percent today. <p>From time to time, you'll find a corporate type who tries 
to profit at the expense of the business; we saw that in some of the leveraged buyouts of the 1980s. But as a rule, the self-interest of the CEO and the interest of the company are identical. The executives, the shareholders, and the people on the assembly line are basically in the same boat. Ask yourself this: Where is it more rewarding to work, at a struggling <a name="NYSE:KM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10830"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kmart</b></a> or a thriving Microsoft?<p>If we must blame somebody for the layoffs, it ought to be you and me. All of us are looking for the best deals in clothing, computers, and telephone service -- and rewarding the high-quality, low-cost providers with our business. I haven't met one person who would agree to pay AT&T twice the going rate for phone service if AT&T would promise to stop laying people off. These companies are responding to the constant pressure from consumers and shareholders.<p>By the way, the competitive pressures that companies face don't necessarily come from abroad. AT&T isn't worried about losing customers to Telfonos de Mexico or Philippine Long Distance. It's worried about losing customers to <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a>, the cable systems, the Baby Bells, and a slew of small companies (called resellers) that offer discount phone service.<p>Let's look at the market forces in action. Older companies in established industries are struggling to keep up with the times. Younger, more aggressive companies are challenging the older companies or starting new industries from scratch. The jobs lost when the older companies falter are made up and then some in the younger companies that succeed.<p>Business today is criticized for being heartless and greedy, but it was lambasted for being soft, lazy, and out of touch with reality not long ago. In the mid-1980s, we learned that the Japanese made better products than we did, and that the Germans worked harder than we did, and that while our corporate leaders were thinking about their golf scores and getting a good table at Lutce their corporate leaders were plotting how to outsell and outproduce us.<p>Detroit was the target of much of the criticism, and it deserved what it got. The Big Three auto companies made second-rate cars in run-down factories as the unions pressured them to pay higher and higher wages, which were tacked onto the price of the cars. So consumers got less car for more money, until the Japanese and the Germans arrived and offered more car for less money. Millions of once loyal domestic car buyers defected to foreign brands, and the auto industry became a symbol of the decline and fall of U.S. industry in general. From 1979 to 1982, <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a> was in a more or less constant state of crisis, with bankruptcy a serious threat. 
Chrysler was saved by strong leadership, layoffs, cost cutting, and an impressive lineup of new products (the minivan, the K-car, the revamped Jeep, etc.). It did get $1.5 billion in federally guaranteed loans in 1980 (which made it possible for the company to actually produce the cars that would save it), but it paid off every dime. The strong leader was Lee Iacocca, and the turnaround he orchestrated was so successful that he deserved every penny of whatever Chrysler paid him. <p>Without Iacocca, it's quite likely that Chrysler would be as extinct as Studebaker or Nash. But it is alive and solvent enough to support perhaps 500,000 workers, if you count its 126,000 employees plus those of its suppliers. That's a huge number when you consider there are only 18 million manufacturing jobs left in the U.S. Last year, Chrysler employees got an average of $3,200 in profit-sharing bonuses.<p>Other manufacturing companies followed Chrysler's lead in downsizing, cutting costs, and developing new products. Few were in as desperate a fix as Chrysler, but they had all struggled through the recession of 1982. They decided to make big changes that would free them from the old routine of adding workers in good times and laying them off in bad.<p>The urge to become more productive with a smaller workforce spread from manufacturing into retailing, pharmaceuticals, banks, financial services, and, most recently, newspapers and entertainment. Even when companies posted record earnings, they put themselves through the Chrysler drill (cut costs, make better products) to prepare for tougher times ahead. They wanted to avoid the fate of some very large companies that had failed to prepare and were lost in Chapter 11.<p>As a result of this efficiency campaign, the U.S. labor force has become the most productive in the world. According to the most recent numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American worker produces $49,600 worth of goods per year, $5,500 more than the average German and almost $12,000 more than the average Japanese. This extra productivity gives a company a lot of options. <p>Let's say it builds a new plant, where the same work crew from the old plant can increase the output by 15 percent. It can use that 15 percent to give employees a 5 percent raise, making the workers happy; to lower prices by 5 percent, making customers happy; and to still increase profits, making the shareholders happy. Of course, the productivity windfall could be divided up in different ways, but the point is that there are multiple benefits to becoming more competitive.<p>If you ask me, we have two key factors to thank for whatever prosperity we have enjoyed as a nation in recent years: Enough large companies have continued to do well,  la Chrysler, while small companies have blossomed. Without one or the other, we'd be in a sorry state.<p>A list of 25 large companies that have managed to stay in top shape appears on page 90. Many names could have been included, but these are some of the standouts. A few have overcome serious trouble. Others are in the process of turning themselves around. Others have kept up their earnings growth against the odds. Others have accelerated their growth rates, which is a rare feat for a giant enterprise such as <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a>. <p><a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a> is one of the companies that hit the accelerator. In 1975, it was a manufacturer of testing and measuring equipment, one-fifteenth the size of <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>, with annual sales of $981 million. In 1995, its sales were $31.5 billion, only 10 percent of which came from the testing and measuring divisions. The vast majority of sales ($25.3 billion) came from printers and computers. Hewlett-Packard is now half the size of IBM, a leader in printers, and ranked sixth in computer sales worldwide, even though as late as 1983 it had never made a printer. It was reinvigorated by employees who were encouraged to dream up new products.<p>Lumped together, the 25 companies on the list have doubled their sales and profits in the recent decade. They've also cut 363,000 jobs, making them likely targets for negative publicity about the downsizing disease, but I cringe when I try to imagine the troubles we'd have if they hadn't downsized and created better products. A few big bankruptcies in the Fortune 500 are all it would take to stretch the unemployment lines around several blocks. Instead of 3 million jobs lost in the 500 largest companies, we might have lost 10 million or 15 million.<p>While the innovative large companies have been holding up their end, the small companies have been blossoming remarkably. No one has an exact count on how many jobs they've generated, but we do know that 6.3 million new businesses opened their doors in the U.S. in the 1980s alone.<p>Among these 6.3 million new businesses is an elite group of high achievers. Twenty-five of the most successful are listed on page 92. All but one (Cabot) went public in the past two decades. Had we packed the list with the all-stars of the computer industry, the performance of the group would have looked even better. But we chose a representative sample from different industries to show that companies of all kinds can grow up very fast in America. We included a toy company, a payroll processor, an airline, even a company that makes the carbon black used to strengthen tires. That's Cabot, which went through a difficult period but turned itself around.<p>In 1985, these 25 small companies had sales of $31.4 billion combined, less than half the sales of Exxon alone. Their combined earnings were one-quarter of IBM's earnings. They employed 368,000 workers, while the 25 firms in our large-company category employed 2.6 million workers. <p>By March 1996, the small companies had sales of $260 billion and employed more than 1.4 million workers. So while our 25 large companies were cutting 363,000 jobs, the smaller group was adding more than a million.<p>Wal-Mart was small enough to make the small-company list in 1985, but today it is bigger than every company on the large list except <a name="NYSE:XON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10537"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Exxon</b></a>. <a name="NYSE:TOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11495"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toys 'R' Us</b></a> was a medium-sized company in 1985, but now it has more sales than Gillette or <a name="NYSE:CL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10363"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Colgate</b></a> and 22,000 more employees than <a name="NYSE:GT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10668"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Goodyear</b></a>. <a name="NASD:AMGN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12623"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Amgen</b></a> didn't exist in 1975, and in 1985 it employed 200 people. Today, it makes a pair of $200 million pharmaceuticals, Neupogen and Epogen, which helped Amgen earn more than $538 million in 1995. <p>Behind each of these companies is a leader or a couple of leaders who had the vision and the gumption to do something different. Thomas Stemberg took the business plan he wrote after getting fired from his job with a grocery chain and turned it into <a name="NASD:SPLS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14790"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Staples</b></a>, which has 25,000 employees. The $3 billion company he has created will be a $10 billion company by the year 2000. Herb Kelleher turned a hub airline into the powerful <a name="NASD:LUV"></a><b>Southwest Airlines</b>, which employs almost 20,000.<p>Some people think <a name="NYSE:FDX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10552"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Federal Express</b></a> followed the pony express, but in 1973 it was an idea rattling around in the head of Frederick W. Smith. Smith revolutionized the delivery business. When Bill McGowan and Bert Roberts at MCI dared to compete with AT&T in the long-distance market, people laughed at them. For ten years, MCI lost money, but it has survived and succeeded. Because of MCI's competition, we all pay less for long distance. <p>Twenty years ago, <a name="NYSE:NUE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11098"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nucor</b></a> was a small steel manufacturer whose embrace of a new technology called thin-slab casting allowed it to thrive when other steel companies were stumbling. Chairman Ken Iverson pays his workers based on the company's performance, and today Nucor is the country's fourth-largest producer of steel. By 2000, it will outproduce USX, which back when it was U.S. Steel was the first billion-dollar company in U.S. history.<p>Without small companies flourishing underneath the big companies, the U.S. could easily have 15 percent unemployment instead of the recently reported 5.6 percent. Then we'd be in worse shape than the countries of the EU, where large companies have resisted laying people off and where 19.6 million people (10.9 percent of the workforce) are out of work. By being paternalistic and refusing to cut costs and innovate, Europe's big companies have stagnated. Small companies are simply hard to find. The 2,740 small companies that have gone public in the U.S. in the 1990s are probably more than Europe has created in the nine centuries since Charlemagne.<p>My guess is we're in the seventh or eighth inning of downsizing, while Europe has just entered the second or third inning. They've begun the painful process that we are close to completing, and they're doing it with 20 million people already out of work. They'll need a stronger drug than Prozac to help them cope with the problems that lie ahead.<p>Of course, we don't lack for problems, either. Our overall economic growth has lagged the growth rates of other periods in our history, and our lowest-paid workers are bringing home a smaller paycheck (adjusted for inflation) than they did 25 years ago. We've got high crime and high unemployment in the inner cities, where half the children never finish high school. Our dropout problem deserves the kind of attention the layoffs have been getting, and business is not doing enough to help with a solution. There are next to no dropouts in Taiwan and Korea, and those countries will have a big advantage over the U.S. in the next century because of it.<p>But when it comes to job growth, ours is the most dynamic economy in the world. I think much of the pessimism about the 1990s may turn out to be misplaced.<p>

						Thanks to a diligent reader, a crucial adjustment to the stay-in-stocks strategy  <p> By Peter Lynch  <p> Last September's cover story,  "Fear of Crashing," drew more response than any other article I've written. The subject washow to weather a stock-market correction, which many pundits said was imminent as the Dow hit 4700. By mid-February of thisyear, the Dow had risen to 5600, so a 16 percent correction wouldhave taken it back to the 4700 that people were worrying about when the piece was written.   <p> This supports the main point I was trying to make: Corrections are unpredictable. By selling stocks to avoid pain, you can miss the next gain.  <p> The most thoughtful and challenging response to "Fear of Crashing"came from Scott Burns, a columnist for The Dallas Morning News.Burns found a flaw in my argument that an investor who needsincome can use a stock portfolio as a bond substitute, boostingthe yield when necessary by selling shares out of the portfolio.His column ran under the headline "Peter Lynch's Stock Theory May Be a Bust."  <p> Here's the plan as I presented it. Let's say you have $100,000 to invest and you want to produce a $7,000 income stream. That's7 percent a year. The normal course of action would be to buya 7 percent bond that matures at a much later date: 20 years or longer. But suppose you reject that option and put the $100,000 into a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks or into a growth-and-in comemutual fund that owns dividend-paying stocks.  <p> At the end of the first year, you get $3,000 worth of dividends from your portfolio, leaving you $4,000 short onthe income stream.You make up the difference by dipping into capital and selling $4,000 worth of shares inthe stocks or the mutual fund you bought12 months earlier.  <p> In financial circles, dipping into capital is a no-no, but in this case, if you accept certain assumptions, it makes sense.You have to believe that stock prices will continue to rise overtime and that companies will continue to raise dividends at thesame rate. You have to believe that stocks will produce a total return of 10 to 11 percent a year, on average, as they have inthe past.  <p> You might be forced to dip into capital for several years to engineer the 7 percent return, but as the companies in your portfolio raise their dividends, eventually you'll get $7,000 without having to sell any shares. Twenty years later, if stocks behave as advertised,the portfolio will be worth $349,140, so you will have more than tripled your money on top of the annual $7,000 you extracted.If you bought a $100,000 bond, the most you could hope for is your to get $100,000 back.  <p> In a bull market, this plan is a cinch to succeedlast year,for instance, when the total return from stocks was 37 percent,you could have withdrawn $7,000 and still come out $30,000 richer.My chief concern was how it would work in a bear market. I asked a number cruncher to crank up the computer, and we tested two nightmare scenarios. In the first, stock prices drop 25 percent the day after you invest the $100,000. In the second, stocksand dividends rise at half the normal rate for the next 20 years.<p>As I reported in "Fear of Crashing," the computer's verdict was thumbs up. In the first hypothetical case, you could take home your annual $7,000, and two decades later you'd be looking at a portfolio worth $185,350. In the second, you'd end up with $100,000, so you'd get back the same amount as you would have from a bond. This is where Scott Burns had his doubts.  <p> With the help of a couple of brokerage houses, Burns tested the plan on the Standard & Poor's 500 and other stock indexes going back to the 1960s. Using data from real life, Burns found a worse worst-case scenario than my two imaginary ones: the Papa Bear market of the early 1970s. In that disaster, stock pricesdropped a quick 40 percent and didn't regain their lost grounduntil the early 1980s. Any hapless investor who had bought atthe top and followed the plan, withdrawing $7,000 a year, would have gone broke. By the time the next bull market rolled around,there would have been no money left in the account.  <p> On the off chance that Burns's computers had caught a virus,I sought a second opinion on his second opinion of my first opinion.John McAllister, at the Boston-based Keystone group of mutual funds, agreed to run a test on Keystone's Growth and Income Fund,also known as S-1, which goes back to 1935 and has had a habit of paying a regular dividend. The results were disappointing.If you put $100,000 into S-1 at the peak of the market in January 1973, and extracted $7,000 every year thereafter, you were penniless by 1991. <p>Burns deserves kudos for bothering to figure this out. Clearly,it's not safe to withdraw $7,000 from a stock portfolio or a stock mutual fund if you had the bad luck to buy on the eve ofa 40 percent correction leading to a 10-year bear market.  <p> Now, I chose this 7 percent figure arbitrarily. If I'd given it more thought last fall, I would have remembered that hospitals,museums, universities, etc., customarily take a 5 percent annual draw, as they call it, from their endowments. The fiduciarieswho manage those endowments are a cautious bunch. They must have chosen 5 percent for a reason.  <p> With that in mind, I asked Keystone to test a 5 percent annual draw from the S-1 fund, assuming one had the misfortune of buying at prePapa Bear market prices in 1973. After five years, a $100,000 investment was reduced to $52,671, but eventually, stocks rallied enough to overcome this double whammy of declining prices andregular withdrawals. After 20 years, the portfolio was worth $107,653, so at least there was a $7,653 profit.  <p> Granted, a 5 percent annual return on a $100,000 investment over 20 years, plus a $7,653 capital gain, is nothing to marvel at. But we're talking about the worst-case scenario since the crash of 1929. Stocks in 1973 had a long way to fall, because they were selling for ridiculous pricesfor instance, 90 times earnings for <a name="NYSE:PRD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11198"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Polaroid</b></a>, 83 times earnings for <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a>, and76 times earnings for <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney</b></a>.  <p> Today, the Dow is selling at 16 times its 1996 earnings as projectedby Wall Street analysts, which puts it in the middle of the range of 10 to 20 times earnings, where it has roamed for 50 years.If the Dow went to 15,000 next week and you put $100,000 in the market, I guarantee you'd be unhappy with the results of a 5 percent withdrawal plan or a 0 percent withdrawal plan, for that matter.<p>

						A quick lesson in wiggle reading:  The use of standard price and earnings charts topot good buys (and bad) in growth stocks. <p> By Peter Lynch  <p> On my watch at the helm of the <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Magellan Fund</b></a>, I often consulted a chart book to check the bearings of companies in the portfolio.Many investors focus on recent price, but I like to refer to certain 10-year and 35-year charts of earnings and price to give me a clue as to a stock's future value. The charts I use arepublished by Securities Research Corporation. A subscriptionis expensive, but many libraries carry the latest copies, sothey're easy enough to find.  <p> Perhaps you follow the progress of companies with the price-to-earningsratio, or p/e. A chart will tell you more: It tells the storyof the ongoing relationship between the P and the E. It's likea tacking duel in a sailing race. As the earnings line (the E)gains or loses ground, the price line (the P) zigs and zags aboveand below it. E is the reality of a company's performance, whileP is led around by Wall Street expectations. Each chart revealssomething important about the way investors perceive a company. <p> The chart of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (shown on the nextpage), which tracks earnings and stock prices of 500 large companies lumped together, lifts the fog from the market at large. We seethe E tailing off in the recession of 1990 and 1991, while theP was on the rise. The P was ignoring the drop in the E becauseinvestors anticipated the economic recovery that began in early1992.  <p> To catch up to the rising P, the E basically had to double from1991 to 1994, which it nearly didtaking Wall Street by surprise.In 1994 alone, the E was up 40 percent while the P went nowhere.Then in 1995, the E was up another 20 percent, for a combinedgain of 65 percent in two years. This phenomenal rise in earningsis why the P in stocks had such a run in 1995.  <p> This sort of chart reading works best with growth companies,ten of which also appear on the next page. I've also thrown ina cyclical, <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a>, for variety's sake. You can tella growth company because the E keeps on a steady course, withearnings higher each year. Once you've identified a growth company from the E line, you follow the P line to get a read on whether the stock is expensive or cheap, relative to its earnings.  <p> Overpriced growth stocks are doubly risky: If the earnings take a dive, the stock price heads for the bottom, and even if the earnings go up, the stock price may take a dive, or at best treadwater. When you way overpay for growth, the risk/reward ratiois highly unfavorable. The charts can help identify those situations. <p> Here are the charts of 11 companies (in no particular order)and the stories they tell:  <p> <a name="NYSE:ABT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10030"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Abbott Labs</b></a> is a typical growth company, with the E on the riseand the P maneuvering around it. Every few years, as in 1987and 1991, investors get carried away with Abbott's prospectsand bid up the P, which puts a lot of distance between it andthe E. The best time to buy the stock is when the P comes backto the E, or drops below the E, as it did briefly in 1993. When the two lines converge, it means the company's growth rate is equal to its p/e ratioa good opportunity to invest in futuregrowth at a bargain price. Today, we see the P drifting awayfrom the E; Abbott is no longer the bargain it was two years ago, despite very good profits.  <p> Walgreen is an excellent drug chain whose P rides above the E most of the time. This shows that investors are so confident of Walgreen's knack for making money, they're willing to pay a high price for future earnings growth.   <p> The P drifted sideways in 1993 and '94. People who look onlyat stock prices might have thought something was wrong with thecompany. But the E kept rising, so people who paid attention to earnings knew the company was doing fine. The price simply got too high, as it does from time to time. It's moving in that direction again.  <p> <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a> is in the news; Warren Buffett is reportedly buyingshares. No doubt he's aware of the risk: The gap between McDonald'sP and its E hasn't been this wide since 1987, just before theOctober crash. Investors are counting on McDonald's to speedup its earnings by sending more and more Golden Arches abroad.If McDonald's doesn't accelerate the E, there's potential troubleahead for the P.  <p> <a name="NYSE:JNJ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10824"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Johnson & Johnson</b></a> was one of my recommendations at the Barron'sroundtable in January of 1994. I'd noticed the P had taken arare dip below the E, which, as usual, was on a profitable tack.You can see what's happened sincethe P reversed field and hasshot from under $40 to over $90. Johnson & Johnson is still agreat growth company with strong future prospects (I own it),but a wide gap has opened up between the lines.  <p> <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a> investors have had an unshakable faith in the rapidadvance of the E, so until recently they paid a big premium forthe P. Hence, there's been a gap you could drive a fleet through.By 1992, the P had strayed further from the E than at any timein the company's history. For three years thereafter, the earningsrose by nearly 50 percent and the stock went nowhere. Imaginethe stock's fate if the earnings had dropped.  <p> Recently, Wal-Mart's p/e gap has narrowed, making it less riskythan it was in 1992. This hulking giant can't be expected tokeep up the fast growth it enjoyed in years past, but the stockis priced for slower growth. The current p/e ratio on expected1996 earnings is about equal to that of the average stock. IfWal-Mart's new supercenter stores are successful, it has a decentshot at a decade of respectable growth.   <p> <a name="NYSE:GE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Electric</b></a> investors have always lacked faith in GE'sability to speed up the growth rate, so the P travels close tothe E and often drifts below it. This chart is telling us: "GEcan't keep up with a Wal-Mart or a McDonald's." Nevertheless,GE makes steady progress, and the E has always been on the rise.Saddam Hussein gave us a buying opportunity a few years backwhen the P veered sharply south in the months before Desert Storm. <p> <a name="NYSE:EMR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10514"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Emerson Electric</b></a>, a leading producer of electric motors andother industrial products, has sailed through recessions withouta hitch: 38 consecutive years of rising E. You can see the pointwhere Wall Street finally recognized Emerson as a reliable fastgrowerin 1991, the P crossed above the E, and it's stayed thereever since.  <p> As of this writing, Emerson sells for about $80 a share, but if the market had continued to perceive it as an unreliable slow grower, the stock might well be selling for $55 a share, a $25 difference on the same earnings. Instead of being an $18 billion company, Emerson would be a $12 billion company. That's how muchfaith in future growth can affect a shareholder's pocketbook. <p> <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola's</b></a> chart from 1984 to 1989 looked like it belongedto General Electric, and from 1988 forward, it looked like Wal-Mart's.The flagship of the soft-drink business suddenly was put on thefast track, and Wall Street noticed. While the E accelerated,the P raced ahead of it, creating a dangerous gap. At the startof 1992, any chart reader could see the P was out of line andthe E needed time to catch up to it. The P went nowhere for twoand a half years, while the earnings continued apace. Lately,the P has jumped again, and the gap has widened. Investors arebetting once more that Coke will speed up the E.  <p> Who knows how high the stock price will go? Maybe it will hit$100 or $120 a share and go from overpriced to grossly overpriced.Such an advance won't do long-term investors any good. Sooneror later, the P will come back to more sensible levels, becausewith Coke in more than 195 countries already, how can its E growthaccelerate fast enough to support the rising P?  <p> <a name="NYSE:AUD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10148"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Automatic Data Processing</b></a> is an even more consistent growerthan Coke34 years of double-digit earnings growth every quarter,and all it basically does is handle other companies' payrolls.You had a great chance to buy it in 1989 and again in 1990, whenthe P and the E converged, but since that time, optimistic investorshave bid up the P and widened the gap.  <p> <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a> is another fast grower that Wall Street givesno respect. It's a chronically underpriced growth stock whoseP stays well below the E most of the time. Investors continuouslyworry that Philip Morris will lose billions in lawsuits broughtby smokers. Yet in spite of its underachieving P, the stock isup tenfold in ten years, thanks to the spectacular rise in theE. If Philip Morris maintains its earnings growth, investorswill make money no matter what Wall Street thinks. Without thethreat of lawsuits, the stock would be worth $120 on earningsstrength, as opposed to the $90 it fetches today.  <p> Now, General Motors. Can you see why this chart doesn't fitwith the others? The E wobbles all over. It's the typical courseof a cyclical company, as unpredictable as a hurricane's path.From 1984 to 1989, GM's E was far above its P, yet the P neverrose to meet it because investors didn't believe the prosperitywould continue. They were right: From 1990 to 1992, the E felloff the chart. GM was losing billions. Today, the E has movedback to the top of the chart, but judging by the sluggish P,investors are doubting it will stay put. GM has cut costs andrevamped its operations. There's a chance the E will continueto advance and GM will ride out the next recession in the black.If that happens, investors will probably value earnings morehighly in a subsequent recovery. It's a stock I own.  <p> After saying so much about charts, I must issue the followingdisclaimer: I'm not a technical analyst, or a wiggle reader whomakes predictions on the direction of the next wiggle. I usecharts to help me find value among growth companies I follow. <p> I'd be the last person to suggest using these charts to sellyour growth companies every time they looked way overpriced.Instead of investing for the long term, you become a market timer.But if you've got an extra pile of money to invest, and you seethat your favorite growth company's P has far outdistanced itsE, you might want to hold off on buying the stock until it becomesmore reasonable. "Buy on strength," advisers may tell youbutthe charts show it's a lousy strategy.  <p> Do-it-yourselfers can plot their own charts with the help ofthe National Association of Investors Corporation, an umbrellaorganization for more than 18,000 investment clubs.

						The stock picker's stock picker finally catches up with his mailand answers readers' questions  <p> Letters from readers have been piling up on my desk for morethan three years. I appreciate the fact that so many of you havetaken the time to ask questions and make comments. This keepsthe mail carriers in shape, and I never get lonely. I'm takingthis opportunity to answer a few of your questions in public. <p>  <p>What's your current opinion of <a name="NYSE:PIR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11185"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pier 1 Imports</b></a>? <p>Carl J. Cooper, Rockwall, Texas  <p> I bought Pier 1 (NYSE: PIR) for the Magellan Fund in the mid-1980s,but it was really my wife, Carolyn, who discovered it. She likedthe eclectic assortment of furniture, rugs, pottery, and glassware--allimported from exotic places like Mexico and the Far East, butwithout the exotic prices these items would have fetched at Bloomingdale's. <p> In 1991, I recommended Pier 1 again after the stock had fallento $7 a share. The economy was in a recession, money was tight,and buying a new couch wasn't high on most people's shoppinglists. Mom-and-pop furniture stores were going out of business,and big department stores were closing their home-furnishingdepartments. I figured as soon as the recession ended and peoplecould afford to redecorate, Pier 1 would capture a huge chunkof a market that had been abandoned by its former competitors.Also, at the $7 price it looked cheap.  <p> Today, Pier 1 has 651 stores. The key element to the expansionplan is that 100 of its newest 150 outlets have opened in whatthe company calls "single-store markets"--places like Hattiesburg,Mississippi; Rapid City, South Dakota; and Twin Falls, Idaho.The company is expanding into smaller cities where it can attracta bigger percentage of the shoppers. These people no longer haveto drive 150 miles to buy a rattan room divider.  <p> Pier 1 has continued to cut costs and reduce debt, and it'salso expanding abroad, with ten stores in the United Kingdomand outlets installed in several Sears stores in Mexico. TheMexican experiment has been a modest success, in spite of a severerecession there, and when Mexico recovers, results should improve.Although 1995 has been tough for U.S. retailers, Pier 1's domesticsales are up 11 percent. The company is likely to post recordearnings of 85 cents a share for 1995. Analysts expect it toearn $1 a share in 1996.   <p> As I write this, the stock is selling for about $10. Obviously,it's not as cheap as it was in 1991, but it's still undervaluedat 10 times the 1996 estimated earnings, in a market where theaverage stock sells for 15 times earnings. Pier 1 is a maturecompany that is no longer growing at 20 percent a year, but itcan be a decent long-term performer. I still own the stock. Andevery August, my two older daughters, who are away at school,furnish their rooms in Pier 1.  <p> ----- <p>I enjoyed your article "Charlie Silk's 150-Bagger" in the May1994 issue. I'm curious about what sources Charlie uses to findcash-rich companies with no debt and good earnings growth.  <p>C.J. Biddle, La Jolla, California  <p> That was the article in which I nominated Charlie as the world'sgreatest amateur investor. Figuring he ought to answer your question,I coaxed him into providing the following:  <p> My search for undervalued Nasdaq stocks begins with Barron's,which I study every week, noting the stocks making new 12-monthlows that have fallen 50 percent or more from their 12-monthhighs. I take this list of the downtrodden and review their fundamentalsin either the Standard & Poor's monthly guide or Moody's OTCIndustrial Manual. I reject the companies that have a low cashposition or a declining sales trend. I'm also looking for companieswhose current assets are at least two times greater than alltheir debt.  <p> Whenever a company passes these hurdles, I call the investor-relationsperson and request the latest annual report, 10-K, proxy statement,and product literature. I study these materials to get a feelfor the business, the products, and the competition. Weighingthese various factors, I choose an "entry point," a price atwhich I would begin to accumulate the stock.  <p> The most important factor is the cash or cash equivalents onhand. My goal is to find situations where there's little or nodebt and the cash per share is nearly equal to or greater thanthe price of the stock. I've never seen a company with a lotof cash and not much debt go bankrupt.  <p> A basic rule is to have the safest investment value with thesmallest downside risk. The next most important considerationis the probability of a turnaround. Was this price decline atemporary aberration that can be reversed, and is there a possiblere-acceleration of growth?  <p> This approach works best at the year's end, due to tax-lossselling pressures or after a significant market decline. In afrothy market, there are very few opportunities.   <p> ----- <p>Last March you wrote about Cedar Fair. Of all the hundreds ofstocks available, how do you focus on a few to study and research? <p>Raymond Capobianco, Foster, Rhode Island  <p> There are attractive companies everywhere: cyclicals, fast growers,slow growers, some that pay a dividend, others that don't. Mytheory is to stay flexible. When people limit themselves to acertain kind of company, they also limit their opportunities. <p> I'm always on the lookout for companies that have no debt, lowprice-to-earnings ratios, good records, and prospects in businessesthat are easy to understand. These don't come along every day.Once I get to know a company, I look for the chance to buy moreshares when the price happens to drop for reasons that have nothingto do with the fundamentals.  <p> I discovered <a name="NYSE:FUN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10305"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cedar Fair L.P.</b></a> (NYSE: FUN)in the pile of prospectuseson my desk. It had just come public in 1987, but it had ownedand operated its amusement-park business for over 100 years.Here was a company that had a good growth rate and paid a dividendof 10 percent, which is rare for a solid growth company.   <p> Later, my family and I did the on-site research, riding theroller coasters at Cedar Fair's three amusement parks in Ohio,Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. Many of the 70 million people wholive within driving distance of these parks already knew thiscompany firsthand, so they were a step ahead of me. This is anotherexample of finding great investments close to home. None of thebig Wall Street firms bothered to follow Cedar Fair, but amateurinvestors had the perfect chance.  <p> The story is simple to follow. The parks are only open a fewmonths a year, so you've got those off-season months to studythe quarterly and annual reports. If the stock price drops inthe idle months, you know it's not because the company has reportedbad results. There are no results to report.  <p> This is where it can pay to wait for a buying opportunity. In1987, Cedar Fair had just come public at $10 when the marketwent over the ledge. Suddenly, you could buy FUN for $6, withan 18 percent yield. Because the market had crashed, people wereworried that the country was headed into a recession. But ifyou did your homework, you realized that Cedar Fair's businesswouldn't be affected for at least six months, because the parkshad just closed.   <p> In 1990, when the recession jitters hit the market once again,you had another opportunity to buy Cedar Fair on a dip. If youkeep a list of stocks you'd like to own and watch them like avulture, eventually you will get the chance to swoop.  <p> Cedar Fair had a great run from its $6 low in 1987 to its all-timehigh of $36 in 1993. It's been trading between $26 and $36 eversince. The company also keeps raising the dividend--this year,it's $2.30 a share.  <p> In 1995, Cedar Fair acquired two adjoining parks outside KansasCity, Missouri. Every year, a fantastic new ride is added atone or more of the parks, the latest being the new $12 millionroller coaster in Ohio. Next year, Wild Thing will be installedin the Valleyfair park near Minneapolis. This roller coasterwill be more than 200 feet tall, with a weightless zone at thecrest of the second hill. I can't wait to do the research onit.  <p> The only hitch is that Cedar Fair enjoys a favorable tax status,which is likely to run out in late 1997. But the market has alreadydiscounted that. Even if Cedar Fair paid a normal tax rate in1996, the stock is valued at 15 times 1996 estimated earnings,so it's cheaper than the average company in the S&P 500. I ownthe stock.  <p> ----- <p>In Beating the Street you gave <a name="ADR:BDSPY"></a><b>Body Shop</b> a great write-up. Thestock has dropped nearly 49 percent since I bought it. What areits prospects? <p>William A. Boudreau  Nesconset, New York  <p> Here is another example of why investors should focus on whetherthe story is still valid. A stock can fall in half, only to reboundso you end up making several times your money. I'm not sure BodyShop (LON: BOS; ADR: BDSPY) will have such a rebound, but ithas the potential.  <p> The stock price tripled from a low of 125 pence (this is a Britishcompany) in 1990 to a high of 375 pence in 1992, and lately ithas fallen back below 140. The earnings declined in 1993, largelybecause of recessions in three of the Body Shop's most maturemarkets: the U.K., Australia, and Canada. In 1994, the earningsmade a nice recovery, but the company predicts that they willbe lower for the first half of 1995. Earnings would be higherexcept the company is spending a lot of money to introduce newproducts in the U.S. and to revamp its packaging. The Body Shopfaces stiff competition from The Limited's Bath & Body Worksin the U.S. But whether Body Shop succeeds in the U.S. may notbe that important. What's really important is what happens inthe 44 other countries where it has gained a foothold.  <p> The company could concentrate on those 44 markets alone andenjoy excellent growth for the next decade. But it has plansto open Body Shops in China, Korea, and India. This is a fast-growingglobal operation that is opening 150 new stores a year. <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> is in almost 200 countries worldwide, and there's no reason BodyShop can't reach the same audience.  <p> A company that can manage to grow at 20 percent a year willdouble its earnings every three and a half years. The earningsquadruple every 7 years, and increase eightfold every 14 years.That's how you make big money.  <p> That's the upside. I wouldn't take a chance on Body Shop ifthe company were saddled with debt. Then I'd be facing bankruptcyrisk. But Body Shop is debt free. It is a profitable company,and the stock is very cheap. In my opinion, the risk/reward isfavorable. I own it, and I'm sticking with it.   <p> ----- <p>In October you wrote about buying shares in savings & loans.But how are the stocks of S&Ls allotted to depositors? Does thenumber of shares you're allowed to buy depend on how much moneyyou have on deposit? It hardly makes sense to keep thousandsof dollars on deposit for a handful of shares.  <p>Murray Dornfeld, New York, New York  <p> You usually have to keep at least $50 on deposit, and sometimesthe minimum can go as high as $500, but beyond that, the sizeof the deposit has no effect on the allotment of shares if theS&L decides to go public. You generally can buy as many sharesas anyone else.  <p> It doesn't matter how you've deposited the money, whether it'sin a checking account, a savings account, or a CD. What doesmatter is when you opened the account. Again, the rules vary,but people who get first dibs on the shares are usually thosewho've had an account with the S&L at least a year before it announces the offering.   <p> It's too bad 98 percent of people who have deposits in S&Ls that go public pass up the chance to research and then considerbuying shares. They throw away the announcements and prospectuses they get in the mail. Don't dismiss these offers. Most of them have turned out to be great investments.  <p>  <p>Written with John Rothchild.

Some thought this investment opportunity was too good to last. They were wrong. The local S&L is still a heck of a place to put your money.<p>By Peter Lynch<p>When last we looked into it, investing in the local savings and loan when it went public was the closest thing to printing money that ever came a stock picker's way. Between 1991 and 1994, some 300 new S&Ls issued shares that gained an average of 30 percent on the first day of trading and 60 percent within three months, on their way to doubles, triples, and even a few quadruples. (It's also remarkable that fewer than a handful of these are trading below their offering prices.)  But in early 1994, regulators put a temporary stop to this bonanza.<p>What created the bonanza in the first place was a quirk in the way these institutions took shape. Founded many decades ago (and in many cases a hundred years ago), America's thrifts were organized along the lines of a co-op. They were run for the benefit of depositors, but they weren't owned by anyone in particular.<p>So when the thrifts (the term covers S&Ls, mutual savings banks, and some other creatures) began to go public, there were no previous owners to pay off, as happens in most public offerings. Instead of a big chunk of the proceeds ending up in the pockets of the company's founders, all the money was returned to the company till.<p>For the lucky buyers of the shares, the result was the same as buying a new car for cash, then discovering that the dealer has left the cash in the glove compartment as a car-warming present. Let's say the local S&L had a book value of $20 million, the result of decades of earnings built up inside the company. Then it went public and sold $20 million worth of shares in the offering. That $20 million invested by the shareholders became their thrift-warming present to themselves; in effect, they were buying the business for nothing. And because their $20 million was injected into the S&L, the book value doubled overnight, from $20 million to $40 million. Theoretically, each share was now worth twice as much as the investors had paid for it.<p>This explains the big "pop" on opening day, when the newly issued shares began to trade on the stock exchanges. The price almost always took a jump to catch up to the fact that the value of the company had doubled in the act of going public. There were no former owners to cry foul, as they surely would have in a traditional offering had their company been sold for half price to public buyers who stood to make a greater profit than the previous owners.<p>In these hundreds of thrift "conversions," as it's known when a thrift goes public, every person with a savings account in the institution was invited to buy shares at the initial low price! Twice in the past four years (in a column and a Worth cover story), I attempted to describe the merits of investing in S&Ls as they went public or, for that matter, investing in S&Ls that had already gone public and were still selling at what seemed to be bargain rates. Reviews of the publicly traded thrifts I suggested researching last year and in 1992 are shown on this page.<p>Sadly, only a small percentage of depositors nationwide took advantage of the opportunity to buy shares in the public offerings in their own neighborhoods. The vast majority of the shares (98 percent by some accounts) were scooped up by professional investors who roamed the country opening savings accounts so they would get the right to participate in as many conversions as possible. The loyal customers who had maintained savings accounts at the local S&L for decades turned their backs on these deals while the outsiders took home the spoils.<p>There were a few notorious cases where the managers and directors of the local thrift gave themselves an ample supply of free stock or stock options going into a conversion. To stop this profiteering, the Office of Thrift Supervision slapped a moratorium on conversions in early 1994. As soon as the moratorium was announced, a chorus of industry watchers proclaimed that the game was over, but four months later the moratorium was lifted. <p>Once again, the regulators would allow conversions, subject to new restrictions. Insiders could no longer reward themselves with bushelfuls of free shares and options, and the underwriters who took these companies public were pressured to raise the offering prices to take some of the pop out of these stocks.<p>Though the game wasn't over, it had definitely changed. In 1994, 100 thrifts went public. The stock prices of the 68 that traded on Nasdaq gained 17 percent on average on the first day, but by the end of the year, they were up only 16 percent.<p>There were two reasons for this disappointing performance: a lackluster stock market in late 1994 and the confusion surrounding the new regulations. Since that confusion has now been resolved, the 1994 conversion class is up 48 percent from the initial offering prices. The table on page shows the top-performing thrifts that went public in 1994, as of mid-1995. [Tables and graphs are not included in the Worth OnLine archives.]<p>For last year's article ("Bank on   It," April 1994), the staff at SNL Securities, a Charlottesville, Virginia, research firm that is our favorite authority on the subject, gave us the names of 100 thrifts that were not yet public but were likely candidates for eventual conversion. Eight of those have converted thus far, with an average one-day pop of 18 percent and an average gain of 34 percent as of this writing. Seven more thrifts on that list have conversions pending<p>In 1995, we've seen 53 thrifts go public, with an average gain of 14.7 percent on the first day of trading and 27 percent after three months. These results don't quite measure up to the bonanza of years past, but a 27 percent gain__in just 90 days__is a better return than you'd get from a savings account in five years.<p>One reason for the return of the bigger pops is that shares in the recent offerings have been priced at an average of 64 percent of book value, as opposed to the 73 percent in 1994, when the Feds were leaning on underwriters (who price the shares) to make the thrift conversions less lucrative.<p>It still makes sense to do what I suggested a year ago in these pages: Scout the area where you live or work for thrifts that haven't yet gone public, and open a savings account in each. In most cases, if you maintain an account for six months, you'll be able to buy shares if a conversion occurs. If the conversion never happens, you haven't lost anything, and you'll collect interest along the way.<p>The number of unconverted institutions has dropped from 2,524 ten years ago to 1,036 today, and at the rate they've been going public, they may all be public by 2005. Although many of the remaining thrifts are small (many have only one branch), my sources at SNL Securities estimate they represent between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in "embedded gains" that could end up in the pockets of the pioneer investors.<p>SNL's update on likely conversion candidates is shown at left. We offer our special thanks to Paul Doherty and Bill Kerkam for providing us with this data.<p>Before you purchase a single share in a thrift going public, you'll receive (as an account holder) a prospectus with all the details about what you may be buying__this is one gift horse whose mouth ought to be looked into. Here are some of the important points:
* At minimum, you want the thrift to be profitable. You're getting it for nothing, but unless it's a profitable and healthy enterprise, it may be worth less than zero.
* You want it to have a solid balance sheet and not be saddled with problem loans. You want the price-to-earnings ratio to be relatively low (last year I suggested p/e's of 10 or below), the equity-to-assets ratio to be relatively high (5 or above), and the percentage of nonperforming assets to be on the decline.
* You want to see insiders buying the shares and paying the same price as you. Insider buying must be fully reported in the prospectus, so you can easily find out whether the managers and directors are risking their own money on the future success of the thrift. If they believe in the deal as much as you do, it's a good sign.
* You also want the amount of money raised in the offering to roughly correspond to the book value of the company before the offering. If a local thrift with a book value of $10 a share plans to raise $100 a share in the IPO, the buyers will be paying $100 to get $110 in assets__hardly a bargain. But if that same thrift with a $10 book value plans to raise $10 a share in the IPO, the buyers will be paying $10 to get $20 in assets, the kind of favorable math that produces a nice pop.
* If you don't like what you see in the prospectus, you don't have to participate in the offering. Nobody is forcing you to invest.
A special note about so-called "mutual holding companies." A small number of thrifts have adopted this form of organization because it allows them to sell a minority interest in the business, with the insiders keeping permanent control and preventing a potential takeover. These deals are less attractive for investors. The real earnings power and real book value of the banks are understated, and the stocks don't have much lift. <p>In years past, even if you never bought shares in a single conversion, you could make a good living buying shares in recently converted, profitable S&Ls that were selling at modest p/e ratios and below book value. But the pickings are much slimmer than they were a year ago. As you can see in the table below, [Tables and graphs are not included in the Worth OnLine archives.] the S&Ls I've put on the current research list are quite expensive compared with those on my earlier research list. Of the thrifts on this list, I own <a name="NASD:ALBK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13377"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Astoria Financial</b></a>, <a name="NASD:CMRN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=44328"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cameron Financial</b></a>, <a name="NASD:CARV"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=44709"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Carver Federal Savings</b></a>, <a name="NASD:GNPT"></a><b>GP Financial</b>, and <a name="NASD:QCBC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17064"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Quaker City</b></a>.<p>In 1994, 13 of the 15 publicly traded thrifts on my list had p/e ratios of 10 or below, whereas 7 of the 15 on my new list have p/e ratios above 10. On the 1994 list, 14 of the 15   were trading below book value, but on this latest list, nine are trading above book. It's hard to find real bargains in today's higher-priced market.<p>Before the moratorium, the typical thrift stock would advance in three phases: the original pop, the gradual rise to book value, and a secondary pop when the thrift was acquired by a larger institution at a premium to its book value. In recent years, these secondary pops have been quite spectacular, taking the stock prices to new heights__150 to 170 percent of book value. The possibility of a takeover gives us another reason for investing in thrifts, although in the near future, we may not see as many takeovers as we've seen in the recent past.<p>While 1995 has been a banner year for bank mergers__a trend that is expected to continue__the number of thrifts acquired by banks has been declining. Of the active buyers from 1991 to 1994 (including AmSouth, <a name="NASD:FITB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13381"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fifth Third</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:BKB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10175"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bank of Boston</b></a>, First Fidelity, First Interstate, <a name="NYSE:FLT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10585"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fleet</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:PNC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11138"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PNC</b></a>, and Shawmut), only <a name="NYSE:FTU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10578"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>First Union</b></a> has continued to buy thrifts. Measured by assets sold, the takeover rate in the first half of 1995 is 60 percent behind the 1994 rate. The experts at SNL Securities tell us this is because thrifts are currently too expensive.<p>We've gone through a period of bankers' nirvana, several years of steady interest rates and a decent economy, and banks have used these good conditions to eliminate problem loans and strengthen their balance sheets. If these conditions continue, so much the better, but if they don't, sooner or later we may see a sell-off in the thrift-banking stocks, which would create new opportunities all over again.
There are two additional factors, one short-term and one long-term, that make thrifts attractive. In the short term, regulators are nearing an agreement that would lower the premiums on deposit insurance. There is already a surplus in the Bank Insurance Fund, which covers savings banks. The Savings Association Insurance Fund, which covers S&Ls, is undercapitalized, and the government is considering hitting SAIF-insured institutions with a one-time charge of $6 billion to bolster the reserves. Following that infusion of money, the premiums on S&L deposit insurance would be reduced as well.<p>For thrifts covered by the BIF, the drop in premiums could increase earnings by 10 percent or more. Those covered by SAIF will have to pay their share of the $6 billion, which might cost them 85 cents on every $100 of deposits. This one-time hit would cause them to suffer an immediate drop in book value, but the lower insurance premiums would boost their earnings for years thereafter.<p>In the long run, what keeps me interested in the banking and thrift business is the likelihood of future takeovers and mergers. As the government relaxes the prohibitions against interstate banking, we're bound to see more consolidation. There are too many banks and too many chicken restaurants in this country already. I've said this before, but Great Britain has a population of 58 million and only seven different banks, while we've got almost five times the crowd and more than 20,000 banks__if you count the credit unions, thrifts, national banks, regional banks, and so on.<p>We don't need all these separate buildings, software systems, boardrooms, and highly paid administrators. Every time a thrift is taken over, the acquiring bank can cut costs upstairs and increase productivity downstairs. The acquiring bank can make better use of the thrift's deposits by lending them to a wider range of borrowers over a larger geographical area and by making numerous types of loans where they have a lot of experience and expertise. The entire industry will become more efficient__just like the phone companies, drug companies, and a whole gamut of other companies already have. <p>Written with John Rothchild.

						Think the market's headed for a fall? No argument here--unless you think you know when, or that there's a better survival strategy than owning great stocks.  <p> by Peter Lynch with John Rothchild  <p> The Dow's passing 4700 has brought new worries about a nastycorrection. The worrying started as soon as we recovered fromthe last nasty correction, in 1990. There's no end to the listof probable causes for a repeat: Too many mutual funds are chasingtoo few stocks, stocks are overpriced, the dividend yield onthe Dow is at an all-time low, and--this one is my favorite--notenough investors are worried.  <p> Let me go on record with Lynch's prediction: Another big correctionis on the way. I'd bet the ranch on it, if I had a ranch. Itmay come this year, next year, or the year the Red Sox win theWorld Series (don't hold your breath!), but sooner or later,it will happen. You read it here first.  <p> On what do I base this bold assertion? Stocks have declined10 percent or more on 53 occasions since the turn of the century.That's roughly one correction occurring every two years.* And on 15 of these 53 occasions, stocks have declined 25 percentor more. That's one nasty correction (also known as a bear market)every six years.  <p> For all I know, another bear may have arrived on the scene bythe time this article reaches the newsstands. Or the equity godsmay wait until the Dow reaches 6500 before they decide to knockit back to 4700, today's highs becoming tomorrow's lows. Or we could drop from today's levels straight down to 3100.  <p> Make no mistake: Corrections can be scary experiences. People lose confidence in the economy, in their portfolios, and in the companies in which they've invested. It's like a storm that rollsin and blackens the sky. Fear sets in.  <p> If only we didn't have indexes--the Dow, the Standard & Poor's500, and so forth--that enable us to track the ups and downs of "the market," we'd never have this problem with corrections. Do you know what the range is between the high and the low priceof the average stock on the New York Stock Exchange in any given year? Fifty percent. So most stocks fluctuate 50 percent fromtop to bottom every year, without any fanfare.  <p> We remember the 1000-point drop in the Dow from August to October1987, the scariest correction in recent times. But we forgetthe 1000-point rise in the Dow in the 11 months preceding thatdrop--a remarkably fast gain, considering that it had taken theDow four years to tack on the previous 1000 points. If we hadbeen sequestered like a jury during all of 1987, we would havecome out thinking the market was flat for the year, and nobodywould have panicked.  <p> But we do have indexes and we are preoccupied with their upsand downs, so we will have scary corrections. If we tack on another 1000 points from here and the Dow rises to 5700 in short order,the chances of another big decline increase considerably.  <p> Assuming you agree with my forecast, how can we prepare? Mostly by doing nothing.  <p> This is where a market calamity is different from a meteorological calamity. Since we've learned to take action to protect ourselvesfrom snowstorms and hurricanes, it's only natural that we wouldtry to prepare ourselves for corrections, even though this is one case where being prepared like a Boy Scout can be ruinous.Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for correctionsor trying to anticipate corrections than has been lost in correctionsthemselves.  <p> The first mistake is hedging the portfolio. Anticipating a dropin the market, the skittish investor begins to dabble in futuresand options, the kind of investment that will make a profit whenstocks decline. People think of this as correction insurance.It seems cheap at first, but the options expire every coupleof months, and if stocks don't go down on schedule, people haveto buy more options to renew the policy. Suddenly, investing isn't so simple. Investors can't decide whether they're rooting for stocks to falter, so their insurance will pay off, or fora rally, for the sake of the portfolio.  <p> Hedging is a tricky business even the pros haven't mastered--otherwise,why have so many hedge funds gone out of business in recent years?Hedge-fund managers have been sighted in unemployment lines. <p> The second and more prevalent mistake is the ritual known aslightening up. This time, our skittish investors, again fearingthe correction is imminent, sell some or all of their stocks and stock mutual funds. Or they put off buying stocks in companiesthey like and sit on their cash, waiting for the crash. "Better safe than sorry," they tell themselves. "I'll wait for the dayof reckoning, when all the suckers who didn't see this comingare wailing and gnashing their teeth, and I'll snap up bargainsleft and right." (But once the market reaches bottom, the cashsitters are likely to continue to sit on their cash. They'rewaiting for further declines that never come, and they miss therebound.)  <p> They may still call themselves long-term investors, but they'renot. They've turned themselves into market timers, and unlesstheir timing is very good, the market will run away from them.  <p> Market timing was quite popular about 2700 Dow points ago, whenclients of mutual funds were encouraged to switch back and forth from stock funds to the money market, thereby avoiding any unpleasant corrections. The signals were sent out by self-appointed heads of "switching services" who charged hefty fees (as high as 3percent a year) for their canny advice. People were paying their switch-fund advisors two to eight times as much as they paidin management fees to the funds themselves.  <p> Whereas in most states barbers have to pass a test before theyare allowed to cut hair, there is no test for switch forecasters. My advice for anyone who is still paying for such a service: Go back and carefully check the results before you give anotherpenny to a switching service. Have you really avoided the corrections,or have you avoided the best months of the greatest bull marketin history? It pains me to think how many people have done thelatter.  <p> A review of the S&P 500 going back to 1954 shows how expensiveit is to be out of stocks during the short stretches when theymake their biggest jumps. If you kept all your money in stocksthroughout these 40 years, your annual return on investment was11.4 percent. If you were out of stocks for the ten most profitablemonths, your return dropped to 8.3 percent. If you missed the20 most profitable months, your return was 6.1 percent; the 40 most profitable, and you made only 2.7 percent. Imagine that:If you were out of stocks for 40 key months in 40 years, trying to avoid corrections, your stock portfolio underperformed yoursavings account.  <p> The same computer that gave us that revelation also contributedthe following: If you invested $2,000 in the S&P 500 on January1 of every year since 1965, your annual return has been 11 percent.If you were unlucky and managed to invest that $2,000 at thepeak of the market in each year, your annual return has been 10.6 percent.  <p> Or if you were lucky and invested the $2,000 at the low pointin the market, you ended up with 11.7 percent. In other words,in the long run it doesn't matter much whether your timing isgood or bad. What matters is that you stay invested in stocks. <p> Recently, Forbes published its hit parade of the richest peoplein the world, and I was reminded that there's never been a market timer on the list. If it were truly possible to predict corrections, you'd think somebody would have made billions by doing it.  <p> The fact that nobody has done so ought to tell us somethingabout our chances of dodging the drops. Warren Buffett weighsin at No. 2 on the Forbes list. He got there by picking stocksand not by switching in and out of them.  <p> Buffett switched only once in his career, in the late 1960s,when Wall Street fell so hopelessly in love with a select groupof growth companies that no price was too high to pay for them.At the point of maximum silliness, <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a> was selling for 83 times earnings and <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney</b></a> for 76, whereas in saner times,they might sell for 20 times earnings. These two companies, and 48 others in the so-called Nifty Fifty, were so overvalued thatit took them ten years to catch up to their price tags. So ifyou're looking for more concrete advice than I've offered sofar, take a tip from Warren Buffett and get out of stocks that are selling for 83 times earnings. Otherwise, stay the courseand resist the temptation to outsmart corrections.  <p> In telling you this, I'm assuming you're in stocks for the longhaul: two score years or beyond. Never invest money in stocksif you are going to need it for some other purpose in the foreseeablefuture. Twenty years is a reasonable horizon for investing. Thatought to be long enough for your stocks to overcome the worstof times, such as the stretch between 1966 and 1982, when theDow stumbled from a peak of 1000 to a nadir of 777 And here'sa reassuring point: When you include the dividends, stocks inthe S&P 500 gave a total return of 75.37 percent during that depressing 16-year period, or 3.5 percent annualized. Thanksto dividends, corrections aren't necessarily as bad as they'remade out to be.  <p> As soon as you realize you can afford to wait out any correction,the calamity also becomes an opportunity to pick up bargains. <p> The table on page 83 shows a few examples of how the four nastiest corrections in recent history (1973-74, 1981-82, 1987, and 1990) actually paid us a favor by giving us the chance to buy greatcompanies at fire-sale prices. If it's happened before, it will happen again.  <p> THE ANATOMY OF A CORRECTION  <p> How have different types of companies fared in those four corrections?Do all stocks correct equally? To answer those questions, I enlistedthe help of Deborah Pont, my dogged researcher at Worth, whoin turn enlisted the help of Standard & Poor's, the Frank RussellCo., and Safian Investment Research. Together, we came up witha large table (on the next page) involving four broad categories,each represented by an index. Large companies are representedby the S&P 500; small companies by the Russell 2000; growth companiesby the Safian growth index; and cyclical companies by the Safian cyclical index.  <p> It's obvious from these numbers that growth companies were thestar performers during and after two of these corrections, andthey held their own in the Saddam Hussein correction of 1990.The only time you wished you didn't own them was 197374, whengrowth stocks were grossly overpriced, as we've already mentioned. <p> For those who haven't boned up on the subject, a growth companyis a steady performer that can prosper in all economic conditions,as opposed to a cyclical, which lurches from rags to riches andback again. A typical lineup of growth companies includes thosethat make software and soft drinks, drug makers and fast-foodchains, specialty retailers and service-related businesses, andeven a cigarette manufacturer, <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a>. Sam Stovall, editor of Standard & Poor's Industry Reports and an avid student ofcorrections, calls these the "eat 'em, drink 'em, smoke 'em,and pay-for-it-by-going-to-the-doctor type stocks."  <p> After the infamous 1987 bear market, when investors in the Dowindustrial stocks were traumatized by a 33 percent loss fromthe August top to the October bottom, including the terrifying 508-point one-day drop, investors in growth stocks were still ahead by 8.5 percent and getting a good night's sleep. In 1990,growth stocks lost a bit more ground than the cyclicals on thedownside but far less than the three other categories of stocks,and they've kept pace with the cyclicals on the upside.  <p> I've long been a fan of growth companies, but in the courseof collecting data for this article, I was amazed to discoverthat since 1949, an investment in the 50 growth stocks on Safian's list has returned over 230-fold, while the cyclicals have returned only 19-fold. Whether they are owned individually or as an elementof mutual funds, growth stocks have given their owners fewer heartaches and many happy returns.   <p> THE CASE FOR ZERO PERCENT BONDS--THAT IS, YOU SHOULDN'T OWNANY  <p> This brings me to an investment strategy I described in my secondbook, Beating the Street. If I convince you of its merits, youwill never again buy a bond or a bond fund, and you'll stay fully invested in stocks forever.  <p> There are two main arguments for owning bonds: They give youincome so you can pay the bills, and they add ballast to your portfolio. Unless you're talking about bonds of the short-termvariety (two to four years), the ballast argument is false. Long-termbonds can be almost as volatile as stocks. They have their owncorrections: When interest rates go up, bond prices go down justas fast as stock prices. If you're not willing to hold a bondto maturity, you're exposing yourself to potential losses, thesame as in stocks. And bonds have no upside to reward you forthis risk if they're held to maturity. You collect the interestalong the way, but in the end, the best you can hope for is toget reimbursed.   <p> In the nine decades in this century, bonds have outperformedstocks only once--in the 1930s. They came close in the 1980s,but in the first half of the 1990s, stocks have once again provedtheir superiority. People are living longer these days, so manyretirees who buy bonds for the income are discovering that theymay end up needing more money than they thought they would. Theycould use some growth in their principal, but they aren't gettingit.  <p> The strategy I'm proposing can offer the best of both worlds:money to live on that normally comes from bonds, and growth thatcomes from stocks. Here's how it works. You sink 100 percentof your investment capital into a portfolio of companies thatpay regular dividends. You could do this the easy way and investin an S&P 500 index fund, currently yielding about 3 percent.Or you could select a few "dividend achievers," as identified by Moody's. These are the companies that have a habit of raisingtheir dividends year after year no matter what.   <p> According to the latest Moody's list, no fewer than 332 publiclytraded companies have accomplished this for at least ten yearsin a row. The list includes some obscure names but also a lotof familiar ones, the likes of <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a>, <a name="AMEX:HAS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12007"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hasbro</b></a>, Philip Morris, and <a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a>. (To get a copy of the Handbook of Dividend Achieversfor $19.95, call Moody's at 800-342-5647, extension 0546.)  <p> Since dividends are paid out of earnings, these dividend achieverscouldn't have compiled such a record without having enjoyed consistentsuccess in their core business, whatever it is. So you're lookingat a group of profitable enterprises with staying power.  <p> Let's say you've got $100,000 to invest for the long term, andyou need an income of $7,000 per annum to make ends meet. Youcan get it by purchasing a 30-year bond paying 7 percent. Butinstead, you take Lynch's advice, shun the bonds, and build aportfolio of stocks that pays you a 3 percent dividend. In thefirst year you get $3,000 in dividends. Since you need $7,000to live on, you're $4,000 short on the income side, but thatcan be solved. You sell $4,000 worth of stock.   <p> It may sound crazy to be selling shares that you bought 12 monthsearlier, but bear with me. Let's assume the prices have goneup 8 percent, which is the historical norm for stocks. (Overtime, stocks return 8 percent on the price gains and 3 percenton the dividends, for a total return of 11 percent.) Betweenthe dividends and the price gains, your portfolio would be worth$111,000 after the first year if you left it alone. But you don't.You take out the $3,000 in dividends and you sell the $4,000chunk of stock. After putting this $7,000 in your pocket, youbegin year two with $104,000 in the account.   <p> You can see from the table on the next page what happens next.The companies in which you've invested raise their dividendsas usual, so in the second year, the portfolio gives you an incomeof $3,120. At the end of year two, you have to sell only $3,880worth of stock to reach your $7,000 goal. Every year thereafter,as dividends are raised and stock prices go up, you're sellingless and less stock to cover your expenses. In year 16, you receive$7,000 out of the dividends alone, and from this point forward,you never have to sell a single share to get the customary payout.In fact, your payout goes up.  <p> These numbers are theoretical, but they're based on the averagereturns from stocks and dividends over this entire century. Assumingthese same results hold for the future, after 20 years, youroriginal $100,000 will have grown into $349,140. You'll be morethan three times richer than when you started, on top of the$146,820 worth of dividends you've spent along the way. By takingthe bond route, you would have received $140,000 in interestand gotten your $100,000 back.  <p> If this dividend strategy is such a great idea, why aren't morepeople taking advantage of it? I suspect it's the same reasonthey own more bonds than stocks ($9.4 trillion to $6.5 trillion,at current count) when stocks are clearly more profitable overtime. They think they're jinxed. They're worried about the nextnasty correction, and they're convinced it will happen the dayafter they invest in stocks. Perhaps you count yourself as oneof this unlucky crowd.  <p> The best way to cope with the fear of crashing is to assumethe worst and examine the results. Let's assume, then, that youare jinxed, and the day after you invest your entire $100,000in dividend achievers, the market has its worst session in historyand your portfolio loses 25 percent of its value overnight. <p> Fidelity's Bob Beckwitt ran the numbers. In spite of the immediate25 percent loss, if you stuck with the plan, sold shares to augmentthe return, and collected your $146,820 in dividends along theway, at the end of the 20th year your portfolio would be worth$185,350. That's not as good as $349,140, but it puts you $85,350ahead of the $100,000 bond.  <p> Let's imagine an even more terrible case: a recession that lasts20 years. The country is in its worst slump since the Great Depression.In this prolonged crisis, companies struggle to increase theirprofits, and instead of share prices and dividends increasingat the normal rate of 8 percent and 3 percent, respectively,these returns are cut in half. Still, if you stuck with the programand removed $7,000 from the account each year, you'd end up witha $100,000 portfolio--exactly the same as getting your principalback from a bond.  <p> Again, these calculations are theoretical, but the results areso favorable to stocks that there's a lot of room for error.Everybody can be unlucky, the whole country can be unlucky, andstocks will still do better than bonds--assuming you keep yourmoney in stocks for 20 years or longer. This is where male retireeswill say: "I don't have 20 years to wait, because I'm 65 alreadyand my life expectancy is 68.2. I only have 3.2 years to live."In fact, if a man gets to 65, he's likely to make it to 85, andif he and his wife both reach 65, there's a good chance one ofthem will make it to 90. People have more time than they thinkto ride out corrections, which is the main reason we shouldn'tbe worried about the next one, or the one after that.  <p> I'll leave you with the latest gloomy report from Wall Street:Experts say stock prices will collapse because too many peoplehave become long-term investors. The way they see it, the ideaof long-term investing is so popular, it has to be wrong. Doesthat mean the earth really is flat?  <p>  <p>* In spring 1994, we had a stealth correction. The Dow dropped10 percent from its January 31 high on three separate occasions,managing to recover its losses before the end of the tradingday in each instance. Few people took notice, but maybe that'swhy 1995 has been such a good market: The semiannual declinehas already sneaked past us.   <p>  <p>ASK YOURSELF: WHY DO I OWN THESE COMPANIES?   <p> When a correction hits and people around us are losing theirheads, as Kipling would say, we can find reassurance in the following:What makes stocks valuable in the long run isn't "the market."It's the profitability of the shares in the companies you own.As corporate profits increase, corporations become more valuable,and sooner or later, their shares will sell for a higher price.Historically, corporate profits have advanced by 8 percent ayear. This 8 percent, along with the 3 percent dividend yield,is what accounts for the 11 percent annual return. There maynever have been a year when they had a total return of exactly11 percent, but that's the average over time. Corrections orno corrections, that's what stocks produce, because that's whatcorporations produce.  <p> Even if corporate profits grew at 6, 5, or 4 percent, stockswould still advance, albeit at this lower rate. Adding in the3 percent for the dividends, you'd get a 9, 8, or 7 percent totalreturn. That's still a better return than you'd get from bondsin most decades. Ultimately, to be an investor in stocks, youhave to believe that American business has a decent future, aswell as business worldwide, and that corporations will continueto increase their profits. If you are as convinced of this asI am, then you'll never panic in a correction.     --P.L. <p><p>

						Don't mistake a spin-off for a throwaway:  Spin-off companiesoften outperform their parents.  <p> By Peter Lynch  <p> Imagine this scenario: you're a shareholder in <a name="NYSE:OAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11237"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Quaker Oats</b></a>,because you think it is a good investment and you like the oatmeal.One day the mail brings free shares of Fisher-Price, a QuakerOats subsidiary that's now being turned loose as a separate company.You call your broker to ask how Fisher-Price is doing. You findout it has been losing money for several quarters, so you thinkto yourself, Why keep this dog? You sell the shares as soon asthey start trading, and you are happy to receive $11 for each.After all, you got them for free.  <p> A couple of years later, you're browsing through the stock pages,and you come across Fisher-Price. Those $11 shares have become$38 shares, and you wish you hadn't noticed it, because now yourealize you missed a chance to more than triple your money onthe giveaway, while Quaker Oats (which you still own) is up amodest 10 percent.  <p> When a subsidiary or a division is booted out of the nest ofa parent company, it's called a spin-off. Lately, we've seena lot of these. After decades of trying to diversifyor as Icall it, diworsifymany companies are returning to their coreoperations. The buzzword for this is "rightsizing." If a divisiondoesn't fit in with a company's main line of work, the companysells it or spins it off.  <p> A spin-off happens in two stages. First, the parent companyissues stock in the offspring and sells a small percentage ofit in a public offering. The rest is distributed as a gift (oftentax free) to shareholders of the parent. What makes these dealsso intriguing is that spin-offs tend to do better than stocksin general, particularly in the first 24 to 36 months after theyget their independence. On the next page is a table showing someof the most impressive performers of the 1980s and '90s.  <p> Two Wall Street analysts are making a career out of spin-offs:Barbara Goodstein at Rothschild and Patrick Cusatis at LehmanBrothers. Cusatis says he got the idea from reading my firstbook, One Up on Wall Street, which contains a short section onthe subject. I'm gratified that he paid such close attention.He traced 161 spin-offs going back as far as 1965 and made anintriguing discovery: 14 percent of these spin-offs became takeovertargets and ended up as divisions in other companies, usuallyin the same industry.  <p> Fisher-Price is a typical example. This liberated toy companywas on its own for less than three years before <a name="NYSE:MAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10966"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mattel</b></a> snappedit up. It made no sense at Quaker Oats, but it was a fine complementto Mattel.   <p> I look at a lot of numbers every week, but the 14 percent takeoverrate made an impression. With companies in general, the oddsof a takeover are only 3 to 4 percent, so the shareholders ina spin-off are three to four times more likely to benefit fromone of these potentially lucrative episodes. In a takeover, thestock price is a cinch to go up.  <p> It's no accident that spin-offs have done well. The managersno longer take orders from above and cut costs in obvious waysthat the old regime overlooked (this is called grabbing the low-hangingfruit). They become more entrepreneurial. The parent companymay have a financial stake in the success of the spin-off. Certainly,it has an emotional stake. The last thing a parent company wantsis for one of its own projects to flop. So it tries to do everythingpossible to help the fledgling enterprise, from cleaning up thebalance sheet to installing good management. A company that hasto jettison divisions in a fire sale to raise cash may not careabout the consequences, but a powerhouse like <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> certainlydoes.  <p> Coca-Cola spun off Columbia Pictures in late 1987 (keeping a49 percent interest), and when Columbia proved to be a disappointment,Coke did what it could to turn things around. Then it found abuyer at a fancy price. In 1989, <a name="NYSE:SNE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41885"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sony</b></a> acquired Columbia for $27a share, more than three times higher than where shares firsttraded.  <p> The most complicated separation was the Baby Bells. If you owneda share in <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a> in 1983, you got fractions of shares in sevenspin-offs at once. A lot of people thought this was a nuisance,but those who held on to their fractions were well-rewarded.The Baby Bells did the easy cost-cutting and had a great sixyears while AT&T languished.  <p> In many of these spin-off situations, you've got two forcespulling at the stock price from opposite directions. On one sideare the mutual funds that own shares in the parent but can'tget involved with the offspring. For instance, the S&P Indexfunds must sell whatever shares they get from a spin-off if thenew company isn't in the S&P 500. While the funds are dumpingtheir holdings, so are individuals who don't want to be botheredwith upstarts they know nothing about.   <p> On the other side are buyers who understand the virtues of spin-offsand scoop up the shares at what they perceive to be bargain prices.This often results in a standoff that may last for several months,until the new company has a chance to prove itself and impressthe Wall Street kibitzers. Take <a name="NASD:GDMI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42122"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gardner Denver Machinery</b></a>, a manufacturerof air compressors and blowers, which emerged from <a name="NYSE:CXW"></a><b>Cooper Industries</b> in April 1994. The stock was stuck in a trading rut for nearlya year until it surprised the Street with better than expectedearnings. Only recently did Gardner Denver jump the rut.  <p> Tandy is one of the champions of spinning things off, sendingso many divisions out into the world that its genealogy beginsto sound like the families of Levites from the Old Testament.In 1975, <a name="NYSE:TAN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11441"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tandy</b></a> begat <a name="NYSE:TAC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11442"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tandycrafts</b></a> and <a name="NASD:TBAC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12569"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tandy Brands</b></a>, and the shareholdersgot free shares in both. Then, in 1976, Tandycrafts begat Stafford-Lowdon.Three years later, it begat Colortile, and in 1986 it begat InterTAN,one of the few losers in this crowd. Tandy Brands, meanwhile,changed its name to Bombay Company, which in 1991 begat TandyBrands Accessories. If you had invested $5,000 in Tandy in 1975and held on to the whole lot, you would have $86,000 by now. <p> The latest trend from the boardroom is for companies with twoor three giant divisions to divide themselves into equal parts.Usually, they take this action because they think investors havefailed to appreciate the true value of the sum of the parts.In other words, the stock price is too low. Thus, <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears</b></a> spunoff <a name="NYSE:ALL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16182"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Allstate</b></a>, 80 percent of which will go to Sears shareholdersas a tax-free gift sometime this summer.<p>

						 <p>You don't need your own ingot, but the time may be coming when we'll all want to own a little gold  <p> By Peter Lynch  <p> No less a personage than Alan Greenspan once said that gold was the only refuge against profligate governments that are forever debasing their currency. He should know, I guess. These days we've been seeing a lot of debased currencies, including the good old U.S. dollar, and there's a whiff of inflation on Wall Street.  <p> I won't try to predict when the whiff will turn into a rank breeze, but I'm sure about one thing: If it does happen, interestrates will rise and stocks and bonds will fall. In the high-inflation scenario, the only investors who get a good night's sleep arethose whose money is parked in a money market or deployed inhard assets such as gold. Some people keep 5 percent of their portfolios in gold at all times, as a kind of insurance policy. For years they haven't needed it, but the case for owning gold is more compelling today than it was a decade ago.  <p> When the price of gold hit $800 an ounce in 1980, it was a signal for every would-be prospector on earth to grab a pick and shovel and head for the nearest Sierra Madre. No glint in a rock orfleck in a stream escaped attention: Creaky, old shafts were reopened; new holes were dug. South African gold production was in decline, but new mines in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and Australia took up the slack.   <p> Today, South African output continues to decline, and miners there are scraping the bottom of what was once the mother of all mother lodes. But the big news is that the newer mines that have opened up around the world are beginning to run out of gold as well. Many of these latter-day projects involve small deposits of ore, and they have short life expectancies. Moreover, 14 years of catatonic gold prices have dampened the enthusiasm of prospectors,so the search for new sources has been limited. There's beena definite sag in the supply line.  <p> About 3.6 billion ounces of gold have been extracted from theearth since the time of the pharaohs. That may sound like a sizablehaul, but if you took all the gold in circulation today jewelry, bars, ingots, coins, fillings, crowns and melted it into onebig bullion cube, the entire world supply would easily fit ontothe basketball court at the Boston Garden. The whole lump is worth about $1 trillion at today's prices, or only one quarter of the U.S. national debt.  <p> If you divided the lump equally among the 5.6 billion inhabitants of the earth, everybody would get less than an ounce. But that's hardly enough to satisfy the growing demand for jewelry justin Asia and India, where billions of fledgling capitalists have money to spend and not much to spend it on. They can't buy a Winnebago, because the roads are too narrow, and where would they park one? In remote areas, they can't buy electric appliances,because there's no electricity. The last thing they want is to be stuck with the local currency, as long as their governments can operate a printing press. So they're buying as much goldas they can.  <p> Jewelry sales have nearly doubled in the past decade, and 75 percent of the world's gold output now ends up as baubles, bangles,and beads. The U.S. is still the world's largest customer, but Chinese jewelry lovers are buying so much gold these days thatChina is running a close second. This surge in retail buying would surely have driven up the price if it weren't for the central banks. They've been on a selling spree.  <p> Since the days of the gold standard, when nations settled their debts with metal, the various central banks have kept stacks of gold bars in repositories such as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which has the largest supply of gold on earth more than any South African mine. From 1989 to 1993, central banks have been net sellers of gold, giving their governments somethingto live on while they watered down their own currencies. The governments are like their citizenry in this respect: They've been buying gold because they know the local money can't be trusted. <p> The Russians have been the most active sellers of gold, drawing down their stockpile to pay their international bills as they flood the country with worthless rubles. As much as the Russian selling has depressed the price of gold, the idea that they will continue to sell has depressed it even more. By one popular guesstimate,the Russians still have 2,000 tons to unload, while the Russians themselves have pegged their supply at a more modest 240 tons.Apparently, there is no way of knowing the exact amount, but in any event, the Russian selling has subsided.  <p> Selling by central banks in general has subsided, from 500-plus tons in 1993 down to an estimated 46 tons in 1994. This, coupled with the growing popular demand and the dwindling supplies inexisting mines, has lifted the spirits of the gold bulls, more commonly known as gold bugs. These people have been waiting for a rally long enough for their children to grow up and leave home. <p> As to when we'll actually see an extended rally, your timetableis as good as mine, but I've got an idea of how you can get the most out of it when it happens. In the last big run-up in gold, the one that carried the price to $800 an ounce, the most popular way to play the rally was to buy gold coins and gold bars. People lined up at the coin stores to purchase the one-ounce Krugerrand. In those days, there was a widespread fear that the financialsystem was about to collapse, which is why so many investorsopted for owning the metal, as opposed to shares of mining companiesthat traded on the stock exchanges.  <p> I've never understood the apocalyptic theory of investing. Ifthe world really does collapse, is it really going to do you any good to have a few Krugerrands in your pocket? And if it doesn't, you're much better off buying shares and not the metal. Gold coins and bars are heavy and take up space in the bank vaults, and there's always the chance they'll be stolen. If you buy themthrough a company that offers storage, they charge you for it. Physical gold never pays a dividend, the way shares routinelydo. And the arithmetic of corporate earnings strongly favors investing in the stocks.   <p> The back-of-the-napkin explanation is as follows: You buy anounce of gold at, say, $360 (a little less than gold's selling for as I write this), and the price does a high jump and hits$500. So you've made $140. That's a 39 percent profit from owning the metal. But look what happens when you buy shares in a miningcompany instead. Let's say for argument's sake that the mining company is making a profit of $20 an ounce on production when gold is at $360 an ounce. When gold hits $500, the company's profits suddenly jump to $160 an ounce. That's an eightfold increase in earnings.  <p> When a company's earnings go up eightfold, even when Wall Street analysts are skeptical that the bonanza can continue, the stock price will double or triple. And if euphoria sets in and people start believing the price of gold can rise to $1,000 an ounce and beyond, the stock price of our would-be mining company may well increase as much as eightfold, right along with the earnings. Even if it doesn't, you'll get a far better return than the 39 percent you'd get out of the Krugerrand.  <p> Now we arrive at the usual problem: Which gold stocks do you buy? Mining companies are tough to figure out, so this is one of those cases where Lynch's everybody-can-do-it theory of stock selection doesn't apply. How sad it would be if you were right about gold, but then missed the benefit because you picked the wrong company.  <p> It's smarter to go with a gold mutual fund. You'll get a diversified portfolio managed by somebody who knows more about mines than you do. There are 38 or so gold funds or gold-related funds, including 13 with ten-year records (see the table on the nextpage).  <p> Looking over this latter group, I'm struck by two things. A few have done remarkably well, given the fact that the price of gold is stuck at the same place it was at the beginning of the period.<p>

Fannie Mae is misunderstood, underappreciated, and undervalued. But don't pity this company.  Buy it.  <p> By Peter Lynch  <p> In the stock market, no less than in police work, there are cases of mistaken identity. Once in a while, a reliable company with a steady source of income gets stuck in the line-up with the known gamblers, companies that are in cyclical industriesand therefore have unpredictable incomes. Being thrown in with the gamblers can have a depressing effect on the stock price. <p> One of my favorite victims of mistaken identity is <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fannie Mae<a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>(NYSE: FNM), formally known as the Federal National Mortgage Association. I've recommended the stock for a decade and owned it all along, and I'm still recommending it even though the pricehas risen from the single digits into the $70s. That's because it's still cheaper than it would be if Fannie Mae were correctlyunderstood. For ten years, it's been a reliable earner that can't shake the image of being unreliable, so the stock sells at a low multiple to earnings.  <p> Through seven years and one recession, Fannie Mae has turned in 28 consecutive quarters of record earnings. If you covered up the name on the chart and asked the nearest Wall Street analyst what company produced these results, he'd probably say <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a> or <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a>. The difference is that Wal-Mart's stock is priced at 17 times earnings in today's market, whereas Fannie Mae is priced at 9 times earnings. It's a $75 stock that could easily become a $100 stock, overnight, if Fannie Mae started using an alias.  <p> Fannie Mae is a former government agency that was privatized and first sold its stock to the public in 1968. It's the world's foremost owner and handler of mortgages. It buys them by the thousands, then bundles them into packages. Thanks to FannieMae and its close relation, Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.), mortgages have become a commodity like barrelsof oil or bushels of wheat. Banks and S&Ls no longer hold onto mortgages the way they once did. They sell them to FannieMae to be packaged, then use the proceeds to make more loans.The result is that mortgages are easier to get, and you and I pay cheaper rates. When banks or S&Ls want to own mortgages,they simply buy one of the packages. There's a very active market for these so-called mortgage-backed securities.  <p> Fannie Mae has been a great success as a private enterprise. It pays $1 billion in taxes annually, whereas if it were still part of the government, like the Federal Housing Administration, it would be sopping up taxes. The FHA is also in the mortgage business, but Fannie Mae with its 3,500 employees does twice the volume of the FHA with its 5,400 employees. It makes you root for the FHA to be privatized, along with the post office.Imagine the post office run by Fannie Mae, delivering the mailat peak efficiency and sending $1 billion a year back to the Treasury.  <p> The reason Fannie Mae gets lumped in with the unreliable earnersis that it used to be one. The old Fannie Mae was more like <wam-co NYSE:GM>GM</b></a> or <wam-co NYSE:C>Chrysler</b></a>: rags to riches and back again. It borrowed moneyat short-term rates and invested in mortgages that paid long-termrates. This worked fine as long as short-term rates were lowand long-term rates were high as long as the yield curve wasnormal, in other words. But when short-term rates went up, FannieMae would bleed red ink. At one point, it was borrowing moneyat rates that varied from 12 to 16 percent while holding mortgages yielding 7 to 11 percent.  <p> In the early 1980s, Fannie Mae changed its strategy. The average mortgage lasts about seven years, so Fannie Mae decided to pay for its mortgages by selling bonds of an equivalent maturity. If it could earn, say, 10 percent on a mortgage and pay 9 percent interest on the bonds, it would lock in a 1 percent profit for the seven years.   <p> Now Fannie Mae was borrowing long and lending long. This was more expensive than borrowing short, but it removed the risk of rising rates. Fannie Mae also removed the risk of falling rates by making its bonds callable, which means it can redeemthe bonds at will. So when millions of homeowners refinance their mortgages at lower rates, as they did in 1992, 1993, and 1994. Fannie Mae can refinance its bonds at lower rates and maintain its spread.  <p> It other words, Fannie Mae is no longer interest-rate sensitive. By borrowing long and issuing callable debt, it has lessened its earnings in the short run and given up the chance of making the occasional killing when interest rates go its way. But it has proved it can make a steady profit on rising rates, as in1994; falling rates, as in 1993; and recessions, as in 199091.This is the kind of company that Wall Street loves to own: a10 to 15 percent grower that's reliable. Yet a lot of people can't seem to stop worrying about Fannie Mae long enough to appreciateit. Interest rates go up, they sell the stock. Interest rates go down, they sell the stock. Saddam invades Kuwait, they sellthe stock. The dollar falls, they sell the stock.   <p> There's no such thing as a worry-free investment. The trickis to separate the valid worries from the idle worries, and then check the worries against the facts. Since Fannie Mae has reinvented itself, the facts have been easy enough to check.  <p> Remember the headlines six years ago, when people were worried about the collapse in real estate? A big drop in housing prices would seem to be a disaster for Fannie Mae, which owns billions of dollars' worth of mortgages. As it turned out, the prices of fat-cat houses were declining, but the prices of the vast majority of modest houses held up. In fact, the median priceof a house has been on the rise for 27 years, ever since the statistic was first published. It comes out every month. So all you had to know was that Fannie Mae didn't have anything to do with fat-cat houses, and that its average mortgage was $80,000, and you would have ignored the dire predictions and held on to the stock.  <p> Five years ago, people were worried about the recession and how millions of workers would lose their jobs and default on their mortgages. In the oil-patch recession of the mid-1980s, thousands of homeowners walked away from their loans and sent the keys back to the bank. This hurt Fannie Mae, but it learned its lesson and tightened its credit standards. Throughout the1990 recession, when 2 million people did lose their jobs and banks such as Citicorp were reporting delinquency rates of 3 percent or more, Fannie Mae's delinquency rate was negligible less than 1 percent. The company passed the recession test. Today,its delinquency rate has fallen to 0.57 percent, an all-time low. The company publishes this data every quarter, so you and I can keep track of it.   <p> By the end of the recession, people were worrying that the babyboom was over and that soon we'd have fewer people buying houses and taking out mortgages. But halfway into the 1990s, we've hadthe highest population growth since the 1950s and the highest immigration levels since 1910. Even if we did enter a period of zero growth in the housing market, the mortgage market could still grow. That's because of all the older homeowners in this country who paid off their mortgages long ago. When they sell their houses to move into condos or the Great Beyond, the buyers of those houses will be looking for mortgage loans.  <p> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (I'm a shareholder in Freddie Mac,too, and I recommend it) already control 40 percent of the U.S.mortgage market, either as owners or as packagers. Mortgage-backed securities didn't exist 25 years ago, when Freddie Mac invented the idea and Fannie Mae followed. Today, this is a trillion-dollar business, most of it divided between Fannie and Freddie. Year by year, the two pioneers are capturing an ever-greater share of all mortgages.  <p> The latest worry is that the government will meddle in FannieMae's affairs by imposing fees and restrictions, or by taking away some of its business the way it has with Sallie Mae (the Student Loan Marketing Association). But that's not likely to happen. In 1992, Congress passed a law that set higher standardsfor Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and required them to strengthen their capital reserves. They've done so and today are the mainstays of our housing-finance system.  <p> As I write this, Fannie Mae is sitting on $40 billion of surplus cash, half of which could be invested in mortgages. The old FannieMae would have put that money into mortgages right away, to boost profits immediately. The reformed Fannie Mae is holding back,waiting to lock into a better spread. This strategy has put adrag on earnings growth, which is why a lot of big-time investors and the so-called momentum players have been avoiding the stock. Once Fannie Mae puts this chunk of money to work, the growth rate will pick up again. Either way, the company will show its usual steady progress.   <p> In June, investors will descend on Washington to hear FannieMae give what promises to be a favorable progress report. Eighty-five percent of the shares are owned by institutions, many of which will be there to get the good news in person. Average investors who do their homework in advance have a chance to get a jump on the herd.  <p> I never believed in the efficient-market theory, which says that all the information about any company is reflected in the current price and that therefore the price is always rational.Fannie Mae, stuck in the lineup with the cyclicals and sellingfor a price-to-earnings ratio of 9, is all the proof I need that the market makes mistakes.    <p>

It's been distinctly unrewarding to own electric utilities lately. But that will change__any decade now.<p>By Peter Lynch<p>In the past couple of years, I've fielded a lot of anxious questions about electric utilities from investors. They thought they were being conservative when they bought these low-risk stocks, so it was a shock to see them drop faster and further than a lot of the high-risk stocks. Today, the Dow Jones Utility Average hovers around 200, 10 percent below its high of 220 in 1986. Over ten years, this group has gone backward. People want to know if there's something fatally wrong with these companies.<p>I was mulling this issue when I sat down in January at the annual session of prognostication known as the Barron's Roundtable.<p>Jim Rogers was sitting directly to my right. This is the man who rode a motorcycle 65,000 miles around the world and lived to write a fascinating book about it, Investment Biker. You'd expect Jim to get excited about Iranian stocks, Ghanaian stocks, and real estate on the Turkish border, but there he was, touting the stodgy domestic utilities. He hasn't been shy about buying these. He owns about half of the hundred that are publicly traded.<p>Rogers's enthusiasm is based on simple supply and demand. As individuals, we're not using as much electricity as we used to, thanks to more efficient refrigerators and air conditioners and people turning off the lights. But overall demand is still rising, at least 1 to 1.5 percent a year in the U.S. On the supply side, nobody has built a major electric plant anywhere in the country in two decades. What company wants to face the protesters, the lawyers, the cost overruns, the haggles with regulators? <p>So the plants we've already got aren't getting any younger, and many of the nuclear reactors are wheezing their way closer to retirement.<p>The point Rogers makes is that it won't be long before the older plants are unplugged and we'll have a power shortage in this country. In his experience, whenever there's a shortage of anything, the producers raise prices and make bigger profits, and bigger profits push the stock prices up. "I'm usually early about these things," he says. But he can sit back and collect the hefty dividends on his utility shares while he waits.<p>I speak to utility analysts and read their reports from time to time, but lately I haven't seen many reports that you could call enthusiastic. The prevailing view is that Jim's power shortage won't occur in this millennium. Many utilities generate more electricity than they need, and they've actually upped their production without building huge new plants. Joan Bok, the chairwoman of the board of <a name="NYSE:NES"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11069"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>New England Electric</b></a>, tells me her company is planning to refurbish an existing plant, which will add 6 percent to its total output. What the company doesn't make itself, it can buy from Canada with its abundance of hydro generators. And as for nuclear plants being decommissioned, Bok says it won't begin to happen until 2002, and for some facilities not until 2033.<p>One way or another, there's more than enough voltage to go around, which brings us to the utilities' biggest headache: customer defections. A law the utilities would rather do without, passed in 1992, gives industrial users the right to shop around for the best price. <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford Motor</b></a> doesn't have to get its juice from <a name="NYSE:DTD"></a><b>Detroit Edison</b>. It's free to negotiate with other utilities that might offer lower rates. And if Ford can make a better deal in Wisconsin, Detroit Edison still has to deliver the power over its own lines. <p>This is called "wheeling," a form of deregulation that's great for industrial customers but puts the utilities in a bind. They can lower their rates to match the competition, which will cut into profits, or they can keep rates high and lose business to the competition, which will cut into profits.<p>And if they try to raise rates on the residential customers to make up for what they've lost from the industrial defectors, they'll have a consumer revolt on their hands. The regulators will never approve it.<p>It's the same predicament the regional phone companies are facing, except the Bells have an advantage. The money they lose in their rate wars, they can make back by cutting costs. Also, people are adding more phones and using them more often, which boosts the revenues of the phone companies. The electric utilities have a harder time finding costs to cut. They can't replace thousands of operators with machines, because they don't have thousands of operators. They've made a giant investment in expensive equipment that needs constant repair. As appliances get more efficient, their customers will use less electricity.<p>Last year's 20-percent-off sale in the utility sector is not a once-in-a-lifetime event. There's a sale of some kind whenever interest rates go up, because high rates make these dividend-paying shares less attractive. In 197174, the Dow Jones Utility Average dropped 57 percent, but it came back, eventually, in spite of the dire predictions about nuclear meltdowns and imminent bankruptcies. In the meantime, if you bought near the bottom, you were buying good companies on the cheap. A similar situation exists today, and there's no reason to doubt we'll see a comeback sooner or later.<p>The biggest difference between 1971 and 1995 is that utilities in 1995 are losing their monopolistic advantage, which means you have to be careful about which ones you buy. The important factors are as follows:<p>Payout Ratio. You can't invest blindly in the power company that pays the highest dividend, because in today's competitive environment, it may have to cut the dividend to survive. In 1994, six major utilities did just that, and more cuts are likely to come. The danger sign is a high payout ratio. That's the percentage of earnings that goes to paying the dividend.<p>A company that's paying 100 percent of its earnings in dividends could be in a tight spot. If earnings decline, the dividend can't be maintained. On the other hand, a company that pays out 80 percent of its earnings in dividends has a comfortable cushion. <p>The investor-relations person at any utility, or any brokerage-house utilities analyst, can give you the payout ratio of a utility. Or you can calculate it yourself by dividing the annual dividend by the annual earnings. A company that pays $1 in dividends and earns $2 per share has a ratio of 50 percent. Eighty-five percent or below is considered safe. Above 90 percent and you may be in the danger zone.<p>Cost of power. Utilities that borrowed billions of dollars in the 1970s and '80s to build expensive nuclear plants, some of which never got their operating license, obviously have more bills to pay than utilities that stuck with gas or coal. Where low-cost producers can generate a kilowatt of electricity for three or four cents, the high-cost producer might be spending as much as 15 cents.<p>There's no simple calculation you can make to determine whether a company is low cost or high cost, but if your brokerage firm has a utilities analyst, you can find out from him or her. Two low-cost producers on several analysts' buy lists are <a name="NYSE:PPW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11142"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PacifiCorp</b></a>(NYSE: PPW) and <a name="NYSE:AEP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10084"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Electric Power Company</b></a> (NYSE: AEP).<p>The industrial-residential customer ratio. Since it's the industrial customers who are shopping for lower rates, the safest utilities to invest in are those with a high percentage of residential and nonindustrial customers. A good benchmark is 75 percent.<p>Location. Electricity can't be shipped more than a few hundred miles, because beyond a certain point, too much gets lost in transmission. So gluts and shortages are more regional than national. In the Southeast, where supplies are relatively tight, utilities will have an easier time holding their rates up than in the Southwest, which now generates more power than it needs. Hawaii has a natural protection from competitors: 2,500 miles of ocean makes it wheel-proof.<p>Cash and miscellaneous assets. Twenty years ago, utilities plowed their excess cash into construction projects. They borrowed heavily and issued more shares to raise the billions they needed to build new plants. They were plant-rich and cash-poor. Since they've stopped building plants, they've been building up cash, and some have more than they know what to do with. They've gone out and bought everything from savings and loans to insurance companies. In January, <a name="NYSE:MPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11004"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Minnesota Power & Light</b></a> bought a company that holds auctions for used cars.<p>A Texas utility, <a name="NYSE:HOU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10751"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Houston Industries</b></a>, bought a cable-TV business, which it recently agreed to sell to <a name="NYSE:TWX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11482"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Time Warner</b></a> for $2.25 billion. It's planning to use the proceeds to pay off debt and buy back millions of its own shares.<p>This could be terrific news for shareholders. Soon there will be fewer shares outstanding, which automatically increases the earnings per share and improves the payout ratio, since there will be fewer dividends to pay out.<p>It's always been a good strategy to invest in companies that buy back shares. Several other utilities are using their excess cash in this fashion. The list includes <a name="NYSE:PCG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11145"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pacific Gas & Electric</b></a>, Dayton Power &Light, and Florida Power and Light. Southern California Edison recently announced a buyback, too.<p>The table on page 34 lists ten utilities that have raised dividends ten years in a row and have relatively safe payout ratios. Those shown in italics are considered low-cost producers. Among the top utilities analysts I contacted for this article, Barry Abramson at Prudential recommends <a name="NYSE:DUK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10481"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Duke Power</b></a>, LG&E, <a name="NYSE:TE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11429"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>TECO</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:SCG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11302"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>SCANA</b></a>. Michael Temple at Duff & Phelps likes TECO, <a name="NYSE:ED"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10392"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Consolidated Edison of New York</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:CSR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10314"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Central & Southwest</b></a>. Ernest Liu at Goldman Sachs rates Duke Power and LG&E as "outperformers," one notch below Goldman's highest rating, "Buy."<p>Even if Jim Rogers has to wait until the next millennium to see his prediction come true (and that's only five years away), some utilities are likely to do well. In the meantime, it gets my attention that nearly 70 percent of the shares in this industry are owned by individual investors, and 30 percent by the pros and the institutions, whereas with most stocks, the percentage is reversed. The fact that utilities have been underweighted in the pension funds and the mutual funds is promising in itself. The pros wouldn't be shunning this industry if they didn't expect the worst. So if anything good happens and they get more encouraged, there's always the chance they'll start a buying stampede.<p>

						Who says investing isn't fun? With this company you get both a great stock and a reason to try out Raptor.  <p> By Peter Lynch  <p> It's worth reminding ourselves from time to time that gyrations in a stock price may tell us absolutely nothing about the prospects of the company involved. A good example of this is <a name="NYSE:FUN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10305"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cedar Fair,L.P.</b></a>, a company that owns three amusement parks within driving distance of 65 million potential investors: Cedar Point, in Sandusky, Ohio, on the shores of Lake Erie; Valleyfair, on the outskirts of Minneapolis; and Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, near Allentown, Pennsylvania.  <p> Cedar Point dates back to 1870, and seven U.S. presidents have visited there, but its biggest claim to fame is that Knute Rockne invented the forward pass on the premises. It's listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and it has one of the oldest working wooden roller coasters in the world. So this is a company with a lot of experience. It also belongs right at the top of Lynch's hit parade of companies that are easy to follow.  <p> You don't need a Ph.D. and a microscope to figure this story out, and there aren't 14 different divisions going off in14 different directions. The whole operation hinges on the three parks and how many customers they manage to attract in the four months a year during which they're open. That's the key ingredient in successful investing: finding companies you can keep track of so you've got a point of reference other than the stock price. <p> Cedar Fair tells you everything you need to know in the annual report, plus the very important third-quarter report sent to shareholders in November, after the summer season has ended. The most recent third-quarter mailing was a humdinger. It reported record crowds at the three parks in 1994, up 9 percent from 1993. (<a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney</b></a> and other park operators suffered a decline in attendance last year.) Revenues were up, earnings were up, and spending per visitor was up. The balance sheet was strong, and the company announced a record $24 million in capital improvements for1995. <p> The good news is out, and for a few months the parks will be closed and the roller coasters turned off, so nothing is going to happen to affect the company's prospects for a prosperous1995 and beyond. Yet the stock will continue to have its ups and downs, and investors who realize there's no reason for the downs can take advantage and buy more shares.  <p> Since Cedar Fair went public in 1987, there have been at least four chances. The first occurred six months after the stock began trading at $10 a share. The market hit Black Monday, and a $10 share became a $6 share overnight. The company was paying a $1.05 annual cash distribution at the time, so the $6 buyers were getting an astounding 18 percent yield on their investment. You had to ask yourself: Is anything wrong with Cedar Fair that this stock should be this cheap?  <p> The short answer was no, because the parks were already closed for the winter. The big fear at the time was that the U.S. would fall into a deep recession that would doom corporate America. So you then had to ask yourself: How does Cedar Fair do during a recession? The answer is quite reassuring. For the past 20 years, revenues have increased without a single lapse, during good times and bad. That's because, again, 65 million people live less than a tankful of gas from a Cedar Fair park: 22 million within reach of Cedar Point, 8 million within reach of Valleyfair, and 35 million within reach of Dorney. When money is tight, they can take a Cedar Fair vacation and spend far less than they would if they had to fly the family to Disney World. Disney is vulnerable to recessions because so many potential customers have to travel long distances to get there.  <p> You got a second chance to buy Cedar Fair in the fall of 1990, when the U.S. military was preparing for the Gulf War. Thirteen dollars a share became $10.40 a share. Once again, it was off-season at the parks, so nothing had gone wrong at the company to justify this drop. You had to ask yourself: Was Saddam Hussein planning to launch a Scud missile attack on Cedar Point?  <p> The third chance came in 1992, after Cedar Fair bought Dorney Park. Everything about this deal looked favorable, but several months after it was done, the stock price still hadn't budged. It was stuck in the $20 range, giving you plenty of time to study the situation and realize that Dorney was a great acquisition that more than doubled Cedar Fair's customer base.   <p> It's not like Cedar Fair had brought home a wind farm or a biotech lab or something else it didn't understand. Amusement parks it knows how to run. The 20 top people in management have been with the company an average of 20 years apiece. They can take over a park that's down at the heels, renovate, spiff things up, advertise, and cut the overhead by folding the management into the Cedar Fair management. They buy the same trash cans, ticket booths, and roller coasters for all their properties, so they save money by getting a bulk rate.  <p> This brings us to chance four, because while the company is posting record results, with earnings, revenues, and cash distributions on a continuous rise, the stock has fallen a long way from its high of $36.60 in1993. It hit a recent low of $26.75 in the fourth quarter of 1994, and as of this writing, it's selling for less than $29, giving it a very stingy price-to-earnings ratio of 10.  <p> Again, the parks are closed, and again you have to ask yourself:What's the Street worried about this time? My guess is that there is concern about Cedar Fair losing its status as a master limited partnership. An MLP has a big tax advantage over a normal corporation. It makes quarterly cash distributions, similar to a dividend, but it doesn't pay taxes on them. Master limited partnership status makes Cedar Fair's earnings 25 to 30 percent higher than they would be otherwise.  <p> About 90 MLPs trade on the stock exchanges, and roughly a third including Cedar Fair are scheduled to lose their status in1998. There's a small chance, however, that some or all of these will be grandfathered and allowed to keep their tax advantage. Legislation to that effect has been introduced in the House. If Cedar Fair is not granted grandfather status, it will become a regular corporation and will be taxed accordingly.  <p> But when you consider that the average stock on the S&P 500 has a p/e ratio of 15, Cedar Fair is already selling at a 30 percent discount to the market. Looking at it this way, the stock has already suffered from the drop in earnings that won't occur until 1998, and maybe not even then. It's as if investors have decided that 1998 has already happened, ignoring the fact that Cedar Fair has three years of tax breaks ahead of it. Meanwhile, the cash distribution gets bigger every year. In 1995, the expected payout is $2.40 to $2.45 a share, a yield of more than 8 percent on the current stock price.  <p> Cedar Fair has several advantages that go beyond being an MLP and are again apparent to anybody who reads the reports. The three parks attracted 5.9 million visitors in 1994, so they haven't begun to saturate the market of 65 million people. Cedar Pointis famous for its macho roller coasters, but it's been adding kinder, gentler rides for aging baby boomers and their young children.  <p> Moreover, competitors won't come in to knock them off. You don't see entrepreneurs lining up to build $500 million amusement parks in cold climates. Cedar Point can make a living by staying open four months a year, but that's because the infrastructure is already there. Anybody who starts from scratch will go someplace warm, where tickets can be sold year-round. Not one new park has been constructed in the Midwest in more than 20 years.  <p> Finally, the company can grow its earnings by adding new rides. That's been Cedar Fair's strategy all along. Cedar Point is already in the Guinness Book of Records for most roller coasters (11) in one location, and its Magnum XL-200 was voted Best Ride on Earth by readers of Inside Track magazine, whoever they are. But management isn't resting on these laurels. Last year, Cedar Point unveiled Raptor, the world's highest, steepest, and fastest inverted roller coaster. It flips upside down six times per trip. This year, the park is doubling the size of Soak City, a cluster of water rides.   <p> Cedar Point now has enough flumes, roller coasters, and other amusements that a day in the park isn't enough time to take the mall in. This creates overnight traffic for the hotel, where an extra 200 rooms are being added to the existing 300. Whatever works at Cedar Point is repeated at the other locations. There's a Snake River Falls at Dorney, where it's called White Water Landing, and a Berenstain Bear Country at all three parks.  <p> If Dorney has its expected growth spurt, it will boost Cedar Fair's earnings for the next five to ten years. At that point, Cedar Fair can acquire a fourth park and maintain the growth rate that way. And there's always the chance that somebody bigger will come along and buy out the entire operation. Disney might be a likely candidate, or PepsiCo, the parent company of TacoBell, Pizza Hut, and Kentucky Fried Chicken. Think of all the Pepsis, pizzas, tacos, and chicken wings Pepsi could sell if it had its own amusement parks. It could install a Pepsi coaster fizz flume.  <p> In sum, Cedar Fair has everything you'd hope to find in a long-term investment: a solid franchise in a growing business that lacks competitors and that every person over the age of six can understand. I've owned shares since 1987, and bought more late last year. <p> Over the past decade, 40 million people have visited a Cedar Fair park, seen the crowds, and watched the new rides going up. How many of these 40 million went home, though, and bought shares in the Uruguay Fund, or the Bangladesh Fund, or the Emerging Markets Infrastructure Opportunity Fund, or the High-Yield Inverse Floater Government Guaranteed Bond Fund, or a biotech stock they knew nothing about, ignoring a great company with a proven record that pays an annual cash distribution of 8 percent plus and has a story that's easy to follow?  <p> Here's a lesson from Lynch 101 that I never turn down a chance to repeat: No investor can expect to be an expert in hundreds of stocks, but it's possible to become an expert in four or five that are easy to follow and monitor their progress and buy more shares when the opportunity arises. Cedar Fair is a prime candidate. <p> The best part about being a Cedar Fair shareholder is doing the on-site research. In 1991, my wife, Carolyn, and our oldest daughter, Mary, thoroughly investigated the flume rides at Valleyfair. In 1992, all five of us tested the roller coasters at Cedar Point. In 1993, Carolyn and our middle daughter, Annie, did a complete examination at Dorney. The company's stock symbol isn't FUN for no reason.  <p>  <p>Peter Lynch writes the Investor's Edge column with John Rothchild.

						J.R. may be gone, but there are still opportunities to make a killing in oil--in the service companies  <p> By Peter Lynch  <p> It's hard to believe that more than a decade has passed since the heyday of Texas crude, when the Hunt brothers were riding high on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans, Dallas was the world's most popular nighttime soap, the Arab sheikhs had bought up London, and everybody was scrambling to get into the "awl bidness."  <p> All it took for the bidness to lose its glamour, besides Dallas going off the air, was a pesky decline in oil prices. This brought no joy to Rigville. The lower oil prices caused the <a name="NYSE:XON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10537"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Exxons</b></a> and the <a name="NASD:MBLE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14148"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mobils</b></a> to quit exploring for new sources, which left the drillers and the roust abouts with nothing much to do and a trail of bankruptcies and rusty rigs extended across several continents. The survivors have struggled along ever since, merging, cutting costs, and waiting for a new opportunity, which may soon open up.  <p> We can't go much longer burning more and finding less. Lately, we've been living off oil fields discovered long ago--Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea--but these old supplies won't last forever. In fact, we're much closer to a shortage than the glut that people are worried about. You've read the stories: OPEC can't stick to its quotas, and once Iraq starts pumping, it will flood the market with 3 million extra barrels a day. What these stories don't mention is that with world consumption increasing by anannual 1.5 percent, each year we need another million barrels per day. At that rate, the Iraqi "flood" will be completely absorbed in three years' time.  <p> It's the same story with natural gas: too many straws stuck in the drink. In the U.S., we're burning 20 trillion cubic feet a year, which is double the amount of new gas that's being discovered. The supply in the proven reservoirs has fallen from 290 trillion cubic feet in 1970 to 160 trillion cubic feet today. At the current burn rate, that's eight years' worth, which puts us as close to running on empty as we've been at any time in the second half of this century.  <p> We continue to import from Canadian fields, but you can see where this is heading: More demand and less supply equal higher prices. So if you buy this scenario and you want to profit from it, you have two basic choices. You can invest in the oil producers: Exxon, Mobil, <a name="NYSE:BP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41759"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>British Petroleum</b></a>, et al. (Some of these stocks have had a decent run-up already, but there are still opportunities in the group, which I'll discuss in a separate column later in the year.) Or you can invest in the downtrodden oil-service companies that will benefit from the next pickup in drilling and exploration. <p> At that point, another kind of supply and demand will begin to work in favor of the oil-services outfits: the supply and demand for drills, bits, and rigs. The rig count, which is how oil hands keep track of this industry, has had quite a fall since1981, when there were 4,200 rigs operating in the U.S. and Canada and 1,400 in the rest of the world. Today, there are fewer than1,000 rigs at work in the U.S. and Canada and only 770 everyplace else. Very few industries have suffered a decline as severe as this one. In the Gulf of Mexico and other watery locations, the offshore rigs have been vanishing at a rapid rate. They've almost become an endangered species.  <p> The oil producers don't own rigs; they generally rent or lease them from the oil-service companies. So when they decide to start exploring again, they are going to be faced with a very tight market for rigs. This will be a fortunate situation for the owners of the rigs, who can raise the rents and name their price. They've already paid for the equipment, and it doesn't cost much to get it into shape, so the increased rent will pass through to the bottom line. That's why a slight pickup in drilling can be explosive for earnings.  <p> But you can't just invest in oil services. You have to pick and choose among the land drillers, ocean drillers, pipeline operators, seismic mappers, downholers, rent-a-rigs, drill-bit manufacturers, tube makers, platform builders, and secondary-recovery companies. Oil services used to be a business in which muscles counted for more than brains, but lately it's gone high-tech. They've got 3-D seismic mapping. They've got new "smart" drills that go horizontal and can snake around the pathways and contours of the rock. They've got drill ships that can sink a probe in mid-ocean. They've got submersible rigs and semisubmersible pontoon vessels that float around like giant oil-sucking lily pads. <p> With their computer divisions, their science labs, and their Ph.D.s on the payroll, the most advanced of the oil-service companies have given up the he-man role to become technical advisors and consultants to the oil producers. In a sense, this sophistication hurts the old-fashioned drillers, because as the prospectors get smarter, they don't have to drill as many holes. The companies that have the brightest futures are those with the high-tech capability.  <p> There's also been a lot of merger activity in the industry; thus, a handful of companies will dominate what used to be a fiercely competitive situation. The hulk in the lineup is <a name="NYSE:SLB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11327"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Schlumberger</b></a>, with annual revenues of $6 billion plus. Of the three analysts I contacted in researching this piece, two have put Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) on their buy list.  <p> Schlumberger executive vice president Victor Grijalva once admitted that the company had a King Kong complex, but that's been cured. The company let go of Fairchild Semiconductor, a conquest that was outside Schlumberger's regular line of work, and acquired a company in its own field, GeoQuest, a leader in seismic services that once belonged to <a name="NYSE:RTN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11261"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Raytheon</b></a>. Recently, Schlumberger has put its cash to better use, bought back stock, and managed to make money (more than $500 million after taxes in 1993) as the market for oil services has shrunk. It's not hard to imagine what will happen when the market begins to expand. The stock has been stuck in the $50$70 range for several years, and lately it's fallen to the low end--$51 as of this writing. Analysts say it's going to go much higher, but even if it returns only to the top end, that's a 40 percent move.  <p> Among various consolidations in progress, the one that looks the most promising to me is the upcoming merger between <a name="NYSE:MDR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10972"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDermott International's</b></a> marine-construction division and a company called <a name="NYSE:OFP"></a><b>Offshore Pipelines</b>. The result will be an entirely new company, J. Ray McDermott, which overnight will become the largest marine-construction outfit in the world. The parties to the merger were still awaiting final approval from the regulators when I wrote this, but the deal may have gone through by now.  <p> If and when the merger is approved, James Stone at Werthheim Schroder predicts that the new company can cut $50 million in costs right off the bat, on the theory that two can live more cheaply than one. He estimates that cash flow will rise to $5 per share, and if he's right, we're about to witness an exciting development. Cash flow, simply put, is the money a company takes in. The normal ratio between the price of a stock and the cash flow of the company is about ten to one, but with Offshore stock selling at $20, the stock price to cash flow would be four to one.  <p> You can approach this opportunity in one of three ways: buying shares now in McDermott (NYSE: MDR) or Offshore Pipelines (NYSE:OFP), or buying the new company, J. Ray McDermott. Stone thinks Offshore at around $20 is the better choice, assuming the merger hasn't happened yet. For each share of Offshore you own, you'll get a share in J. Ray, plus a 50 centper-share cash dividend thrown in as a bonus. James Carroll of Paine Webber favors buying the parent company, McDermott, which will continue to own 60 percent of the shares in J. Ray. He estimates that the J. Ray asset will be worth $12.50 a share to shareholders of McDermott. <p> Of the smaller, high-tech companies, Gordon Hall of CS First Boston recommends <a name="NYSE:WAI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17140"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Western Atlas</b></a>. It was spun off by Litton Industries in March 1994 at $40 per share, which is about where it sits now. Western Atlas (NYSE: WAI) is a leader in 3-D seismic services, which will be in great demand once the search for oil and gas begins in earnest. It's not cheap on earnings ($1.85 per share is estimated for 1995), but a cash flow of $5.45 makes it more attractive.  <p> Finally, there's one I own: <a name="NASD:TUBO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12022"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tuboscope Vetco International</b></a>. As you might have suspected, Tuboscope (Nasdaq: TUBO) is engaged in tubing and pipeline inspection. It's a specialized area, and not many companies are involved in it. At $6.50 a share, the company is cheap and attractive. It may earn 50 cents in 1995, which gives the stock a modest price-to-earnings ratio of 13. The estimated cash flow for 1995 is $1.35.  <p> Last year, Tuboscope was almost bought out by Weatherford at $11 a share, and the company has announced it's still for sale. Somebody else could make a similar offer, but Tuboscope has a good chance of getting to $11 on its own.  <p> But do your own research. Maybe you'll find some drillers you like. There are numerous companies in oil services that have gotten stronger and have sobered up considerably from the free-spending days. The ones that are making money now stand to make huge amounts when the price of gas and oil goes up. And if we get a burst of drilling activity and a rebound in seismic work and secondary recovery, we could see a heyday in oil services and a liftoff in these stocks to rival the liftoff in autos and chemicals that began in 1991.  <p>Peter Lynch writes the Investor's Edge column with John Rothchild.

						By Peter Lynch  <p> What rarely happens at the gas station happens all the timeat the broker's office. Millions of customers pay the full-servicerate without getting the full services. In a nation of smartshoppers, this may be the last great lapse. With all the attentiongoing to discount brokers and Wall Street firms vying to offerthe lowest commissions, nobody is talking about how people whopay for full-service brokerage can get their money's worth. Thanksto the computer, full-service brokers are a far more valuableresource than they were a few years ago. They spend most of theirworking hours staring at the same information the fund managerson Wall Street are staring at. With the newfangled terminalsthat have replaced the clunky Quotrons of old, even a brokerin the boonies is only a keystroke away from a menu of high-poweredsources including Reuters; Dow Jones New/Retrieval; Bloomberg,which reports on the vital signs (cash flow, revenues, etc.)of thousands of companies; Zacks, which gathers earnings estimatesfrom all the analysts who follow a particular company; and chartsand graphs that track stock prices and volume of trading goingback weeks or even years.  <p> Along with these data services, the broker can call up the latestcommentary from the in-house analysts at his own brokerage firm.This is the sort of fresh information retail investors normallycan't get. To find out what the Dean Witter analyst is sayingabout IBM, the clients of Dean Witter have had to wait for thewritten report, which often takes weeks to be printed and sentout to the local branches. By that time, the information is staleand the fund managers and other large investors have alreadyacted on it, because they hear it straight from the analyst'smouth.  <p> I've argued over and over that the retail investor has an edgeover the wholesale investor in many aspects of investing, butgetting the latest news from official Wall Street sources isn'tone of them. Look what happens, though, if the retail investor'sbroker is willing to pass along the analyst's comments as theyappear on his computer screen. The information gap closes, andthe retail investor no longer has to be the last to know.  <p> "The research departments of the major brokerage firms are underutilized,"says Tom Reilly, a Merrill Lynch broker from Boston who enthusiasticallyplays the new role of conduit between his clients and his database.Merrill Lynch has about 200 analysts in 37 countries, and wheneverone of them writes a report on a company whose stock is ownedby a client of his, Reilly can retrieve it. "When I came intothis business 18 years ago," he says, "the printed reports wemailed out could be three months old by the time they reachedthe customer. Now I can print a copy off the screen and fax it.Or if there's something that the compliance department won'tallow me to print, I can at least read it to the customer offthe screen."  <p> Suddenly, there are better things to ask a broker than "Where'sIBM trading today?" - which tells you nothing about IBM's prospects- or "Is the market headed up or down?" - the question brokershave to answer every day, even thought they have no more ideaof where the market's going than you or I do. You can ask forthe latest news on IBM from the Dow Jones wire, or for the latestsummary of earnings estimates from all the brokerage analystson First Call, or for a copy of the most recent bulletin putout by the in-house IBM analyst.  <p> Or, if you want the complete story all at once, the broker canpull the relevant details out of Bloomberg, Zacks, and the rest,and string the pages together to produce what amounts to a homemadereport on any company that piques your interest. Al Bernazani,a broker at Smith Barney with 35 years of experience, preparesthese information packages as a matter of routing. "I can generate20 pages of data on almost anything," he says, "and the computersprint it up at night."  <p> It sounds like a lot of extra bother, but Bernazani, Reilly,and other brokers who are the pioneers of computerized servicessay it's not. They can gather 20 pages on the computer withoutleaving their swivel chairs, and in less time than it would taketo walk to the office library and copy a couple of pages outof the S&P reports or the "VALUE LINE INVESTMENT SURVEY," whichis the traditional way of doing research for clients. That oldmethod doesn't compare with what's possible today.  <p> Perhaps you're looking for companies with particular characteristics-- a low price-to-earnings ratio, or no long-term debt, or ahigh growth rate, or an unbroken record of raising the dividend,or all of the above. Ten years ago, there would have been noeasy way to search through 10,000 publicly traded companies tofind the suspects that fit the description, but now we've gotonline databases with screens. Some of these databases are soexpensive it wouldn't make sense for the average person to acquirethem, but the brokerage houses might. In that case, your brokercan run the screens for you.  <p> It's not a commonplace request at the moment, but Tom Reillyalready runs screens for his clients, and there's no reason stockscreen can't become one of the standard full services. Meanwhile,useful information on annuities, foreign stocks, and mutual fundsof all stripes is piling up on broker's desks. Many offices alreadysubscribe to the Morningstar and Lipper publications that trackthousands of mutual funds: stock funds, bond funds, open-end,closed-end, foreign, domestic, best total return over ten years,highest yield, you name it. A broker can help clients pick mutualfunds by sending along the ratings and the rankings, yet fewinvestors take advantage of this. People who believe that allfunds seem the same might feel differently if they looked atthese reports from time to time.  <p> It won't be long before a broker's entire client base can beput on an alert system, where any newsworthy development thataffects a specific stock or mutual fund will trigger a note tothe broker, who can then relay the information to clients whoown the shares. There are a least two programs that do this already:Reuters Money Network and Telescan. Both roam the news wiresautomatically, looking for news on the stocks in a subscriber'sportfolio whenever that subscriber logs on to get the latestprice quotes for the shares.  <p> Computers have revolutionized the business to the point thatthe two most important factors to consider in choosing a brokerare: (1) Does he have good software and good databases? and (2)Is he willing to use them on his clients' behalf? This is wherethe larger offices, particularly the flagship offices in majorcities, have an advantage over the smaller, far-flung branches.Larger offices tend to have greater access to research and moreelaborate databases than smaller offices do.  <p> Bernazani is in a great spot. He works at one of Smith Barney'smain offices in Boston, which has its own trading desk wherebig blocks of stock are bought and sold for institutional clients.An office with a trading desk is likely to have the most advancedresearch available, which is how Bernazani gets to use Bridge.Bridge is a premier database that runs 24 hours a day there andwill tell you everything you ever wanted to know about a company'saffairs short of the CEO's bedtime. It also tracks options andcommodities and does the mumbo-jumbo calculations used by theesoteric market timers know as quantitative analysts, or quants.It's a great service, but for an individual to subscribe, thecost can run to a hefty $2,000 a month. Bernanzani makes useof Bridge for his customers free of charge.  <p> I'm amazed that full-service brokerage firms aren't advertisingthe research benefits their clients can get from their computersystems, but so far they've been quiet on the subject. Assetallocation is what they talk about. That's where they hand youa questionnaire that asks you how much risk you are willing totake, and a worksheet so you can figure out how much money you'llneed for retirement, or to pay tuition bills, or whatever. Basedon your answers they design a portfolio with the right mix ofstocks and bonds for your particular situation. Then periodicallyThey review the portfolio to see if it's underweighted or overweightedin one investment or another. It's a valuable service, but notas valuable to the stock picker as the help the broker can providead hoc.  <p> There's potential here for a total overhaul of the relationshipbetween brokers and clients, which often has been less than satisfyingto either party. Instead of the brokers calling their customerswhen they have something to sell, now they can call when theyhave something to say. The client will benefit from having anactive research partner who does for him what the analyst doesfor the big players on Wall Street. The broker will benefit fromfelling more useful. The brokerage house will be able to showthat higher commissions are worth the price.  <p> We're in the experimental stages here, so the client has totake the first step. Call your broker and ask him what he andhis computer can do on behalf of the companies you own stockin. It might be the beginning of a beautiful new relationship. <p> <hr>  <p>Copyright 1995 Capital Publishing Limited Partnership. All rightsreserved. <p>

It's fall, when one investor's tax loss is another's bargain buy. Some of the best values may be in last year's IPOs.
By Peter Lynch<p>
From January 1991 through September of this year, 1,765 new domestic companies were hatched on Wall Street -- a record for such a short period. The newcomers outnumber the entire population of the New York Stock Exchange.<p>
Many of them shot out of the starting gate and attracted attention. But it's a lot harder to generate good news after that first blush. Of the recent arrivals, 831 were selling at press time for less than the prices at which they came public. <p>
This tells us something very important about initial public offerings: There's no rush to buy shares at the outset, because there's an excellent chance they can be picked up more cheaply a few months down the road once they've started trading. People complain that only fat cats and institutions can get their hands on IPOs at the premarket prices, but in many cases brokerage houses are doing small investors a favor by shutting them out. <p>
Why talk about the recent batch of new issues now? Because we've entered the fall selling season. That's when trees drop their leaves, and investors drop the losers from their portfolios. It happens every year, in plenty of time for people to claim the losses on their tax returns. For some reason, taking a loss is a pleasurable exercise -- many stock pickers look forward to it even though the tax break itself is no more than a partial compensation. There's a psychological benefit to tossing the bums out: The names disappear from the monthly brokerage statements; we're no longer reminded of our mistakes. <p>
The stocks most likely to be dropped in the selling season are small-company stocks, a category that includes most of our recent IPOs. Small-company stocks are often purchased as flyers or speculations, and they lack the status of core holdings. As a rule, they aren't followed by Wall Street analysts beyond the initial coverage that accompanies the underwriting. So information about these companies and their prospects is hard to come by. <p>
Even when they do know the details, the stock jockeys on Wall Street -- fund managers and so forth -- have a low tolerance for even a single stumble, or a "negative surprise," as it is called, from any new enterprise. "Everybody wants these nice pretty quarters after a company comes public," says Mary Lisanti, a small-cap fund manager at Bankers Trust who frequently searches for what she calls broken IPOs. "One bad earnings report and the stock gets tossed out." <p>
So as we move into fall, people dispose of their flyers and speculations and disappointments. The dropping prices create more losses, which other investors are tempted to take. The selling leads to more selling. Below $5, a stock no longer can be counted as collateral in a margin account, so the margin buyers join in with the tax-loss crowd, the portfolio managers, and the camp followers who sell because everybody else is doing it. Perfectly good businesses with excellent prospects are marked down to a fraction of their actual worth. <p>
This creates a perennial opportunity for bargain hunters who rummage through the list of IPO losers. Granted, many of the 831 stocks on this year's list have dropped in price for valid reasons -- the companies they belong to have stumbled and bumbled repeatedly and may be lurching toward bankruptcy. So the first task of the bargain hunter is to narrow the field and separate the solid prospects from the ones that are counting on hopes, prayers, and miracles. <p>
You could start by looking for the companies that have no debt. If a company is debt-free, then at least you don't have to worry that it will default on a loan.<p>
Next, from among the debt-free companies, find companies that are selling for less than cash. Say a company has a million shares outstanding and $3 million in cash in the bank. That's $3 in cash per share. If the stock is selling for $2 per share, then you're in the enviable position of paying $2 to get back $3, with the company itself thrown in for free. Of course, whether this cash does you any good in the end depends on whether the company uses it wisely or fritters it away. <p>
A company that is losing money will go through cash quite rapidly, so the next thing you want to worry about is whether it can make a living. Add a third element to your search: From among companies that have no debt and are selling for less than cash, look for companies that actually have earnings. You can take this a step further and seek out companies whose stocks are priced at less than ten times those earnings. <p>
Some names on the losers list come from biotech or high tech, and their appeal is based entirely on an invention that has yet to be tested or a wonder drug that hasn't emerged from the petri dishes. You have to be an insider, an expert, a gambler, or all three to want to put money into these shares. But along with the risky what-ifs are the companies that have proved themselves with several years of consistent earnings growth. <p>
If you operate a computer and can call up the right kind of database, you can run a screen to pick out the best-performing companies from among the IPO losers. Otherwise, you can do the research on a case-by-case basis. For starters, I've contacted three experts in the field who offer their own favorite downtrodden IPOs, and I've also put together a group of my own candidates for further study (see the list following this story). <p>
Mary Lisanti recommends the following eight companies, all of which have shown they can turn a profit: <a name="NASD:WGTI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17214"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wandel & Goltermann Technologies</b></a> (information networks), <a name="NASD:DLNK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16766"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Digital Link</b></a>  (digital access products), <a name="NASD:SUMA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16523"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Summa Four</b></a>  (telephone-switching systems), <a name="NASD:BSMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15162"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Filene's Basement</b></a> (discount apparel), <a name="NASD:JOSB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42005"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Jos. A. Bank Clothiers</b></a>  (men's apparel), <a name="NASD:WIND"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16072"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wind River</b></a>  (semiconductors), Damark International (discount mail order), and Protocol Systems (monitoring for hospital patients). <p>
Robert Natale, editor of Standard & Poor's Special and Emerging Situations newsletter, says that picking from the losers' bin is not his favorite tactic, because the majority of the losers will go from worse to terrible. But he agrees there are some good buys to be found, and he's identified three of them: Capital Guarantee Corp. (insures municipal bonds), <a name="NASD:IGEN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41927"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IGEN</b></a>  (medical products), and <a name="NYSE:PCS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16146"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Payless Cashways</b></a>  (a chain of home-repair outlets similar to <a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a>). <p>
Manish Shah runs a small investment company called Otiva and also publishes a newsletter, IPO Maven. A man after my own heart, he believes in doing research first and investing later, and he doesn't rush in to buy shares from the underwriters. "People shouldn't get caught up in the first hour of trading," he says. I couldn't agree more. It's the first two years, three years, five years, that really count. <p>
Shah has been following IPOs for six years. He looks for companies in the 20-20-20 club: 20 percent sales growth for three years or more, 20 percent earnings growth, and a 20 percent ratio of debt to capitalization. To pass his muster, a company must also have a niche -- some sort of specialized product or service -- and the capacity to expand globally. <p>
Again, Shah doesn't necessarily concentrate on IPOs selling below their offering price, but going down the losers list he chose the following: <a name="NASD:RAWL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=20153"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Rawlings Sporting Goods</b></a>  (sports jerseys and paraphernalia), O'Sullivan Industries (furniture maker, a <a name="NYSE:TAN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11441"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tandy</b></a> spin-off), Software Etc. (software retailer), <a name="NYSE:DGP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15668"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>USX-Delhi Group</b></a>  (natural gas distributor), <a name="NYSE:BOR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15930"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Borg-Warner</b></a> (security systems), <a name="NYSE:ALL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16182"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Allstate</b></a> (insurance), <a name="NASD:STEK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13516"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Steck-Vaughn Publishing</b></a>  (children's textbooks, educational software), <a name="NYSE:PRL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16279"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Paul Revere</b></a>  (insurance), <a name="NASD:GATE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16706"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gateway 2000</b></a> (personal computers), Concord Holdings (back-office support for mutual funds run by banks, a Bank of America spin-off), Wandel & Goltermann (also on Lisanti's list), and <a name="NASD:RADAF"></a><b>Radica Games</b>  (hand-held casino games). <p>
I can't leave this without repeating the usual Lynch disclaimer: These are not hot tips to take to the broker's office or the bank or the nearest trading desk. They are starting points for calling the company, getting the annual reports, quarterlies, and IPO prospectuses, and doing the research. <p>
It's easy to overlook the fact that Home Depot, <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>, <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:FDX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10552"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Federal Express</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:UNH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15007"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>United Healthcare</b></a> , and other well-known companies that are the modern leaders of their industries, employing thousands of people and giving a great boost to the prosperity of the nation (not to mention the shareholders), began their public life on the IPO list. In some cases it wasn't that long ago. Somewhere from among the 1,765 recent new issues, the future corporate giants will arise. <p>

How to catch companies that are on their way back and avoid companies that are on their way out.<p>By Peter Lynch<p>Investing in troubled companies that show signs of turning around can be a profitable pastime.

Rip Van Winkle would still be waiting for <a name="NYSE:BS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10210"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bethlehem Steel</b></a>, whose stock hit its all-time high in 1956.<p>The first challenge in analyzing a company in distress is to figure out if it's going to survive long enough to work out its problems. This is where large, well-known companies have an advantage over smaller ones. Big companies got that way by being successful, and most of them own valuable assets: real estate, subsidiaries, cash in the till. Chances are they've got a good credit rating, and bankers will lend them money in a pinch.<p>Small companies are more likely to be living in rented office space with rented equipment. They have limited amounts of cash, which will soon run out if they need to use it to cover their losses. Their bankers may not be so eager to rescue them with new lines of credit, and their competitors would love to put them out of their misery. That's why troubled small companies declare bankruptcy in droves and disappear from the stock exchanges, whereas I can think of only a handful of big companies (Pan Am, Eastern Airlines, First Executive, Bank of New England, and a couple large Texas banks) that have gone kaput in recent years. <p>So when I'm looking at a possible turnaround, I do a solvency check right away. Generally, it's the big outfits that have the resources to muddle through, but you can't assume that. In the early 1980s, when <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a>'s survival was in doubt, its shares were selling for $2 apiece. People who were daring enough to buy Chrysler on its deathbed made 20 times their investment -- but they could have lost everything. I waited until Chrysler got an infusion of cash, thanks in part to a government bailout loan. By then its shares were selling for $4, so eventually I made only 10 times my money, but at less risk.<p>Chrysler turned around relatively quickly, but most big companies don't. This is where investors get fooled. They see a famous company with a glorious history that's fallen on hard times, and they notice the share price has dropped, and they snap up this supposed bargain in the belief that a turnaround is imminent. A decade, two decades, three decades later, it still may not have happened. International Harvester, now Navistar, ran out of steam in the 1960s. <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> began to lose its pizzazz around the time the Beatles first landed in New York. <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears</b></a> reached its pinnacle of $61 in 1973, when Richard Nixon was in the White House erasing the Watergate tapes.<p>The bottom fishers who bought Sears at $45 a year later, in 1974, and held on to their shares through all the ups and downs have nothing to show for their patience. In 1990, Sears was selling for the same price it fetched 16 years earlier. You would have missed the bull market in the 1980s by investing in Sears.<p>It's one thing for a company's earnings to decline in a recession or because of a temporary misfortune such as a labor strike or a hurricane or a bad marketing decision. But when there's a steady and prolonged drop in revenues, then you're looking at a serious, fundamental setback that won't be corrected overnight. The key lesson here is, you don't have to rush in to buy shares. You can afford to wait. In some cases, you can't afford not to wait.<p>Once a troubled company faces up to its predicament (this, too, can take time), it will announce a plan for recovery, which usually involves taking an ax to the budget. Here again, the would-be investor must be careful, because while cutting the budget may boost profits in the short run and create the impression that the company has put its troubles behind it, the real work has scarcely begun.<p>The hard part is winning back customers and reversing the decline in sales. A company that continues to spend less to make less will eventually have nothing to spend and nothing to make.<p>I should have reminded myself of this lesson before I invested in 50-Off Stores, a company that couldn't be more aptly named. 50-Off sells discount clothing in a chain of outlets strung across the southwestern U.S. The stock price hit a high of $32 in 1992, and then 50-Off went into a tailspin. Customers lost interest in its inventory of bargain-basement merchandise, and the stock itself fell to a bargain-basement level: $12. Or so I thought.<p>I visited three 50-Off stores in Texas and was impressed with a snazzy kid's shirt that I bought for a friend. More to the point, the company announced major changes and budget cuts and an exciting new array of bargain dry goods. Yet instead of waiting for results of these reforms to show up on the earnings line, I bought the stock posthaste, along with the shirt. The next thing I knew, the stock had two 50-off sales in a row, dropping to $6 and then to $3. It is currently at $4, slightly above book value.<p>Another lesson I've learned from experience is not to expect too much from companies on the mend. Occasionally, you'll stumble onto a Chrysler or a Fannie Mae, where you can make 10 to 20 times your money, as <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Magellan</b></a>'s shareholders did during my tenure at the fund. But comebacks are rarely that lucrative. A double or a triple is normally a great result. You get your ten-baggers from young companies in their fast-growth phases, not mature companies in a midlife crisis.<p>Turnarounds don't always happen once and for all. Sometimes there are false starts. Sometimes there are lapses and relapses. Chrysler, for instance, has had two turnarounds since the early 1980s. Kmart has had at least two since its heyday in the 1960s. <a name="NYSE:PIR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11185"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pier 1</b></a>, a perennial favorite of mine, is going through its third. I own the stock, and it's on my list of favorite turnarounds. The company has closed unprofitable stores and revamped the merchandise. Sales are up, and Pier 1 has a good chance of making record earnings this year. The stock is selling for half its price of five years ago. <p>Here are three more of my current favorites, each with concrete evidence of a turnaround and each of which I own:<p>GM: I've been touting GM since 1992, when it was selling for $32 a share. The way I see it, GM's diversification gives it an advantage over a one-dimensional enterprise like <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>. While GM's U.S. auto business has been a constant source of headaches and losses, its other operations (Hughes Aircraft, GMAC, Electronic Data Systems, U.S. trucks) have been highly profitable all along. For GM to rise again, all it has to do is break even on cars in this country.<p>GM has taken all sorts of steps to reduce costs, but what got my attention was how it turned around its European auto business a few years ago, then brought the key players from the team that accomplished this feat back to the U.S. to do the same at home. In the second quarter of 1994, GM wowed Wall Street by reporting the best quarterly earnings in its history: $1.9 billion. I suspect the best is yet to come.<p>SEARS: Sears closed its famous catalog, which was losing money, and added 200 small stores in rural areas to serve its former catalog customers. It sold 20 percent of its insurance subsidiary, Allstate, to the public in the biggest initial public offering in history and used the proceeds to improve its balance sheet. It has remodeled its stores and brought in new merchandise. It is doing well in Mexico. The outlook for Allstate, which contributes half of Sears's earnings, is favorable. <p>If everything continues to click, Sears has a chance to break its record and earn $5 per share in 1995. Meanwhile, the stock sells for $46, $15 below the record price.<p>TANDY: <a name="NYSE:TAN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11441"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tandy</b></a> has overhauled its basic business by selling off its computer-manufacturing operations. It is now a pure retailer, with 6,500 Radio Shack stores and $250 million in excess cash. Radio Shack has become a kind of 7-Eleven for household electronics, and soon all these outlets will offer repair service for items that are normally a hassle to get fixed. Bring your portable phone, VCR, answering machine, etc., to the neighborhood Radio Shack, and Tandy will ship it to one of its centralized repair shops and return it in working order. <p>Moreover, the company has trotted out a couple of megastore retail ventures: Computer City for computers and Incredible Universe for electronics and appliances. Both are growing fast. It looks like Computer City will rack up $1 billion in sales this year, and Incredible Universe nearly half that.<p>Because the Radio Shacks are doing well already, Tandy's earnings are on the rise without either of the new ventures contributing much. If both prove profitable, it's easy to imagine Tandy becoming a growth company again, a remarkable achievement for a turnaround. Even if only one new venture succeeds, it will be a big boost to earnings and presumably the stock price. The company has also announced a plan to buy back 10 percent of its shares -- usually a very good sign.<p>There's no harm in taking a "show me" attitude toward turnarounds. Once in a while you'll miss a few dollars of profit by not getting in at the bottom of the successful cases. But in the unsuccessful cases, you'll save yourself a lot of money and frustration. Missing the bottom on the way up won't cost you anything. It's missing the top on the way down that's always expensive.

America is phone obsessed, yet the markets hate phone companies.
It's time to ask: Do the Bells still toll for individual investors?<p>By Peter Lynch<p>This year marks the tenth anniversary of the breakup of <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>, alias Ma Bell, in the settlement of the biggest antitrust case ever. The Justice Department required AT&T to split itself into eight parts, with Ma going her way and the seven new Baby Bells going theirs. The Baby Bells got control of the local phone service in each region. Ma Bell kept the long distance.<p>Like the former Soviet Union, the old AT&T was a vast enterprise, often accused of being sluggish and outdated. In its heyday, it employed 1 out of every 100 American workers. It controlled virtually all the phones and all the phone lines. To make a  call without Ma Bell, you had to use tin cans and a string.<p>AT&T was also the nation's most popular and widely held stock, with 3 million shareholders. Institutional investors avoided it, but small investors have always loved it. The breakup didn't dampen their ardor. For every ten shares of Ma Bell, they  got one share in each of the Baby Bells. Ten years later, the four most widely held stocks in the U.S. are Bells, and the remaining Bells are in the top 15.<p>Meanwhile, AT&T continues to rank near the bottom of institutional ownership -- which for a large growth company is quite unusual -- and the pros have ostracized the other Bells as well. This has been a bad choice on their part, because the Bells as a group have made investors five times their money since the breakup, while the S&P 500 has merely tripled. Since a large majority of fund managers have underperformed the S&P during this period, only one conclusion is possible: The unsophisticates who stuck to their Bells have once again outfoxed the experts.<p>Until 1990, the offspring flourished while Ma Bell lagged, but lately it's been the other way around. Ma Bell has held its own against some stiff competition, and investors have responded by bidding up the shares, whereas the rest of the Bells have barely advanced. Because they are regulated like electric utilities and pay big dividends like electric utilities, they've been lumped together with electric utilities in the recent massive sell-off.<p>The big question, of course, is where the Bells go from here. In the end, their prosperity, or lack of it, will depend on who controls the phone lines and who is allowed to offer service to whom. So do not ask for whom the Bells toll, ask from whom they'll be collecting tolls, and whether they'll be collecting enough to make for a good investment.<p>Let's start with the bullish argument. The bulls say it's unfair to throw out the phone companies with the power companies. Electric utilities are bedeviled by rising costs and almost no growth, whereas phones have become a way of life. A five-line family is no longer out of the question, with one line for the teenagers to breathe into and one dedicated to the fax, plus a home phone and a home-office phone and the cellular unit, which has supplanted the cigarette as the most likely object to be carried into a party. There's shopping by phone, conferencing by phone, and pretty soon they'll have to put nonphone sections in restaurants.<p>On the cost side, roomfuls of operators have been replaced by machines and digital voices that don't require health insurance. Switching equipment is more compact and easier to manage than it once was. We've seen a 30 percent increase in phone hookups nationwide in the past 10 years, but phone-company payrolls have been cut in half. In 1984, a typical Baby Bell employed around 70 people per 10,000 phone lines. In 1994, they've got it down to about 35 people per 10,000 lines.<p>This is the heart of the bullish case for the Baby Bells. Demand is up and costs are down. These companies have staying power. At current prices, their stocks are yielding slightly more than 5 percent. It's the highest percentage the Bells have ever paid in dividends, relative to the S&P 500, which currently pays 2.8 percent. On top of that, the Bells have picked up some valuable assets on the side, most notably the cellular franchises.<p>Cellular started out as a fad, a curiosity, a CB radio for yuppies. In each region, two franchises were awarded, one to the local Baby Bell and the other to a lottery winner -- Hillary Clinton was in a partnership that won a stake in a franchise in Arkansas. Who could have imagined that by 1994 we'd have over 16 million cellular subscribers nationwide, and no end in sight to the line of recruits? With 6 percent of the population already cellularized, that makes 94 percent who are still potential customers.<p>Recently, we found out what one of these cellular franchises is really worth. The California Baby Bell, <a name="NYSE:PAC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11147"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pacific Telesis</b></a>, decided to spin off its cellular as a separate business and make it a gift to shareholders. For every share of PacTel, you got a free share of <a name="NYSE:ATI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16964"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AirTouch Communications</b></a>. These AirTouch shares now trade on the New York Stock Exchange for about $25 apiece. PacTel without the Airtouch is selling for about $30 a share, so the cellular part turns out to be almost as valuable as the rest of the phone company.<p>Thanks to the Los Angeles commuters who use their car phones for companionship while they're trapped for hours on freeways and the Hollywood types who make deals while they're jogging, PacTel was number one among the Bells in cellular, with the most customers and most revenue. But the other Bells have built up sizable cellular operations in their regions, and they've bought additional franchises from lottery winners outside their regions. Along the way, they've acquired paging services, cable TV assets, real estate, and bits and pieces of phone companies in Mexico, Russia, and elsewhere. <p>I got the rundown on Southwestern Bell from Bill Deatherage, a telecommunications analyst for S.G. Warburg. Southwestern has a cellular business that's worth an estimated $13.75 a share, a large stake in the Mexican telephone system ($5 a share), and other assorted properties ($3 a share). That's almost $22 in extras beyond the basic phone service. Deatherage figures the total package, minus the company's debt, is valued at $55, and the stock is selling for $43.<p>At the moment, Deatherage's favorite Bell is <a name="NYSE:USW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11518"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>U S West</b></a>. That stock sells for $42. Every share gives you $5 worth of cellular, $6 worth of Time Warner, $3 in international cable and cellular, $4 in real estate, and $4 in assorted odds and ends. When the company's debts are subtracted, you're left with $58.75 worth of assets.<p>But before we get too carried away with the bullish case, let me give you the bearish case. The crux of it is that the Baby Bells are losing control of local phone service. Where once they enjoyed a monopoly, now they have to fight off a growing number of competitors, especially for long-distance hookups, known in the trade as "handshakes."<p>Even though the Baby Bells are not long-distance carriers per se, they get paid for every toll call that begins or ends in their area. On an average call, one costing 17 to 18 cents per minute, the Bells at each end get 3 to 4 cents for transporting the call to and from the local lines to the long-distance lines. Where I live, near Boston, a long-distance call is any call that travels beyond the next town, so a piece of this action is very important to my regional Bell, <a name="NYSE:NYN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11044"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>NYNEX</b></a>.<p>Imagine how much cheaper long distance would be if there weren't a Bell at each end. It's already happening in the business districts of major cities, where the so-called competitive access providers, or CAPs, have arrived with their fiber cables. A CAP can connect a local business to a long-distance carrier and cut the local Bell right out of the equation. The Bell is forced to cooperate with its enemies by letting the CAPs install switching equipment on its own premises. Recent court decisions may change this.<p>The CAPs won't be coming to my house or yours anytime soon, but they have connected enough cables to enough businesses to take a sizable bite out of the Bells' revenues. The Bells are putting up an active resistance. One -- <a name="NYSE:BEL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10197"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bell Atlantic</b></a> -- recently won a court case that frees it from obligation to let the CAPs set up shop in its central office. All seven Bells are seeking permission to compete in the long-distance market, just as other companies have been allowed to compete in their local markets. <p>Sibling loyalty counts for nothing here. Southwestern Bell recently sought court approval to offer local phone service to a town in Maryland, in the middle of Bell Atlantic's territory. If this holds up, it will be every Bell for itself.<p>An advocate of the bearish viewpoint regarding the Baby Bells is Jack Grubman, telecommunications analyst for Salomon Brothers. While Grubman acknowledges the value of cellular, etc., he thinks the benefits of cost-cutting are overrated, because whenever a Bell can save a dollar by laying off a worker, it will lose a dollar to the lower rates that result from the fierce competition. He regards the big dividends as something of a hindrance, because they leave the Bells perpetually short of cash. Since it may ultimately cost them billions to rewire their systems to keep up with new technology, they're going to need all the cash they can get.<p>Grubman rates the Bells as holds. He sees them as 5 percent to 7 percent growers. He prefers long-distance carriers: AT&T, <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:FON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11560"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sprint</b></a>, in that order -- each of which he thinks can keep up double-digit growth rates. He says the long-distance carriers are growing as fast as many drug companies, but their stocks are much cheaper on earnings.<p>The future of the Bells and the CAPs, and everybody else in the phone business for that matter, depends to a large degree on the whims of the regulators, the politicians, the courts, and the deal makers on Wall Street. Will the telephone company bring movies into the house, or will the cable company offer telephone service? Will the CAPs be put out of business, or will they capture more revenues from the Bells? Will the Bells be allowed to compete with the long-distance carriers, especially on the calls that begin and end in their regions? Will their various alliances with cable companies and overseas telephone companies prove profitable? Will they be allowed to make massive raids on each other's territory?<p>There are more questions than answers, and a lot of work for the fortune tellers. But all things considered, I wouldn't bet against the Bells. In fact, I own two of them myself, Southwestern Bell and NYNEX. In the bull market of 1991-93, these stocks went nowhere, and in the decline of 1994 they're falling along with the rest. With their dividends paying almost twice the yield of the S&P 500, they already reflect a gloomy prognosis.<p>Wall Street is betting that the Bells will be the losers in the legislation coming out of Congress, but they have a lot of moxie and a lot of clout in Washington. Clout doesn't show up anywhere on a balance sheet, but in a regulated industry, it's the most valuable asset of all.

What do the great successes of the past 20 years tell us? It's the company, stupid.<p>By Peter Lynch<p>What can we learn from the hit parade of the stock market, the top 100 winners over the past decade -- and the decade before that? The first thing I notice is the lack of household names. <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:G"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10655"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gillette</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a> crop up, and also <a name="NYSE:PEP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11166"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PepsiCo</b></a> and Blockbuster Entertainment, but celebrity issues are in the minority. Wal-Mart and Blockbuster began their winning decades small and uncelebrated.<p>If there was ever a doubt that small stocks make big moves whereas big stocks make smaller moves, the hit parade ought to put it to rest. The star performers on Wall Street come straight from nowhere. Most of them never got into the Fortune 500. At the outset of each of the two decades, only a handful of the eventual winners could be found in the Standard & Poor's 500.<p>A few are unknown to me even today, and I'm the guy who once managed a portfolio with 1,500 different stocks. How did I miss some of these? <a name="NASD:NAUT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nautica Enterprises</b></a>, almost a 9,000 percent gainer? <a name="AMEX:GDX.A"></a><b>Genovese Drug Stores</b>? <a name="NYSE:WHT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11633"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Whitehall Corp.</b></a>? New Hampshire Ball Bearings? Who would have thunk it?<p>In the 1973-83 period, small companies were doing so well that it took a 25-fold gain to make the hit parade. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials performed dully, rising from 850 to 1248. No wonder so many mutual fund managers outperformed the market averages in those years: They were picking above-average small stocks that turned in spectacular gains. <p>In the more recent period, the situation is somewhat reversed. The Dow tripled, going from 1258 to 3751, while small companies slumped a bit -- it took only a tenfold gain to make the second hit parade. So it's hardly surprising that the vast majority of fund managers in the 1980s were outdone by the so-called index funds that ape the averages.<p>Going down the two lists of winners from the past two decade (see the lists following this article), you get a quick read on the modern U.S. economy and the direction in which we've been headed. Disney and Coke are the only two Dow stocks. There are no aluminums, ores, or chemicals in either of the top 100s and only one paper company (<a name="NASD:WSAU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15126"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wausau</b></a>), a lone steel company (<a name="NASD:WTHG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Worthington</b></a>), a small oil company (<a name="AMEX:HOC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Holly</b></a>), and one tire maker (<a name="NYSE:CBE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10405"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cooper</b></a>). You have to search to find the cyclicals.<p>So what does this say? For one thing, since we are no longer a gritty industrial nation, we aren't likely to get spectacular returns from gritty industrial investments. And it's the rare cyclical that performs well enough over long stretches to make a hit parade. You can't go to sleep holding cyclical stocks for a decade and expect to be richly rewarded. The rich rewards are in growth stocks and special situations.<p>As you can see by the evidence, great growth companies come in endless variety. This is a point that can't be repeated often enough. Banks, S&Ls, supermarkets, biotech, carpets, bubble gum, ballpoint pens, sugar, and health care are all represented in the top 100. There are a few casino gambling companies, a few stodgy financial companies, and a couple of insurance companies to boot. <p>Investors who put on blinders and ignore entire categories of companies, such as the stodgy utilities, or the lousy airlines, or the silly candy makers that only sell to a bunch of kids, are missing out on some great deals. Stodgy utilities? Not General Public Utilities, the owner of Three Mile Island, which almost made the hit parade with a 1,000 percent gain on its stock in the latest decade. The lousy airlines? A lot of people will tell you never to put a penny into that mess. Yet here we find three airlines -- <a name="NASD:COMR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13032"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Comair</b></a>, <a name="NASD:ASAI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12682"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Atlantic Southeast</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:LUV"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11377"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Southwest</b></a>, with the latter two high on the winner's list. Southwest's stockholders made 12,000 percent from 1973 to 1983.<p>If it's a choice between investing in a good company in a great industry, or a great company in a lousy industry, I'll take the great company in the lousy industry any day. Good management, a strong balance sheet, and a sensible plan of action will overcome many obstacles, but when you've got weak management, a weak balance sheet, and a misguided plan of action, the greatest industry in the world won't bail you out. Here's my investment motto of the month: It's the company, stupid.<p>Notice the number of bank stocks on the recent winner's list? Eleven, by my count. The period from 1983 to 1993 was the best of times for some banks and the worst for others. There were S&L fiascoes and bank failures galore, but a long drop in interest rates and an accommodating Federal Reserve helped many banks to record profits. And look who made the most of it. You don't see <a name="NYSE:CCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10345"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Citicorp</b></a> or <a name="NYSE:JPM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10812"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>J.P. Morgan</b></a> on the hit parade. You see River Forest Bancorp and <a name="NASD:TRST"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14953"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Trustco Bancorp of New York</b></a>, and a couple of obscure S&Ls, <a name="NASD:TCTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14929"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tompkins Country Trust Co. of Ithaca</b></a> and National Commerce Bancorp of Tennessee. Imagine all the Ithacans who bought Dow stocks to be in the big time with proven winners and missed Tompkins Country Trust in their own backyard.<p>The retailers make a strong showing on both lists: the <a name="NYSE:GPS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11469"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gap</b></a>, Blockbuster, <a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:BBA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16119"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bombay Co.</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:CC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10343"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Circuit City</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:HMV"></a><b>Heilig-Meyers</b> (a furniture seller) on the later, and Wal-Mart, <a name="NYSE:MFI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15731"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mac Frugal's Bargains Closeouts</b></a>, the <a name="NYSE:LTD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11471"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Limited</b></a>, <a name="NASD:CHRS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12948"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charming Shoppes</b></a>, Dunkin' Donuts, <a name="NASD:HECHA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13666"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hechinger</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:PBY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pep Boys -- Manny Moe & Jack</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:TAN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11441"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tandy</b></a> (owner of Radio Shack), and <a name="NYSE:SME"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11342"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Service Merchandise</b></a> on the earlier.<p>I've always been partial to retailers (a poorly kept secret), and to find them on a hit parade is no surprise. Retailing is easy to keep track of, and there's great potential for earnings growth by expansion. All a company has to do is take a successful store and clone it. What sells in Pomona is an odds-on favorite to sell in Phoenix, and in Peoria, etc. Meanwhile, if somebody improves on the idea and opens a similar but better store in Philadelphia, so what? The new rival isn't going to hurt business in Pomona until the competitor puts a store in Pomona, and that may never happen in this lifetime.<p>With retailers, you can see the competitors coming, and you can see when a company has reached the saturation point with a store in every mall and on every other street corner. That's the time to think about selling the stock, but until that point is reached, a successful chain of stores can multiply its sales and its earnings at an exponential rate. It happens again and again.<p>It tells you something that only two companies made the top 100 in both decades. Fast-growing companies can't be expected to keep up the pace forever. Eventually, they reach middle age and lose some of their oomph, just like the rest of us. They encounter obstacles. <p>But it also tells you something that of the two repeat performers, Circuit City is a retailer and <a name="AMEX:HAS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12007"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hasbro</b></a> is a manufacturer that sells to retailers. Successful retailers have a lot of staying power. They can grow for a lot longer than people think. If they run out of room in the U.S., they can go overseas, just like <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a> has, and Coke, and PepsiCo, and <a name="NYSE:TOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11495"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toys 'R' Us</b></a>. McDonald's doesn't show up among the winners, but it's been an outstanding growth company and a terrific stock -- a 100-bagger in 25 years.<p>On both lists, there's no lack of high-tech stuff, companies with names like E-Systems and Pneumo Corp., <a name="NASD:MATX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10283"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Matrix</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:TDY"></a><b>Teledyne</b>, Scimed and <a name="NASD:GNTX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13558"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gentex</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:EDO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10489"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>EDO</b></a> and <a name="NASD:BMET"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12777"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Biomet</b></a>, <a name="NASD:AMGN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12623"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Amgen</b></a> and Alpha. In hindsight, it would have been nice to have owned these stocks, but my advice is: If you don't know what it means, don't put money into it. Why take chances with a Biomet when you can do just as well or better with a Wrigley's or a <a name="NYSE:TR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11490"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tootsie Roll</b></a>? <p>Did you notice that among all the high-tech issues, biogenetic companies, science labs, etc., there's not a single computer? Computer parts, yes; support services, yes; the software and the chips are all represented, but there's no <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> or <a name="NYSE:DEC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10462"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Digital</b></a> or <a name="NYSE:CPQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10381"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Compaq</b></a> or <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple</b></a>. It's one more example of how the suppliers to a hot industry, the residual players, can fare better than the main competitors who are engaged in a desperate struggle to knock each other off.<p>In the end, what's most gratifying about these two lists is they prove that there's equal opportunity on Wall Street. Small companies can come out of humble circumstances and rise to the top, creating jobs, creating wealth, creating a better world for everyone. What long-distance company is on the hit parade? Not <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a> but LDDS Communications. The winning airlines are the three regional carriers mentioned above. <p>It's Horatio Alger all over again -- small companies outdoing the big companies and taking up the slack when the big companies lay off workers. More than 2.1 million small companies were started in the U.S. in the 1980s alone. If each one, on average, employs ten workers, that's 21 million new jobs! <p>Europe has small companies, but not nearly the number we have, which may explain why the European recession has been more severe than ours was. Small companies may be our greatest national assets. There's no doubt they are our greatest investments.

Not only is this the right point in the business cycle to look at quality growth stocks, it's also the right time of year.<p>By Peter Lynch<p>In the seasons of the stockpicker, late in the year is when a small stock often loses its value, only to revive in January. Thus, aficionados of small stocks do their bargain hunting in November and December, then await the January Effect, when the small stocks come out of their holes. There's a different season for the quality growth stocks, though fewer people know about it. Spring to early summer is the best time to shop for potential bargains in great companies such as <a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:JNJ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10824"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Johnson & Johnson</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:PEP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11166"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PepsiCo</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:ABT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10030"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Abbott Labs</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:G"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10655"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gillette</b></a>.<p>These big-name issues and others like them tend to bloom in the second half of the year, when the smaller stocks are starting to wilt. This Second-Half Effect is caused by portfolio managers who bid up the prices for quality growth stocks in the third and fourth quarters. I'll explain why in a minute.<p>This is a timely subject, because right now we're in the bargain phase before the Second-Half Effect takes hold in the market. What makes it even more interesting is that quality growth stocks have done poorly of late. While other kinds of stocks scored big gains from 1991 to 1993, as a group the quality growth issues went nowhere. <p>A representative list of these recent underachievers in the market appears at the end of this file. PepsiCo has been flat; Gillette, dull; <a name="NYSE:HRB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10689"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>H&R Block</b></a>, a brick; <a name="NYSE:RBD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11294"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Rubbermaid</b></a>, a stiff; Home Depot, nothing to write home about. <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a>, the star performer of the lot, has outgained the S&P 500, but that's the notable exception. Out of this dreary dozen, seven stocks are selling for near or less than their 1991 prices.<p>If this was your entire portfolio in 1991, you missed two years of excellent advances, particularly the run-up in cyclicals. As a group, the cyclicals shown gained 37 percent while the growth group gained only 3 percent. <p>If Home Depot, Johnson & Johnson, etc., had lost their knack for making money, I wouldn't be touting them now. But there is nothing fundamentally wrong with them. Over the long haul, these have been terrific investments. Their earnings go up every year. They have a habit of raising their dividends continually. The only problem is that their stocks have been overpriced. <p>In early 1991, I noticed this situation and issued a warning: Avoid expensive growth stocks. But don't give me the swami award for this call. I saw it coming on the charts. The technical mumbo jumbo that usually goes along with chart reading is beyond me, but there's a simple exercise that I've found to be invaluable. You can do it yourself. In fact, once you've digested the next two paragraphs, you'll be as capable as I am of sounding the alarm the next time the growth group gets overextended.<p>If you were to examine a chart showing Johnson & Johnson's annual earnings per share going back more than 15 years, you would see a steady, straight line of earnings growth. This is the typical footprint of a quality growth company: steady increases in earnings with only the occasional bobble.<p>A line showing Johnson & Johnson's stock price over the same period would looks like it was drawn with a shaky hand. The stock hit a high of $58 in late 1991, and it's been mostly downhill since. On such a chart, the price line and the earnings line, taken together, serve as an important reminder of what we're buying when we buy a stock: a share of the earnings. A glance at these two lines gives us a visual history of the price-to-earnings ratio of the company--what investors have been paying for the earnings along the way. <p>When the price line strays far above the earnings line, as it did for Johnson & Johnson in 1991, it means the stock is very expensive, and people are paying an unusually high price for owning Johnson & Johnson. I found similar gaps up and down the quality-growth list.<p>That's what told me three years ago that it wasn't the time to be adding Home Depot and <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a> to a portfolio.<p>Such charts are found in books published by the Securities Research Co., but there's no need for the casual investor to subscribe. Most brokerage houses carry chart books in their libraries, and brokers will readily lend out their copies. For my purposes, charts don't need to be reviewed very often. It's a good idea to consult them before you buy a stock, then every six months or so thereafter.<p>While quality growth stocks were lagging the market from 1991 to '93, the cyclicals had a great run. Cyclicals came into vogue as Wall Street's portfolio jockeys anticipated an upswing in the economy. Investors who were savvy to this change in market leadership doubled their money in <a name="NYSE:BS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10210"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bethlehem Steel</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:DE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10444"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Deere & Co.</b></a>, and did better than that in <a name="NYSE:OCF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11132"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Owens-Corning</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:CAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10304"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Caterpillar</b></a>.<p>Now consider what you would see on a chart for Bethlehem Steel, a company on our cyclical list. You would notice that the earnings-per-share line wanders all over the place. As any Wall Street Boy Scout can tell you, this is the footprint of a cyclical. Cyclical companies produce or sell big-ticket items such as tractors or cars, which people will buy in good times and put off buying in bad times. That's why the earnings are so streaky.<p>Quality-growth companies, on the other hand, sell small-ticket items such as hamburgers or shaving cream or necessities such as pharmaceuticals. People won't stop buying Tylenol and Band-Aids no matter what shape the economy is in. That's why Johnson & Johnson's earnings line is so beautifully straight.<p>I'll buy almost any company at some price, and whereas two years ago the growth group was overpriced and the cyclicals were cheap, now it's the reverse. Let's go back to the chart of Johnson & Johnson. The stock price has fallen and the earnings have risen to the point that the troublesome gap is almost closed. Other quality growth stocks are beginning to close their gaps as well. <p>This doesn't mean you can shut your eyes and pick a growth stock. Sometimes, a stock is cheap for good reason - the company has troubles. With every company, there is something to worry about, but the question is, which worries are valid and which are not? <p>You may have noticed I omitted <a name="NYSE:OAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11237"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Quaker Oats</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:GRB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10650"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gerber Products</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:K"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10841"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kellogg</b></a>, and other food companies from our list of 12. These are solid growth companies, but at the moment their stocks are not cheap. The cereal and baby-food business has become highly competitive, with everybody fighting for market share by cutting prices. Price wars are not good for earnings, so this is a valid worry.<p>A less valid worry is the one that says U.S. health care reform with price controls on drugs would ruin Johnson & Johnson. My research tells me that Johnson & Johnson gets only one third of its revenues from pharmaceuticals. And more than half of those come from overseas, where price controls on drugs have existed for years. So whatever happens in the U.S. political arena won't affect J&J as much as people think. <p>This brings us back to the Second-Half Effect. One of the natural tendencies of fund managers is to start the year dwelling in the present, but then to begin to anticipate the future as soon as the snow melts. In the winter months of 1994, they were thinking about 1994 earnings. For instance, McDonald's is expected to earn $3.36 this year. But when summer rolls around, analysts begin to think about 1995 earnings, when McDonald's is expected to earn $3.83. On the basis of 1995 earnings, McDonald's stock suddenly looks cheap. So a lot of people buy it, and the price goes up. Nothing has changed, except a page has turned on the calendar.<p>The Second-Half Effect does not apply to cyclicals. Their earnings are too unstable. Is <a name="NYSE:AA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10068"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Alcoa</b></a> cheap on 1995 earnings? Who can say? What Alcoa will make in 1995 is anybody's guess. What it will make in 1994 is anybody's guess. It all depends on the price of aluminum, and you do need a swami to predict that.<p>I can't say enough about the fact that earnings are the key to success in investing in stocks. No matter what happens to the market, the earnings will determine the results. In 30 years, Johnson & Johnson's earnings are up 70-fold, and the stock is up 70-fold. Bethlehem Steel earns less today than it did 30 years ago, and guess what? The stock sells for less than it did 30 years ago.<p>In a bear market, the Johnson & Johnsons will suffer right along with the Bethlehems (although perhaps not as much), and nobody will be happy. But between Bethlehem with its spotty record and Johnson & Johnson doubling its earnings every six or seven years and raising its dividend like clockwork, which would you like to have in your portfolio a decade from now?

Meet an amateur investor with an approach -- and a track record -- any professional would be proud of<p>By Peter Lynch<p>My candidate for the world's greatest amateur investor is Charles Silk. I met this fellow Bostonian halfway around the world, at a reception at the Bible Lands Museum in Jersualem in 1992. We were part of a trade mission to Israel sponsored by the state of Massachusetts. It turned out we had a few friends and many stocks in common. On a bus ride to historic sites, we had our first extended chat. Not about historic sites, but about Blockbuster Entertainment, Charlie's most successful pick.<p>Charlie bought Blockbuster many splits ago, in 1984, for $3 a share. It wasn't called Blockbuster yet. It was called Cook Data Services, which fit into Charlie's area of expertise. He had had his own data-processing company, which had fallen on hard times, and he was forced to shut it down. He was sitting home, doing telemarketing for a software outfit and wishing he could find another way to make a living. <p>Cook Data Services solved his problem. The shares he bought for $3 apiece are worth $450 today, so his $10,000 investment became a living in itself. Thanks to this one exciting stock, he was able to abandon telemarketing and devote himself to his favorite hobby--looking for more exciting stocks. He and two of his three sons are now full-time stock pickers.<p>I've often said that a couple five-baggers every decade is enough to make do-it-yourself investing a worthwhile pastime. With a 150-bagger like Cook Data, one every half century or so is all anybody needs.<p>Call Charlie a lucky man for stumbling onto Cook Data Services, but luck didn't make him a millionaire. The hard part was holding on to the stock long enough to get the full benefit. After the price had doubled and then tripled, he didn't say to himself, I'll take my profits and run, like many investors who invent arbitrary rules for when to sell. He wasn't scared out when the price dropped, as it did several times, and he ignored the highly publicized negative comments made by forecasters and "experts" who knew less about Blockbuster than he did. He had the discipline to hold on as long as the fundamentals of the company were favorable. It was not a guess on his part. He was doing his homework all along.<p>In my investing career, the best gains usually have come in the third or fourth year, not in the third or fourth week or the third or fourth month. It took eight years for Charlie to get his 150-bagger, but in a way, he'd been preparing for the opportunity since college.<p>At the University of Michigan, where he earned a degree in accounting and finance, Charlie was first exposed to one of life's great mysteries: How do you find a good stock? A professor named Wilford J. Eiteman, famous at the time for his market theories, posed the question. Over the years, Charlie found his own answer. He searches for good stocks among small companies that are relatively debt free and have been beaten down in the market, to the point that they're selling for less than the cash in their bank accounts. "I'm paying nothing for the company itself," Charlie says in his rich Boston accent. "The only thing I'm risking is my patience."<p>He reminds us that on the New York Stock Exchange, 70 percent of the companies are followed by two or more analysts, but on Nasdaq, 72 percent are not covered by any analysts. This lack of coverage helps produce the great distortions between price and value that he seeks out. <p>Beginning in the 1960s, Charlie combed the so-called pink sheets in the over-the-counter market. Many small companies went public in the hot initial-public-offerings market late in the decade only to see their prices collapse in the 1973-74 bear market. But it was a heyday for Charlie. Roaming through the wreckage, he found several low-risk opportunities in the area he understood: computers and data processing. A company called Computer Usage had $4.10 a share in cash; he bought the stock for $2.25. Another was Scientific Computers, which had $1.37 a share in cash and at one point was selling for 25 cents. On the rebound, it hit a high of $33.50, but Charlie had bailed out at about $6. "I learned then how tricky it is to know when to sell," he says. <p>Now we move forward to 1984. Another hot IPO market was followed by a collapse at the end of that year. Small high-tech stocks suffered the most. For Charlie, it was 1974 all over again, except this time he didn't have to bother with pink sheets. Nasdaq had launched its computerized trading system.<p>He surveyed this latest wreckage. Cook Data Services caught his eye. It sold software programs to oil and gas companies--right up Charlie's alley. It came public in 1983 at $16 a share and quickly rose to $21.50, but the price had fallen to $8 when Charlie began tracking it. He was still tracking when year-end selling dropped the price to $3. <p>This was the kind of risk Charlie liked to take: a company with no debt and $4 a share in cash, selling for $3. But cash in itself is no guarantee of success. If a company is sick to begin with, it has to spend its cash to stay alive. Cook Data was quite healthy. Its revenues had increased four years in a row. "To produce a record like that," Charlie says, "they had to have something on the ball." His $10,000 investment was as much as he could scrape up. It made him one of the largest shareholders.<p>A few months after Charlie bought his shares, Cook Data announced it was moving away from data services and into the "consumer area." The company's president, David Cook, had an ex-wife who was a movie buff. Apparently, she still had some influence and convinced him to open a video superstore in Dallas.<p>Charlie wanted to know more. He got some of his best information by calling the company directly. He made contact with the CEO, Ken Anderson, and also with the investor-relations person, Barbara Phelps. She agreed to send him articles about Cook Data that appeared in the Dallas newspapers.<p>One of the most interesting things the company sent Charlie was an independent study on the future of the video-rental industry. "When I read that thing," Charlie says, "I found out that 30 percent of American households owned VCRs, and that eventually 60-70 percent would own these machines. [This estimate turned out to be conservative.] All these millions of people with VCRs were going to need an endless supply of tapes."<p>It got more interesting when he went to the library and looked up company filings in the SEC's Official Summary of Security Transactions and Holdings. He saw that two different groups, the Sanchezes from Texas and Scott and Lawrence Beck from Illinois, had become major shareholders. Scott Beck was coauthor of the video study and obviously impressed by his own research. Charlie also learned that revenues from the Dallas superstore had more than doubled  in the first three months of operation. His sources at the company confirmed these numbers and told him how crowded the store was. It was amazing, they said. People were driving from as far as 30 miles away.<p>Meanwhile, the stock price had begun to rise on heavy volume. Volume is something Charlie watches very closely. In his experience, stocks on the way down usually don't hit bottom until the volume has subsided. Heavy volume in the upward direction is often a harbinger of more big moves. In six months from late 1984 to early 1985, he'd already made five times his money. Some of his friends were urging him to be sensible and to take his wonderful profit. This is where many investors would have tripped up, but having missed some spectacular gains in the 1970s, Charlie kept his focus where it belonged--not on the stock price but on the company itself. <p>In spring of 1986 Blockbuster opened an outlet in West Roxbury, a mile from Charlie's house. Suddenly, everything he had been hearing about came to life, and he could see the crowds for himself. It is a tremendous advantage for investors to have stores owned by immature public companies open in their neighborhoods. They get an early whiff of success or failure before Wall Street picks up the trail. Perhaps if there had been a Blockbuster in my own little suburb of Boston, I would have noticed what Charlie noticed. "My sons and I would go over there on Saturday night and count cars," he said. "The parking lot was always packed. I thought to myself, 'This is going to be incredible.'"<p>By late summer 1986, three new superstores had opened in Texas, and the Becks had bought franchise rights to four new cities. Revenues continued to grow at a rapid pace.  A secondary stock offering was planned for September to raise money for more expansion. The company was changing its name from Cook Data to Blockbuster Entertainment.<p>A week or so before the offering, Charlie was reading Alan Abelson's column in Barron's, when he came to a pan of Blockbuster. Abelson's argument: Who needs another video store?<p>Abelson's comment produced a spate of selling that caused the stock price to drop 15 percent. Charlie was a fan of Abelson's, but he was confident he knew more about Blockbuster. The sales figures from Blockbuster showed that people were flocking to the new superstores. But enough investors backed away from the offering that instead of the anticipated $20 million, Blockbuster could raise only $3.7 million. <p>Wayne Huizenga, the Waste Management tycoon, entered the picture in late 1987. A partner with Scott Beck's father, Huizenga jumped on the Blockbuster opportunity, eventually taking complete control. "Now I was really impressed," Charlie says. "I was aware of the terrific job Huizenga had done at Waste Management. I also liked the fact that he wanted to concentrate on company-owned stores, more profitable than a franchise operation."<p>Toward the middle of 1987, Charlie started worrying about the stock market in general and the fact that he had too much money riding on one issue. So he sold a portion of his shares in the high 30s, just before the big correction in October of that year. Short term, this proved to be a smart move, because Blockbuster stock promptly fell by half, to $16. But longer term, he would have been better off to hold on to every share to get all of Blockbuster's tenfold gain over the next four years.<p>In 1989, another Wall Street expert spooked the shareholders. Lee Seidler, an analyst for <a name="NYSE:BSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10191"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bear Stearns</b></a>, made a big fuss over the company's practice of carrying a large quantity of older and less-popular video tapes on the books as assets, when in his opinion they were worthless. This, he argued, made the company appear more profitable than it was. <p>Seidler's salvo was taken so seriously that the stock price got clobbered (falling 36 percent). The accounting flap was still an issue six months later when Huizenga visited Fidelity in December 1989. I was running <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity's Magellan</b></a> fund at the time and  was impressed with his explanation. He said that even if the company changed accounting methods, the result would be a one-time earnings drop of 10 to 15 cents. This was peanuts compared to the tremendous growth of the company.<p>Having done his own research, Charlie didn't need to meet Huizenga to reach the same conclusion. He and his sons had traveled to New York, Connecticut, and elsewhere to visit other Blockbuster stores. Everywhere the stores were jammed with customers.<p>Today, Charlie still owns a big chunk of Blockbuster. The recent merger with <a name="AMEX:VIA"></a><b>Viacom</b>, which in turn has swallowed up Paramount, has complicated the story considerably. He's studying the situation.<p>For all the benefit he's gotten from this one company, following its progress has taken him only a few hours a month. These days, Charlie works at his investing full-time, though his method is basically simple. Every morning, he scans the Nasdaq section of the business pages, looking for stocks that have fallen to new lows. From the Moody's OTC Industrial Manual and other sources, he finds out which of these beaten-down companies are cash rich with no debt and have a potential for a turnaround.<p>He is excited by the hundreds of new small companies launched at high prices in the hot IPO market of the past three years. Already, some of these 1,400 or so companies have fallen out of favor. Whenever we get the next sharp correction, Charlie will be ready to pick up the valuable pieces.

The author, perhaps the most famous stock picker ever, tells how to profit from one of the best opportunities he has witnessed during a 30-year career of beating Wall Street<p>By Peter Lynch<p>My first column for Worth appeared in the August/September 1992 issue. The subject was the great investment opportunities in the scores of mutual savings banks and thrifts (a.k.a. savings and loans that were going public). Perhaps you know what's happened since then: The share prices of many of these new public companies have doubled, tripled, and even quadrupled in the period following the initial offerings. In my 30 years of looking at stocks, I've rarely seen a group do as well as this one has.  <p>During good times for packaged foods, insurance, or retailers, not every food packager, insurance company, or retailer is going to share in the prosperity. An investor may find the right sector but choose the wrong stock and lose money. But among the mutual savings banks, it's hard to find a wrong stock. Of the 13 that began trading in 1991, the worst performer is up 89 percent.(For more on that year's conversions, see "Class of 1991" on this page.) Out of 46 new issues in 1992, there's only one loser to date. And of the 57 initial offerings in 1993, there are no losers; 30 have gained more than 30 percent. <p>I'm not telling this old story to exercise my hindsight--who cares about the wonderful investments we all might have made in years past? What causes me to revisit the topic is the 1,231 mutual savings banks that haven't yet converted to public ownership. On top of those, a sizable number of prior converts are trading in the market at bargain prices.<p>The savings banks have recently made headlines, but not the kind I'd like to see. It seems that a small number of officers and directors have been enriching themselves on their own conversions by issuing themselves free shares or options to buy shares at a discount. There's a move afoot in Congress to put a stop to the insiders' profiteering, and the Office of Thrift Supervision has slapped a moratorium on all future deals while it studies the matter. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department has halted all direct sales of savings banks to larger commercial banks.<p>I'm no fan of insiders getting more than they deserve. If that's the situation, it ought to be corrected. But to my mind, the prospering of insiders is not the biggest tragedy with conversions. The biggest tragedy is that millions of depositors, average people with CDs or savings accounts, also could have prospered but have not. When given the chance to participate in the scores of recent offerings, only 2 percent of the depositors have taken advantage. The rest have turned down what may be the opportunity of a lifetime.<p>My guess is that this moratorium on thrift conversions will be lifted sooner or later. Some way has to be found to bring the remaining mutuals into the system of public ownership, or else they'll be unable to compete with the other banks and thrifts that enjoy access to public capital. And unless the rules are drastically revised in the wrong direction, there will be more good deals to come. I only hope that more individuals will enjoy the benefits.<p>So we know what we're taking about here, mutual savings banks, thrifts, and savings and loans are varieties of the same species. Some are chartered by the states and others by the federal government. Many began in the 19th century as neighborhood associations, similar to electric co-ops or food co-ops. They aren't owned by anyone in particular, except the mass of depositors. This mass ownership is what creates a windfall for the new shareholders, as I'll explain in more detail below. <p>It's ironic that mutual-savings-bank conversions are branded in the press as unfair to the little guy. Actually, conversions are the rare exception where the little guy gets to buy shares at the initial offering price. In nearly any other kind of IPO, the Wall Street gorillas (institutions, mutual funds) grab all the shares, while the average person is shut out. I often wonder why we bother to call these events public offerings at all; generally, the public has nothing to do with them.<p>But the offerings of savings banks are truly democratic. Widows, blue-collar workers, and kids with paper routes get a crack at the shares. Although the actual requirements for conversion vesting (that is, eligibility for buying shares at conversion) vary from bank to bank, in most cases a passbook balance of $100 to $500 will give you the right to purchase as much stock as you can afford, up to several hundred thousand dollars' worth.<p>When a savings bank decides to convert, one of the first things it does is send out letters to all depositors informing them of these rights. Most of these letters, and most of the announcements that follow, end up in the trash along with the junk mail. People are used to getting toaster ovens and calendars from banks--not stock solicitations. They think there's something fishy about a bank's inviting them to put up money in advance to buy its own shares. They've all read the stories about Charles Keating.<p>This rejection by its own customers usually forces the bank to extend its offer to an ever-widening group of outsiders: residents of the county, residents of neighboring counties, or even all residents of the state. Some of the shares will end up in the hands of professional investors like me who open accounts in a variety of banks and thrifts with the sole purpose of hitting upon a possible conversion. I know about this from personal experience. Seven years ago, my wife, Carolyn, and I bought CDs in several different mutuals in our vicinity. <p>Becoming a serial depositor is not everybody's idea of an exciting time, and keeping track of the paperwork can be a minor hassle. On the plus side, it only takes one conversion to make all your troubles worthwhile. We have been fortunate enough to have stumbled into four: three in the area around greater Boston, where we live, and one in Maine, where the family goes skiing. Given the remarkable performance of so many other conversions around the country, I only wish we had spent the latter part of the 1980s traveling from coast to coast, sticking money into thrifts.<p>On second thought, the kids would have mutinied in the back seat. Anyway, the vesting requirements have been tightened to discourage the long-distance carpetbaggers. That's just as well. I'm all for keeping the profits in the neighborhood where savings banks are located, and with 1,231 possible conversions waiting to happen, the odds are excellent that at least one candidate can be found in a city or town where you live or work.<p>It can't hurt to ask local bankers how many unconverted thrifts exist in your area. Leave a small deposit or purchase a small CD in each one, and even if nothing happens, you'll collect your interest payments. The 100 most likely and most attractive candidates for conversion are identified in "Get Ready," a list that comes courtesy of SNL Securities, a highly regarded advisory service in Charlottesville, Virginia. There are opportunities here in 32 different states. Shown in italics are the 29 thrifts that SNL predicts are most likely to convert within two years. No guarantees, of course.<p><p>CASH IN THE TILL<p>What makes conversions such exceptional investments? It's not simply the bull market that has lifted these stocks. It's the fact that mutual savings banks have no formal owners. A normal company has founders, early investors, and venture capitalists, all of whom claim a share of the proceeds from a stock sale when the company goes public. But a mutual savings bank has only depositors. There are no sellers to compensate. Officers and directors may get free stock, as we've noted, but all the cash that's raised in the offering, minus the underwriting fee, is returned to the company till.<p>The effect is quite magical. Let's say PennyWise Mutual Savings Bank, which has a net worth of $10 million before conversion, announces a public offering: 1 million shares at $10 per share. The underwriters take their small cut, but for the sake of this exercise, we'll ignore that. So the entire proceeds of $10 million revert to PennyWise. This doubles the value of the company, from $10 million to $20 million. The lucky buyers have just paid $10 million for a $20 million property. Another way of looking at it is they've bought the company for zero.<p>It's hard to think of another transaction where the value of the merchandise doubles the minute it changes hands. Imagine it this way. You've just paid $10,000 in cash for a new car and driven it home, where you open the glove compartment and discover your $10,000 has been placed there, along with a note from the car dealer: "We don't need this. You keep it." <p>As long as you leave that money in the glove compartment, your $10,000 car is a lot more valuable than it was before you bought it. Is it any wonder then, that the stock price of a mutual savings bank rises quickly as soon as it starts trading on the open market? Indeed, first-day gains average more than 30 percent. For depositors who are used to getting 3 percent on their CDs, that's ten years' worth of interest, paid overnight. The initial price surge is usually followed by a second, more gradual increase. On average, the 384 thrifts that trade on the major exchanges sell for 104 percent of book value in today's market. Usually, it takes the newer conversions several months or even years to reach this plateau. Investors who miss out on the quick 30 percent profit from the offering can get in on the next 50-70 percent by purchasing shares later.<p>The example of <a name="NYSE:GPT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=44684"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Green Point Savings</b></a> is instructive. This is the New York bank (publicly trading as its parent, GP Financial) that was at the center of the fuss about the insiders' unfair advantage. The original plan was to sell Green Point to <a name="NYSE:RNB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11274"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Republic New York Corp.</b></a>, and when that deal didn't pan out, the directors decided to take their bank public. In typical fashion, the stock was offered at $15 and quickly rose to about $20, where as of this writing it now sits. The book value is $27, and if the earlier pattern holds, the price will creep up to that level eventually. <p>But let me repeat myself: no guarantees. In spite of the built-in advantage of cash in the drawer, it's a mistake to think that one savings bank is as good as another. Some are highly profitable, others less. Some have "clean" loan portfolios; others are plagued with defaults and foreclosures. While most are solvent, a few of the shaky ones are forced into conversion by the government so they can meet minimal capital requirements with the infusion of new money. These so-called supervisory conversions can be hazardous to investors. I wouldn't invest in any thrift without asking some basic questions. <p>-- Is there enough equity? Equity is important for two reasons. If a bank lacks sufficient equity, it puts itself in a precarious situation with regulators and becomes a candidate for bailout or liquidation. The S&L casualties of the 1980s didn't have enough equity to cover the losses from bad loans.<p>The proceeds from a public offering are counted as equity, which is why converted savings banks excel in this category. The equity-to-assets ratio is the standard measure of financial strength, and an e/a of 5 percent is considered good. <a name="NYSE:JPM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10812"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>J.P. Morgan</b></a>, one of the nation's strongest commercial banks, has an e/a of 7, while the average e/a of the 384 publicly traded thrifts is 9 percent. Green Point Savings has 20 percent equity to assets after adding the new capital from the conversion.<p>A couple good things can happen to a bank that's cash rich. The more equity it has, the more loans it can make; the more loans it makes, the more it increases its earnings.<p>Or if it doesn't want to make loans, it can invest the money in Treasury bills and earn a nice living. Better yet, it can buy back its own stock. Fewer shares outstanding means more earnings per share, more book value per share, and a higher stock price. <p>-- Is there a high-quality portfolio of loans? Bad loans, a.k.a. nonperforming assets, can break a bank very quickly as it channels more money into its loss reserves and into the management of properties in foreclosure. I look for thrifts that have a low percentage of nonperformers. Less than 0.5 percent is comforting.<p>-- Is the thrift making money? The common measure of a bank's profitability is return on assets. You get the ROA by dividing the bank's income by its assets over a specified period. A 1 percent ROA is average, and that's a good benchmark to use. Anything above that is a plus. Another useful measure is the price-to-earnings ratio. I look for thrifts with p/e ratios below 10. I'd be wary of investing in any thrift that is losing money (zero or negative earnings) at the time it goes public. <p>-- What's the book value? You can get this number from a bank officer, the investor-relations department (if there is one), an annual report, an S&P report, or a variety of other research services. Its importance has already been noted.<p>If bank officers have begun the conversion process, your investigation is a snap: Everything you need to know can be found in the prospectus. Here, you'll find the offering price of the stock, the earnings history, the makeup of the loan portfolio, the percentage of nonperforming assets, the equity-to-assets ratio, the resumes of officers and directors, the number of shares they are buying, and at what price. This last detail is an important one. Corporate insiders are not known to be self-destructive. They don't buy company stock unless they expect to make money on it. So when you pay the same price they do, you're in with the right crowd.<p>I also look for a couple of other things. If a bank owns its own branches, it's a plus. Real estate is carried on the books at cost and can be a valuable hidden asset. Another plus is what bankers call cheap deposits. A bank that has few branches and large concentrations of deposits tends to be more cost effective than one with many branches and smaller deposits.<p>After you've read the prospectus, you can ask all the questions you want and clear up any remaining confusion at a meeting with bank officers and others in the know, to which every would-be investor is invited. The hosts will probably serve donuts and coffee or sandwiches and <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coke</b></a>, and still only six or eight people will show up. This is another rare opportunity for the average person to learn from the horse's mouth--and it's astounding how few take advantage. They're too busy listening to their brokers and watching for the latest hot tip from CNBC.<p><p>WINNERS AND LOSERS <p>What can we learn from 2 savings banks out of the 116 that converted since 1991 whose share prices have lagged behind the rest? The biggest disappointment is <a name="NASD:FSSB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=45567"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>First Federal Savings & Loan Association of San Bernardino</b></a>, which at this point is the only outright loser in the group. It has suffered from being in the wrong place at the wrong time: California in its worst recession in the modern era. The other disappointment, although not a loser at the moment, is <a name="NASD:PTRS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=46123"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Potters S&L</b></a> of East Liverpool, Ohio. Potters's stock followed the usual pattern--it was offered at $10 a share in 1993, then jumped to $10.88 on the open market. But from there, it drifted downward, reaching a low of about $9. However, it rebounded and today it sells for around $11.<p>Maybe Potters is jinxed by having virtually the same name as the villainous banker in It's a Wonderful Life. But from what I can gather, the basic problem is earnings. Potters wasn't making much money when it converted, and it's barely profitable today. With 6 percent nonperforming assets, it's not hard to imagine where the profits have gone.<p>Anyone who asked the key questions about Potters would have avoided the stock. It flunked the test on loan quality. Until you get hard evidence that the delinquency rate is in decline, you're better off putting your money elsewhere. There's plenty of opportunity.<p>In the column I wrote on this subject in 1992, I included a list of ten savings banks with favorable characteristics. That group is up some 58 percent (see "Scorecard"). A new list of good candidates appears in "Prospects." I'm not suggesting that you run out and buy these, only that they appear to be worth consideration. (I personally own many thrifts including three on this list: <a name="NASD:PBCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12481"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pamrapo</b></a>, Fidelity New York, and North Side Bank.) Investigate before you invest. <p>Another word of warning: The perfect conditions banks have enjoyed for several years won't last forever. It's been an extremely happy time for bankers, something they can tell the grandchildren about: declining interest rates, an accommodating Federal Reserve, an improving economy, and a beautifully shaped yield curve. With short rates low and long rates high, a banker can lend money at 6 percent, borrow at 3 percent, and feast on the spread.<p>Eventually we will have another period of tight money. The first tiny increase in the Fed's lending rate in early February caused bank stocks to stumble. Rising interest rates are profit killers. During 1.5 years out of every 10, on average, we get an inverted yield curve, when short rates are high and long rates are low. This is a calamity for banks.<p>So it may be that the steady upward rise in bank stock prices will be interrupted sooner or later. But long-term there's another reason to be bullish: consolidation.<p>In the past five years, nearly 37 percent of the thrifts and savings banks have been acquired through mergers and buyouts. When this happens, the stock prices are pushed to a third tier, far above book value.<p>Even with the buyouts temporarily put on hold, consolidation is inevitable because we have too many deposit takers in this country. If you count credit unions there are more than 20,000 separate institutions where we can park our money. Each one has its own advertising jingle, board of directors, auditors, software system, and headquarters. The last time I wrote about this, I mentioned the six banks in my town of 19,000 people, as compared to nine in all of Canada. My little town still has six banks.<p>The record levels of cash that has piled up in the commercial banks is another stimulus to mergers. The industry today looks like it did after World War II--bankers have more cash than they've seen in decades and no place to lend it. By acquiring smaller banks and thrifts, they can expand their deposit bases and eventually increase their earnings.<p>So we're seeing a double trend: Many mutual savings banks and thrifts are going public, while others are being bought out. Many of the takeover targets are attractive to larger institutions because they, too, are full of cash. On our list of good prospects, <a name="NASD:QCSB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16680"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Queens County</b></a>, Pamrapo, and <a name="NASD:SRBC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13393"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sunrise Federal</b></a> can be put in the cash-rich category, along with Green Point, with its incredible 20 percent equity-to-assets ratio.<p>You may have noticed that seven of the banks on the recommended list are from New York and three from California. On the last list, two were from New England. I've always found the biggest bargains in the thrift group in regions that are recovering from recession. But you have to be careful to buy the ones where loan delinquencies are in decline, and where the situation--the health of both the bank and the community or region--is getting better and not worse.<p>New York banks are especially ripe for takeover, because the regulations in New York make it easy for out-of-state banks to make acquisitions. Wherever these takeovers have occurred, the target has been bought out at a premium to book value.<p>SNL Securities (these people keep themselves very busy) did a recent study of the 16 thrifts acquired by larger institutions in 1993. The average acquisition price was 1.5 times book. Not a single one was acquired at a price less than 300 percent of the initial offering price for the shares.<p>By this measure, our fictional PennyWise, which went public at $10 with a $20 book value, would be worth $30 in a takeover. Of the three phases in the life of a mutual savings bank or thrift, this last one is the most rewarding of all.<p>Ask the residents of Hattiesburg, Mississippi; Wilmington, North Carolina; Bay City, Missouri; Lakewood, Colorado; New Smyrna Beach, Florida; Covington, Kentucky; or Hometown, La Grange, and Tinley Park, Illinois. They've already tripled their money by investing in the places where they cash their paychecks. That's my kind of insider's edge.

Unknown, unexciting, unheralded on Wall Street, and successful in Japan: What's not to like about AFLAC?<p>By Peter Lynch<p><a name="NYSE:AFL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13111"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AFLAC</b></a> is my kind of company: a $15 billion operation most people know nothing about. Its main source of revenue is selling cancer insurance, which is unlikely to top any list of exciting businesses. Its headquarters is in Columbus, Georgia, which is at least one change of planes from Wall Street. The original name, American Family, was forgettable enough that in 1992 the board of directors voted to drop it in favor of the acronym. The longer and drawn-out version is the American Family Life Assurance Co. "Life assurance" sounds completely old-fashioned. It makes you think of a roomful of clerks sitting at high desks, making notations in giant ledgers with their quill pens.<p>But AFLAC is exciting where it counts. Its earnings have increased for 12 out of the past 13 years and continue to grow at a 15 percent annual clip. The stock has outperformed the market for 15 of the last 19 years in spite of the fact that it's chronically unfashionable and therefore undervalued. If you put a piece of tape over the name of the company and looked only at the earnings and the growth rate, you'd figure this to be a $37 to $40 stock in today's market. Since it's AFLAC, it's a $27 stock. A situation like this never bothers me. Stocks and singers may start out in the hinterlands, but if they keep making beautiful noises, they're bound to be discovered sooner or later.<p>In this case, the beautiful noises are in Japanese. AFLAC might just as well be named Japanese Family Life, or JAFLAC, in honor of its remarkable success in the country that has been the bugaboo of U.S. commerce. The Japanese won't buy U.S. products, you say? Twenty-eight million Japanese are insured by AFLAC. That's a quarter of the entire population. The only American-made product that has earned more money in Japan than AFLAC is <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a>, also from Georgia.<p>To understand how this miracle happened, we have to go back to John Amos, a Colonel Sanders-ish character who got together with his two brothers to form the company on a shoestring budget in the 1950s. Their fledgling enterprise was nearly bankrupt when the Amos brothers revived it by dropping the general line of life insurance, which wasn't selling, in favor of cancer insurance.<p>Cancer insurance had its critics, who likened it to polio insurance and other "dread disease" coverage sold door-to-door to unsophisticated consumers at very high prices. What was a great deal for the insurers was often a lousy deal for the insured. Nevertheless, American Family earned a reputation for reliability and for paying its claims on time.<p>Through the 1950s and into the 1960s, American Family expanded its markets and prospered under the leadership of Amos. By the 1970s, when cancer insurance was no longer an easy sell in America, Amos took a pleasure trip to the Far East. I've always admired executives who don't let holidays interrupt their thinking. Some of the best ideas come from a relaxed brain. In this case, Amos was touring Japan with a friend when he observed that the Japanese were obsessed with germs and preoccupied with cancer, which was both a leading cause of death and a taboo subject, just as it had been in the U.S. Meanwhile, they were madly puffing away on their cigarettes, so the surgeon general's warning hadn't quite caught up to them.<p>Investigating further, Amos discovered that Japanese salaries had increased to the point that millions of workers were wealthy enough to afford supplemental health insurance, and there were gaps in the national health system that might make such insurance desirable. In short, he realized he had stumbled onto the perfect market for the AFLAC cancer policy.<p>A family-run company such as this one can have its drawbacks, but one of the advantages is that there are no stodgy committees to pour cold water on a quirky yet fantastic idea. A committee might have pointed out that AFLAC had no contacts in Japan, no experience in doing business abroad, and no employees who spoke Japanese, and that larger U.S. companies with all three had failed to gain entry into that xenophobic country. Amos was not bothered by such trivial impediments. He came home and promptly filled out a formal application to the Japanese Ministry of Finance.<p>As it turns out, being small and unimportant worked in AFLAC's favor. It was hardly a threat to the Japanese insurance industry, since none of the Japanese insurers had any desire to sell cancer policies. That being the case, allowing AFLAC to operate in Japan was a painless way for the Japanese government to show its openness to U.S. business. <p>It still took four years of wrangling with the ministry before AFLAC was finally accepted into Japan. This was a lot like being accepted into an Ivy League college--difficult to do, but once you're there, the authorities will go to great lengths to prevent you from failing. Ergo, AFLAC was granted an eight-year monopoly on cancer insurance throughout the entire country. As if this weren't enough, it was allowed to sell its policies inside the major Japanese corporations, which agreed to encourage their workers to buy the insurance and to deduct the premiums automatically from the monthly paychecks. In this remarkable "sponsorship" system, retired executives from each corporation are often enlisted to do the actual selling. Imagine what it would mean to Aetna if General Electric offered to sponsor Aetna's policies in all its offices and factories, or to Travelers if Lee Iacocca returned to Chrysler to sell Travelers insurance to his former employees.<p>As of this writing, 92 percent of the corporations listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange are involved in AFLAC sponsorships. Is it any wonder than in its first year in Japan, AFLAC had $25 million in sales, roughly eight times more than its most optimistic projections? Every year thereafter, the sales and revenues have grown, proving again and again that Amos's trip to Japan is the best thing that ever happened to the shareholders.<p>AFLAC could have followed the lead of many of the giants in the insurance industry by investing its policyholders' premiums in risky real estate loans and junk bonds. This was the thing to do in the 1980s, which resulted in many better-known insurers losing their shirts, along with their pants, shoes, cars, boats, and houses. AFLAC took a less sophisticated approach and put the money into boring old Treasury bonds, so today its $12 billion portfolio is one of the strongest and safest on earth. And since all its policies, Japanese or American, pay a lump-sum benefit, the company is not exposed to unlimited and unforeseen liability.<p>There are two bits of bad news in this story. AFLAC tried and failed to peddle its products in Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy and elsewhere. Apparently, nobody loves the cancer policy quite as much as the Japanese. And Americans don't love it as much as they used to, because by the mid-1980s, sales in the U.S. had begun to slow.<p>This was a transition period between the aging John Amos and his energetic nephew, Dan, who is now the CEO. Under Dan Amos, the company left the white-suit era and entered the gray-suit era. Among other things, the younger Amos installed modern management systems, improved and expanded the advertising, and launched a cost-cutting campaign that eliminated two of the four corporate jets. <p>Along with the internal makeover, the new leadership shut down operations in unprofitable foreign markets. They successfully introduced several new products into the U.S. market: accident, disability, nursing-home care, home health care, hospital indemnity and Medicare supplemental policies. In addition, AFLAC continues to own seven TV stations, which were acquired many years ago at almost no cost to the company, since the revenues covered the interest payments on the debt. <p>As the new products begin to pay off, cancer insurance is less important to the bottom line. In 1993, noncancer policies accounted for 68 percent of AFLAC's new domestic sales. Taking a lesson from its Japanese operations, AFLAC is selling these new policies through payroll deduction plans, to companies that range in size from 2 or 3 employees to 10,000. <p>Meanwhile, Japan is in a recession, and the sale of cancer policies has slowed even there. While there's still solid demand for the cancer coverage, AFLAC has begun to broaden the product line over there. It's introduced Super Cancer, an upgrade on the original, and Super Care, which helps defray nursing-home expenses for the elderly.<p>Nursing-home costs are a major concern in a country whose population is exceedingly long-lived, and Super Care has gotten a favorable reception to date. After one year of existence, it accounts for 25 percent of new sales in Japan. <p>AFLAC has been helped in recent years by the strength of the yen, since the bulk of its revenues come from people who pay their bills in yen. This could reverse itself at any time. A 10 percent drop in the value of the yen could take 15 cents off AFLAC's earnings per share and put a short-term drag on the growth rate.<p>But I'm convinced the long-term prospects are excellent. It costs a lot of money to bring new insurance products to market, and the big payoff comes several years down the road. Insurance companies are required to maintain sizable cash reserves for various contingencies. In Japan, AFLAC recently has reached the point where its reserves are fully funded, so it can now "repatriate" the surplus cash back to the parent company in the U.S. In 1993, it repatriated a record $100 million, a number that is almost certain to increase in 1994 and beyond. This extra cash may be used to buy back stock or raise the dividend, either of which would add to shareholder prosperity.<p>Even on the basis of 1993 earnings, AFLAC at $27 is a cheap U.S. stock with a price-to-earnings ratio of 12.9, as compared to the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio of 22. Viewed as a Japanese stock, AFLAC is the biggest bargain in all of Tokyo. Give it a relatively low Japanese price-to-earnings multiple of 30 to 40, and in the current bear market these $27 shares suddenly become $70 to $90 shares.

With the art market finally regaining its strength, it's time to look at auction houses.<p>By Peter Lynch<p>Art may be the "window to the inner soul," but like cement or oil, it's also a commodity. It has its cycles of low prices and high prices and the occasional bubble followed by a bust. The latest bubble reached all the way to $82.5 million, the price fetched by Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet in 1990. This, apparently, was the priciest bit of canvas ever unloaded at an auction. The art market was giddy. Soon afterward, it went into a three-year hangover.<p>What does art have to do with my favorite little objects of beauty--stocks? When cement prices begin to turn up, it usually pays to own shares in cement companies. When aluminum prices begin to turn up, it usually pays to invest in Alcoa. So when Van Gogh prices turn up, I direct my attention to <a name="NYSE:BID"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12331"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sotheby's</b></a>.<p>My idea of a great business is one that has a shortage of competitors. In America, we grow up thinking that competition is healthy, which in spelling bees, pie contests, and fund management, it is. But in such industries as airlines and computers, competition can lead to lousy earnings and multiple bankruptcies and is hazardous to human wealth. There ought to be a warning label.<p>Since any Tom, Dick, or Harriet can rent a room, buy a podium, hire a fast talker, and open business as an auction house, you'd figure that the auction business would be more competitive than even airlines or computers. This is not the case. Wealthy aristocrats, in particular, are very persnickety about who handles their effects. They want their auction houses to go back at least as far as their antiques. So they end up at one of two places: Sotheby's Holdings, founded in 1744, or Christie's International, founded in 1766. <p>These two companies, it turns out, handle 98 percent of the world's major auctions for art, antique furniture, jewelry, and other expensive items. Warren Buffett made his fortune and his reputation investing in companies that dominate their markets, from Katharine Graham's Washington Post to Rose Blumkin's furniture store in Omaha. Sotheby's and Christie's are like two Rose Blumkins, operating in 40 countries and 26 countries, respectively.<p>This isn't quite a monopoly, but a global duopoly is almost as good. You and I and $500 million could hire some scientists and invent a new computer chip, but we couldn't mount a serious threat against Sotheby's and Christie's. A company called Hapsburg Feldman recently tried and failed.<p>Sotheby's and Christie's have all the right contacts with galleries, dealers, and major museums. They employ celebrated experts in every category of fine art and collectibles, to whom curators at the major museums often turn for advice. Their representatives graze on the party circuit with the people who own expensive things. These are valuable long-term relationships that can't be manufactured more cheaply in Mexico or Taiwan.<p>That's not to say these two companies don't compete with each other. In its annual report, Sotheby's can't bring itself to mention Christie's by name. It refers only to "our main competitor." They fight endlessly over prestigious clients, and their rivalry is as spirited as the old Macy's versus Gimbels or Harvard versus Yale. <p>Last year, a resident of Paris, Hubert de Givenchy, announced he had decided to "simplify his lifestyle" by auctioning off several roomsful of bronzes, silver, rugs, and paintings from Louis XIV through the French Empire. A New York socialite reportedly tried to help Sotheby's win the Givenchy job with a clever seating arrangement. At a dinner party, she placed Givenchy next to Albert Taubman, Sotheby's chairman and principal stockholder, so the latter could schmooze the former. It didn't work. Christie's got the collection.<p>On the other hand, Sotheby's held the much-publicized auction of stuff from a castle belonging to Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis. This is not a German cab company. It's a prominent family whose tree reaches back into the Holy Roman Empire.<p>What makes this rivalry more amusing than damaging is that there are enough rich people to keep both auction houses very busy. Also, their squabbling over clients does not keep them from uniting on the important issue of raising prices. Late in 1992, Sotheby's upped its buyers' commission from 10 percent to 15 percent on the first $50,000 of any item purchased at its auctions. Christie's quickly followed suit. (Both houses take 10 percent of all amounts over $50,000.) If these were airlines, 15 other competitors would have forced them to lower their prices.<p>Even though the companies may be equally good investments, Sotheby's is located in New York and trades on the New York Stock Exchange, while London-based Christie's trades on the London Stock Exchange. That makes Sotheby's much easier to track for American investors. And being a Sotheby's shareholder myself, I follow that story more closely.<p>Sotheby's went public in 1977 with a small number of shares, only to be taken private again by Taubman in 1983. In spring of 1988, there was a new public offering of 11 million shares, a sizable chunk of which was supplied by Taubman. He made a lot of money on the sale, and the public ended up with a major stake in the auction house. The initial price was a split-adjusted $9 per share.<p>It was just before the Sotheby's IPO that artwork began to get preposterously expensive. First the Australian tycoon Alan Bond bought Van Gogh's Irises for $53 million. Then, shortly after the IPO, Picasso's Yo Picasso fetched $47.9 million. Eventually a Renoir entitled Au Moulin de la Gallette would go for $78.1 million. In the fall of 1989, Sotheby's stock peaked at the rather silly price of $37 a share, so for the initial investors, this was a four-bagger. The stock earned a record $1.96 per share. <p>It's in the nature of Wall Street to imagine that whenever a company sets a record for earnings, it will go on setting new ones. (This is no different from sports, where last year's winner is usually picked to repeat.) The people who paid $37 for the stock must have been looking for $2.50 in 1990 and $3-plus after that. They were unprepared for the expected: In cyclicals, a period of silly prices is followed by a period of sobriety. Sotheby's earnings dropped to 25 cents a share in 1991, and the $37 stock became a $10 stock. It's been stuck in the teens ever since.<p>This is unpleasant for former buyers, but it gives the rest of us a chance to own a piece of this great franchise at a reasonable price. Christie's peaked at almost $7 a share during the last bubble and has recently traded below $3.<p>During the decline, Sotheby's was strengthening itself. It cut its operating budget by 17.5 percent, to about $42 million. It reduced its debt from $54 million at the end of 1991 to $5 million by the end of 1992. As mentioned above, it raised the buyers' premium 50 percent. And it reduced its regular dividend.<p>Normally, I root for companies to increase the dividend, but not where the amount of the payout exceeds the annual earnings, as it did at Sotheby's for three years. This stock was artificially held up by the regular dividend, which, when cut last August from 15 cents per quarter to 6 cents, took away some of that support.<p>There are some risky elements to this business. To keep up its credibility in the art world, it must continue to employ the right experts (the recent resignation of president and CEO Michael Ainslie took Wall Street by surprise). Sotheby's may buy important artwork or furniture for its own account, hoping to resell these items at a profit; it could make a costly mistake. To attract prestigious collections to its auctions, Sotheby's sometimes offers the seller a guaranteed return. If the proceeds fall short of the guarantee, Sotheby's must make up the difference. And on the buyer's side, Sotheby's sometimes lends money to the winning bidder. When Alan Bond bought Irises, half the money he used was Sotheby's via a secured loan.<p>This loan caused a lot of head scratching after Bond went bankrupt and Sotheby's was left holding the Irises, which it later sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum <p>We can't have it both ways. If we believe sources that they recovered the difference, then of course it was resold for less.presumably for a much lower price. But sources in the company assure me that Sotheby's has recovered the balance of the loan from Bond and that the entire transaction turned out to be quite lucrative. Its finance subsidiary has become a profitable addition to the business.<p>So overall, this is a more attractive company than it was in 1989, selling for less than half the price while its principal commodity is showing signs of a revival. In December, Sotheby's sold 88 Picassos at an auction in New York, with most of the winning bids at the high end of the pre-auction estimates. Christie's had a successful fall season as well.<p>An auction buff myself, I recently attended a sale with my wife, Carolyn, at a leading local dealer in Boston. Here again, 90 percent of the paintings brought top dollar. An unsigned work, Still Life With Daffodils, was listed at $800 to $1,200 and went for $16,000. For a Sotheby's investor, this is exciting fundamental research.<p>There's also a growth element to this story, which adds to its appeal. The auction market itself is growing yearly at an estimated 15 percent worldwide, so Sotheby's stands to gain from that. The company has opened offices and "selling centers" in Europe, Latin America, and the Far East. In the 1980s, the Japanese traveled to auctions in New York to buy French art. Now they can attend auctions in Japan and buy Japanese art. The Taiwanese can stay in Taiwan and buy Taiwanese art. The auction method seems to work in many cultures.<p>Sotheby's is also expanding its product line. Along with the furniture, antique jewelry, paintings, etc., Sotheby's is bringing many new items to the auction block: baseball cards, sports memorabilia, original sketches for <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney</b></a> animated cartoons, comic books. The company now handles 70 different categories of collectibles. Through a subsidiary, it sells real estate, mostly in the seven-figure category. Its newest product? Used corporate jets.<p>Every decade seems to produce a different group of rich buyers who want to acquire the high-priced treasures of formerly rich sellers who need the cash (the Arabs in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1980s). As long as there's death, divorce, changes of address, and reversals of fortune, we'll see no end to the procession of goods out of one drawing room and into another. Sotheby's will be there to collect the commissions both ways.<p>Peter Lynch writes the Investor's Edge column for each issue of Worth.

The worlds's seventh latgest economy is bottoming out. Get ready for the rebound.<p>By Peter Lynch<p>Recently, the decline and fall of california made the front page of the New York Times, in a three-part series, no less. It made me want to buy some California stocks.<p>The Decline and Fall of California bears an uncanny resemblance to the Decline and Fall of New England, which made the front page of the New York Times on July 23, 1990. In four years, New England had gone from economic miracle to economic disaster, and all the talk on the news was about the lost jobs and the death of the real estate market. You would have thought that Massachusetts, my home state, would have to be liquidated.<p>Now that New England has bounced back and Massachusetts is still in business, we can view the "disaster" with more dispassion. Housing prices never did collapse, except in the high end of the market, and even the fancy houses are selling again at somewhat fancy prices. People have cheered up and resumed shopping. The amazing part is, the recovery in New England has occurred without the jobs coming back.<p>The same sort of thing happened in Old England in the 1980s. The British economy looked so hopeless that people were delighted when it managed to muddle through. British stocks did brilliantly after that.<p>California in 1993 reminds me of New England in 1990 or Old England in the early '80s. Out of 14 million jobs in California, 560,000 have been lost, so that part of the disaster is hardly imaginary. But in the drumbeat of total despair--more layoffs in the defense industry are expected, for example--people are terrified that soon there will be no jobs left in the state. <p>Housing prices have declined in California, but mostly in the high-end houses, and after more than doubling in the 1980s they were due for a pullback. If what happened on the East Coast is repeated on the West, the California real estate market will stabilize as soon as there's a change in psychology. Then we'll see a modest rebound in consumer spending and a bigger rebound in the stock prices of a variety of California companies as investors anticipate a more prosperous future.<p>The New England psychology began to improve about the time our state government reduced its deficit and balanced its books. That's where California is right now. After several years of a double whammy--raising taxes and cutting the state payroll--the California government is about to balance its budget. The deficit has fallen from $2.6 billion in 1993 to a projected $560 million in 1994, and a zero deficit is projected for 1995.<p>I profited from New England's recovery by investing in regional banks and neighborhood savings and loans. Many were selling at tantalizing prices: below book value and with very low price-to-earnings ratios. Those with the wherewithal to survive have been remarkable performers. Problem loans have declined, earnings have skyrocketed, and stock prices have doubled, tripled, and in a few cases quadrupled. All this in less than three years. <p>There's no reason to believe California S&Ls won't follow the same script. As of this writing, half are selling below book value. I'm told by Joe Jolson, the S&L analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, that for the first time in five years, California thrifts are able to sell their foreclosed real estate. The worst may be over for loan defaults.<p>In particular, Jolson likes SFFED, a stock that I recommended earlier this year. He also touts two lenders that specialize in California auto loans: <a name="NASD:CTLI"></a><b>CTL Credit</b>, recently trading at $12.50, and <a name="NYSE:WES"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12459"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Westcorp</b></a>, trading at $10.50. These have been steady growers in a weak auto market that will benefit from a pickup in sales.<p>Other analysts are bullish on California's bigger thrifts, beginning with the nation's largest, H.F. Ahmanson, which writes 74 percent of its loans in California. Like its counterparts in New England, Ahmanson learned an expensive lesson and has been staying away from commercial real estate lately. The company recently unloaded another heap of trouble by selling $1.2 billion in delinquent single-family mortgages to <a name="NYSE:BSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10191"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bear Stearns</b></a>. This transaction may have broken all records for largest onetime disposal of bad home loans in modern financial history.<p>The drastic move will take a chunk out of Ahmanson's $19.50-a-share book value, but in the long run it will strengthen the company and prepare it for a huge boost in earnings later. Two other large S&Ls, Great Western and Golden West Financial, also stand to benefit from a recovery in real estate. Golden West is so well managed it has avoided all trouble. <p>A slightly more far-fetched play on a California turnaround is Fannie Mae, my perennial favorite stock. While Fannie Mae has been a great investment--up twentyfold in nine years and more than fivefold in five--the true value of the company is still not reflected in the price. Based on projected 1994 earnings, if Fannie Mae traded at the market multiple, it would be a $125 stock. But a cloud of doom always hangs over Fannie Mae, the way the cloud of dirt hangs over Pigpen. <p>People remember that Fannie Mae got hurt in the Texas recession, when battalions of homeowners walked away from their houses, defaulting on some Fannie Mae mortgages. Wall Street is worried that the same thing will happen in California, but I say it won't. Fannie Mae has tightened its underwriting standards since stubbing its toe in Texas. The delinquency rate on its mortgages has been going down for six years in a row, continuing to drop throughout the latest recession. Currently, the rate is less than six-tenths of one percent, a ten-year low. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae's mortgage-backed-securities business is booming. <p>In playing the New England recovery, I invested in a few retailers in addition to the banks and S&Ls, but it was hard to find companies that were exclusive to the region. California is full of them. It has the seventh largest economy in the world and is home to a variety of businesses that derive most if not all of their revenues in-state. Thirty-one million Californians have a chance to monitor these companies firsthand.<p>The Good Guys is an electronics retailer with locations primarily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas. It offers excellent service and low prices, and the stock itself is selling at half its 1992 high of $22.50. The Good Guys will benefit when consumers resume shopping for nonessentials.<p>One grocery-store chain, <a name="NYSE:VON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11589"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vons</b></a>, operates almost exclusively in California, and a second, <a name="NYSE:ABS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10049"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Albertson's</b></a>, has a major presence in the state. <a name="NASD:NOBE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14261"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nordstrom</b></a>, a department-store chain based in Seattle, does 50 percent of its business in California, <a name="NYSE:DH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10440"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dayton Hudson</b></a> of Minneapolis gets 30 percent of its sales there, and Carter Hawley Hale, which just emerged from bankruptcy, does 90 percent of its sales in the state. Nordstrom is a well-managed company with a great record, and its stock has been trading at a below-market price-to-earnings ratio of 19. <p>California is also the land of the discount warehouse clubs. A majority of the Price Club outlets are located there, so Price Co. may benefit from a California turnaround, as well as from its recent merger with rival <a name="NASD:PCCW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17060"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Costco</b></a>. HomeBase, a West Coast version of <a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a> (owned by <a name="NYSE:WBN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Waban</b></a>, which also operates the BJ's Wholesale Club in the East), has cloned itself around the state. <p>A discount retailer of a different kind that I've touted for two years running is <a name="NASD:CUTS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15444"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Supercuts</b></a>, a hair salon. One fourth of all Supercuts stores are found in California, and the recession may have helped their business, because people who can't afford the $100 stylist are coming in for the $13 shampoo and trim. Perhaps some of them will never return to the $100 stylist, but in any event, Supercuts is expanding across the country and its same-store sales are on the rise. The stock recently traded around $16.25.<p>Another way to profit from a turnaround in a depressed region or state is by acquiring shares in companies that own sizable parcels of real estate. During the go-go 1980s, raw land in California was priced so high it could have been sold by the ounce. <p>Today, there's a lot of land in California that's selling for a lot less than it was five years ago, and two publicly traded companies, <a name="NYSE:NHL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11074"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Newhall Land and Farming</b></a> and <a name="AMEX:TRC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12373"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tejon Ranch</b></a>, have large inventories on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Newhall was a spectacular stock for two decades, and now it can be bought for half its 1989 high price.<p>This brings us to the California home builders. While the Decline and Fall gets most of the publicity, California has quietly become the best place in the country to build houses, with cheap land and a labor force willing to work for modest wages. Many former defense contractors are wielding hammers these days.<p>In the earlier recessions in Texas and New England, we've seen the marginal home builders go bankrupt, creating more business for the well-capitalized survivors. In California, the largest survivor is <a name="NYSE:KBH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10839"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kaufman & Broad</b></a> (the Broad rhymes with toad, but the company is managed like the prince). Kaufman & Broad dominates the market for entry-level houses, and it plans to build several new communities in the next few years. It keeps costs low and quality high, a combination that's hard for competitors to beat.<p>While the New England recovery has been anemic, California's may be more robust. Its favorable location north of Mexico and at the gateway to the Far East, an impressive array of high-tech industries, and an experienced work force give California plenty of appeal. <p>If you miss the California recovery, don't despair. Sooner or later there will be another Decline and Fall, in the Sun Belt, perhaps, or in the Pacific Northwest, which already is slumping, or in Maryland and Virginia if we can ever lay off a few federal bureaucrats. When the calamity makes the front page of the Times, it's a signal to start your research.<p>Peter Lynch writes the Investor's Edge column for each issue of Worth.

While the Japanese downshift, investors can hitch a ride on the recovering U.S. automobile industry<p>By Peter Lynch<p>After a couple of years of improved car sales, a lot of people expected the party to be over, but as we've seen in the showrooms, the party continues, in spite of a sluggish economy that has added 2 million workers to the unemployment rolls since 1990. The public may not be buying new suits or dresses at the moment, but it is buying new cars.<p>In the car business, there are long stretches of poor sales, which create a so-called pent-up demand, followed by equally long stretches of excitement when the pent-up demand gets satisfied. These cycles of automotive boom and bust may be slightly out of sync with the economy at large.<p>One indication of how much pent-up demand exists at any given moment is the number of clunkers on the road. Right now, the average age of a car in the U.S. is 7.9 years, the highest it's been since 1948, when GIs home from the war had no money for anything but rent, diapers, and groceries.<p>Until somebody improves the bus service or invents a strap-on personal helicopter, most people will not tolerate living without a car. So as the clunkers conk out, they'll have to be replaced, and this means a steady supply of customers for car dealers and manufacturers.<p>This is happening at a time when the entire sad story of the U.S. auto industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s (inefficient, inept, insensitive to customers' needs) has been rewritten. Detroit is making good cars that people want to drive and that don't break down any more often than Japanese cars do. It's producing them in efficient factories that pay competitive wages.<p>The Japanese story (omniscient, omnipotent, omnivorous) has also been rewritten. When their economy was booming and their factories were running at top speed, the Japanese could sell their extra cars abroad at a very low cost per car. Today, with their factories running at half speed, the cost per car is much higher. Now it is <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a> and not <a name="NASD:TOYOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41889"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toyota</b></a> or <a name="NYSE:HMC"></a><b>Honda</b> that is producing at full capacity. Now it is Japan and not Detroit that has to worry about losing its share of the U.S. market. <p>The financial press treats the decline in Japanese auto sales in the U.S. as though it's all to do with the rising yen and the falling dollar, which makes Japanese cars too pricey. This situation will reverse itself as soon as the yen falls and the dollar rises. I think more profound changes are at work here. The remarkable efforts of U.S. carmakers to correct their prior mistakes are likely to pay off for years to come.<p>In September 1992, I recommended <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a> on Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser. Chrysler is doing okay selling cars and making a fortune on Jeeps and minivans. The minivan has replaced the station wagon as the suburbanite's favorite conveyance: It's roomier and also a better value. In the government's dictionary, a minivan is defined as a truck, whereas a station wagon is a car. Being a truck exempts the minivan from certain emission-control requirements that add to the sticker price of cars.<p>Chrysler flirted with insolvency in the early 1980s, but today it is generating so much cash that the rating on its bonds is being raised from junk to investment grade. This would reduce its cost of borrowing and add further to its profits. Chrysler's Jeeps are selling well, and Chrysler has managed to hold on to a 50 percent share of the minivan market against a horde of competitors. The company has produced an exciting new line of cars (the LH series) in the $17,000 to $30,000 range and the first redesign of a full-size truck in 22 years. The Chrysler Neon, a lower-priced car that will appear at dealerships in 1994, has the potential appeal of GM's Saturn.<p>So it's easy to make a positive case for Chrysler, but with the stock having quadrupled in 24 months, it's not the buy it once was.<p>Three of the top auto analysts with whom I recently spoke (Wendy Beale-Needham at Smith Barney Shearson, Don DeScenza at DeScenza & Co., and David Bradley at J.P. Morgan Securities) like Chrysler, but they like <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> even better.<p>GM has long been the dunce of the industry--it took years for the company to figure out that customers actually want air bags in their cars--but lately GM has gotten smarter. It is installing air bags in all but three of its 1994 models. After noticing that many of its loyal Cadillac customers were getting too old to pass a driver's test, GM jazzed up the Caddy with a bigger engine to appeal to a younger crowd.<p>The main reason to prefer GM (and also Ford) over Chrysler is that GM and Ford have big overseas markets and will benefit when Europe shakes out of its recession, whereas Chrysler is essentially a domestic operation.<p>Elsewhere, I've noted that GM does so well with its non-automotive divisions, including GMAC, Hughes, and Electronic Data Systems (a canny acquisition it made from Ross Perot), that if it manages to break even on its U.S. auto business, it will make a fine profit. David Bradley thinks that before the end of the current upswing in car buying, GM can earn between $5 and $7 a share on U.S. car and truck sales alone. If that happens, the company's overall earnings would be $10 to $15 a share. He sees GM as a potential $100 stock.<p>GM may also benefit from the curious way Wall Street appraises the earnings of cyclical companies. Chrysler is doing better than GM at present, so let's say Chrysler earns $8, then $10, then $12 a share in the next three years, and in the fourth year it slips back to $10. Meanwhile, GM earns $4, $6, $8, and then the same $10 as Chrysler. At that point, investors are likely to pay more for GM's $10 than Chrysler's $10. That's because Chrysler will appear to have reached its peak, while GM will look like it's still climbing.<p>
Supply-Side Investing:
Besides the carmakers themselves, there are an estimated 2,500 additional companies whose principal products are parts of cars. Many of these are publicly traded, and they also stand to benefit from the surge in auto and truck sales. GM, Chrysler, Ford, and even the Japanese carmakers are manufacturing fewer parts in-house, and this "outsourcing" makes the parts industry more important than in any previous cycle.<p>Somewhere on a car or truck, there's always a part or two that will make investors happier than if they'd invested in the sum of the parts. The catalytic converter, antiskid brakes, and the air bag all have created big winners in the stock market, and so has the aluminum wheel.<p>The main supplier of aluminum wheels is Superior Industries, whose stock has enjoyed a modest 40-fold gain in a decade. It didn't take a Nostradamus to see this one coming. Carmakers had to reduce the weight of their cars to improve gas mileage to meet EPA standards, and they could drop an easy few pounds with aluminum wheels. The percentage of new cars and trucks with aluminum wheels has increased from zero 20 years ago to 37 at present count. Someday, it may be 100 percent.<p>There's a certain amount of protection in investing in an established supplier such as Superior. When a car part fails, it's the carmaker that gets the bad publicity and not the part maker, so carmakers are very careful about who gets the contract. A competitor might arrive with the best-looking aluminum wheel ever, but unless that competitor has a track record, carmakers aren't likely to give up on what already works.<p>Superior may have a prosperous future ahead of it, but the problem is that its price-to-earnings ratio of 34 already reflects that probability. If you want to invest in wheels, Wendy Beale-Needham suggests <a name="NYSE:HAY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10384"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hayes Wheels</b></a>, a company that came public in 1992. Hayes is the largest supplier in Europe, and in North America it's number two, behind Superior. <a name="NYSE:VAT"></a><b>Varity</b>, which sold the Hayes shares in the stock offering, still owns a sizable stake.<p>
Don't Forget Spare Parts:
The fact that 37 percent of the vehicles on the road are at least ten years old augurs well for the spare-parts business, also known as the aftermarket. The aftermarket has suffered in recent years because there were too many new cars on the road from the last big spurt in auto sales from 1983 to 1988. <p>In addition to normal cyclical blahs, two other factors added to the woes of the spare-parts market: Automakers insisted on making high-quality cars and trucks that refused to break down, and longer warranty periods meant that more repairs were being handled by dealers. But sooner or later, the warranties had to expire and the parts had to wear out. Millions of vehicles bought between 1983 and '88 have reached that age when they have to spend time in the shop.<p>So we can expect the aftermarket to become a very busy place--even busier if and when the other states follow California's lead in adopting stringent pollution-control standards. In addition, it's estimated that one third of all older cars will fail the EPA tests that go into effect in 1995. <p>Some of the best-known companies in this industry (<a name="NYSE:ECH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10502"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Echlin</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:SMP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11392"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Standard Motor Products</b></a>) have already seen their stocks rise in anticipation of better days ahead. Others have gone sideways, such as <a name="NYSE:GPC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10646"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Genuine Parts</b></a>, which went from $30 in 1987 to a recent $36. This company has increased earnings for 32 straight years, which puts it in the Lynch Hall of Fame. Even in the recent recession, Genuine Parts managed to boost its earnings. Lately, it's been cutting costs and upgrading the 700 NAPA parts stores it owns outright--it also supplies parts to 6,000 independent dealers. Don DeScenza has made Genuine Parts his number one pick in this sector. <p>Except for retailing and restaurants, there isn't another area of the stock market where more people have more of a chance to follow what's happening than in cars, trucks, and assorted parts. We'll eventually have an electric car, and once the initial confusion is sorted out, some company will emerge as the champion of that business, and we'll all realize who it is. Then there will be several champion suppliers of batteries and so forth, and we'll know who they are, too. And even though the news is out, there will be plenty of time to invest, because if Wall Street is true to form, it will be slow on the uptake.<p>

By Peter Lynch<p>
There's been a lot of sobering talk lately about housing and how instead of getting a big bounce in housing starts, we're only getting a hop. The "disappointing" housing numbers are used as evidence that the economic recovery has stalled.<p>I've been hearing a different story from David Berson and Mark Obrinsky, two of the resident experts at the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). While it's true that this year's estimated 1.27 million housing starts will fall far below the record of 2.4 million in 1972, Berson and Obrinsky estimate that 1.1 million single-family homes will be built in 1993. This almost reaches the all-time high of 1.2 million, set in 1986. Moreover, 3.8 million existing homes (the industry never calls them used homes) will change hands this year. This is also close to the all-time record of 4 million, set in 1978.<p>So we're in a strong phase for single-family construction and a boom in used-home sales, and housing in general is the most affordable it's been since the early '70s. The price of the median house continues to increase each year, as it has for the two and a half decades this data has been collected.<p>What hasn't bounced is multifamily housing, but that's not because we've been in a recession. The government has pulled its support for low-income housing and eliminated the tax shelters that created the boom in residential high-rises in the 1970s and early '80s. In 1972, there were 906,000 apartment buildings of five or more units built in the U.S., and last year there were only 139,000. It's this decline that makes the overall housing numbers look worse than they are. <p>Three years ago, I began to look into the housing sector, since housing is one of the first industries to turn around in a recovery. In the early stages, the home builders tend to do well, and home-building stocks made impressive gains from early 1991 to the end of 1992. The price of <a name="NYSE:TOL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11488"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toll Brothers</b></a>, an East Coast builder that I often follow, increased more than fivefold.<p>Toll Brothers is a typical example of a company that will benefit from hard times. In the 1980s, anyone could build a house. All he needed was a tool kit, a nail apron, and a net to catch the money that bankers were throwing at the project. But in the bust years, banks will lend money only to established, well-capitalized builders. So builders like Toll emerge from the 1990 recession with as many new jobs as they can handle.<p>Nevertheless, by 1993, many of the home-building stocks had had a good run, and bargains were hard to find. The home builders may not be in the ninth inning of the recovery, but they surely have made it into the sixth or the seventh.<p>Whenever I research an industry, I like to call an assortment of Wall Street analysts to get their views on how various companies are doing. An analyst can be an invaluable resource, but you have to be careful about whom you listen to. I like the ones with proven records for staying up-to-date on each company they follow.<p>After talking to a couple of housing analysts, I found I was not alone in thinking it was hard to find bargains among the home builders. Greg Nejmeh at Lehman Brothers likes Lennar, a Florida builder that stands to benefit from Hurricane Andrew, and D.R. Horton, a newcomer that went public in 1992. But these are the exceptions.<p>From the stock picker's point of view, one of the nice things about a recovery is that it doesn't happen everywhere at once. So with the home builders already in recovery, I turned my attention to other companies in related industries that continue to struggle.<p>In the forestry group, John Chrysikopoulos at Goldman, Sachs likes Weyerhaeuser. Its timber sales have improved and will improve even more when Japan comes out of its recession, because Japan is a big buyer of U.S. trees. Its paper and packaging divisions are still in the doldrums, but eventually they'll prosper. Meanwhile, Weyerhaeuser has gone through the corporate Slim-Fast, selling an array of unrelated businesses to get back to solid wood.<p>The best thing that ever happened to timber companies such as Weyerhaeuser was the campaign to save the spotted owl. Who benefits when environmental groups successfully pressure the government to dramatically restrict the cutting of timber on federal lands? Firms with large private forests, including Weyerhaeuser, Georgia-Pacific, Louisiana-Pacific, and <a name="NYSE:PCL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11196"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Plum Creek</b></a>.<p>Plum Creek was spun off from Burlington Resources. It's a limited partnership (traded on the NYSE), and I've always been fond of publicly traded LPs. They require extra paperwork that scares a lot of investors away, and this creates bargains. Plum Creek has a decent balance sheet, strong cash flow, and no expenses to speak of. It's just a bunch of trees that the company harvests and sells, sending the proceeds to the shareholders as dividends.<p>The dividend fluctuates with profits, but at present the stock is yielding 7.7 percent. Since Plum Creek plants several new trees for every tree it cuts, there is an endless supply. This is a conservative's way to invest in lumber futures.<p>A few years ago I recommended <a name="NYSE:PIR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11185"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pier 1 Imports</b></a>, on the theory that a housing revival is good news for home furnishers. Nobody wants to live in an empty house, and the new occupants have to have lamps, rugs, couches, and other such items that are sold at Pier 1.<p>Pier 1 has had its ups and downs, in part because the recovery in home furnishings is lagging the recovery in home sales. Perhaps home buyers have spent all their money and are holding off on decorating and renovations until they can replenish their bank accounts. But all the analysts with whom I spoke expect home furnishings and appliances to do well in 1994. Let's take a tour of the department store to find their favorite companies.<p>In the paint department--"coatings" on Wall Street--I heard nice things about <a name="NYSE:SHW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11350"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sherwin-Williams</b></a>. This is one of those great companies in boring industries for which I'm always on the lookout. Paint is a pretty boring industry, but Sherwin-Williams has done a spectacular job, and the stock has been very exciting. The company has 2,000 outlets and opens 20 to 30 new stores each year, which is the slow-and-steady approach to growing a business. And when every U.S. town has a store, they can always move into Canada.<p>In the furniture department, John Baugh of Wheat, First Securities likes Heilig-Meyers, a retailer with 450 stores in 16 states. In the next five years, Heilig-Meyers plans to enter 19 more states. Their formula works, and they are taking it on the road, a la <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a>. I learned from Wal-Mart and from <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a> that successful companies can continue expanding for decades.<p>David Dwyer of Kidder likes Ethan Allen Interiors, the furniture maker spun out of INTERCO in 1989 that went public last March. The stock was $18 then and $19.50 now, so it hasn't gone far. <a name="NYSE:ETH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13027"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ethan Allen</b></a> is famous for its Early American line, but half of what it makes today is contemporary. It earned $1.08 per share in the year ending in June, and Dwyer expects $1.45 next year and $1.75 by 1995.<p>I also got positive reviews on <a name="NASD:PLFC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14505"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pulaski Furniture</b></a>, Winston Furniture (which went public at $16, then dropped to $10.50), Pier 1 (a stock I still like), and <a name="NYSE:LEG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10888"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Leggett & Platt</b></a>. L&P is one of those wonderfully boring companies that makes a product that puts people to sleep: bedsprings. It has 50 percent of the bedspring market and is a major supplier of recliner parts for easy chairs and hide-a-beds. It has a great balance sheet and excellent earnings growth. <p>In the appliance department, Bob Cornell at Lehman Brothers likes <a name="NYSE:WHR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11632"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Whirlpool</b></a>, which makes 50 percent of the washer-dryers and 25 percent of the refrigerators in the U.S. This was a marginal company in the 1970s that has become a global leader in white goods. White goods is the industry term for large appliances; small appliances (TVs, microwaves, VCRs, radios, etc.) are known as brown goods.<p>In the carpet department, I discovered that while new carpets are superior to old ones (they are stain resistant and last longer), the price has stayed the same for many years. So carpeting is one area where the consumer is getting more for less, as opposed to, say, cars, where the prices are 80 percent higher than they were ten years ago. <p>Between laying down carpets in new buildings and replacing old carpets in old buildings (70 percent of the business is replacement), there's a steady demand for carpets. This should increase, because big fiber makers such as Dupont, <a name="NYSE:MTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11010"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Monsanto</b></a>, and Allied are beginning to spend tens of millions to advertise the wonders of modern carpeting. Moreover, carpet making has become a highly mechanized industry in which the labor cost is only 10 percent of the price of the final product, so there is no threat of domestic carpet makers being undercut by foreign companies paying their workers 50 cents an hour.<p><a name="NYSE:SHX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11345"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Shaw Industries</b></a> has been one of the all- time great stocks in history, number eight on the list of winners from the NYSE over the last decade. A $1,000 investment in Shaw in 1971 is worth $80,000 today. Shaw has succeeded by being a low-cost operator and by gobbling up many of its less efficient rivals. Today, Shaw makes 35 percent of all the carpets in the U.S., a remarkable figure. If they keep acquiring more competitors, Shaw will be making so many carpets that it may get a call from the antitrust division of the Justice Department, which probably has a Shaw carpet on its floor.<p>Shaw could continue to do well, but John Baugh of Wheat, First prefers <a name="NASD:MOHK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14105"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mohawk</b></a>. Its stock price has more than doubled since Mohawk came public at $15. <a name="NYSE:CCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10345"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Citicorp</b></a> owns a big chunk from the initial offering and hasn't sold a single share, which means that Citicorp must have a high opinion of Mohawk and its future prospects. Mohawk adopted the Shaw formula, but with only 7 percent of the market it has a lot more room to expand and acquire competitors.<p>That's the update on the housing sector. Housing is a cyclical industry, and the situation is always fluid. Right now, the best buys seem to be in companies that make the contents for houses, but the next time the stock market has a big correction, maybe the home-building stocks will sell off, and investors will have another chance to find bargains there.<p>

One of the keys to <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Magellan</b></a>'s success was buying cyclical stocks in the early '80s. Is it time to buy cyclicals again?<p>By Peter Lynch<p>At Magellan, I loaded up on cyclical stocks during the 1981-1982 economic slump. This strategy was one of the keys to Magellan's success. It occurs to me that we may now be in a similar situation, one in which cyclical stocks will do well. <p>While the stock market overall has been stuck in the tightest trading range in 40 years, we've already seen some exciting advances in cyclicals. "Seen" may be the wrong verb, because many people seem not to have noticed the upturn, which is occurring, as usual, as we come out of the latest recession.<p>At the end of the glorious decade, the 1980s, the consumer growth stocks (<a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:G"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10655"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gillette</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a>__you know the names) continued to wax while the cyclicals waned, but this couldn't continue indefinitely. On Wall Street, what waxes today may wane tomorrow, as many of these growth stocks have, since 1991. Meanwhile, the cyclicals were due for a rebound.<p>Sure enough, the 30 companies included in <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a>'s Cyclical Index turned in a 23 percent gain in 1992, when the S&P 500 rose just 4.5 percent. In the first half of 1993, cyclicals once again have outpaced the average stock. One leader, Standard Products, which makes plastic and rubber gizmos for the transportation industry, has tripled off its 1990 bottom.<p>For those of you who haven't already heard, a cyclical is a company that will prosper in good times and suffer in bad. That's because it makes or sells expensive products or luxury items that customers can put off buying when they are short on cash. People continue to buy deodorant, dental floss, Big Macs, and headache pills no matter what, which is why drugstores and fast-food restaurants are not cyclicals.<p>Usually when people think of cyclicals, they think of the industrial giants, such as the steels, the aluminums, and the autos. But industrial giants no longer dominate the financial landscape the way they did in, say, the 1950s. The folks at Dow Jones have had to fill out the Dow Jones Industrials with such unlikely industrials as <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney</b></a>. If more people realized that McDonald's was a Dow Jones Industrial, the Big Mac might not be so popular.<p>While the smokestack cyclicals have declined in number, there are other kinds of cyclicals, including some that are not recognized as such. Hotels are cyclical, since more rooms are sold, and at higher prices, in a strong economy. Expensive restaurants are cyclical, since they cater to a prosperous clientele, people who can retreat to the neighborhood bistro as soon as they feel the pinch of recession. <p>Machinery in general is cyclical, and so are the homebuilders, the appliance companies, and the furniture manufacturers. <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> turned into a cyclical when the mainframe computer became its most important product. Waste-management companies are cyclical__although when these clean-up stocks were widely touted some years ago, investors, unfortunately, did not recognize that fact. Many bought at the wrong time, only to see the cleanup stocks get clobbered in the recession. When business is slow, there's less waste to clean up.<p>Liner board, which we call cardboard, is cyclical; when nothing is selling, the stores don't need boxes to ship it in. Then there are the airlines. I regard United as the ultimate cyclical. One year it earns $15 a share, and another year it loses $15 a share. So it's a $15-a-share operation, no matter what.<p>If you're ever in doubt as to whether a certain company is a cyclical, the easiest way to tell is to look at its chart in Value Line, or in one of the chart books published by the Securities Research Company and available in libraries or in a broker's office. One of the lines on a stock chart is the earnings line, and here a picture is worth a thousand numbers. When the earnings line has a steady upward slope, the way Merck's does, you're dealing with a growth stock. When it wobbles up and down, as Alcoa's does, you're probably dealing with a cyclical.<p>The best time to get involved with cyclicals is when the economy is at its weakest, earnings are at their lowest, and public sentiment is at its bleakest. The staff at Standard & Poor's weekly newsletter, "The Outlook," once reviewed the eight recessions since World War II to find out what happened to the prices of key cyclical stocks after the stock market hit bottom. In every instance, the cyclical groups gained 50 percent or better in five months, more than double the advance of the S&P 500.<p>It is consumers who lead the way out of a recession, with their car buying and home buying and replacing of old appliances, all of which then creates a revival in the businesses up the line__lumber mills, steel plants, capital goods manufacturers, the advertisers, the newspapers that sell space to the advertisers, and so on.<p>Yet even though the cyclicals have rebounded in the same fashion eight times since World War II, buying them in the early stages of an economic recovery is never easy. Every recession brings out the skeptics who doubt that we will ever come out of it, and who predict that we will soon fall into a depression, when new cars will sit unsold in the showrooms forever and houses will stand empty, and the country will go bankrupt. If there's any time not to own cyclical stocks, it's in a depression.<p>"This one is different," is the doomsayer's litany, and, in fact, every recession is different, but that doesn't mean it's going to ruin us. In order not to get sucked into the gloom, I always remind myself that although we once suffered from chronic depressions leading to the Great Depression of 1929 (in fact, that one was no "greater" than several others), we are no longer the same economy. <p>Today 17 percent of Americans work for federal, state, or local governments, and millions more get Social Security benefits, unemployment compensation, and/or pension payments, so there are enough steady paychecks being cashed every week to keep the economy from slowing to a halt. We have a huge college industry and a huge health-care industry, both of which are immune from recession__colleges do better in recessions. There are many other stabilizing factors__the Fed, deposit insurance, and so forth__that we've all heard about.<p>This brings us to the ninth recession since World War II, which began in 1990. As usual, the skeptics said that this recession was different from other recessions, and that we might never recover from it. Now that we're two years into the recovery, some people are still doubting that we'll ever recover. Meanwhile, Europe is still in the depths of recession and Japan is sluggish, and the inevitable revival in both places will stimulate our economy.<p>While some cyclicals have produced impressive gains already, others have yet to turn, and if the experience of 1982 is any guide, the cyclicals have several good years ahead of them. Although <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a> has quadrupled in price since its 1990 low, and <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a> has doubled, both stocks have barely reached the levels at which they sold before the Great Correction of 1987. <p>As business goes from lousy to mediocre, investors in cyclicals can make money; as it goes from mediocre to good, they can make money; from good to excellent, they may make a little more money, though not as much as before. It's when business goes from excellent back to good that investors begin to lose; from good to mediocre, they lose more; and from mediocre to lousy, they're back where they started. <p>So, you have to know where we are in the cycle, and right now, most companies are somewhere between lousy and mediocre. But it's not quite as simple as it sounds. Investing in cyclicals has become a game of anticipation, as large institutions try to get a jump on their competitors by buying cyclical companies before they've shown any signs of recovery. This can lead to false starts, when stock prices run up and then fall back with each contradictory statistic (we're recovering, we're not recovering) that is released.<p>To succeed at investing in cyclicals, you have to have some way of tracking the fundamentals of the industry and the company involved. This is where the Investor's Edge comes in. Of the 110 million Americans who have jobs, at least 50 million are involved in cyclical industries, where they are in a position to see a business turn before the news reaches Wall Street. People who build houses or sell houses, make cars or sell cars or parts of cars, work in a chemical plant or install aluminum siding, work in the airlines or the travel agencies, have a front-row seat from which they can watch the prices, the inventories, and the sales go up or down. Employees in the temporary-help agencies are the first to know which companies have more work than they can handle, a sure sign that business is getting better. <p>This is the sort of "inside information" that can be put to profitable use, although most people fail to take advantage of it. Even if you decide it's too late to buy your favorite cyclical in the current recovery, in the next five years, ten years, or 15 years there will be another down cycle, and another buying opportunity. Cyclicals are very forgiving. They always give you a second chance.<p>

						 <p>By Peter Lynch<p>In my last column, I discussed the perils of biotech investing, particularly in the small "start-up" companies over which much ado has been made, and often about nothing. For those who are still attracted to biotech, but not to the risks, there may be a chicken's way out.<p>Now that investors have lost faith and money in the recent biotech sell off, the 225 or so publicly traded companies in this industry can no longer depend on the public generosity to keep them solvent. In the past, when a biotech lab ran out of cash, it could always sell more shares to an eager crowd of buyers__but not today. The new-issue market has all but shut down for lack of interest.<p>As a result, biotech companies that are low on cash are being forced to enter into mergers, joint ventures, or licensing agreements with richer partners, mostly the pharmaceutical giants. Thus, the new chicken's approach to investing in biotech: Buy the pharmaceutical giants. <p>For the drug companies, the chance to get involved with biotech couldn't have come at a better time. They've got problems that go far beyond Hillary Rodham Clinton. In the halcyon days of the 1980s (when even adjectives like halcyon were turned into drugs), the pharmaceutical giants went along happily increasing their earnings at an annual 12% to 20%. But lately, as many of the patents on their traditional best-selling drugs have expired (Cardizem, Procardia, Ceclor), they've run into fierce competition from the generics.<p>Now, as these traditional best-selling drugs are losing their money-making potency, new biotech products have emerged from the labs. Not only do these marvels of genetic engineering have the potential to cure many diseases that were incurable in the past, they also have the protection of new patents that won't expire for many years.<p>Every biotech analyst on Wall Street has a story about a pharmaceutical giant that will benefit from a biotech alliance. Stuart Weisbrod of <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> told me about <a name="NYSE:SGP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11326"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Schering-Plough</b></a>. It sounds like what happens when a tractor hits a rock, but Schering-Plough's a prosperous enterprise that's expected to earn $4.20 a share in 1993. It would earn 50 cents more but for the $125 million it spends annually on biotech R&D. <p>In addition to this in-house research, Schering-Plough has a licensing agreement with <a name="NASD:BGEN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12776"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Biogen</b></a> to market alpha interferon, which has been highly profitable to date. Currently, Schering-Plough's stock is selling at about 15 times 1993 earnings, and the earnings are expected to continue to grow at a 15% rate. And another success from the biotech lab would speed that up.<p>Then there's <a name="NYSE:LLY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10509"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Eli Lilly</b></a>, which manufactures recombinant insulin in a joint venture with <a name="NYSE:GNE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10628"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Genentech</b></a>__Genentech getting an estimated 8% of the proceeds, Lilly the rest. Lilly is doing other joint ventures with <a name="NASD:CNTO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12923"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Centocor</b></a>. Meanwhile, Roche Holdings, the parent company of Hoffmann-La Roche, another pharmaceutical giant, has spent $2.1 billion to acquire 60% of Genentech. In similar fashion, <a name="NYSE:AHP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10093"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Home Products</b></a> has acquired 67% of <a name="NASD:GENIZ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14904"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Genetics Institute</b></a>.<p>American Home was given this opportunity after Genetics Institute lost an important patent suit to <a name="NASD:AMGN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12623"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Amgen</b></a>. Since then, the scientists at Genetics Institute have produced a blood-clotting protein by implanting a modified gene in the ovary cells of Chinese hamsters. How they think of these things is beyond me, but the result is a breakthrough in the treatment of hemophilia. <p>Genetics Institute is also pushing ahead with a family of cloned proteins that can repair bone cartilage and tissue, to take the place of tissue and bone transplants. Its blood cell work may revolutionize the treatment of infectious diseases. These could be very important developments for American Home, which all along has been doing something that even I can understand__raising its dividend for 41 years in a row.<p>Then there's a reverse chicken's approach to investing in biotech: Buy the biotech companies that are being absorbed by the pharmaceutical giants, or those that are involved in the major joint ventures. When a Roche spends billions to acquire 60% of Genentech's shares, it's a pretty good sign there's some value left in the remaining 40%. In fact, it was the announcement of Roche's plan to purchase a majority interest that convinced me that the biotech industry was for real.<p>This occurred in September of 1990. It took four months for Genentech stock to start its climb from $21 to $39. Roche still has the option to acquire all of Genentech's remaining shares, at a prearranged price well above the market, that increases each quarter. This gives the stock some built-in support. American Home Products has a similar arrangement with Genetics Institute.<p>Biotech companies that partially merge with the pharmaceutical giants have solved the liquidity problem that plagues their independent rivals, who are always scrambling around for more cash. To survive and to compete, a biotech company must have the wherewithal to support the scientists in the labs, then to pay for the clinical trials. Finally, if they do get an FDA approval, they may have to defend their ownership of the product when a rival biotech company claims it had developed the same thing first.<p>As it turns out, Biogen, Amgen, Genentech, and Genetics Institute are among a handful of biotech companies that have produced anything at all that's been approved by the FDA. Amgen, the most prosperous of the four, is beginning to resemble a pharmaceutical giant__an established enterprise with decent earnings from current products, and with potentially valuable new products in the pipeline. Last year, it earned $2.40 a share, or $358 million.<p>Amgen was recognized circa 1989 by Mike Gordon, Fidelity's biotech analyst at that time. Gordon was urging the in-house fund managers, including yours truly, to load up on the stock when it was selling in the $5 to $7 range. Later in 1989, when Amgen's first saleable compound, Epogen, got its final clearance from the FDA, the stock price had reached $10. At the end of 1991, the price had reached a high of $76. So in about two years, shareholders had made more than ten times their investment.<p>This lesson applies not only to biotech, but to investing in general: Just because the good news is already out doesn't mean it's too late to invest. While it's true that the biggest profits in biotech have been made from speculating in start-up companies and their untested ideas, Amgen's stock doubled again in 1991-92, after it had won all the patent battles over the Epogen compound.<p>Then, whacko, the entire biotech sector takes a fall because one other company fails an important clinical test, and Amgen's stock price drops with the rest, in sympathy. What had been a $70 stock is promptly marked down to $35, and Amgen the $10 billion company becomes Amgen the $5 billion company. An investor in biotech shares has to have a strong stomach and it helps to be farsighted as well.<p>It's times like these, when the entire biotech market has taken a hit, that brave investors can look for bargains, such as companies with share values close to their cash holdings. Of course, biotech companies can go through cash pretty quickly. However, limiting the search to companies that already have drugs on the market, or at least in clinical trials, and some revenues coming in will reduce some of the risk. (<a name="NASD:IMUL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12015"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical Corp.</b></a>, for example, has allergy vaccines Catvax and Ragvax in the pipeline, a joint-venture agreement with Marion Merrell Dow, a joint R&D project with <a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a>, $13.2 million in revenues, and has been selling for near its cash value for three months.)<p>For the average investor with a normal stomach who lacks the training to analyze a pharmaceutical giant and its biotech connections, the ultimate chicken's way out is to purchase a mutual fund. Although I spend much of my time telling people they can be successful stockpickers in almost any industry they follow, biotech is the exception. It's so volatile and so complex that it may make sense to let the pros do the picking. Your neighborhood investor's edge won't help you here.<p>At present count, there are 14 biotech-related funds on sale in the U.S. Most combine biotech stocks with health-care stocks, so the investor has only a partial exposure to biotech, although with all the complicated deals, it is getting harder to decide what a "pure" biotech investment might be.<p>The two funds that appear to have the most exposure to biotech are <a name="FUND:FBIOX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FBIOX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity's Select Biotechnology</b></a>, managed by Karen Firestone, and Oppenheimer Global Bio-Tech, managed by Sandra Panem. Panem is far from your average stock jockey. She has a PhD in microbiology and once worked at the Brookings Institution in Washington writing on the economics of biotechnology. This is typical of the experts in this field, both the analysts and the fund managers, many of whom have multiple degrees. Weisbrod of Merrill Lynch also has a PhD in biochemistry and an MBA from Columbia; this is the kind of background a person needs before he can discuss ovary cells of Chinese hamsters as well as price-earnings ratios. <p>Two other biotech mutual funds are the closed-ended kind, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange. These are H&Q Healthcare and H&Q Life Sciences, both managed by Alan Carr at Hambrecht & Quist, hence, the H&Q prefix. Carr thinks this is a good time to invest in biotech, now that the worry over health- care profits has driven down the prices of all related stocks, including the biotech issues, even though most don't have any profits.<p>At H&Q Healthcare, Carr has put 42% of the fund's money into biotech. He is also investing some of that money as a venture capitalist would__to provide capital for biotech companies that have recently gotten started. With fewer venture capitalists investing in biotech these days, the mutual funds are beginning to play this role.<p>Let me leave you with this footnote:<p>Usually, my favorite method for investing in high-growth areas where the competition is fierce is the pan-and-shovel technique. This technique gets its name from the 19th century owners of general stores who got rich selling equipment to the prospectors who went bust in the Gold Rush. When I see a mania, such as computers, where dozens of companies are struggling to sell the same thing, I look for a supplier who provides them all with some basic gizmo they all need.<p>I never found such a company in biotech, but Stuart Weisbrod says there was one: Applied Biosystems. According to him, this was the best-performing stock in the whole group. Applied Biosystems made the DNA and protein synthesizers and other stuff used by all the biotech labs. It was a good stock until it was taken over by Perkin-Elmer, which unfortunately is too big a company to buy just for the Applied Biosystems part. It's uncanny how often the pan-and-shovel technique has worked. <p>

						 <p>By Peter Lynch<p>The recent collapse of the biotech group got me interested, as collapses almost always do. This isn't like the collapse of the saddle-making group, which never had a chance of coming back after the automobile was invented. Biogenetics has established itself as an industry of the future, as well as the bust of the present. <p>Knowing next to nothing about what goes on inside a biotech lab, I called a number of analysts and fund managers who specialize in this field. Here's the tantalizing part, as related to me by Stuart Weisbrod, a biotech analyst at <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>. If, in early 1986, any of us had been smart enough to buy equal amounts of <a name="NYSE:GNE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10628"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Genentech</b></a>, <a name="NASD:AMGN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12623"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Amgen</b></a>, <a name="NASD:CHIR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12972"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chiron</b></a>, Cetus (later acquired by Chiron), <a name="NASD:BGEN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12776"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Biogen</b></a> and Genex, we would have made 40% annually to the end of 1992, turning a $10,000 investment into $105,414 in spite of the fact that Genex went to zero. This is the sort of result that demands some attention.<p>Thirteen years ago, when the first of these companies began appearing on the stock exchanges, I remember hearing that all it took to start one was 100 PhDs, 101 microscopes, and $100 million in cash. The 101st microscope, I guess, was a spare. Or maybe there were 25 PhDs with 26 microscopes, but the story was always the same: The brilliant scientists were bound to hit upon a brilliant idea that could be turned into a useful product, from which the shareholders would someday make a tidy profit.<p>Speaking of tidy profits, the venture capitalists who put up the money to hire the PhDs and install the microscopes could "cash out" by selling all or part of their shares in an initial public offering. On Wall Street, this is called "harvesting the seed capital."<p>The original flurry of biotech issues I ignored, on the theory that mysterious ventures with no earnings should be avoided. I did buy some of the Genentech IPO, whose stock then rose from $35 to $89 on the first day of trading on October 14, 1980. This was a remarkable event, and a signal of exciting prospects to come. However, the biotech group accounted for less than .5% of <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Magellan</b></a>'s portfolio throughout the time I ran the fund.<p>A decade later, I'm hearing that the science of biotech has advanced rapidly. The pace of the research has quickened and the scientists are making more genetic breakthroughs than could have been imagined in 1980. Lately, they've been coming up with potential cures for many serious diseases.<p>Another thing that has advanced rapidly is the number of biotech companies whose shares are traded publicly. Instead of the handful of companies with the cash, the PhDs, and the microscopes that existed in 1980, there are now about 225, many added in the latest wave of public offerings that ended with the recent biotech slump.<p>Herein lies the problem, and the reason for the selloff. The odds are slim (I figure, 1,000 to 1 or so) that a great idea from one of the microscopes will ever become a saleable product. With all the companies now involved in the business of developing new drugs, predicting which company's drug will be approved by the FDA is no easier than picking which turtle egg from a mess of turtle eggs will become a turtle and make it to the sea. <p>To usher a would-be saleable product through all three of the FDA's mandated trials can take from 5 to 15 years and cost from $100 million to $500 million. So far, the biotech group has been far more adept at inventing things than at surviving the dreaded three Phases, which are given roman numerals, like the Super Bowl.<p>In Phase I, the new substance is tested on from 20 to 100 patients to determine whether it's safe to use and isn't going to make people sicker than they already are. Then there's Phase II, involving between 50 and 250 patients, to show if the substance really works. After that comes the hard part, Phase III, the multi-center trials with up to several thousand patients, to show that the substance works in different surroundings.<p>What's been happening lately is that the new drug makes it through Phases I and II, and investors bid up the stock in anticipation of the final FDA approval (it's not uncommon for a biotech stock to double in value between one phase and another), and then the company flunks Phase III. <p>Earlier this year, Synergen flunked Phase III with its drug Antril, which treats septic shock, and the stock lost 68% of its value in one day--a fate that had previously befallen two other companies, XOMA and <a name="NASD:CNTO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12923"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Centocor</b></a>, that had developed similar drugs. It was once reported that "knowledgeable people" thought Centocor's Centoxin had a 90% to 95% chance of passing Phase III, which goes to show that a lot of knowledge can be a dangerous thing in the biotech field.<p>Moreover, when one biotech company fails a big test, the others are sold off in sympathy, as they were after Synergen's drug flopped last February. So many drugs have failed one test or another in recent years that between the end of 1991 and February 1993, the market value of the entire industry declined from about $41 billion to $26 billion, which reminds us how tenuous these valuations can be, based as they are on hopes and dreams, as opposed to earnings.<p>That's another problem: The earnings in biotech are as scarce as hen's teeth, which scientists have yet to invent. To date, only Genentech and Amgen have what could be called a tradition of meaningful earnings, although even Genentech's earnings have been highly variable, and Amgen didn't start making serious money until 1991. Others haven't fared as well. <a name="NASD:GZTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14332"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Genzyme</b></a> earned a little something in 1991, as did Biogen in 1992, and Chiron, reportedly, is about to break even.<p>This, more or less, sums up the proceeds from the entire biotech group. Only about a dozen companies out of 225 have had products approved, and more than 90% of the companies in the biotech group are stuck in the "pre-revenue" stage, which is the new euphemism for not earning a living. The firms that can't make ends meet usually are absorbed into larger companies: That has happened to something like 75 companies since July 1990.<p>Apparently, the experts are as much in the dark about how to pick the next Genentech from among the many potential Genexes as the average person with a degree in English lit. I asked Linda Miller, an analyst at <wam co NYSE:PWJ>Paine Webber</wam-co>, if the PhDs with the microscopes have an advantage in choosing these stocks. She thinks not.<p>According to an article I read in Barron's, insiders at the Amgen labs, where ten molecules were being tested, were convinced that the least promising among them was the one that later became Epogen, Amgen's half-billion-dollar drug. Likewise, a product called Neupogen came out of nowhere and is now Amgen's second half-billion-dollar drug. So even the experts have trouble predicting these things.<p>Moreover, the success of an Epogen or a Neupogen depends on many factors outside the realm of science, such as what happens in the legal department (patent disputes are common in the industry) and what happens at the FDA. Many of the diseases that biotech companies are now trying to cure are difficult to test. It's hard to quantify how much better someone feels after taking a new genetically-produced arthritis medicine in Phase III.<p>Mr. Weisbrod's investment advice is to ignore the companies with the most exciting products, and buy the ones whose drugs have the best chance of getting approved. He saw the potential in Amgen quite early, because Neupogen did one simple thing that was easy to measure: It raised the white blood-cell count. <p>In the clinical trials, all Amgen had to prove was that people's white blood-cell count goes up after they take Neupogen. Synergen, on the other hand, had to prove that Antril helps people cope with septic shock, a more subjective exercise.<p>Every biotech analyst has a favorite method for separating the potential winners from the losers. Some concentrate on the cash, and pick companies with enough of a bankroll to survive several years at their current level of spending, which is called the "burn rate." Others look at the "M Score," which compares the level of R&D spending with the total market value of the company. Others look for the number of products in the pipeline, or in Phases II and III. At present, these are only attempts to fathom the unfathomable.<p>The three most important lessons I've learned from my conversations are these: (1) Don't buy a biotech company because it announces an exciting new drug that hasn't yet been tested; (2) Don't assume that because an exciting drug has survived the first two trials, it's a shoo-in for Phase III; And (3) the investor's edge I'm always talking about often doesn't work in biotech. Investors who ignore these rules may end up getting nothing for something, as the shareholders of Genex already have.<p>Biotech reminds me of computers in the 1960s--the prospects in general are spectacular, but most of the prospectors are likely to fail. What a waste it is to understand the biotech potential, then put your money on the wrong company and lose it. Are there sensible ways to reduce the risks? That's the topic for my next column. <p>----------<p>Peter Lynch retired in 1990 from managing the Magellan Fund, the best-performing of all mutual funds over a 15-year period.

						 <p>By Peter Lynch<p>
Most of us spend more time building up our net worth than we do in figuring out how to give it away for maximum benefit. Nobody argues with the fact that you can't take it with you, but a lot of people try to delay letting go of it right up to their date of departure. Consequently, charity begins not at home, but at the reading of the will.<p>The retentive impulse can be very unfortunate for the people and organizations we'd most like to support. When charity begins at the reading of the will, the bulk of the money falls into the hands of the nation's biggest profligate: the federal government.<p>Uncle Sam's is the unkindest cut of all, the 55% federal tax on inheritance for the deceased in the top bracket. Many states also take their cut, which has caused a great migration of the elderly to places like Florida, which in addition to sunshine offers the warmth and comfort of no estate taxes. But moving to Florida for the postmortem tax break is hardly worth the effort. Most of what the state doesn't get, the feds will.<p>A 55% tax on inheritance makes death the equivalent of a 2,000-point drop in the current Dow Jones average, and this after all the years the deceased has paid taxes on capital gains and "unearned income." (While the government encourages us to save and invest, it persists in using this insulting term, which makes it sound as if we don't deserve the proceeds from the saving and investing we've managed to do. Here's a suggestion for President Clinton: Order the IRS to drop the phrase "unearned income" from all tax forms immediately.)<p>I'm straying from my main point, which is that there are ways to insure that a greater percentage of any good fortune can be handed down to our children or to the worthy causes that we'd most like to support. A giveaway plan ought to be part of any investment strategy, for what's the use of struggling to accumulate net worth, and then allowing it to be carted off to Washington by strangers?<p>The government offers us various ways to avoid the ultimate tax, beginning with the onetime contribution of up to $600,000 that each person ($1.2 million per married couple) is permitted to make to the recipient of his or her choice, free of the gift tax. We can bestow this $600,000 on anyone we like, or even someone we don't like--wife, husband, uncle, mother-in-law, Mike Milken, or <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a>, to help make up for that company's recent losses.<p>Meanwhile, every adult couple can give up to $20,000 annually to each of their children, also free of any gift tax. This opportunity is well-known, but many couples fail to take advantage of it, either because: (1) they worry that their children aren't mature enough to use the money wisely, or (2) they imagine they will go on living for a long time, and see no need to rush to sign over any of their assets.<p>Since it's simple enough to set up a trust fund for the children to delay their receipt of the money, thereby eliminating worry number one, my guess is that number two is the more likely cause of procrastination over making the $20,000 transfers by people who could easily afford them. This failure to act is very rewarding for the government, but unfortunate for the heirs.<p>This brings us to charitable contributions. Although corporations get most of the publicity for being charitable, individuals do most of the giving. In 1991, 89% of the $125 billion collected by churches, foundations, hospitals, schools, and the like came from individuals. According to Nathan Weber of the Giving USA digest, we Americans spend more money every year on charity than we spend on gas and oil.<p>Our collective generosity is a wonderful thing, and continues to set us apart from certain societies of Scrooges in other parts of the world. Nevertheless, our charitable giving often comes in dribs and drabs out of the checkbook, with the major contributions left to the will. But there are more effective methods to consider.<p>Before you write the next sizable check to your favorite charity, you might want to review your portfolio to see if there are any securities that you could donate instead. Stock certificates can be signed over to any qualified tax-exempt organization, which in turn can sell the shares and pay no taxes on your gains. If you sold the shares yourself, you would owe the 28% capital gains tax, but by giving away the shares, you get their full value as a tax deduction. The advantages are even greater in states that have their own capital gains taxes.<p>Consider the following two scenarios. If you donate $5,000 to a worthy cause, and you happen to be in the highest tax bracket, you can save $1,550 on this year's income tax, so the donation ends up costing you $3,450. However, if you donate 1,000 shares of stock for which you paid $2,000 five years ago, but which are now worth $5,000, you avoid the $840 tax on the capital gain and you still get the $1,550 write-off against your taxable income. This way, the same $5,000 donation has cost you only $2,610.<p>I'm not a tax expert, but I'm told there are also advantages to donating artwork, jewelry, houses, used cars, and the like. Several national charities accept used cars in their "vehicle donation" programs. If you're giving away shares of stock, you must have owned them for at least a year and a day to get the full benefit of the tax breaks.<p>Before you give anything away, you ought to consult with your tax advisor. If you are subject to the alternative minimum tax, you'll have to make an adjustment for the size of the gift.<p>Until recently, the most effective way for an individual to contribute to charity has been through a foundation. But as I've discovered for myself, you pay a lot of legal fees to establish a foundation, and after that, you continue to pay the accountants for doing a great amount of paperwork. If Fidelity Investments had launched its Charitable Gift Fund a few years earlier, my wife and I could have avoided the bother.<p>This is my sixth column for Worth, and I haven't yet recommended a Fidelity product, so perhaps I can be allowed one plug for a Fidelity fund that permits small and large investors alike to funnel money into worthy causes. At present, Fidelity is the only for-profit company that the IRS has approved to run a public charity, but various community foundations have set up similar operations.<p>You invest in the Charitable Gift Fund much in the same way you'd invest in a regular mutual fund. You make an initial contribution that is fully tax-deductible. A fund manager puts your money to work, and your assets grow tax-free. In the case of Fidelity's gift fund, you have the option of investing in a growth pool, an equity-income pool, or an interest-income pool, depending on your tolerance for the ups and downs of the stock market. You may also split investment of that gift between any of the funds. You can draw on your share of the assets by having the Gift Fund send checks (in amounts of $250 or more) to your favorite charities at any time.<p>Imagine that someday you'd like to do something special for the American Heart Association. So, you invest $10,000 in an equity mutual fund that grows at 10% a year, for 20 years. Assuming you deduct the amount needed to pay yearly taxes on the dividends, and then pay the capital gains tax on the profits when you get out of the fund, you will have turned your $10,000 into a $43,000 gift. <p>On the other hand, if you invest the same $10,000 in a Gift Fund account where it grows at 10% a year, but tax-free, your original $10,000 will produce a gift of more than $67,000. You see the advantage of tax-free compounding.<p>A technique I often use to inspire a charity to which I've contributed is the challenge grant. You offer them a donation of a specific amount, but only if they can match it by raising a similar amount from other sources. I've never met an organization that failed to match a challenge grant.<p>What begins with a donation may result in larger involvement: a seat on the board, or a place on an ad hoc committee, or some similar opportunity to serve a worthy cause. In my own experience of working with charities, I've found there's no job that's more rewarding. 
---------------------<p>
Charitable Trusts: Smart Ways to Give it Away<p>There are a few additional newfangled methods by which people can avoid estate taxes and maximize their charitable contributions. <p>Charitable remainder trust. You give a major asset (e.g., a portfolio of stocks) to a qualified charity. The stocks are sold, and the proceeds are put into a trust account that you've set up in advance. The trust is managed by the charity or an outside investment manager. You and your spouse continue to receive the income from the trust account for as long as you live. After you both die, the charity gets your trust account. This doesn't do your heirs any good, but if you don't have children, or if your children are richer than you are and don't need to inherit your money, there are tax advantages.<p>Pooled income fund. This is similar to the charitable remainder trust described above, except that your assets are put into a pooled fund run by the charity or an outside manager. Well-run funds of this type can deliver the same returns as regular mutual funds. You can deduct about 25% to 50% of your donation, depending on your age and the fund's earnings history.<p>Charitable lead trust. This is a charitable remainder trust in reverse. You donate assets to a trust, the charity gets the income as long as you're alive, and when you die, the assets are handed over to your heirs. The more years the charity has use of the income, the bigger the tax break for your heirs.<p>Life estate agreement. You and your spouse sign over your house to charity and get a tax deduction for the present value of the remainder interest of the property. You can stay in the house for as long as you live. Then the charity takes possession.<p>Charity insurance. You take out a life insurance policy and name the charity of your choice as beneficiary. This enables you to give much more than you could otherwise.<p>Charitable trust with insurance. Set up a charitable remainder trust and take out a life insurance policy that is equal to the value of the assets you've given to the trust. When you die, the assets in the trust become the property of the charity, but the life insurance pays off to the insurance trust, which in turn is distributed to your heirs. They pay less in taxes than they would if you simply willed your estate to them.<p>Gift annuity. These are offered by several financial services companies, colleges, and universities. You make a donation. The charity pays you a fixed return on your money, say 8% a year. You can arrange for payments to start immediately or later. The longer you delay, the greater your tax deduction may be. A 40-year-old who buys a fixed annuity that will start paying him income at age 65 can write off 90% of the value of the gift. <p>----------

						 <p>by Peter Lynch<p>
Every year, hundreds of new issues take their place on the ticker tapes. These financial newborns are called initial public offerings (IPOs), and how they are handled is one of the most fascinating stories on the Street.<p>Whereas for humans, life ends at the undertaker's, for common stocks, it begins at the underwriter's. Company X engages one of these Wall Street investment houses to peddle its first publicly traded shares, at a fixed price, to a group of initial buyers. Where to fix the price is a guessing game that puts the underwriter in a ticklish situation.<p>If the price is set too high, it will surely fall after the stock begins to trade freely, causing the initial buyers to lose money as well as any faith they may have had in the work of the underwriter. Since most of these buyers are big Wall Street institutions who do not take kindly to losing money, this result will not enhance the underwriter's popularity.<p>On the other hand, if the price is set too low, then the stock will soar in the market, making the initial buyers very happy-- but not so the company. Company X will realize it could have gotten much more for its shares had the underwriter set a higher price at the start. The next time it wants to do a deal, Company X will likely take its business elsewhere.<p>To satisfy both sides, the underwriter tries to price the new issue high enough so the company won't feel bamboozled, and low enough so the initial subscribers can make a bit of profit. In IPO circles this process is known as "leaving something on the table." <p>The underwriter, however, reserves the right to sell an additional amount of shares, usually about 10% of the offering shares, at the time of the offering. This is the "green shoe" allotment, named for the now-defunct Green Shoe Corp., for which the strategy of selling additional shares was invented. If all goes well, the stock price of the new issue will "lift" (another bit of IPO jargon) after it begins to trade freely on the open market. The green shoe shares can then be sold to add to the proceeds from the offering.<p>The deliberate pricing of deals slightly under the presumed market value is one reason IPOs do so well in the first three months of existence. In fact, if you'd bought shares in every IPO that appeared in the last ten years (I'm not counting penny stock IPOs here), held those shares for three months, then sold them and invested in the next batch of IPOs, you would have outperformed the S&P 500 by a large margin.<p>Getting your hands on the shares of an attractive IPO is not easy. They are doled out by the underwriter to a who's who of pensions, mutual funds, and the like. Usually the best deals are oversubscribed. At <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Magellan</b></a> , a constant frustration was getting excited about a new company and then discovering that I was allowed to buy only a piddling amount of stock.<p>If Magellan had this problem, you can imagine what chance the average investor has of participating in an attractive IPO. Brokerage houses get an allotment of shares, which they offer to their biggest and best clients. If you're not one of those and your broker offers to let you in on a "hot IPO," you ought to look this gift horse in the mouth. Why are the big investors avoiding this deal?<p>When <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a> went public in 1980, the state of Massachusetts, using the arcane Blue Sky laws, prohibited small investors from buying any shares. The idea was that Apple was such a risky venture that only professionals should participate. This ranks just behind the Boston Red Sox's decision to sell Babe Ruth as the worst ever made in my state. It was fortunate for me because it meant I got a big allotment in the Apple deal.<p>IPOs seem to come in waves, followed by calmer periods when there's relatively little action. There were waves in mid '81, between mid '83 and early '84, in 1987, and we're in the midst of one that began in late 1991. These waves correspond to peaks in the stock market when investors are euphoric and willing to pay top dollar for stocks. Companies wait for a giddy atmosphere in which to go public, which is why so many of them do it at the same time.<p>Some people argue that it's a mistake to buy IPOs in a giddy atmosphere, which may be true in general, but this is often when the best of the new issues make their debut. It was in July 1987 that a company called MBIA, Inc., was launched. This profitable insurer of municipal bonds came public at $23.50 and promptly dropped half its value on Black Monday in October. It's a $63 stock today. <p><p>Lessons From A Prospectus<p>If you miss out on an IPO, you can acquire as many shares as you want when the stock starts trading in the "aftermarket." I always search for bargains during the rare periods when the deals aren't lifting, as occurred in the summer of 1992, when 70% of the most recent 100 IPOs were selling at or below their original prices. <p>In looking through the list of new issues, I came across <a name="NASD:TACO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14431"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Taco Cabana</b></a>, a chain of Tex-Mex restaurants. I got copies of all the relevant reports, one of which included a map of Texas covered with bright red chili peppers that represented each Taco Cabana outlet in the state, accompanied by the company billboard slogan toot if you like our borracho beans.<p>It's always a good idea to review the prospectuses. There are two of these. The first is called the red herring, named for the numerous warnings sprinkled throughout the text and printed in red. This is the provisional explanation of the deal, showing the range of prices at which the underwriter thinks the shares might be sold after the "road show," where investors are solicited. The final prospectus, with all the details worked out, is printed in black.<p>By comparing one prospectus with the other, you can see whether the road show was a success and the underwriters got their expected price, or whether a lack of enthusiasm caused them to have to reduce it.<p>In the Taco Cabana red herring, the underwriter said the deal would be priced somewhere in a range of $11 to $13, but in October 1992 it came public at $13.50. Obviously, investors were moderately excited about borracho beans.<p>A prospectus also tells you what happens to the money that was raised in the stock sale. The proceeds can go one of two places: into the corporate till (the best result) or into the pockets of the founders and directors who are selling their shares in the offering. Whenever I see insiders using the IPO as an excuse to cash out, I ask myself: If they have no faith in the future of their company, why should I?<p>In this instance, $20 million was going into the corporate till and $13 million to insiders. I also noted that 94 cents a share was going to the underwriters-- no wonder Wall Street firms love to handle IPOs. In the regular market, institutions make only three to five cents a share in commissions for doing stock trades.<p>Among the insiders, the chairman, who owned 2.046 million shares, was selling 754,500 of them to pocket a quick $10 million or so. I would have preferred that he keep all his shares, but among the many gossipy details in the red herring, I found his age: 65. A 65-year-old, I figure, has a right to enjoy some of his money, and he'd retained more than half his holdings. Meanwhile, the Prudential Venture Partners II, one of the original bankrollers of Taco Cabana when it was private, owned 2.9 million shares and were not parting with any of them. This was a positive sign.<p>The next point to consider was how the company will use its share of the proceeds. The red herring informed me that Taco Cabana was planning to reduce its overall debt from $10.4 million to $2.5 million. In fledgling public companies, it's always reassuring to see a strong balance sheet. A company with no debt will have a hard time going bankrupt.<p>Did management know what it was doing? On page 20 of the report, I learned that Taco Cabana had opened its first "Mexican patio cafe" in 1978, and since then had added 40 more company-owned patio cafes, mostly in Central and South Texas. The chairman had 36 years' experience in the restaurant business in San Antonio. The president had been a vice president at Fuddruckers, the vice president of operations was a vice president at Burger King, and a director was president and COO at Church's Fried Chicken. They knew their beef, their chicken, their beans.<p>Sales were on the increase and so were the earnings-- another good sign-- and the company was determined to put new chili peppers on the map, with 12 new company-owned patio cafes planned for 1993 and another 18 for 1994.<p>You discover a lot of interesting trivia in a prospectus, such as the fact that a Taco Cabana restaurant is painted vivid pink and open 24 hours a day, that the average check is $4.63 per person, and that 40% of the business is drive-through. You imagine yourself going to a pink building at 4 am to eat borracho beans, and you marvel at the hearts, minds, and stomachs of Texans.<p>It says here that it cost $900,000 to build a Taco Cabana and that each one is expected to bring in $1.8 million in average annual sales. A general rule for investing in restaurants is that annual sales should exceed the cost of construction. A two-to-one margin is quite favorable.<p>Alcohol (beer, I guess) accounted for only 6% of sales. I'm skittish about owning stock in restaurants that make most of their money on liquor. Liquor tastes the same everywhere, and a restaurant that becomes a bar is likely to lose its customers to a trendier bar.<p>With the stock at $13.50, Taco Cabana was selling for 18 times its estimated 1993 earnings of 75 cents. This was not an extravagant price tag for a fast-growing company in a stock market selling for 23 times earnings overall.<p>I'm not recommending that either of us buy shares in Taco Cabana. I'm using it to illustrate how much you can learn from reading prospectuses, and how it makes sense to investigate companies that have recently gone public. <p>New companies are routinely misunderstood and/or ignored by Wall Street, which makes these the perfect targets for individual investors who do independent research. There are several newsletters and advisory services that keep tabs on the latest IPOs. These include "Going Public/The IPO Reporter," published by Investment Dealers' Digest in New York ($990.00 per year; 212-227-1200); "New Issues Digest," published by National Corporate Sciences, White Plains, NY ($425 per year; 914-421-1500); and Standard & Poor's "Emerging & Special Situations," in New York ($223.50 per year; 800-221-5277). <p>In the chart on page 38, you can see the results from a few of the most profitable IPOs of the past 12 years. Most are household names already. <p>----------<p>Peter Lynch retired in 1990 from managing the Magellan Fund, the best-performing of all mutual funds over a 15-year period.

					<font size=4>
						 <p>By Peter Lynch<p>The romance with foreign stocks continues. What started in the mutual funds has spread to the pension funds. The California Public Employee Retirement System poured $7.3 billion into foreign stocks in 1991, and, not to be left out, the New York State Teachers' Retirement System invested $750 million in 1992. Our largest 200 pension funds now have $75.6 billion invested abroad--more than seven times as much as they did in 1985.<p>In effect, U.S. pension managers are betting increasing amounts on the notion that foreign companies will outperform the home-grown variety that got us this far. The subtext is that Wall Street can no longer compete with the Paris Bourse or the Hong Kong Ordinaries. If what's made in America is second-rate, the story goes, then so are the companies that do the making.<p>Let me be the first to throw myself in front of this bandwagon. It is remarkably short-sighted to invest willy-nilly in foreign stocks when you could be investing in America. In the ten years since foreign stocks have become fashionable, U.S. companies have become more competitive. Even our railroads are beginning to look good.<p>U.S. railroads are a cherished symbol of great American ineptitude. My generation was raised on the idea that Americans couldn't run one, and that the purpose of the industry was to support large numbers of aimless individuals, a sort of welfare state on wheels. Behind each train was the red caboose, a vestigial organ tacked on by the unions in order to house the pinochle players sitting on the featherbeds.<p>Slowly but surely, the railroad companies have tossed out the featherbeds and eliminated the cabooses, and last year the industry's return on investment was the best in about 50 years. The average crew size is declining and the volume of traffic is increasing, as railroads are hauling more coal and grain. They are even taking some container business away from the truckers.<p>The railroad shares still sell at a large discount to the market, so Wall Street does not yet fully believe in this transformation. Nevertheless, companies such as Norfolk Southern, <a name="NYSE:BNI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10250"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Burlington Northern</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:UNP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11544"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Union Pacific</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:CRR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10395"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Conrail</b></a> prove that America can make the trains run at a profit, and perhaps even on time.<p>The United States still leads the world in airplanes (<a name="NYSE:BA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10221"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Boeing</b></a>) and in tractors (<a name="NYSE:CAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10304"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Caterpillar</b></a>). Caterpillar is recognized worldwide as producing what once would have been called the Cadillacs of farm equipment--before Cadillac lost its place at the pinnacle of automotive craftsmanship. Detroit, says the tune from the bandwagon, has forgotten how to make cars.<p>Really? I'll grant you that it's difficult, if not impossible, to determine the nationality of a car, which has begun to resemble the military brat, raised a little here and a little there. That said, the most successful car product of the last decade did not come from the drawing boards in Japan or Germany; it came from Detroit. I'm referring to the <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a> minivan, which sells twice as many units in the United States per year as all the <a name="NASD:VOLVY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41854"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Volvo</b></a>s, Lexuses, and Infinitis combined. So if foreign car companies make such an obviously superior product, why did some 450,000 Americans buy Chrysler minivans last year, while only 70,000 bought Volvos?<p>Perhaps we should say that Caterpillar is the Chrysler minivan of farm equipment. And when it comes to the farm itself, U.S. agriculture has hardly been resting on its cornucopia. U.S. companies are leading the world not only in tractors, in fertilizers, and in food processing (<a name="NYSE:CAG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10388"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ConAgra</b></a>'s stock is up almost fifteen-fold in ten years), but also in genetic hybrids.<p>You wouldn't think it takes much intelligence to come up with a seed, but the seed-making business now resembles the pharmaceutical business in its astounding complexity. New seeds must face years of clinical trials and run a gauntlet of government approvals before they can be sown.<p>We've already proven our ability to be among the best in the world of pharmaceuticals (<a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a>, Upjohn Co., and <a name="NYSE:BMY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10232"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bristol-Myers Squibb</b></a>), and we're repeating the performance in agriculture with <a name="NASD:SEEDB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13152"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>DEKALB Genetics</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:PHB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14440"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pioneer Hi-Bred International</b></a>. DEKALB has been producing hybrid hens since the mid '40s and hybrid swine (bigger litters, fatter porkers) for 20 years, and has recently made progress with its hybrid seed corn. The leading brand of hybrid seed corn in France is marketed by Pioneer Hi-Bred, a triumph in a country that treats home-grown food with the respect that we give our nation's flag. <a name="NASD:CGNE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12871"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Calgene, Inc.</b></a>, is working on a genetically engineered tomato, <a name="NYSE:MTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11010"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Monsanto</b></a> on a superior, pest-resistant potato that may inspire a rewrite of the famous ditty: You say potato, I say Monsanto.<p>Likewise, the U.S. steel industry, once left for dead in the Rust Belt, is showing signs of life, especially in companies such as <a name="NYSE:NUE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11098"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nucor</b></a>, a spectacular enterprise that has introduced efficient mini-mills. Even the fallen mastodons, such as <a name="NYSE:BS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10210"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bethlehem Steel</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:IAD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10786"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Inland Steel</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:X"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12969"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>USX</b></a> (the former U.S. Steel), are beginning to stir. <p>America's loss of the TV market to the Japanese has created the impression that America is unable to compete with the Japanese in electronics. In fact, our position in this industry is still strong at home and overseas. While it's true that the TV-manufacturing business has been captured by the Japanese, they aren't making money in it like they used to, so to this market we can say good riddance. Moreover, this popular theory that the United States can't compete in electronics is disproven by <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a>, a world-class supplier of semiconductors and the world's leading supplier of cellular phones and mobile radios. Their foreign operations account for 42% of sales, and they are the only non-Japanese supplier of car phones and pagers to Nippon Telegraph & Telephone.<p>As for who will control the computer business, I heartily endorse the opinion expressed by Alan Ryan in a recent issue of The New York Review of Books: "The mass production of computer chips now lies largely in the hands of NEC, Toshiba, and Hitachi, but it is widely believed that the American firm <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a> will wipe the floor with them during the next decade."<p>We can't deny that the Japanese took over the camera business and became their own best customers, but, like TVs, cameras are not profitable per se. Film is where the money is, and although Fuji has made inroads with U.S. customers, its major U.S. competitor, <a name="NYSE:EK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10500"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kodak</b></a>, still has a higher market share for film in Japan than Fuji and all other Japanese producers have here. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based <a name="NYSE:PRD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11198"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Polaroid</b></a>, of course, continues to have a lock on the instant-gratification market worldwide.<p>Speaking of locks, <a name="NYSE:G"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10655"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gillette</b></a> maintains its global domination of the razor trade, and political and corporate leaders across every continent (if they happen to be male) begin their day by pulling Gillettes across their cheeks--prima facie evidence that the United States is doing something right.<p>Meanwhile, we continue to export our fantasies, from Mickey Mouse to Madonna, along with our soft drinks, our fast-food chains, and our retail outlets. It's culturally correct for all U.S. travelers abroad to groan in dismay as we pass a <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a> in Paris or a <a name="NYSE:TOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11495"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toys "R" Us</b></a> in Heidelberg, but these are sights we ought to celebrate. The more of this sort of culture we can export, the stronger our economy, and the more likely we'll all be able to afford to travel to Paris to admire the Mona Lisa and wince at McDonald's.<p>Back at home, we're creating more promising small growth companies of the kind that are listed on NASDAQ. Europe is particularly short on these emerging-growth opportunities, as the European economies are dominated by oversized conglomerates of which only some are making a decent level of earnings. While it's true that Japan has become a haven for small-company growth stocks, these are often so overpriced that the investor has little chance to gain on the upside, and Japan in general is having its troubles these days.<p>This brings me to the ultimate reason to prefer U.S. stocks: Wall Street provides a level playing field that exists almost nowhere else. Things we take for granted here--the timely settlement of stock trades, the timely receipt of dividends, the accurate reporting of earnings--cannot be taken for granted by shareholders in Latin America, Europe, and the Pacific Rim. Regulatory authorities elsewhere, whether in Malaysia or Mexico City, don't protect investors the same way the SEC does.<p>Throughout the 1980s, I made a lot of money in foreign stocks for the <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Magellan Fund</b></a>. This successful foray had nothing to do with foreign companies being superior to U.S. companies. Foreign stocks were so poorly covered and the reports so sketchy that many of the best companies were selling for a fraction of their actual worth. I found bargains galore, even among the most famous conglomerates (Nestle, Volvo, Unilever, Montedison), with nary an analyst to trumpet their virtue.<p>The popularity of global investing has caused prices to rise and bargains to disappear, but the primitive reporting system still exists. When you buy foreign stocks, you almost have to do your own research, or else rely on a fund manager's doing his or hers. Managing a portfolio of foreign stocks is a much harder job than managing a domestic portfolio.<p>There's a patriotic argument I haven't mentioned. Every dollar sent abroad robs an American company of capital it could use to grow. Someday there may be a backlash against owning foreign stocks, just as we've seen against owning foreign cars. Protesters may burn shares of foreign companies on the steps of the New York Stock Exchange, the way they bashed Japanese cars in American parking lots.<p>You don't have to be a patriot to invest in America--merely self-interested. We have a great system of reporting to protect shareholders. We have great industry leaders (<a name="NYSE:NKE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14254"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nike</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Walt Disney</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:IR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10785"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ingersoll-Rand</b></a>, Sallie Mae, and <a name="NYSE:FDX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10552"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Federal Express</b></a>, to add a few more names). When <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> falters, we have at least three other five-star generals, <a name="NYSE:GRN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10643"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Re</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:GIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10639"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Mills</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:GE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Electric</b></a>, to pick up the slack with their great records. <p>There's nothing wrong with investing abroad if you're familiar with the territory.

Nothing bedevils the average investor more than the false sense of inferiority that comes from playing against the institutions. After all, the institutions are so big, and get so much attention for dominating the markets, that the amateur stockpicker can't help but feel that he's trapped in a fantasy baseball camp, competing against the Atlanta Braves.<p>
I've said this before, but having had nearly three years to reflect on life in the pro ranks on Wall Street, I'm still convinced that it's not the Atlanta Braves, or even the Toledo Mud Hens, that the average investor is competing against. It's more the Thundering Herd.<p>
"Thundering Herd," as you may recall, is how the financial press once described the great mass of stockbrokers hired by <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> to service the average investor, back in the days when average investors bought and sold most of the stocks. Today there's another kind of Thundering Herd on Wall Street: institutional investors, including the mutual fund managers, who now do most of the buying and selling.<p>
A sizeable faction of this Thundering Herd could even be called the Blundering Herd. I can say that with confidence, having ridden with the Blundering Herd on more occasions than I care to admit.<p>
The fact that the professionals now dominate the markets, which so often leads people to conclude that the amateur has no chance, has actually improved the amateur's chance. He or she can take an independent tack by zigging when the Herd zags and buying stocks that the Herd has overlooked, and especially the ones that the Herd has recently trampled. What holds them back is the inferiority complex they've gotten from mistaking a cattle drive for the Atlanta Braves.<p>
The inferiority complex causes investors to do one of three self-destructive things: (1) imitate the pros by buying "hot" stocks or trying to "catch the turn" in, say, IBM; (2) become "sophisticated" by investing in futures, options, options on futures, etc.; (3) buy what they've heard a pro has recommended, either in a magazine or on one of the popular financial news programs. Information on what the pros think is so readily available that the celebrity tip has replaced the old-fashioned tip from Uncle Harry as the most compelling reason to invest in a company.<p>
Let's say that in the spirit of doing it yourself, you take money out of your savings account at the local S&L, America First and Foremost, and decide to buy stock with it. You're somewhat intrigued by the fact that the price of the common stock of America First and Foremost has fallen in half. You know this to be a solid institution with a strong balance sheet and no commercial lending because you checked into these things before you put your money there. (Forgive me for using an S&L example twice in the three columns I've written for this magazine, but lately I've been very taken with this sector.)<p>
Just as you are about to pick up the phone and order the latest annual report from America F&F to see if the story is as good on paper as it seems to be in real life, a little voice from the inferiority lobe whispers, "Who do you think you are, buying a stock in a company that has never been touted in Barron's, Forbes, or Business Week?"<p>
So instead of ordering the annual report, you go to the newsstand to pick up their latest copies to see what the experts are saying, and in one of them you discover that Mario Gabelli owns shares in <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> Enterprises, a bottling company for the world's favorite soft drink. You buy the stock, on the theory that a famous fund manager like Gabelli knows a lot more than you and your Uncle Harry put together. In fact, Gabelli does know a lot more than you and everybody's Uncle Harry put together, but that doesn't mean you're going to profit by betting on his tip regarding Coca-Cola Enterprises. (I mention this company because three years ago I, too, recommended it in Barron's at a price $3 higher than its current price of $11 a share.)<p>
Since Gabelli doesn't give out his home phone number, you can't call him up to ask if he still likes Coca-Cola Enterprises and whether he views the price drop as an opportunity to buy more, or whether he has soured on the company and gotten out of the stock to cut his losses.<p>
Most likely, the drop in the price will cause you to lose faith in the stock, and without Gabelli to reassure you, you sell your shares to cut your own losses - maybe you've even sold them to Gabelli! Then you take your diminished capital and repeat the process with another celebrity tip, perhaps from an analyst at your brokerage firm. If you cut enough losses, sooner or later there's nothing left to cut.<p>
Picking your own stocks in this popular fashion only confirms what you have always suspected: There is no way an amateur investor can compete with the Atlanta Braves. If you're lucky enough to become totally demoralized before the money runs out, you'll send the remains to a mutual fund. My advice here is that if you want to bet on the pros, the way to do it is to invest in their funds to get the full benefit from their expertise coming and going.<p>
I suspect that amateur stockpickers would have a much higher opinion of their abilities, as well as a greater net worth, if they avoided all expert buy recommendations in favor of their own research. This is the only kind of "independent investing" that makes sense.It's taken me three columns to get around to saying this, but the investor's edge is something you already have, not something you acquire by listening to the latest tips from notable sources. As a depositor at America First and Foremost, you are close enough to the situation to at least have a chance of keeping track of it, and also a chance of buying the stock at a bargain price before the Herd comes back.<p>
Actually, there are two kinds of investor's edges: the on-the-job edge, in which you have a working relationship with an industry and the related companies with whom you do business; and the consumer's edge, with which you can capitalize on your experiences in restaurants, airports, and shopping malls.<p>
In fact, of the 20 top-performing stocks on the New York Stock Exchange in the last decade, no fewer than six (<a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:CC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10343"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Circuit City</b></a>, the <a name="NYSE:GPS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11469"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gap</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a> Stores, <a name="NYSE:LIZ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13977"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Liz Claiborne</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:DDS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10463"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dillard Department Stores</b></a>) have been stuck under the noses of millions of shoppers who, if they'd paid attention to the popularity of these enterprises, could have profited from their edge. And they had time to do so: It often takes 15 years for a retailer or a restaurant chain to expand across the country, as more and more investors become aware of it, before the Wall Street professionals catch on.<p>
The line about New York, "If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere," may be true for singers, comedians, and cab drivers, but public companies routinely make it in dozens of places before the news of their success reaches the institutional trading desks in New York or Boston, the two places where most of the Thundering Herd is corralled.<p>
A colleague of mine on the board of Morrison Knudsen, Irene Peden, recently used her coffee lover's edge and bought shares in <a name="NASD:SBUX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15745"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Starbucks</b></a>, the popular Seattle coffee company. Peden is a professor of electrical engineering and an expert in subsurface remote sensing, whatever that is, and she always starts her day with a cup of Starbucks coffee. She became a fan of Starbucks back in Seattle, where she normally resides, but now that she's on temporary assignment in Washington, D.C., she gets the Starbucks beans sent to her.<p>
Except for the shares she owns in companies on whose boards she serves, Peden had never bought a single stock until last year, when Starbucks came public. Her own experience with Starbucks convinced her the company had two great advantages: It made a product that people wanted, and it sold it at a profit.<p>
Peden did not have to look far under the subsurface to find out that Starbucks was well-capitalized, with earnings growing at a steady pace, and that it had begun to expand east and south out of the Seattle area. The story is still a good one, and so far the stock has done well.<p>
Cheryl Peterson, who recently retired from a local charity in which I'm involved, used her letter writer's edge and bought shares in <a name="NASD:MAIL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14014"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mail Boxes Etc.</b></a>, which sells stamps, mails packages, and rents boxes to people who are tired of waiting in line at the post office. This is basically the same story as Starbucks's: good company, strong balance sheet, and a huge potential market - millions of Americans who are fed up with the post office. The stock was first offered at just under $2 a share (adjusted for splits) and is worth $15 today.<p>
Here's another one: Any subscriber to a computer magazine or owner of an <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> personal computer or IBM clone could have used the consumer's edge and discovered <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>. Practically every IBM-based PC you buy comes with the Microsoft disk operating system (MS/DOS), for which Microsoft has the exclusive rights. You can't run the machine without DOS. Microsoft's virtual monopoly on this product puts it in the same enviable position as a <a name="NYSE:GT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10668"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Goodyear</b></a> with the exclusive right to make all the tires for all the cars on the road. But even if you failed to recognize DOS as a potential profitmaker at the onset, once the company went public in 1986, you had other chances to follow its progress each time the company innovated. Microsoft continued to boast steady earnings growth as it introduced "Word," "Windows," various products for the Macintosh line, and "Excel," its spreadsheet that challenged the popular Lotus version.<p>
Making computers has been a treacherous business, with too many competitors killing each other off, but what was bad for them was good for Microsoft because every time IBM sold a computer with DOS, Microsoft made a profit. While many individual investors were busy trying to think like the pros and figure out how to catch the turn in IBM, they should have been thinking like amateurs, looking for clues in their PCWeek or in their computer boxes (they'd have noticed Microsoft software in every one of them). I wish I'd noticed myself. The stock has been a 35-bagger.<p>
In my recent travels, I have noticed <a name="NASD:ABPCA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13703"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Au Bon Pain</b></a>, a name I continue to mispronounce, beginning with the "O," which I call "Ow," and ending with the "Pan," which I call "Paw." This croissant-and-coffee franchise has appeared in airports and food courts in malls, where people like me have a chance to use their croissant-lover's edge. The company went public only recently, but it's been in business for more than a decade. It has a good balance sheet, well-conceived plans for expansion, and so far it's only in a few major markets - but don't take my word for it. Do your homework.<p>
Peter Lynch retired in 1990 from managing the <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Magellan Fund</b></a>, the best-performing of all mutual funds over a 15-year period. He is currently a trustee of the Fidelity Group of funds, and is working on a book to be published next spring by Simon & Schuster.<p>

						Investors know how to save -- which is why they should only invest in nations that do, too <p>
By Jim Rogers<p>
My last column focused on what I believe is the single most important ingredient to success for global investors: the ability to identify nations that have unfettered economies and free markets -- in other words, those that foster economic freedom. Countries that move toward economic openness invariably beat out nations that move in the opposite direction -- and by wide margins. This month, I will explore how countries get the most benefit from economic freedom: namely, through savings and investment. <p>
Investors often fail to realize just how often the deck gets shuffled in the global economy. Nations that lead the pack rarely stay on top for long, and countries can come seemingly from out of nowhere to grab the lead. In an average lifetime, three or four major upheavals can occur in the world economic order. In the 20th century, global economic leadership has shifted from England to the United States to Japan.<p>
This is the way of the world. People accumulate massive amounts of wealth and continually fail to hold on to it. It's a truism that it is easier to make a lot of money than to keep it -- and it's as true for nations as it is for individuals. Examples from history abound. In the 15th century, the Portuguese were rich. In the 16th century, conquistadors discovered gold and silver mines in Latin America and bailed out Spain, thereby giving it wealth for the next couple of centuries. Peru and Mexico profited as enormously from their precious-metal mines in the 16th and 17th centuries as the Kuwaitis and Arabs have from oil in the 20th century. Burma was the richest country in Asia in 1962, but now it's among the poorest -- far, far behind Japan and others.<p>
As countries accumulate wealth, their politicians all too often submit to the temptation to tax that wealth and redistribute it one way or another -- which makes them popular at the same time they are corroding the vigor of the body economic, a proclivity we've seen in this century in Europe and North America.<p>
I find it unfortunate that so many people still believe in the zero-sum notion that profit in one area necessarily creates a loss somewhere else -- or that the haves can succeed only at the expense of the have-nots. This is simply not the case. The science of economics -- dismal as it otherwise may be -- has shown it is possible for everyone to win at the same time.<p>
Savings and investment make this possible. <p>
When people save by setting aside a portion of their earnings, a pool of capital is created. This money, in turn, attracts folks with ideas about how to put it to use. If the capital is held by a bank, these entrepreneurs will try to persuade the bankers to lend them some of it. If the capital is directed into the stock market, the folks with the bright business ideas will compete for it in that arena.<p>
Over time, the business operators who have the best ideas (and can therefore offer the best returns) generally attract the most capital. In this way, the smartest and most efficient producers in each field receive the money they need to exploit their ideas, skills, and resources most effectively. <p>
Economies that promote this type of environment -- high savings rates along with a market-driven system for putting the accumulated funds to the best use -- benefit everyone. Consumers get the best products at the best possible prices. Workers go to jobs at enterprises that are healthy and expanding. Businesses get the capital they need to put their good ideas to work.<p>
But it all starts with savings -- the fuel an economy needs to grow. This is why, in addition to examining a nation's economic climate (capital gets distributed efficiently only if markets are free), I advise global investors to take a close look at a nation's savings rate.<p>
Just as economic performance can vary widely from country to country, so can savings rates. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Washington, D.C., Japan's gross savings rate in 1995, measured as a percentage of disposable household income, was 13.4 percent. Germany's savings rate was 11.6 percent, and France's was 14.3 percent. In contrast, the savings rate in the U.S. was equal to only 4.7 percent of disposable household income (down from 9 percent in 1982). Canada's rate was 7.4 percent, and Finland's was 5 percent.<p>
These numbers alone do not tell the whole story, however, because governments can foul up the picture by managing their finances poorly. When a government runs a budget deficit, it must go into the market and compete with business for a share of the nation's savings pool. When this happens, a nation's hard-earned savings can end up getting diverted from investments in industrial production and business expansion toward such things as military spending, social welfare, and -- when a government runs deficits year after year -- interest payments on government borrowings that are many years old.<p>
So another way to look at how well a country is doing on the savings front is to check out its national balance sheet: its assets minus its debt. In doing so, an investor can figure out which countries are net debtors and which are net creditors. Even though a country's coffers may be overflowing, you have to be sure the country doesn't owe so much that its assets are offset by its debt.<p>
The International Monetary Fund publishes the International Financial Statistics Yearbook, which offers pages of fascinating data on the balance sheets of most countries. With this information, a savvy investor can examine which countries are doing a good job of saving their pennies and which are not.<p>
Which countries stand out? Singapore and Japan all have huge net-asset positions on a per capita basis. In 1995, Singapore's 3 million people had $20,376 per capita and Japan's 125 million people had $3,574. Even Korea was a creditor, with a per capita position of $644. Thirty years ago, most of these Asian countries were struggling to break even. Compare those amounts with that of the U.S., which had a net debtor position of negative $628 per person in 1995.<p>
A country's total reserves, including its holdings of gold, are another good number to look at. According to the IMF yearbook, total reserves grew 773 percent for all industrialized countries from 1965 to 1995. Of these countries, the total reserves of the U.S. grew a meager 285 percent while Switzerland's total reserves grew 696 percent and Japan's a whopping 5,668 percent. <p>
These figures provide a strong indication of which countries not only enjoy wealth today but are managing themselves in a way that will enable them to have even more wealth in the future. The knowledgeable investor who's done well only in the U.S. over the past decades needs to realize that he or she is long on the dollar, which weakens every month as the U.S. national debt grows.<p>
Ultimately, these history lessons don't mean much unless you understand the real point: It's not just knowing who has the money now but figuring out who's going to use it the right way. In 1975, the United States was in decent financial shape but was headed down a rocky path. Asian countries today are the ones that have the formula right: Their governments' policies produce high savings rates. They also tax lightly in an atmosphere of economic openness. The result is one all investors recognize: Asian Tigers. Chile is the tiger of Latin America; it's at the top of the heap in terms of promoting savings and investment and letting the market have a free hand -- measures that pulled it out of one of the most severe economic slumps ever seen in our hemisphere. Chile's per capita net assets have risen from a frightening negative $21,267 in 1965 to a positive $757 in 1995. This economic miracle took more than the legislature's passing a few laws -- it also required a people's sustained effort over two decades to put their house in order.<p>
As Charles Dickens is often incorrectly quoted as saying (it's actually from the musical Oliver!): "In this world, one thing counts: in the bank, large amounts." Just as a large savings account gives an individual tremendous power over his own life and others, it does the same thing for nations and peoples: A country has to have the discipline not only to make money but to save it and then put it to good use. That means spending it on things that contribute to a nation's wealth-generating capacity, such as plants and equipment, and not on luxury palaces (Saudi Arabia) or on interest payments on ever increasing old debt (the United States).<p>
The job for the global investor is to identify the nations that understand that a penny saved is a penny that can produce returns.<p>

						Want to earn big gains in global stocks? Invest in nations that embrace free markets.<p>
By Jim Rogers<p>
Even the most serious investors sometimes grow panicky at the idea of investing overseas. I guess that for some people the whole idea just seems, well, too foreign. But the truth is that it's not really that difficult to develop a workable strategy for overseas investment. The central challenge is identifying the countries that are doing things correctly and are likely to be rewarded for it -- that's what I've made my business. And now there's a new study, orchestrated by the Fraser Institute, that provides an excellent frame-work for assessing which nations will prosper and which will merely plod along in the years ahead.<p>
The case for foreign investing is so strong that I am not even going to try to debunk the mass mania that has gripped the U.S. stock market of late. (Why try to bring people to their senses about this issue when they're already too far gone?) <p>
Foreign investments provide a degree of diversification (and therefore safety) that no portfolio of domestic equities can ever hope to match. This is particularly true if you view your personal finances in a holistic way. By virtue of living and working in this country, almost all of us are already strategically overexposed to the U.S. economy. Our personal wealth is heavily subject to local wages, local prices, local taxes, and local real-estate values. We all reside in the house of the dollar.<p>
Think about the situation this way: You already know you shouldn't load up your investment portfolio with stock in just one company (thereby putting all of your eggs in one basket). So why, following the same logic, would it make sense for you to hitch your personal fortune to any one national economy -- especially since it is now so easy to spread your investment risk around the globe? The options available today are plentiful. They include global mutual funds, currencies, and international stocks.<p>
Just as successful corporations come and go, so do successful nations. The turnover among economic powerhouses is more frequent than you might think: There's practically a whole new group at the top every generation or so. This phenomenon creates a lot of opportunity.<p>
What's more, there's a real logic to the turns of the global wheel. The formula for successful international investing isn't that difficult to decipher.<p>
Here's my advice: Scout for nations that are living up to the ideals and principles that made our country great -- namely, those with unshackled economies and free markets. Place your bets on these places. I promise that if you do this you will be amply rewarded. In fact, it's practically a sure thing -- as long as you stick to this principle and choose accordingly.<p>
Do you want proof? Take a look at the study put together by the Fraser Institute, a Canadian organization that examines economic and social issues. The study, conducted by an international team under the institute's direction, is an exhaustive report on how differing economic and political approaches affect economic growth rates. In particular, the study examined what impact economic freedom has on the income and wealth of nations (or, conversely, what role central planning, high taxes, tariffs, entitlement payments, and the like play in a country's economic progress -- or lack thereof). The researchers reviewed the performance of 103 nations in four major areas: money-supply growth and inflation; government operations; taxation; and restrictions on international exchange. <p>
What did they find through their study? Nothing that would surprise an experienced global investor. Nations that rate consistently high in economic and political openness have much better growth rates than those that are more statist or closed.<p>
The countries with systems that are most open, such as Hong Kong, Switzerland, Singapore, the United States, Canada, and Germany, all fell into the highest growth category during the 30-year period covered by the study. Those nations with the lowest rankings for economic openness, such as Somalia, Zambia, Hungary, Romania, Brazil, Syria, Uganda, and Zaire, were at the bottom of the heap in wealth generation.<p>
The study also found that when nations improve their level of openness by eliminating trade barriers, freeing financial markets, lowering taxes, and reducing governmental red tape (as, for example, Chile, Portugal, and Singapore have done) greater economic growth results. Countries that take the opposite approach, such as Somalia, Iran, and Venezuela, almost always suffer for it.<p>
The Fraser study concludes that "without exception, countries with either a high level of or a substantial increase in economic freedom achieved positive growth. Correspondingly, the overwhelming majority of countries with low and/or contracting levels of economic freedom experienced declines in per capita GDP."<p>
Countries often get religion about putting their houses in order. What is important is that they follow through and maintain their commitment to this strategy over the decade or so it takes to make a real difference. Thus, investors need to be aware that many political systems -- often those with shortsighted politicians whose electoral horizons are five years or less -- do not facilitate this sort of long-haul transformation.<p>
The study also found that a sound economic system is far more important than any short-term windfall or jackpot. Nigeria and Indonesia provide a study in contrasts in this regard. Back in the 1960s, both ranked among the top ten nations in oil production. Since then, however, Nigeria has bungled its wealth; the country is in deep trouble today. Indonesia, meanwhile, is brimming with prosperity. The essential difference is that Nigeria remained a closed economic system, while Indonesia pursued a more open approach.<p>
Or consider Ghana and Thailand, two agricultural economies. In the 1950s, Ghana was far richer than Thailand. But late in that decade, Ghana's politicians imposed severe trade restrictions in a misguided effort to protect the country's internal colonial prosperity. As a result, Ghana became an economic basket case, and only recently has it shown any signs of recovery. Thailand, in the meantime, implemented free-market economic policies, which led to robust growth.<p>
Then there are Venezuela and Chile. In 1975, Venezuela was relatively open economically, while Chile was bogged down in economic red tape. Chile eventually adopted many economic reforms that freed up its society and enabled its economy to grow. Venezuela followed the opposite course. Chile's average annual per capita growth rate since 1985 has been 4.8 percent. Venezuela's, on the other hand, has been negative 2.2 percent.<p>
Similar patterns exist in South Korea (up) and North Korea (down); Costa Rica (up) and Honduras (down); and Portugal (up) and Greece (down).<p>
What countries should an investor be looking at now? Which nations are pursuing a plan of action that could put them on top in the year 2010?<p>
Here are some of the places that I think an investor should take the time to research: Ireland, Denmark, Botswana, Portugal, China, New Zealand, Australia, Chile, Canada, Peru, South Korea, Ethiopia, Uganda, Mozambique, and Eritrea. <p>
I am especially impressed with the changes taking place in the Far East. Many Asian countries today have the formula right: Their governments' policies produce high savings rates and low taxes. These nations are going to be among the most formidable players in the global economy of the future.<p>
Chile is the tiger of Latin America. It's at the top of the heap in terms of promoting savings and investment and curtailing restrictions -- a policy that pulled it out of one of the most severe economic slumps ever seen in the Western Hemisphere.<p>
The openness of the political system that people choose for themselves makes virtually all the difference in their future. By recognizing this, investors can capitalize on opportunities far beyond their own backyards.<p>

						The markets of Latin America will take investors on a bumpy ride, but the destination could be grand <p>
By Jim Rogers<p>
If you still believe that Latin America is a lousy investment -- the home of tin-pot dictators, banana republics, hyperinflation, bankruptcies, and currency collapses -- you might want to review what has been happening in some of the equity markets south of the Rio Grande.<p>
An investor who put $1,000 into Chile's market index on January 1, 1986, would own $43,600 worth of stock today -- almost 11 times the growth of the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index. During the same period, Colombia's equity market would have transformed $1,000 into $32,228, and Mexico's would have produced $14,501. Note that these are dollar returns, which makes them even more impressive given the region's reputation for weak currencies.<p>
I'll grant that investors in Latin America frequently experience hair-raising moments. Argentina's market soared 175.9 percent in 1989, tumbled by 36.6 percent in 1990, and then blasted up 396.9 percent in 1991. The annual standard deviation for U.S. stocks, based on the S&P 500, has been around 15 percent during the past ten years. (Standard deviation measures volatility over time; the higher the standard deviation, the more volatile the market.) In comparison, during the past ten years, Mexico's market has had a standard deviation of nearly 70 percent and Argentina just over 60 percent, according to a report prepared for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.<p>
It's easy to forget that Latin America does have a rich economic history. Early in this century, Argentina was among the wealthiest countries in the Western Hemisphere. Peru was tops 300 years ago, and Mexico has had periods when it possessed a fair amount of loot as well. It's also easy to forget just how big Latin America is -- a market of 500 million people, mostly of one religion and one language. (Brazil has 162 million Portuguese speakers, but Portuguese and Spanish are close enough to preclude real barriers to understanding.)<p>
The equity markets of Latin America have become huge, too. The six largest listed $360 billion worth of stocks by the end of 1995. Brazil's market -- the So Paulo Stock Exchange -- is the biggest, with a total market capitalization of $143 billion.<p>
Few Americans realize how significant the fall of the Berlin Wall was to the rest of the globe and especially to Latin America. Without the benefit of Communist financing, the civil wars that plagued this region began to dry up. Statist Latin-American governments, meanwhile, had already begun to discredit themselves with policies that produced a series of debt crises. These countries were ripe for reform, and the people began taking the reins of government back into their own hands. Bureaucracies shrank, tariffs tumbled, currencies stabilized, foreign investors began pouring in money, and democracy flourished.<p>
Today, Chile is the best-managed country in the Western Hemisphere, bar none. That's because it did all of the things you or I would do if we were running an economy: It began privatizing industry, creating incentives, eliminating tariffs, making its currency freely convertible, and playing to its economic strengths by focusing on its comparative advantages. All these measures have taken time to pay off, but today, Chile's currency is the only one in the Western Hemisphere that rises against the U.S. dollar.<p>
Consider this: In 1975, Chile, with a population of ten million, was bankrupt -- just like Cuba, a nation of approximately the same size. Cuba is still a mess, but Chile is now brimming with financial health. These days, any Latin-American politician who isn't seeking to emulate Chile is likely to have a brief career. You don't see too many people pointing to Cuba as a model of anything -- except of what not to do.<p>
Latin-American economies depend predominantly on natural resources. Manufacturing plays only a small role -- and rightly so. Argentina wasted a lot of time trying to protect its inecient pharmaceutical industry -- a country of 35 million can't afford the cost of develop-ing research-intensive drugs. It finally realized it was better off leaving that job to <a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a> and focusing on exports of wine and other agricultural products. Soaring worldwide demand for commodities such as oil, cocoa, sugar, and copper should benefit Latin America greatly in the years ahead.<p>
Free-trade-zone groups and common markets are also developing, such as MERCOSUR, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and ANDEAN, which includes Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. There's even a movement afoot to make the entire Western Hemisphere a free-trade zone. The first meeting toward this end occurred in late 1994, and the goal is to complete the task by 2005.<p>
Latin America won't be a smooth upward ride. I have money invested in Argentina, but the country valued its currency too high too soon. I am expecting a devaluation that will hurt my investment, but I'll just ride it out.<p>
Latin America knows what it wants, however, and its citizens won't put up with the balderdash to which they were subjected in decades past. Too many of them have been to Miami and seen what democracy and prosperity can do.<p>
I also like Latin America because it has a tradition of raising capital and using it to make more capital. And it is ahead of Africa -- another emerging continent -- when it comes to infrastructure and the collective wisdom of how prosperity is created.<p>
Which countries should you consider investing in?<p>
If you're the type for a tightly run ship, then head for Chile. Ecuador has vast oil reserves and agricultural possibilities, but its commitment and currency don't seem as strong as they might be. Drug money still corrupts Colombia, but if drugs are ever legalized, it certainly would be the best place in Latin America to invest.<p>
While much remains to be done in Argentina to overcome decades of mismanagement, the country has an industrial sector and a vibrant agricultural base, which exports many products. It may be able to tap oil in the South Atlantic. I worry about its 1997 congressional elections, though, which pose a political risk to what would otherwise be a bright investment situation.<p>
For a real chance at a financial moon shot, Venezuela is probably the place to go. Venezuela is at the bottom now -- a total economic mess. But it has an impatient and wizened populace, which means its assets won't get much cheaper. This resource-rich nation should also prosper greatly as commodities prices continue to rise.<p>
Peru was in similarly dire economic straits five years ago. The fanatic Maoist Shining Path was at war with the government of President Alberto Fujimori, which appeared to be in danger of collapsing. In 1992, the leader of the terrorists was finally caught and jailed. Fujimori set in place tax and tariff reforms, privatized 51 state-owned industries to bring in $3.6 billion, and brought down hyperinflation. Still, as is usual in these situations, a post-reform recession set in. Class warfare might well have resulted. Fujimori boldly ignored political pressure to relent and stayed the course of his reforms.<p>
By 1994, barely two years later, Peru had achieved the highest economic growth rate in the world -- 12.9 percent. In those same two years, the number of Peruvians living in poverty declined from 53.6 percent of the population to 45.8 percent -- a drop no welfare state has ever been able to achieve. This June, the government plans to enlarge its "citizen-participation program" to offer more shares of Telefonicas del Peru on favorable terms to lower-income Peruvians. A total of 18,500 people have taken part in the program, and the government's goal is to sell half a million Peruvians shares in its own telephone system by the year 2000. Peru's story offers persuasive evidence of the power of free-market reforms. Its story is as remarkable as Chile's.<p>
Brazil, which always has been and always will be the next great country in the world, has finally stopped printing money. No kidding. These are the folks who invented indexing to compensate for inflation rates of hundreds and thousands of percent a year. Yet today, Brazil's currency is reasonably stable against the dollar -- a situation that underscores just how powerful the changes taking place in this region have been.<p>
Any analysis of Brazil, though, must take into account the likelihood of its splitting into two parts over the next several decades: the industrial, Europeanized south, and the lackadaisical, laid-back north. At some point, the south will tire of supporting the north.Brazil is still the largest and most populated country in Latin America. While it has a huge gross domestic product of $890 billion, its per capita income of $5,600 ranks among the lowest in the region.<p>
Will Brazil continue to accept economic reform? It has privatized many state industries and loosened restrictions on direct foreign investment to boost long-term investment. The Brazilian congress is currently debating the troublesome issues of taxes and social security.<p>
Costa Rica is often touted as a great place for Americans to honeymoon or retire, but keep in mind that it has gone bankrupt four times in its short history. This seems to be a country that always fouls itself up. El Salvador might be a better bet in Central America.Mexico is a special case. Every time our southern neighbor has gotten in financial trouble, the U.S. has bailed it out with a big wad of dough. Consequently, unlike Chile and Peru, but like the spoiled child of a rich parent, Mexico has never really had to learn its lesson. The $20 billion to $50 billion we recently put into Mexico (the U.S. government won't say exactly how much it was, so I suspect it's closer to $50 billion) was supposed to rescue the Mexican economy. Instead, it subsidized Mexican interest rates, which bought votes for the ruling party, the PRI.<p>
If Mexico ever truly went bankrupt -- a position from which honest and sober reform might be possible -- I might consider investing in it. From such a base, Mexico could become an economic powerhouse. Mexico's strengths include abundant oil, a huge market of 95 million consumers, a developed agricultural industry, a brisk tourist trade, a large labor pool, and a friendly neighbor with a gargantuan consumer appetite.<p>
The world's major exchanges now recognize the importance of Latin America. In addition to Brady bonds, the principal of which is guaranteed by U.S. Treasury bonds, new instruments in Chicago and New York allow investors to take a position in the currencies and indexes of Latin America. In addition, many Latin-American stocks are now trading in New York. Latin-American mutual funds from U.S. fund families are an option, but pay careful attention to the fund manager's background and experience. You might end up with someone who, five years ago, couldn't have told you where Uruguay was.Latin-American countries are nowhere near their full potential. The alert investor should find many opportunities to hit home runs while our own economy is lucky to bunt out singles.<p>

						The deficit doesn't matter-- unless you want economic growth, lower taxes, and national security <p>
By Jim Rogers<p>
Quit worrying about balancing the federal budget, I'm often told. Avoiding deficits is no prescription for prosperity.<p>
Economist Walter Russell Mead has said so more than once in the pages of this magazine. In the April issue, he wrote that when it comes to deficits the U.S. "ranks at the top of the class among developed countries. As a percentage of [gross domestic product], our estimated budget deficit [2.3 percent] is lower than Japan's, Germany's, France's, and the United Kingdom's." He added that "talk about the budget deficit is to American politics what sand is to the proverbial ostrich: a comforting darkness into which one can plunge when the perils and pressures of the real world become too much to face."<p>
Frederick C. Thayer, professor emeritus of public and international affairs at the University of Pittsburgh, goes a step further: Reducing the national debt is actually a dangerous idea. Each of the six major U.S. depressions, he notes, occurred either during or after a period of government austerity. This includes the years from 1817 to 1821, when the national debt fell 29 percent; the years from 1823 to 1836, when the debt fell 99.7 percent (to $38,000); and the years from 1920 to 1930, when the debt fell 36 percent. The last of these, of course, produced the worst calamity of all: the Great Depression, which began in August 1929.<p>
Thayer also notes that during World War II federal budget deficits ranged from 20 percent to 31 percent of the economy's total output as measured by the gross domestic product. He concludes that there is simply no evidence that government penny-pinching helps sustain national prosperity. <p>
Guess what. I disagree.<p>
Before you shake your head and say, "So what else is new, Jim?" consider the possibility that these deficit apologists may be missing some critical points. Mead is wrong to compare the U.S. with nations that don't play the same part in the global economy as we do. Thayer errs in failing to recognize how much the role of our economy has changed.<p>
Throughout much of its history, the U.S. was a second-tier player in the world economy--like Canada is now. These days, though, we're first among the first-tier players. We're the only world superpower. Superpower status changes everything. It means that we are the nation that has issued most of the world's trading and reserve currencies, the store of value that other nations hold to back their own currencies. In fact, in 1994, 57 percent of the world's currency reserves (not including the U.S.'s) was held in dollars. <p>
This doesn't mean that Germany has a huge vault somewhere full of stacks of U.S. money. It means that the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, owns tens of billions of dollars of our Treasury's securities. The Bundesbank pays a great deal of attention to the interest it gets on these securities, especially in relationship to the value of the dollar. After all, a falling dollar could negate the interest the German bank earns--or even cause it to lose money. Given this risk, the Germans must constantly ask themselves if they shouldn't sell off their U.S. holdings and buy from, say, the Swiss or the Japanese, each of whom have safer and historically stronger currencies.<p>
All told, foreign central banks now own about $550 billion in Treasury securities--nearly $165 billion more than the U.S. Federal Reserve itself. The foreign holdings equal about 11 percent of the U.S. national debt; the Bank of Japan alone probably owns around 40 percent of that total.<p>
All of these dollars--or dollar equivalents--out there mean that we have become very dependent on the judgment of foreign investors. If these folks decide, for any reason, that dollars aren't a good thing to own anymore, we'll be in so much trouble that even the deficit apologists will be wishing they were ostriches, with their heads buried deep in the sand.<p>
The foreign creditors who buy our debt are savvy, tough-minded folks. They are not playing with mad money; they want to see real returns on their investments. So they watch us very carefully to see if we're keeping our financial house in order. They continually ask themselves: Can we bank on the U.S.?<p>
The answer has obviously remained yes. But the foreigners also have some reasons for feeling edgy--the biggest reason being what has happened to the U.S. debt during the past 25 years.<p>
The national debt has risen almost 13 times over since 1970, from $381 billion to $4.9 trillion (in current dollars). In 1970, we paid only $14.4 billion in interest to service this debt, but in 1995, we paid $232.2 billion, more than 16 times as much. Consumer prices, meanwhile, rose by a factor of 3.93 from 1970 to 1995.<p>
In 1970, 16 percent of our personalincome-tax revenue went to pay the interest on this national mortgage; by 1995, the figure was 40 percent and rising.<p>
What we don't seem to understand as a nation is that even if the annual deficit goes down it's still a deficit--and we're not making a dent in the total debt. We still have to pay more interest year after year.<p>
For most of us, such huge numbers are meaningless--whether the figure is $50 billion or $500 billion. Here's another way of looking at it: Since there are 264 million of us, the cost of paying the interest on the national debt comes to $880 per person. That's $3,520 annually for a family of four. Back in 1970, a family of four had to pay just $284 on the national interest bill. So the bill has risen by a factor of more than 12, nearly twice the rate of growth in the gross domestic product. This disparity will only increase.<p>
Life is already tight. Real wages are stagnating. Can we afford to keep paying more and more each year for the interest on the debt?Some economists maintain that national budgets are qualitatively different from household budgets, that nations don't obey the same rules. After all, no household is allowed to print its own money to pay bills.<p>
On the other hand, if we print too much money--and increase the total supply of dollars--the sharpies at places like the Bundesbank will get very angry, knowing that we are undercutting the value of the dollars they hold.<p>
Keep in mind that it wasn't that long ago that England was the richest, most powerful country in the world. The pound sterling, respected everywhere, was the world's reserve currency and medium of exchange, just as the dollar is today. But the British made the same mistake we're making. They assumed that the world's confidence in the pound could never be shaken. By 1976, the United Kingdom was so awash in inflation that it couldn't find buyers for its long-term government bonds. <p>
What is the overall cost we could pay for our deficit spending?<p>
HIGHER TAXES. As long as we rack up deficits, the government will have to keep raising taxes to pay for the interest on the debt.<p>
HIGHER INFLATION. When politicians become afraid that another tax increase will get them tossed out of office, they'll try printing money to pay off the debt. This adds to inflation.<p>
CREDIT SHORTAGES. In Sweden and Italy--countries with big budget deficits--the government so crowds out other borrowers that businesspeople have difficulty obtaining credit. <p>
RISING INTEREST RATES. As our currency becomes unattractive, the government will have to raise the interest rates it pays to lure buyers for its bonds. Since the government is the most creditworthy borrower, everyone else will be forced to pay yet higher rates.<p>
LESS INVESTMENT IN PRODUCTION. Where would you rather put your money: in a solid currency such as the Swiss franc or in a business that has to wrestle with inflation, higher taxes, high interest rates, and capital shortages? <p>
A LOWER STANDARD OF LIVING. That long slide we've all felt over the past 25 years is traceable directly to the deficit. Since 1985, real per capita economic growth in the United States has lagged behind that of the other industrial nations by more than 43 percent, according to Bankruptcy 1995, a book by Harry Figgie.<p>
Pogo had it right: We have met the enemy, and he is us.<p>
This country had quite a ride in the 1950s and 1960s, when the economy boomed thanks to an unusual confluence of good fortune: cheap raw materials, cheap government, technological advancement, a non-litigious atmosphere, an utter absence of foreign competition (ours was the only major economy that hadn't been ravaged by World War II), and a naive willingness to pollute our air and water. We were rich, and we were prosperous. And we thought the economic growth we were achieving could go on forever.<p>
When things began to slow down in the 1970s, as they inevitably had to, we refused to face reality. Instead, we decided to try to jolt the economy back to its "natural" growth rate by borrowing money. We let the monkey climb onto our backs, and as long as we keep feeding him more bananas, the load will get heavier and heavier.<p>
The sad truth is that throughout history no superpower that has gotten so deeply into such a hole has ever worked itself out. Without a crisis, it's too easy for politicians to put off the day of reckoning year after year. But sooner or later, the market requires such profligates to bite the bullet; one day it decides, in its collective fashion, that it would rather own Swiss francs or German marks. It won't be fun for the U.S. when that happens.<p>

						Africa may appear foreboding and mysterious to most Westerners. But it's also a place to get rich.  <p>
By Jim Rogers  <p>
The paths to wealth in the 19th century were certainly romantic. To encourage economic development, places such as the United States and Argentina gave citizens and immigrants vast tracts of raw land -- in return for little more than a promise to develop this resource. Thousands took advantage of the opportunity, becoming the owners of tens of thousands of acres, which a few decades later came to be worth millions. It sounds exciting, fanciful, and aeons away from the cusp of the 21st century -- except that this sort of opportunity still exists today, found in the only emerging continent left: Africa.  <p>
 Last year, when I outlined some of the following thoughts about Africa in a speech in Washington, I was met with shouts of outrage. Several well-dressed government bureaucrats even left the audience in protest. If there's one lesson I've learned over the years, though, it's to ignore any investment advice from the U.S. government. <p>
 It's true that many people with business degrees still board planes for economic adventure in underdeveloped parts of the world. The Far East is a popular destination nowadays. And even the former Soviet Union, for all its uncertain prospects, gets a fair share of fortune hunters and carpetbaggers. Rarely, however, does anyone embark for Africa with the idea of getting rich. <p>
 This is so even though Mozambique, having suffered two decades of civil war, will virtually hand over one of its old Portuguese plantations to a pioneer willing to restore it and work the land. In Zambia, it's possible to obtain -- in return for expertise and a modest amount of capital -- 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres) of land so rich you don't have to fertilize it. (In some parts of Africa, you can just about sprinkle some seed and wait a few months for your crop to come up.)  <p>
 Africa also carries another enticement: its vast natural resources. Commodities have been in a bear market for 15 to 25 years, depending on which one you use as a yardstick. So they are overdue for a comeback. Sugar is now priced 85 percent below its 1974 peak of 66 cents a pound; gold is down 55 percent from its peak (1980); coffee is down 72 percent (1977); and cocoa is down 80 percent (1977). None of these severe drops accounts for the ravages of inflation. Currently, the prices of many natural resources scarcely cover the costs of production.  <p>
 It's hard to believe, but as late as the 1950s, Africa was a net exporter of natural resources and commodities, and had abalance-of-payments surplus. In 1957, though, Kwame Nkrumah "liberated" Ghana from colonial rule, becoming the first of Africa's many liberators -- all of whom embraced the statist religion of Communism/socialism. Three decades of mismanagement and strife followed.  <p>
 Like people all over the world, though, many of Africa's 800 million residents have become fed up with their wrecked economies and wretched standard of living. Increasingly, they have demanded free elections and free markets. As recently as 1989 there were only three democracies in Africa with open and free markets. Today, there are more than 30. Likewise, the new generation of African leaders knows that its people once governed themselves quite admirably. Consider Egypt, Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia.  <p>
 If Africa interests you as a place to invest, do a lot of reading, ask questions of your local embassies, and go there and look around. I invest in public markets, so I personally would start with the former English colonies, such as Zambia, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Botswana, Namibia, and Malawi, as these have a tradition of operating stock markets, whereas the former French colonies in Africa do not.  <p>
 Botswana, for instance, balances its budget each year and has had trade surpluses for the past 14 years. It has two years' worth of foreign-currency reserves in the bank. Contrast its finances with those of the United States, which hasn't balanced its budget since 1969, hasn't had a trade surplus since 1975, and has become, by far, the world's largest debtor nation.  <p>
 The best way to take full advantage of Africa, though, would be to go there and run your own farm or business. Examine your resistance to the idea for a moment, and you'll understand better why Africa is such a great buy. Don't forget: The chief characteristic of a bear market is that no one wants to buy at the bottom. Nevertheless, by the time you've built a decent house, whipped your land into shape, trained your labor force, set up communications and transportation links, and established markets for your goods, you'll be able to sell out -- if you still want to -- at the top of the coming commodities boom to some knucklehead who has more money than sense and wants to be an African land baron once it has become ultra-chic to do so.  <p>
 It doesn't take lots of capital. African labor is incredibly cheap, and once you have the land, you can borrow or sell equity in your business privately or on the emerging stock exchanges. A dollar goes 30 to 50 times further in Africa than it does here. <p>
 If, however, glorious adventure does not entice you, the next most advantageous way to invest in Africa is to open an account there and buy stock directly on the local exchanges. The third-best way to invest is to buy American depositary receipts on U.S.stock exchanges. The last and least favorable investment method is to buy one of the African funds that have started recently. <p>
 It's odd that people as adventuresome as we are supposed to be are not more interested in Africa. On my motorcycle trip through the continent from 1990 to 1991, from Tunis through the Sahara down to the Cape of Good Hope, I didn't see a single American backpacker. I did, however, run across many European, Japanese, and Australian travelers. The same is true for settlers coming into Africa: lots of other nationalities, but few Americans. <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a>s are scarce, but you'll see lots of Toyotas.  <p>
 Not that Africa will be without problems. The Conference of Berlin in 1884 -- when the European powers assembled to carve up Africa to suit themselves, paying little attention to the continent's historic, tribal, ethnic, religious, and linguistic configurations -- created artificial borders that will continue to be redrawn, sometimes violently.   <p>
 I cannot tell you precisely where to go. Much depends on your temperament and background, and part of the fun will be discovering what suits you. Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt have developed stockmarkets and more open economies, while oil-rich Libya and Algeria are still closed.  <p>
 A settler in Africa obviously should make an effort to find a locale free of coming political turmoil. If Nelson Mandela were 55 years old instead of 78, I would consider South Africa a superb place to live and invest. It has the best infrastructure on the continent, an educated labor force, many natural resources, and a long and fruitful history of capitalism. Personally, however, I am afraid that after Mandela is gone the struggles between South Africa's 11 official ethnic groups may lead to its being the next Zaire, not the next California.  <p>
 Less adventuresome settlers might consider Ghana, Namibia, the Ivory Coast, Tanzania, Zambia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Malawi.<p>
I wouldn't go to Nigeria, the country with the largest population in Africa, as it won't develop until after it divides into two or more countries. The same is true of Zaire, which could easily break into four parts.  <p>
 An example of what's occurring in this part of the world is Mozambique, which the World Bank classifies as the poorest country in the world. The ruling Frelimo party, which led the country to independence from Portugal in 1975 and declared itself Marxist two years later, ditched Marxism in 1990 and is now selling off significant chunks of the economy -- a ship-repair yard, copra and tea plantations, factories, breweries, and hotels -- and wooing foreign capitalists. Between 1989 and 1995 the government restructured (mainly through privatization) 547 formerly state-owned companies. Enron, the gas giant, has invested $700 million infacilities to export natural gas to neighboring South Africa. <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> moved in in a big way in 1994 and sold about 60 million cans of soft drinks in Maputo in its first year of operation.  <p>
 Ethiopia, meanwhile, may blaze the way for 21st-century governance, as its constitution provides that any of its nine member states may legally pull out of its union at any time and for any reason. Thus, the states must all get along; if the other eight treat one badly, it may well leave.  <p>
 Today, Eritrea is one of the most free markets in the world. To its credit, Eritrea's leaders have decided to rebuild its railroad system with purely domestic resources and have refreshingly stated that their goal is to become completely independent of foreign aid soon. Throughout my African travels I found that the wisest people understood that the only true beneficiaries of foreign aid to Africa have been well-connected apparat chiks, Western advisers, and Mercedes-Benz dealers (even if the country didn't have passable roads).  <p>
 Now, if you will indulge me, I'd like you to examine two countries, one in the closing decades of the 19th century, the other in the closing decades of the 20th. Both possess substantial natural resources, including fertile soils, regular rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits. But their economies have been devastated by political instability, huge debts, government mismanagement,the corruption of state officials, civil war, and difficult relations with neighbors. During these unruly decades the leaders of both countries have been periodically assassinated.  <p>
 Agriculture is the most important sector of the two nations' economies, employing over 80 percent of the workforce of each. But each government has recently acted to rehabilitate and stabilize its economy by undertaking currency reform and raising producer prices on exports. In the past few years, both economies have turned in solid performances based on continued investments in the rehabilitation of their infrastructures, improved incentives for production and exports, and gradually improved domestic security. The rest of the world, however, still sees both countries as rude and barbaric.  <p>
 If at the end of the 19th century you'd emigrated to the first, you'd have come to the United States, where you had a chance to make a tremendous fortune, as did a tidal wave of immigrants.<p>
If today you emigrated to the second, you would be investing in Uganda. This African nation is supposed to be the worst ofthe worst, the former fiefdom of the blood-drenched cannibal Idi Amin. But it is now a beacon of capitalism.  <p>
 Since Idi Amin left in 1979, Uganda's exports have increased hundreds of times despite the horrible bear market in commodities during this period. This leap is just the beginning of the story. <p>

						Like it or not, we're all currency traders, and these days the dollar looks like a bad bet<p>
By Jim Rogers<p>
A hundred and fifty years ago banks, as well as governments, printed money that could be traded and used for payment of debts. Even 70 years ago anything could be, and was, used as money__gold, silver, grains, gems. But in the 1930s, the United States and the United Kingdom made it a crime to settle debts with anything other than the dollar and the pound sterling, respectively. Today, it's practically a definition of a sovereign nation that its government controls a single national currency.<p>
This may seem academic, but only because most people don't realize they trade currencies every day. When we buy a Swatch watch, a <a name="NYSE:SNE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41885"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sony</b></a> Walkman, or a Mercedes-Benz, we're swapping dollars for Swiss francs, Japanese yen, and German marks. The more valuable the dollar is against these currencies, the fewer dollars the watch, the gadget, or the car will cost.<p>
Unfortunately for all of us currency traders, since 1966 the dollar has declined about 64 percent against the mark, 72 percent against the yen, and 73 percent against the Swiss franc. <p>
During that time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 1000 to about 5000. American investors note with pride that $1,000 invested in the Dow 30 years ago would today be worth, with the dividends reinvested, $18,494. But $1,000 placed in a German savings account, with interest reinvested, would be $17,467 now__about the same, but at far less risk. And if you'd bought the German equivalent of the Dow Jones stocks, you'd have $41,637, mainly because of the currency difference.<p>
Currency fluctuations, then, affect our daily lives and hopes for the future. Over time, a strong currency helps us live decent lives, while a weak one makes that harder to achieve.<p>
So, if a falling currency is such a terrible thing, why do countries allow it to occur? The political rationale in the U.S., regardless of party, is that a falling dollar makes our exports cheaper, increasing foreign sales, improving our balance of payments, and creating jobs. That has sometimes worked, but only in the short term. In the long run, a falling dollar encourages investors, central bankers, global businesses, and currency traders to sell dollars and dollar-denominated assets and invest in more-stable currencies. This reduces investment in the U.S. and causes the dollar to keep falling.Before investing in a foreign currency or country, an investor should look at four indicators about a particular nation: (1) its balance-of-trade figures, that is, its net exports; (2) its national savings rate; (3) the surplus or deficit of government spending; and (4) its net foreign-currency reserves.<p>
The balance of trade signals whether a country is selling more than it's buying__as well as what it's buying__which over time is as important as whether a household spends less than it takes in. The savings rate will tell you if money is available for investment, which keeps an economy strong. As for the surplus or deficit, a government, depending on how prudent or profligate it is, can stabilize or ruin an economy. Finally, foreign-currency reserves indicate if a country can weather a financial storm. For example, Mexico, with small reserves, has seen its economy repeatedly implode when the government couldn't pay its debt or support the peso, causing investors to take flight.<p>
I used these same indicators in order to produce an A-list for global currency investors.<p>
SwitzerlandThe Swiss learned early that if they wanted to run the world's bank accounts, they needed a sound currency. Eighty percent of the Swiss franc is backed by gold, and it's also cushioned by a huge foreign-currency reserve. Moreover, if Europe adopts a single currency, the Euro, in 1999, as scheduled, the Swiss aren't likely to convert their franc. This could create a European flight to the franc as the last stable currency, driving up its value. Indeed, the Swiss franc recently hit a nine-year high against the deutsche mark. For sheer safety, the Swiss franc beats all other currencies hands down.<p>
GermanyThe deutsche mark also ranks high on the list. Twice in this century the Germans have experienced the terror of hyperinflation. The wheelbarrows of cash it took to buy bread, the hourly adjustment of restaurant prices, and the murderous politics that inflation helped produce are burned into the German collective memory. As a result, the Bundesbank's mandate is simple: Maintain the value of the D-mark.<p>
Sadly, in 1990, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, approaching an election, bought East German votes by exchanging one West German mark for every two East German marks, while the black-market rate__the best barometer of currency values__was eight to one. Pumping billions of marks into the economy has increased inflationary pressure. This bears monitoring, especially since Kohl has begun to appoint "easy money" types to the traditionally tightfisted board of the Bundesbank.<p>
The German government is also pushing for the establishment of the Euro in 1999. Prosperous Germans are worried that swapping D-marks for Euros could mean a loss of value, and German newspapers warn their readers not to invest in bonds with maturities longer than four years. <p>
Denmark, the Netherlands, and Austria have all linked the value of their currencies to the D-mark. As a result, they are relatively stable, comparing quite favorably to the rest of the world's currencies.<p>
FranceFrance has also tied its currency to the D-mark. Fifteen years ago, it declared it would support the franc fort, much as Germany supports a strong mark. But its success has been mixed, and French politicians must cut expensive social programs and a bloated civil service to make the economy more competitive. The fate of these planned cuts is in doubt, as is the future of the franc. <p>
LuxembourgTiny Luxembourg, with only 400,000 citizens, has the lowest debt in Europe__only 7 percent of its GDP, compared with 65 percent in the U.S. <p>
SingaporeSingapore has the world's highest savings rate at 40 percent (the U.S. rate is 4 percent), a booming high-tech, high-wage economy, and an authoritarian government that forces everyone to contribute to his or her own retirement fund. <p>
New ZealandSeveral years ago, New Zealand, racked by devaluation, government debt, and over-regulation, made a contract with its central bank to keep inflation under 2 percent no matter what. After a bout of unemployment and a recession, the bitter medicine has worked; the N.Z. dollar is now solid and well respected, and the economy is productive. It's an election year, however, a good time to see if the country will stay the course.<p>
JapanFor decades the Japanese yen has gone from strength to strength, as has the economy and trade balance. The savings rate is consistently high. But the party that has governed Japan since World War II is fracturing, and various politicians and factions are vying for power and votes, which they may try to influence by using government spending to boost the stagnant economy. <p>
There's also a demographic risk. Japan is experiencing a massive wave of retirements, but its birthrate has been too low to provide enough new workers to support the elders' retirement benefits. In addition, Japanese society has never welcomed immigrants. These factors will create a huge strain on the Japanese economy and may affect the value of the yen in the next decade.<p>
IrelandSome countries are comers whose currencies may well appreciate considerably over the next few years__just as the yen, D-mark, and N.Z. dollar have over the past decade.<p>
Ireland is such a nation, even though debt is 91 percent of GDP. The savings rate is rising, as is foreign investment, and it has one of the best-educated populations in Europe. Most important, there is a shaky peace in Northern Ireland. If the peace holds, the future of the Irish pound, or "punt," looks bright.<p>
ChileChile's peso, and its people, suffered through the 1970s. But the return to civilian rule and the privatization of the social-security system in the 1980s have sent savings and investment rates skyrocketing. Consequently, productivity has improved and the peso rose more than 5 percent in 1995.<p>
TaiwanThe Taiwan dollar is, statistically, solid as a rock. Taiwan holds $100 billion in net foreign-currency reserves, the economy is vibrant, and it's the richest nation in the world on a per capita basis. However, there is a huge political risk: China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, and whose rhetoric and behavior have grown increasingly aggressive. <p>
MalaysiaOne of the Southeast Asian Tigers, Malaysia is blessed with natural resources (oil, timber, rubber, palm oil) and has a strong agriculture sector, a growing manufacturing base, and an authoritarian government committed to conservative monetary policies. <p>
To end where I began, the Swiss franc seems to be the best bet over the next 20 to 40 years. I expect most currencies to decline against it.Of course, many people believe that Swiss banks won't take their money unless they are fabulously rich or have been properly introduced. Well, as "the Indiana Jones of finance" (Time magazine's phrase), I'm here to tell you that few international investments are as easy to make as buying Swiss francs.<p>
Instead of skiing in Vail this year, try the Swiss Alps. Walk into a Swiss bank with proper ID (your passport) and a check in dollars. You'll find the Swiss banker as eager to open an account as a NationsBank officer in Nashville is. <p>
Or try the beaches of New Zealand. Just remember, anyone who wants to create, preserve, or pass on wealth needs to learn about the world's sound currencies, particularly as the greenback becomes less and less of one.<p>

						Reports of inflation's demise are highly exaggerated:  It's alive and flourishing in many world commodity markets  <p>
By Jim Rogers  <p>
Have you been paying attention to the price of grain lately? Or the crop forecasts for 1996? I have even though I live in Manhattan and have no plans to take up sod busting. I pay attention to commodities because it's my conviction that the average farmer has a better handle on what's going on in our economy today than anyone in Washington or on Wall Street.  <p>
 This is especially true when it comes to inflation. The big-city experts, with their fancy computers and econometric models, tell us inflation is no longer a serious threat to our economy. They, Investing Strategiesvesting, Eattribute this critical change in the financial environment to several factors, including the Federal Reserve Board's cautious control of the number of dollars in circulation, ongoing improvements in corporate productivity, and, perhaps most important, the globalization of the world's economies.  <p>
 In a paper entitled "The End of the Inflationary Era," Roger Bootle, an economist at the securities firm HSBC Greenwell, recently wrote that U.S. workers can no longer demand higher wages (and therefore drive up prices), because they risk losing their jobs to less selfish folks in foreign lands. Similarly, U.S. companies can no longer pass on aggressive price increases, because they also risk losing out to foreign competition.   <p>
 Though I have become an increasingly lonely voice on this subject, I don't believe that inflation is dead. In fact, I think it will become a serious problem in the next few years.  <p>
 Why? Partly because the threat of foreign competition is overstated at least when it comes to the supply of goods and materials. Truth is, the developed world's imports from emerging economies aren't much higher now, as a percentage of gross domestic product, than they were in the late 1980s. Foreign workers and foreign companies simply aren't in a position to supply enough goods to function as an effective check against inflation.  <p>
 Then again, foreign consumers may indeed stand ready to give us some competition on the buying side. That would mean a world wide sellers' market. And we all know what happens to prices in a sellers' market: They go up.  <p>
 The message I see coming out of the grain belt affirms this view. Commodity prices are near a five-and-a-half-year high, and are more than 20 percent above where they were in 1993. Corn futures recently hit a 7-year high; wheat prices are higher than they have been in 15 years.  <p>
 Despite cheap labor and the mechanization of giant farms out west, the inventories of corn, rice, wheat, barley, oats, and soybeans are all at their lowest levels in recorded history.This has happened even though the last five annual crops have been among the largest ever. Throughout 1995, the stocks-to-usage ratio for grains was about half its historic level.  <p>
 Why are grain supplies so low? I suspect it's because the new economies of the Pacific Rim, impoverished for so long, can now afford grain, and they're buying it in record quantities. Back in the 1972-to-1973 season, Asians imported 39 million tons of grain. In the 1986-to-1987 season, sales grew to 64 million tons. This year, Asian buying is up to 80 million tons.  <p>
 Russia also may soon come on board as a major purchaser. The Russian infrastructure is falling apart, crippling production. The Russian grain harvest this year is the worst in a long time; it will probably have to import commodities, rather than export them, as it has done in recent years.  <p>
 While grains directly account for a small portion of consumer prices in the U.S., compared with other countries, their indirect effect is much greater. The situation today, in fact, is eerily similar to that of the 1970s, when there were shortages of virtually every major commodity. Many of today's commentators are under the impression that the oil shock caused the spiraling inflation of that period. But get out your chart books. You'll see that the prices of corn, wheat, and other grains rose first, followed by other commodities. Oil was actually the last to take off in price after corn prices had already tripled.  <p>
 Today, supplies of zinc, cotton, and oil, as well as grains, are again near all-time lows. Take cotton prices, which not long ago were the highest they have been since the War Between the States. V.F. Corp., the undergarment manufacturer, recently tooka hit in profits because it didn't, or couldn't, pass on the price of raw material to its customers. To V.F., that's real inflation, and the price of the stock dropped because of it.  <p>
 Keep in mind, too, that new production requires time to establish often years and years. Suppose zinc is in short supply. It takes a while for people to (a) realize that zinc is becoming profitable,(b) find a new supply of zinc, (c) raise the money to open a zinc mine, and (d) bring the zinc on stream.   <p>
 Bottlenecks in supply will occur in the 1990s because major investment flows haven't been directed toward the production of raw materials over the past 15 years. That is, investors have not been putting new money into investments such as zinc mines, sugar plantations, and corn farms. Instead, they've been putting their money into the stock market. Yet as the demand for basic commodities has grown, the relative supply has tightened.  <p>
 Suppose each of the two billion people of China and India starts consuming a mere extra quart of gasoline per week as these economies boom. That's an additional 1.7 million barrels a day enough toraise the world price by 10 to 15 percent.   <p>
 Increases in the price of basic goods are also the true source of upward pressure on wages. When the necessities of life become more expensive, workers ask for higher pay launching the vicious cycle in which demands for higher wages prompt companies to raise prices, which in turn causes further pressure on wages.   <p>
 The dollar's chronic weakness could also add to the inflationary pressures on our economy. Not only do luxury items such as French wines and Mercedeses rise in price as the dollar sinks in value,  but so do the prices of <a name="NASD:TOYOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41889"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toyotas</b></a> and Nissans, and ultimately Chevys and <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fords</b></a> as U.S. automakers take advantage of reduced price competition.  <p>
 Other forces are at work, too. In the early 1990s, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, created a large new supply of dollars to save the American banking system and to reelect George Bush. He succeeded in his first goal but failed in the second.  <p>
 Now Greenspan has cut back a bit. Still, economists such as Milton Friedman note that it takes a few years for liquidity to flow through the system. Like a pig in a python, a surge of liquidity is working its way to the surface and will contribute to the inflation of 1996 or 1997.  <p>
 While Greenspan was acting to boost the supply of money in the U.S., the so-called tight-money Germans created a huge new supply of deutsche marks. To buy votes when the two Germanys merged, the West Germans created four times more marks than were economically justified to convert the East German mark into the West German. <p>
 Not to be outdone, the Japanese banking authorities topped off the bubble economy of the 1980s with hundreds of billions of extra yen. Lately they have again been pumping enormous liquidity into the world's markets. Thus, the three largest economies on the planet, the three that jointly constitute the world's reserve currencies, created a vast new pool of money.  <p>
 "The world is enjoying a situation of significant liquidity creation," Henry Kaufman, the economist, recently told Barron's. "This liquidity explosion is not generating price rises in goods markets, or wage increases, as yet. But it is a powerful force behind price escalation in financial assets, which is another form of monetary reflation."  <p>
Thus, in the 1990s we have worldwide low production capacity, worldwide growth in demand, worldwide low inventories, and a worldwide surge in liquidity. To anyone trained in global economic patterns, this mixture can have only one outcome.  <p>
 How might an alert investor play a resurgence in inflation? <p>
 Start by noting that the world's largest grain producers are the U.S., Canada, Argentina, and Australia. Note also that India, Indonesia, and Russia are the largest importers.   <p>
 Investors obviously can buy futures and options in the agriculture markets. Another course might involve purchasing the common shares of well-run seed, farm-machinery, fertilizer, and other companies in raw material areas. I believe these will be good bets over the next few years.  <p>
 A still more aggressive strategy would be to acquire shares in international farming companies on local stock exchanges in places such as Malaysia and New Zealand or the currencies of the major grain-producing countries. Farmland in Iowa or Latin America may be another smart option.   <p>
 Most of these strategies require professional help, as well as a close eye on the weather, since too little or too much rain can ruin a nation's farm crop.  <p>
 Forewarned is forearmed. The wise investor will look behind today's headlines and expect the unexpected in this case, there turn of inflation.  <p>

						By Jim Rogers<p>
If the 19th century belonged to Britain, and the 20th century to the United States, then the 21st century will surely belong to China. My advice: Make sure your kids learn Chinese.  <p>
I realize this view runs counter to certain popular perceptions. My column isn't called The Other Side for nothing.  <p>
 China certainly does have a long list of problems. It is run by a dictatorship--a hopelessly incompetent and corrupt one at that. Its trade barriers make a mockery of free trade, its labor is cheap and untrained, and it doesn't have the money to buy much of what we capitalists sell. The central-banking system is weak. Inflation is soaring.   <p>
 China is big, but the bulk of its populace lives in the crowded east; the west is mainly a vast desert. The Chinese lack both adequate natural resources and capital. The country's best and brightest have fled during a 100-year brain drain. The remaining Chinese, with an annual per capita income of $361, have a commercial tradition that consists of 46 years of communist rule and, before that, centuries of whimsical leadership by quaint emperors. This is the civilization that invented gunpowder and gave the world the compass, yet it left it to the West to make constructiveuse of these inventions.  <p>
 To top it all off, the Chinese save a third of their income. How can a country grow into a solid capitalist economy if its consumers are so goofy? Shouldn't they spend what they earn, as we do?  <p>
 Against this backdrop of backwardness, though, let's review some of the things that China has going for it. First, the obvious. China's population numbers 1.2 billion--a fifth of the world'sinhabitants living in a landmass the size of the continental United States. China is not only big but booming. Its gross national product has risen by more than 11 percent annually for the last several years, placing it among the world's fastest growing economies.  <p>
 The tens of millions of prosperous overseas Chinese are by no means a liability, but rather a tremendous asset. Not only do most still consider themselves Chinese, but they're also still considered Chinese by China. If they ask for one, they get a Chinese passport--even the fifth-generation emigrant in a Beverly Hills high school who has never even seen a chopstick. The overseas Chinese, with their immense capital and Western expertise, are generally enthusiastic about contributing to China's development--they recognize the  potential for profit.   <p>
 Then there's what the Chinese call "the Asian way," which is rooted in Confucian principles, but which also has a lot to do with plain old common sense. The Asian way involves strict discipline: Everybody in the family works hard and takes care of one another. The code also values frugal living and saving, so the Chinese save and invest 30 to 35 percent of their income.   <p>
 Can you imagine what that can do for capital formation and for a society's ability to compete internationally? Here in the U.S., we save about 4 percent of income, and instead of having a private pension program that invests in our country's future, as does high-growth Chile, we have Social Security, which is a Ponzi scheme and a joke.  <p>
 According to the Asian way, commonsense virtues lead to riches, and riches lead to freedom--which is pretty much the same thing Plato meant when he said that countries go from oligopoly to democracy. Consider this: Taiwan had a wretched military dictatorship for years, but now it has the largest net foreign-currency reserves per capita in the world and is becoming democratic. South Korea has followed the same path.  <p>
 Let's also not forget that China is a big, big market, one attracting tens of billions in foreign investment. To build a strong economy, it helps to have a large home base. In the U.S. we depended on our domestic market for over a century of high growth. In Europe, achieving the equivalent of a large home market was the major point behind the Common Market. The underlying thrust of NAFTA was to expand our own market, preparing North America for the 21st century. But the world's biggest single market is China, and hard by it, Asia itself, with 60 percent of the world's population. <p>
 The Chinese government still calls itself communist, but it started its own deregulation 17 years ago. It's continuing to give its commercial sector the structure it needs to grow and compete internationally. In early 1994, China reformed its trade, foreign exchange, and tax systems. Last year, it announced a series of important changes in its economic legal system, strengthening commercial, central-banking, insurance, and securities law.  <p>
 Unfettered by the central government's nutty notions and restrictions,the Chinese are good business people. Back in the 1970s, China imported cotton. In the 1980s, the government deregulated agriculture, and within a few years China was exporting cotton.  <p>
 Here in the West, it's hard to conceive just how big the Chinese market is. A current goal of the Chinese government is that each resident receive one more egg every four days. The extra chickens required to achieve this goal will annually consume the equivalent of the entire grain crop of Australia, itself one of the world's largest grain-producing countries. China is also planning to add the equivalent of an entire Baby Bell's worth of telephone lines every year. As China grows, its demand for goods and services will significantly increase.  <p>
 Now stand back for a minute and take a panoramic view of the economic map of Asia. Do you see what I see?  <p>
 Consider: China has abundant labor but lacks both capital and undeveloped natural resources. Japan, meanwhile, has all the capital in the world but no natural resources and little labor. North of China sits Siberia, brimming over with natural resources but without labor or capital. There's a potential partnershiphere: Japanese capital, Siberian natural resources, and Chinese labor.   <p>
 Pipe dream? I don't think so. On a recent motorcycle ride through Siberia, I saw Chinese workers operating Russian enterprises in Khabarovsk and Blagoveshchensk with the benefit of Japanese capital and management. As near as I can tell, this golden triangle could become the most productive and prosperous arrangement on the planet.  <p>
 Another thing: Like the Japanese but unlike the North American and European markets, the Chinese are virtually one ethnic group. The Han constitute 93 percent of the population. This means the potential for racial strife and other forms of conflict in China is low.   <p>
 Today there are about 2 billion people worldwide who can speak English and about 1.5 billion who can speak Chinese. Two hundred years ago there were only a few million people who spoke English, and it took many decades for our language to reach its present worldwide influence. The Chinese are starting from a far larger base. We can be sure that hundreds of millions more will speak Chinese by the year 2020, when China has the world's largest economy.  <p>
 One country the U.S. should be emulating is Australia. Today every Australian schoolchild must learn either Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or some other Asian language.  <p>
 On the other hand, just because China is going to be the major superpower of the 21st century doesn't mean a foreign investor can just throw money in China's direction and make a killing. In 1994, 50,000 foreign-funded investment vehicles were formed in China, bringing the total to 222,000. Nevertheless, 72 percent of China's people are rural farmers and workers with income saveraging $120 a year. For the time being, smart marketers are concentrating on establishing their future base by selling in large cities where incomes are higher and they can hope to sell typical consumer goods.   <p>
 For now, productivity levels in China are close to the worst in the world. New foreign enterprises expect to exploit cheap labor. Instead they find their labor budgets bursting because Chinese workers have so little training. Often employers have to import more managers for Chinese factories than they do in other developing countries.   <p>
 In the 1980s almost any foreign product would sell in China simply because it was foreign. Not today. The Chinese consumer now demands quality and won't stand for an exotic label that merely masks cast-off foreign goods. Companies that do their homework, however, that choose Chinese partners with great care and that come to know this market well, have been able to move to profitability within two years of start-up and to pay back their initial investment within five years. China's plans now call for $100 billion a year in equipment and technology imports, with up to a quarter of a trillion dollars to be spent--before the end of the century--on infrastructure.  <p>
 I'm often asked how to invest in China. Deng Xiaoping, China's preeminent leader from 1978 to 1993, the man who tripled its gross national product and transformed China, is near the end of his life. Not until succession is established will the situation become clear. With the wild inflation China now has (between15 and 20 percent a year), there could well be disorder and unrulinessin its markets after his death.  <p>
 I'm going to bide my time. When China's political and economic problems seem to have reached their lowest point, I'll want to step in and act. I'll buy overseas Chinese public companies who have set themselves up with mainland Chinese partners, companies that follow the Western tradition of keeping an honest set of books and sharing their profits with their stockholders. I'll try to find companies that are well-wired into the ruling establishment and that know how to maneuver in this very different land. You can find such companies all over the world, in places like Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and San Francisco. An example might be Hong Kong-based C.P. Pokphand, an overseas Chinese company that is now the largest single foreign investor in China.  <p>
 And then I'll hang on and probably never sell those stocks. Prime, well-run Chinese companies will be in my estate--and I plan to live a long time.  <p>
 Some Americans are afraid of Chinese military intentions. But is China truly belligerent? Even though 14 countries border China, in over 4,000 years of civilization it hasn't had a tradition of conquering other peoples. The Chinese have never invaded Indonesia; they've never needed to. Even 2,000 years ago they didn't invade Africa or take slaves; they traded with the Africans. Look at the record of other civilizations that attained as much power: Rome conquered, as did Persia, Spain, the Netherlands, England, and Portugal. Remember, the Chinese developed gun powder and horses, the super weapons of their day.  <p>
 Another reason China will tend to be peaceful is its one-child policy. No country in the world has ever had such a policy, and no one knows how this bold experiment will turn out. Nevertheless, I suspect that after two generations of Chinese couples having only one child--who will likely be spoiled and the only apple of the couple's eye--mamas and papas aren't going to send their precious darling to some God-forsaken foreign land to die for the greater glory of Chinese expansion. Such sacrifices will be made only when a couple has several precious darlings.  <p>
 It's been six years since either our president or vice president has visited Beijing, and neither the president nor the premier of China has been invited to Washington since 1988. Both sides are ignoring the deeper reality--that neither country can enjoy peace and prosperity without a constructive Chinese-American relationship.  <p>

						Gas prices are cheap now, but a desert storm may be brewing in the land of potentates and petroleum   <p>
By Jim Rogers  <p>
We're all in luck: the scholarly United Nations has just publishedWorld Economic and Social Survey 1995, a learned paper that confidently predicts that the supply of the world's most important commodity will meet demand precisely during the next 15 years and decline. We're talking, of course, about oil.   <p>
 If it comes to pass, the UN forecast is certainly welcome news for the West. We'll be able to buy gasoline at today's prices--cheaper than they were in the 1950s when adjusted for inflation--through the year 2010. We can continue snapping up Chevy Suburbans without going bankrupt at the pump. And we can put off fretting about things like alternative fuels and hand-pushed lawn mowers. So what if the U.S. imports 8 million barrels of oil a day out of the 20 million it consumes? The stuff is cheap--dirt cheap. <p>
 Before we celebrate, though, let's consider a place where much of the world's black syrup comes from. What about Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer? The size of the U.S. east of the Mississippi, Saudi Arabia sits on 25 percent of the world's proven oil reserves--260 billion barrels. Yet for all of its strategic importance, we haven't heard much about this mysterious place since the oil shocks of the early 1980s. What might happen to this critically important country if oil prices are flat or decline during the next 15 years?  <p>
 Back in 1981, it was as if the whole of Saudi Arabia--all 10 million of the nation's inhabitants--had won the lottery. The gross national product reached $16,010 per resident that year, up from $2,130 in 1973. Saudis began receiving unlimited free telephone service and free medical care. Water, electricity, gasoline (naturally), and domestic air fares were all subsidized by the government. Each Saudi prince got a minimum monthly allowance of $20,000, even as the number of princes swelled to 6,000. King Fahd bought scores of M-60 tanks, Patriot missiles, and F-15 fighters, C-130 transports, and AWACS planes.  <p>
 At the time, Western scholars proclaimed that a permanent shift in the world's wealth was underway. Oil would soar to $100 a barrel, and shortly we, who import half our oil, would be forced to drive vehicles the size of bumper cars. The take on Saudi Arabia: incredibly rich, incredibly stable (because the royal family was in complete charge), a huge ally of the United States (our most valuable ally in the Middle East), and soon to be our largest creditor.  <p>
 Winning the lottery isn't always a blessing. If you're a self-made entrepreneur who's put a business together brick by brick, friends and relatives don't necessarily assume they deserve a share of the spoils. But work a modest job, win $20 million in the lottery, and the world feels as though it's as entitled to your oysters as you are. After all, you didn't sweat for the money, did you?  <p>
 All of King Fahd's friends and family arrived with their handsout. The 6,000 princes (a bunch of whom were unemployed) had wives and children, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews. Could Fahd forget that King Faisal had been assassinated by a nephew in 1975? There was so much money it was easy to try to appease all of the demands for handouts--and for the past 12 years, Saudi Arabia has run a budget deficit trying to meet those demands. <p>
 Forgotten in the hysteria over hydrocarbon, however, were the laws of supply and demand. Westerners began to drive smaller cars, adjust their thermostats, and buy energy-efficient appliances and equipment. So the demand for oil slowed. Meanwhile, high prices triggered an exploration and drilling boom. So the supply increased. There was only one possible outcome: lower prices. <p>
 Now, 14 years later, the pressure on Saudi Arabia is severe. Per capita GNP is less than half of what it was in 1981. The budgets of the Ministries of Education and Health have been cut. The water shortage is a disaster in the making. According to Said K. Aburish's The Rise, Corruption and Coming Fall of the House of Saud, the kingdom's real international debt, including offbalance sheet items, now totals $60 billion. At the rate Saudi Arabia is sinking into the sand, that figure could rise to $100 billion by 1997. To my amazement, even the religiousulemas, long silent, have begun to protest the corrupt and profligate ways of the monarch and his huge and ever-growing family. They were particularly galled in 1987 when Fahd gave $300 million in spending money to his 14-year-old son.  <p>
 To service its debt, Saudi Arabia must now do what it and many other OPEC countries don't want to do--pump more oil at ever-declining prices, thereby creating more supply, which will yet again drive down prices. To keep their restless societies from exploding and to pay their international debts, these countries can't afford not to pump all the oil they can sell--and yet they can't afford to pump much more, either.   <p>
 We tend to think of Saudi Arabia's neighbors as the greatest threat to the kingdom's stability: Yemen, Bahrain, Iran, and Iraq. But it is really other Saudis who are most dangerous. From a safe base in London, Arabian dissidents hurl bricks at the regime they hate. Meanwhile, Islamic fundamentalists at home cannot forgive the king for embracing anything Western, be it rock music, <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a>, or the invasion of American troops onto sacred Saudi soil during the Gulf War. A third group, the enlightened, modern Muslims, are angry because they want a Western-style democracy. <p>
 King Fahd sits atop the world's largest family business. Yet it is a business in disarray--one that must now figure out how to divvy up a shrinking pie. The man himself is known to be terminally lazy--he sometimes doesn't look at urgent state papers for months on end--and he is widely recognized as a drunk, a womanizer, a gambler, and a man greedy for yet more billions.  <p>
 The most dangerous internal threats are probably the princes. Since the death of Fahd's father, Ibn Saud, in 1953, the kingdom has had  four of his sons as rulers. Now, doubtless bowing to internal pressure, the 73-year-old Fahd has declared that his successor need not be his 71-year-old half-brother; rather, the best prince should be chosen. The race is open, wide-open. And a wide-open race in Saudi Arabia may eventually come to mean that anything goes.  <p>
 In our Western shortsightedness, we think modern history is the 50-year story of the Cold War. That was an interesting, important struggle, but it's only a side show compared with the main conflict of the past 1,300 years--the one between Islam and Christianity. We forget that the world contains a billion Muslims who stretch from Morocco on the Atlantic Ocean to the Philippines in the Pacific. Christians number almost 1.9 billion. The two groups have been duking it out since the Middle Ages and will undoubtedly continue to do so for centuries more.  <p>
 Just as Christians are divided into Protestants and Catholics, Muslims are divided into Sunnis and Shi'ites. And just as Christians have slaughtered one another for centuries in the name of Christ, Muslims have slaughtered one another for centuries in the name of Muhammad. In 1902 when Ibn Saud took control of Riyadh, the capital, he burned 1,200 people to death and spiked the heads of other political and tribal enemies as a lesson to the populace.  <p>
 As it happens, 63 percent of Iraqis are Shi'ite and 95 percent of Iranians are Shi'ite. In Saudi Arabia the Sunnis are in the majority, with the Shi'ites constituting only 15 percent of the population. But curiously enough, the people who live in the Saudi oil regions are mostly Shi'ite. So the 2.5 million Saudis who have more than a passing allegiance to their brethren outside Saudi Arabia are concentrated in and around major oil fields. To King Fahd, a Sunni, and his horde of greedy princes, this is a disturbing thought.  <p>
 We think of Saudi Arabia as a place that has been around for a long time, one with an ancient national soul like Japan or Iran, but it is not. Look at world maps of a few decades ago and you'll see that there was no "Saudi Arabia," but rather an "Arabia Deserta." The Saudi, a family of tribes people, were bedouins as nomadic as Okies, with herds of camels, sheep, and goats. They were first among equals in this desert, the guys with the biggest swords and the largest herds.  <p>
 The chief of this tribe, Ibn Saud, Fahd's father, not only personally executed 18 rebellious tribal chiefs, but also chose his provincial governors for their fealty and their brutality. To tighten their grip on the kingdom, these governors executed 40,000 people and amputated the limbs of another 350,000--out of a population of 4 million.  <p>
 As was their wont, the English threw in their lot with the winners and positioned them to run the country. The House of Saud enjoys no real affection from Arabians. Ibn Saud and his sons simply grabbed off and held the country's oil wealth to do with as they saw fit. True, the Saudi kings have distributed largesse to their subjects and neighbors, but only because it has been politically prudent. If they hadn't been bought off, the wrath of their fellow bedouins might have blown down the Tent of Saud.  <p>
 So, here's the picture: Despite all that oil, the Saudis are running out of money. The Shi'ite minority shares little of the honey pot and is increasingly aggravated over the House of Saud's greedy royal scheme. As the noose tightens around their throats, the Shi'ites realize their Islamic birth right has been kept from them.   <p>
 What follows for the rest of us if Saudi Arabia collapses from a civil rebellion? We in the U.S. would have a big problem. We use 25 percent of all the oil produced in the world. When Saudi Arabia is in flames, can we send troops to the region around Mecca, Islam's holiest site? Very unlikely. Suppose Iran or Iraqjoins the fray? Fighting a war against Iran and Iraq will be a lot more difficult than was fighting Iraq over Kuwait on a limited front. A clever rebel will marry dissatisfaction over the corruption and high living of the extended royal family with the supposed desecration of holy sites, such as Mecca and Medina. These holy sites will make great cover for all kinds of mischief. The U.S. will never be easily able to send troops to defend the holy cities of Islam against outraged Muslims.  <p>
 In Bahrain, next door to Saudi Arabia, riots recently brokeout, and in Qatar, also next door, the government changed when a sheik overthrew his father. Both are oil-rich principalities. One rebellion might be a fluke, but two show a pattern: expectations were aroused when everybody in that part of the world floated on vast sums of money. Those vast sums have now dried up, and the oceans of money won't rise again until the current world order is so disrupted that oil shortages cause prices to soar. <p>
 I can't imagine that a Saudi Arabian revolution will be a smooth, bloodless takeover. Oil production will most likely fall in the process. Indeed, the oil fields might be a prime target during the struggle, as we saw in Kuwait. Imagine the domino effectat work in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia is under siege, mass confusion reigns in the Western democracies, and so Iran and Iraq hurriedly kiss and make up. (Clinton's policy of isolating them is already pushing them together.) So if Iran and Iraq can pull the new Saudi Arabia to their side, then Kuwait is going to fall, and so will the United Arab Emirates.  <p>
 This powerful new oil cartel could renounce its debts to the evil West, causing the price of oil to shoot through the roof. With billions of dollars in loans suddenly becoming nonproductive, our banking system will be thrown into a state of bedlam. Bank stocks will collapse, and nobody will know whether to buy oil stocks or to sell them. Automotive stocks worldwide will plummet. East and west, north and south, stock markets will close for days that stretch into weeks.  <p>
 I am not predicting that such a terrible series of events will come to pass; I am only pointing out just how much the U.S. and world economies ride on what happens within Saudi Arabia.   <p>
 So what will happen? I know what won't happen. The United Nations' prediction that the supply and the price of oil will be stable for the next 15 years will not come to pass. Historically, there are ups and downs in the financial markets, whether it's stocks or bonds or commodities. Except for the artificially rigged price of gold from 1935 to 1970, no commodity has ever been stable or bearish for 30 years.  <p>
 Bet on it: The price of oil will again be volatile. Something will happen to upset the world's delicate supply-and-demand balance.We, who are so dependent on imports for our oil, should be attentive to the ragged Tent of Saud, whose skirts are flapping dangerously in the first gusts of a harsh desert windstorm.  <p>

						How to drive a hard bargain in today's market of short, sweet auto leases<p>
By Roy Furchgott<p>
How can you tell if you're getting a good deal on your car lease? Compare two car leases currently offered on a pair of luxury sedans, the BMW 740i and the Jaguar XJ6, both of which were chosen as outstanding values by IntelliChoice, a Campbell, California, company that evaluates lease deals. Both leases run 36 months and charge $699 a month -- but the two don't cost the same. <p>
Because of differences in their structures, after 36 months the lease on the BMW would cost you $30,414, while the Jag's would cost only $27,358. And depending on the used-car market, you might be able to knock another $4,451 off the Jag's cost, making it a total of $7,507 less than the BMW, a 25 percent difference -- but we're getting ahead of ourselves. The bottom line is that a lot of factors determine the quality of a car lease. And the most visible ones may not be the most important.<p>
The first lesson for lessees: Don't focus on the monthly payment to determine if you're getting a good deal. That's what many marketers count on, but it's not the critical factor in the quality of the deal. The most important factor is the car's purchase price. Shop the price of the car as if you were buying -- the lower that cost, the lower your monthly payment.<p>
Look for cars that have dealer incentives. The car manufacturers make their money by moving cars off the lot, even at a low price. Sometimes they give dealers money that they can pass along to the consumer -- or keep. Older and less popular models are prime candidates for incentives, but dream machines aren't exempt. In our comparison, the Jaguar scores points because the manufacturer kicks in a $4,552 discount to the dealer, at least some of which is lopped off the car's price. Don't rely on the dealer to tell you about an incentive -- check Automotive News Weekly or the manufacturers' Web sites. If you want a more complete report, current incentives, or a detailed accounting of a specific model's cost and features, contact IntelliChoice (800-227-2665), which will prepare a Just-the-Facts Report for $14.95, or for $4.95 at its Web site (www. intellichoice.com). <p>
The flip side of a car's purchase price is its residual value. A car lease forecasts how much less your new car will be worth at the end of the lease. Most leases today are closed-end -- which means the lessee has the right to buy the car at a specified cost, set in writing when the lease begins. The Jaguar's residual value is set at $25,619. If the bottom falls out of the Jag market, and the car is worth less than that when you return it, it's tough luck for the dealer. On the other hand, if it's worth more, you can sell the car, pay off the residual, and keep the difference. <p>
That's what makes the Jag a potentially outstanding deal. IntelliChoice estimates that the used XJ6 will be worth $30,070 after 36 months, which is $4,451 more than the lease's estimate of $25,619. If you sell the car for $30,070 and pay the $25,619 to the dealer, you can keep the difference, which is equivalent to six lease payments.<p>
For an even better deal, ask Steve Landau, product manager for IntelliChoice, about the sport-utility-vehicle lease he signed two years ago. His 24-month lease on a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo costs $215 a month, and the residual price is $20,800. But Laredos like his bring more than $25,000 on the used-car market. If he buys the car at the end of the lease, then resells it, he may clear more than $4,000, equivalent to 18 months of payments -- almost his entire lease.<p>
So what are the new residual-value leaders? "Two years ago it would have been sport utilities, but pretty much that's not the case right now," says Art Spinella, vice president of CNW Research, which tracks lease activity. But there are some promising exceptions in the oversize four-wheeler class: the Chevy Suburban, the Chevy Tahoe, the GMC Yukon, and the Ford Expedition. <p>
New models are a risky but sometimes rewarding bet. "The used-car-market demand for three-door pickup trucks is huge, but there aren't any because they're new products," says Spinella. "Those will be worth far more than their current residual value." Three-door models include extended-cab pickup models like the Ford F-150; the Chevy S-10, C1500, and K1500; and the GMC Sierra and Sonoma.<p>
High-end models tend to hold value worst (which makes them good deals as used purchases), but some specific models whose styling changes little year to year can beat the odds, like the Lexus ES 300, a perennial residual-value champ, as can cars that draw special-interest buyers, like the Jaguar. Regardless of the market, low-mileage, well-kept cars usually top the list.<p>
Even if you find a car to lease with a fair purchase price and a reasonable residual value, there are often little time bombs hidden in the agreement. To keep the monthly payments low, lease companies often try to wring out extra cash in up-front or back-end charges. For instance, a lease may require first and last payments in advance, so you have to lay out three payments at once. Another favored ploy is to offer to reduce the monthly payment through a "capitalized cost reduction"; in other words, the dealer cuts your monthly payment by whatever amount you are willing to put down up front. <p>
These options defeat one of the main attractions of leasing -- no down payment. Unfortunately, most leases do require some money up front, but they can vary tremendously. In our BMW vs. Jag comparison, the BMW loses a few points on this score: The Beemer requires $5,000 down, the Jag $2,200. <p>
Back-end charges tend to be far more punitive. A lot of leases give you a great deal -- provided you drive the car 10,000 miles or less a year. If you exceed the limit, you'll pay penalties. "We have yet to find any significant percent of people in a 10,000-mile lease who didn't pay for extra mileage," says Spinella. Some leases will let you purchase additional miles at the start of your lease at a discount. For instance, one Chrysler lease charges 8 cents a mile for each additional mile paid in advance and 15 cents for each mile over if you wait until the end; some companies charge a penalty of as much as 25 cents per mile. Many of the pay-in-advance deals will refund any of the additional miles you don't use. <p>
Likewise, there are usually penalties for "excessive" wear and tear, often defined as more wear than is "reasonable." One former leasing executive says she knows someone who lost a $500 security deposit because of a chipped headlight. Find out exactly what "excessive" and "reasonable" mean and if you are entitled to an independent assessment. <p>
Resale charges (sometimes called disposition fees), which cover the costs of anything from paperwork to tuning and cleaning the car for resale, aren't unusual. Make sure the lease spells out what they are and how much you will be charged, or, according to the former executive, you could get socked for a $350 wash and wax. <p>
Now that leases are shorter -- most car-company leases run three years, max -- what is happening to all of those off-lease cars? Well, they go back on the market, either as used cars or as second leases. That's right, you can now lease formerly leased cars. A 1994 model BMW 740iL runs $638 for a 36-month lease, while the 1996 goes for $769 -- a difference of $4,716 over the life of the lease. But there are additional concerns with off-lease leases. For instance, since you are responsible for upkeep, you'll want to make sure fast-wearing items are in good shape. "Make sure it has a new set of tires on it," said Spinella. "It's one of the things people overlook. You can negotiate it with the dealer." <p>
Whether buying or leasing a used car, you can stack the risk of repair in your favor by checking a car's history. Dealers cherry-pick the best off-lease specimens for their own lots. For instance, Bob's Lexus would want to keep an off-lease Lexus that might bring more than market price, not only for the income but because it can help boost the dealership's reputation and raise the price of other used cars on the lot. The cars Bob doesn't want go to an auction for Lexus dealers only. <p>
Finally, the cars the Lexus dealers don't want go to a general-dealer auction. So if you're looking at an off-lease Lexus at a Hyundai dealership, you can bet there are better used Lexi out there. Ask your dealer for the Carfax report on that car, which will often reveal a car's origin, as well as information about mileage and other factors. Most dealers will provide the report for free, or you can contact Carfax at 703-934-2664. <p>
Maybe the best news for lessees is that car dealers are losing some avenues for sneakiness in setting up leases. The Federal Trade Commission recently cracked down on five major car companies for ads that offered low monthly payments but buried hefty additional costs in what the FTC called "mouse print." In addition, the FTC now plans to require dealers to provide complete, understandable figures on lease payments. That should eliminate such "deals" as the one cited by the FTC in which the GMAC SmartBuy plan offered a Buick Regal for a tasty $2,000 down and $249 a month for 30 months. Not bad -- except for the $11,677.68 balloon payment at the end of the lease that the fine print required.

						At least the bargains on airline tickets have a consistent ETA<p>By Roy Furchgott<p>Dave Barry once joked that "airfares are now assigned by a machine called the Random Air Fare Generator, which is programmed to ensure that on any given flight (1) no two people will pay the same fare, and (2) everybody else will pay less than you." In reality, airline-ticket prices are generated by yield-management systems -- computers that look at historic booking patterns, compare how many seats are sold with how many should be sold at that time, and offer discounts accordingly. On top of that, there are yield-management professionals -- people who spend their days second-guessing the computers and setting prices themselves.<p>So, how does the thrifty traveler outwit the computer and predict a big sale? It's simple, though a closely held industry secret. "I'm probably breaking some law by telling you this," says an executive who until recently helped set ticket prices for a major carrier. "An airline offers a sale six to seven weeks before a heavy travel time." So, if you want to travel on the Fourth of July, start looking for a sale around the end of May, when fares should be 40 percent to 50 percent below list prices. The sales are typically advertised as lasting only three days, but don't let that scare you. "Never be afraid of a three-day sale," says the airline exec. "They usually get rolled over into a week or more." <p><p><p><p>

						Something good in fine print: Consolidators' bargain airfares are the real deal<p>
By Rudy Maxa<p>
You'll find the ads plastered on lampposts in downtown Manhattan and in the travel sections of big-city newspapers -- boxes of small, dense type with airline-ticket prices to cities around the world. "Airfare Busters," "Special Airfares," and "24 hr. Discount Airfares" read headlines on flyers and ads that trumpet "scheduled service" but never name the airline willing to fly you from, say, the East Coast to Paris for $479 round-trip with few restrictions. <p>
Is this scam city? No, it's just the semi-secret world of consolidators, the bottom feeders in the hotly competitive arena of airline-ticket sales. Once shunned by many travel agents and viewed warily by travelers, consolidators are now getting respect as consumers begin to understand there's a time and place for these tickets -- as long as you know their limitations. <p>
Consider these round-trip fares offered by consolidators in September and October: New York to Tokyo, $850; Los Angeles to London, $528; Chicago to London, $429. Advance booking is not usually required for these rock-bottom fares, and you often don't have to stay over a Saturday night or a minimum number of days. And which airlines deal with consolidators? Almost all of them, including United, Delta, TWA, Northwest, USAir, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Air France, Malaysian Airlines, and Thai Airways.<p>
Larger consolidators buy blocks of seats at deep discounts months ahead of time from carriers whose computers tell them there are likely to be a lot of unsold tickets on particular flights. Or they have contracts with carriers that allow them to buy tickets that carry generous commissions (as high as 40 percent instead of the customary 10 or 12 percent) or at fixed fares, which means they can sharply discount the retail price of the tickets. Or they offer unsold seats on low-cost charter flights.<p>
"Once, we were considered gray-market dealers," says David Scott, president of Euram Flight Centre, a consolidator based in Washington, D.C., that has been in business 17 years. "But today, we're used by all the major travel-agency chains and independents. It's really been driven by public demand. As passengers become more savvy, we've grown in popularity."<p>
Generally, consolidator tickets are the best buy when you want to travel abroad -- most tickets are to Europe, Asia, and Africa -- on short notice and can't qualify for a 14- or 21-day advance-purchase fare. And while you usually can't get a cash refund for an unused advance-purchase ticket bought from an airline, you sometimes can on a consolidator ticket, though often with a service charge taken out of the refund. Most tickets are for coach seats, but some discounters sell business- or first-class seats at about 20 percent below the full fare. Consolidator tickets are sometimes available for domestic travel, but not often, simply because airlines already discount their prices so much there's not much wiggle room. "Domestic carriers themselves put out bargain fares from time to time, and it doesn't make it worthwhile for consolidators to be involved in that market," says Terence Mascarenhas, owner of Up and Away Travel, a New Yorkbased consolidator that's been in business since 1984. <p>
If a consolidator does sell domestic tickets, they're usually for coast-to-coast travel. And there are bargains to be found there as well. Up and Away Travel, for example, offers a round-trip fare of $299 on TWA from Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, or Washington, D.C., to any major city in California. No advance purchase is required, and passengers accrue frequent-flier miles, which is not always the case on international flights. A few airlines have even granted some consolidators the right to sell tickets between selected city pairs at deep discounts with a three-day advance purchase.<p>
There's still a slightly underground feel to the work of consolidators, probably because airlines never allow consolidators to place their names in their ads. Airlines don't want to anger passengers who paid a higher fare or discourage potential passengers from calling the airlines directly. After all, a major carrier makes a nice profit on the last-minute ticket buyer, who pays at least twice as much as someone who booked ahead.<p>
Some consolidators, such as Euram and Up and Away, are happy to hear from the public; others will sell only through travel agents, who, of course, add a few dollars to the price of the ticket for the service. If you need to fly abroad on short notice, always ask your travel agent for a consolidator ticket; if your agent doesn't deal with consolidators, find another travel agent. <p>
Does this mean you should always wait until just before you travel to buy a discount ticket? Absolutely not. If you know your itinerary months ahead of time, you may pay no more for an advance-purchase ticket than you would later for a consolidator ticket. And you'll be assured of flying the airline you want on the date and time you want. Since consolidator tickets are primarily useful when you're traveling on short notice, they're of special interest to business travelers, who usually can't book ahead.<p>
How much can you save? The numbers change all the time, but according to prices cited in Consumer Reports Travel Letter, passengers can save $100 to $199 per ticket on domestic and European travel and $400 or more on trips to Asia. The best deals to Europe are in the summer, when retail prices are at their peak, while the savings to Asia are generally good year-round. <p>
If you're a frequent candidate for consolidator tickets and want to know everything about the industry, get a copy of Kelly Monaghan's Consolidators: Air Travel's Bargain Basement, which is available for $8.95 at travel bookstores or from the Intrepid Traveler (call 800-356-9315). If you want to know about consolidator flights and approximate fares around the world, subscribe to Jax Fax, a monthly travel-marketing magazine that lists thousands of such flights, from the obscure (Burkina Faso to Chicago for $1,390) to the more common (Tokyo to Washington, D.C., for $755). A one-year subscription is $15 (800-952-9329). Remember that many of the fares quoted in Jax Fax are "net"; they're what a travel agent pays, so you're likely to pay a slight premium. <p>
And how do you protect yourself from a fly-by-night, seat-of-the-pants consolidator? Always pay for your ticket with a credit card and, if you're not familiar with a consolidator that sells directly to the public, use a travel agent who knows consolidators. Get your ticket in hand as soon as possible, verify it with the airline, and make sure the initials in the "Status" box on your ticket are either OK or KK.<p>
Other concerns: Consolidator tickets generally link big cities with other big cities, so if you're looking for a consolidator ticket between Birmingham, Alabama, and Helsinki, you're out of luck. You may find yourself holding a ticket on a third-world carrier you've never heard of, particularly on flights to Europe; a carrier that serves the Near East or Africa will drop you off during a stopover in Europe. If you're not sure you want to fly a lesser-known carrier, always ask which airline you'll be on; if you don't like the answer, keep shopping. If your flight is canceled for mechanical reasons, the airline may not be willing to endorse your ticket over to a rival carrier. If you're on a charter flight and there's an equipment problem, there may not be another aircraft available quickly.<p>
And, finally, a more personal concern: The passenger sitting next to you may hate you if he or she finds out the bargain price you paid for your ticket.<p>

						Callback service makes it cheaper to dial from abroad<p>
By Russ Baker<p>
Expat, Phone Home<p>
If you've ever found your phone calls from a foreign hotel costing almost as much as the room itself, relief is on the way. The overpriced international call is being challenged by a feisty bunch of telecom start-ups. A program dubbed callback service allows you to call from a foreign location to the U.S. or elsewhere at more reasonable U.S.based rates. The system is simple: You trigger a U.S. phone, and it calls you back.<p>
Here's how it works: You sign up with a callback company before leaving the U.S. If you know where you'll be staying, you notify the service of the phone number of your foreign hotel. In many cases, you record a message, such as "Please connect me to Mr. Smith's room." Then, when you're in your hotel room and ready to make some calls, you dial a U.S. number provided by the callback service, punch in a code, and hang up (that call isn't long enough to register as completed with the local telephone company). Within seconds, the phone in your hotel room will ring, and you will be hooked up to a U.S.based outbound line and able to dial any other number at much lower rates.<p>
Callback rates compare favorably not only to what hotels charge, which can be several hundred percent higher, but also to other dialing options, including calling cards issued by foreign phone companies or by your long-distance carrier. On a recent visit to Mexico, I found the callback service charging a flat 68 cents a minute, compared with <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a>'s calling-card rate of $2.10 for the first minute and $1.76 for each additional minute (plus a $2.49 charge per call). <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a> Direct is about the same. On a ten-minute call, I'd save a whopping $13.63, or two-thirds, with callback. Generally, you'll save the most with callback service from developing countries, which tend to jack up the price of long-distance service as a means of subsidizing cheap local service.<p>
Perfect it ain't. Almost no regulations or laws govern the callback companies, and a few are on the roguish side. Before you plunk down a deposit of several hundred dollars on your credit card, ask around for advice. One way is to visit the Web page of San Francisco based M. J. Scheele & Associates (<A HREF="http://www.callbackinfo.com/callback">www.callbackinfo.com/callback</A>), a consulting firm that specializes in analyzing the callback business. If it lists a company, there's a good chance it's legit. Key issues to research include the sound quality (a few offer a good price but poor reception) and whether the service has the right technology to handle fax or modem calls. And some start billing when you trigger the callback, not when your ultimate call goes through. <p>
While in Mexico, I discovered another potential problem with callback: The push-button phone in my room wasn't a real Touch-Tone, which is required for the service to work. A portable tone dialer, available for under $20 at most electronics stores, allows you to transmit Touch-Tone sounds through a rotary handset.<p>
Many of the callback services have a monthly fee, often about $10 or so, which you can earn back with just one long call. Shop around. Some firms will give you a credit to try the service. And prices are dropping fast: The callback company that charged me 68 cents a minute from Mexico now wants just 49 cents a minute.<p>
That's because callback's popularity is causing competitors to sprout like weeds. In 1996, callback spending is expected to exceed $500 million -- a lot of money to spend on rum swizzles and tchotchkes rather than telephone calls home.

Buried within the cheapskate newsletters are smart nuggets fit for a Gates.<p>By Ken Kurson<p>I made what may have been my very first financial observation on a Halloween many years ago. After an evening of continual disappointments, I asked my dad, "Why do the biggest houses always give the shabbiest treats?" His answer, proved right a thousand times since, was simple: "You don't get rich by giving stuff away." <p>While that didn't explain our own family's habit of rewarding trick-or-treaters with a penny each, it did provide a critical lesson: Everyone, rich or poor, likes to save a buck.<p>As it happens, there are dozens of newsletters devoted to achieving that end. Every month, editors cobble together novel ways to save pennies on trifles and hundreds on big-ticket items. Some pepper their practical advice with lectures on the evils of materialism, others speak to the sanctity of thrift, and still others embrace simple living with near-religious devotion. But all agree that the term "cheapskate" is a compliment.<p>Hard-core adherents to what has become known as the frugality movement comb these penurious publications for tips, typically contributing their own money-saving ideas to form a sort of tightwad jam session. The suggestions range from obvious (buy used clothes instead of new) to insane ("I have been toying with the idea of purchasing a steer and having it slaughtered for my family's consumption"). But in between are plenty of creative, interesting ideas for saving money, time, and hassles.<p>I spoke to the editors of 6 newsletters, pored over 4 books, and consumed 31 issues of 8 newsletters -- from Living Cheap News to Bottom Line Personal, which tosses serious investment tips into its brew of money-saving ideas -- to bring you the following list of the best these publications have to offer. Some of them will save you a significant amount of money; some are good for a laugh.<p>If you're buying a new car, do so at the end of the month. The dealer is usually less anxious about covering monthly overhead costs then and is motivated to sell in order to avoid paying another month's interest on the borrowed inventory. Furthermore, salespeople may be participating in a bonus plan that kicks in based on the number of sales made in a month. If he's nearing his quota, your salesman may settle for less commission on your car than he would have at the beginning of the month. Also recommended: Shop just before closing -- when the salespeople are eager to make a deal and the rust bucket you're trading in will get a less thorough examination -- and buy in September or October to get deals on end-of-model-year autos. (Tightwad Living)<p>Bigger is not always cheaper. Grocery stores are hip to the fact that shoppers automatically associate a larger size with a lower cost per ounce, so they've begun to price some popular middle-sized containers higher than both the small and the large. Remember to compare on a per-ounce basis. (Simple Living News)<p>Many foreign travel agencies are less than reputable. To avoid losing your deposit, always charge your reservations on a credit card that offers protection from sudden bankruptcies and bogus deals. (Living Cheap News)<p>If you're prescribed a new drug, ask the doctor to give you samples. Make sure you don't waste your money on medication that may produce side effects. Failing that, ask your pharmacist to sell you only one week's worth of the drug, so you can try it out. (Tightwad Living)<p>It's a point that bears repeating: Percentage increases can be deceiving. An 8 percent mortgage is actually 14.29 percent more in interest than a 7 percent mortgage; a rise in the prime rate from 4 percent to 4.5 percent is an interest jump of 12.5 percent. (Tightwad Gazette)<p>Lots of stuff can be put to work for purposes far different from what you read on the label. Toothpaste is slightly abrasive, so it makes an excellent grout-scrubbing agent. A spritz of hair spray will help take the static cling out of nylons (spray lightly before wearing). A few drops of fabric softener added to water will take the static out of blinds and help keep the dust off the top of the refrigerator. And shaving cream works wonders as an eyeglass-cleaning solution. (Simple Living News)<p>Examine your insurance closely and regularly. Alter it as your life changes -- for example, a five-year-old car may no longer need comprehensive coverage. And stay away from service contracts! (Tightwad Gazette) <p>Did you send your kid to summer camp this year? You might be able to claim the child-care tax credit for a portion of a day camp's tuition. Numerous conditions apply, so check with your accountant. (Bottom Line Personal)<p>If you rent a truck, do so at midweek at midmonth -- and not in the summer. (Tightwad Gazette)<p>Do your homework before bidding in an auction. An experienced auction attendee, Dean King, formerly of The Penny Pincher's Almanac and author of From Paper Clips to Printers, recommends deciding on a few things you'd be happy with before the start of an auction. "Be prepared to pounce if nobody bids," King says. "I got a late-19th-century oak desk for $350 that way." King also recommends that when you're buying computer equipment call a store in New York City first. Because of the 8.5 percent sales tax, New York City computer stores often have to offer rock-bottom prices to compete with the mail-order warehouses. Once you get the store price, call the warehouses and use the store price as leverage.<p>Some states offer an auto-insurance discount for drivers who take a skills-refresher course aimed at older drivers. (Cheapskate Monthly)<p>Do you rent out a residence that you own for two weeks or less over the course of the year? The income you receive is completely free from federal tax and doesn't even need to be reported to the IRS. It'll be too late for Atlanta residents to use this advice during the Olympics, but others take heed: If you live near a hot tourist spot, plan to take your respite during the event so you can use the tax-free income to pay for your own vacation. (Bottom Line Personal)<p>When returning any goods purchased through the mail, ask vendors to provide postage. They usually will, but only if you ask. (Simple Living News)<p>Some banks have begun to add insurance charges to cover the stuff in your safe-deposit box. This coverage is optional, though invoices don't always disclose that fact. If you already insure your valuables with a rider on your homeowner's policy -- and if you don't, you should -- cross out the insurance charge on your bank's bill and pay only the rental fee and the tax. (Bottom Line Personal)<p>Use the lobby phone for long-distance calls from hotels. Some hotels charge 25 to 55 percent of the cost of the call for the convenience of using the in-room phone. (Cheapskate Monthly)<p>
Household remedies are a staple of thrift newsletters. This one, tested on my own clogged drain, works quite well. Pour one cup of baking soda into the drain, followed by one cup of vinegar. Immediately pour a full pot of boiling water down, and use a plunger if necessary. It's not only much cheaper than a commercial drain unclogger but also far less toxic. (Tightwad Gazette)<p>So you've saved a couple bucks on Drano and a couple hundred on your taxes. You've learned to replace expensive items with cheap alternatives that function just as well. Clearly, your thrift has freed up some cash for a splurge -- I hear there's a lovely crystal turtle at Tiffany's...<p><p><p><p><p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> LOST IN THE TRANSLATION <p>The fine print on consumer documents can read like a foreign language. Here's how to speak like a native.  <p> By Alan Siegel  <p> When it comes to deciphering your obligations and rights, determining what you owe, and learning what you need in order to comparison shop, most business documents aren't a lot of help. The vast majority of consumer contracts and statements are confusing, uninformative, even misleading. You have to deal with industry jargon, hidden charges, dense legalese, and microscopic text apparently designed for maximum density.  <p> After studying 30 typical consumer documents, from cable-television  bills to leasing agreements, I chose four that demonstrate the problems consumers face. Here are some guidelines, based on those documents, for avoiding mistakes and saving money.  <p> CIRCUMLOCUTORY CELL-PHONE BILLS. Some cellular-phone companies charge a hidden fee (usually three dollars per month) to provide a detailed bill. I paid the fee for years before I noticed an "optional features" charge and asked customer service about it. The company promptly volunteered to remove it and credit me retroactively because I'd been "such a good customer."  <p> When you sign up with a cellular provider, it's a good idea to keep the first bill you get so that you can compare it with later statements and detect any fees that have been tacked on. For your regular phone service, put one bill aside and, with the help of the phone company if needed, make sure that every charge is reasonable and proper. That establishes a baseline for detecting dubious charges. In 1993, Pacific Bell paid out $34 million to customers after a consumer group called Toward Utility Rate Normalization sued it for slapping unwarranted late charges on unsuspecting callers.  <p> ELLIPTICAL ELECTRIC BILLS. All the jargon on an electric bill boils down to four items: the billing period, the meter reading for that period, the charge per kilowatt hour, and the amount due. Be skeptical of noticeable upticks in any of these four categories and any monthly service work or late charges, says Ken Gordon, a staff attorney for the New York State Citizen's Utility Board. Ignore all the other noise that comes with the bill. Several companies, such as New York City's Consolidated Edison, include a graph of the average customer's use, but this is more confusing than helpful: For a city customer the averages are of all Con Ed residences in the city, from a Manhattan studio apartment to a four-bedroom house in Queens.  <p> MONSTROUS MEDICAL BILLS. The New York Times reported in 1993 that the average hospital bill contained almost $1,400 in "unnecessary charges." At the same time, these bills have become so full of incomprehensible codes and euphemisms that it has become increasingly difficult for patients to read them and spot mistakes. <p>While it is nearly impossible to comparison shop when it comes to health care, there are a few things the wary consumer can do. If you don't recognize a listing on the itemized bill, ask the hospital directly. (Marti Ann Schwartz, the author of Listen to Me, Doctor, reports that she was charged for a circumcision after her daughter's birth.) Pause when you see vague charges like "personal hygiene" (a toothbrush) at $5 a day, or $15 for a "thermal therapy kit" (an ice bag). Finally, if you're unsure about an item and the provider won't listen, contact Med Resolve (800-397-5359), which will audit your bill and help recover unwarranted charges for a fee. (The cost, based on the amount of the hospital bill, starts at $50.)  <p> ARCANE AUTO LEASES. Suppose you decide to end the lease on a1995 <a name="NYSE:HMC"></a><b>Honda</b>. Here's part of what the termination clause says: "I agree that the payment liability upon early termination will be...the amount, if any, by which the sum of the Adjusted Lease Balance as described in Item 8, plus one Base Payment, Item 3A, exceeds the Realized Value, as determined in accordance with Item 15..."  <p> And so on and so on, ad nauseam. This language was so bad that it led to a 1993 lawsuit  in which Betty Lundquist of Westport, Connecticut, sued Security Pacific Automotive Financial Services, claiming the company's standard lease violated the terms of the Consumer Leasing Act. Lundquist lost, but the judge hearing the suit deemed the lease "confusing, unduly complicated, and unnecessarily convoluted."  <p> Most leases have more problems than fuzziness, though. Critical information -- the car's price, the interest rate, and the amount the dealer agreed to pay for the trade-in -- does not appear on most contracts. Only the monthly payment, which may be inflated by hidden charges and manipulations, shows up.  <p> Before you leave the lot, make sure you understand all the important points and have them in writing: the trade-in value, the cost of the car, the interest rate. Don't be pressured into signing right away; take the lease home and study it.  <p> There is some good news. Twelve car lessors, including <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a>Motor Credit and <a name="NYSE:GE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Electric</b></a> Auto Financial Services, have started printing full-disclosure contracts to simplify their leases. Five states -- New York, New Jersey, Florida, Washington, and Maryland -- have now passed laws mandating disclosure of a leased vehicle's cost. And the Federal Reserve, which is responsible for enforcing truth-in-lending laws, has proposed a regulation that would do the same nationally.  <p> The fact that car leases -- traditionally among the most inscrutable of consumer documents -- are getting clearer is a hopeful sign. Perhaps one day customers will be able to trust all their statements without having an attorney reading over their shoulder.  <p>

						Get a good deal at better restaurants with a discount dining card. The newest ones let diners save without feeling like cheapskates. <p> By John Mariani  <p> It may well be true that there's no such thing as a free lunch, but how does 25 percent off sound? This is the idea behind a fast-growing company named Transmedia Network, which issues acard that lets members dine at some of the top restaurants in the country at a guaranteed 25 percent discount. The key to the program's popularity is what it doesn't involve: coupons, advance notice to matre d's and waiters that you'll be paying less than full price, and limits on menu choices and dining times.  <p> It works because restaurants like it, and here's why: Let's say a restaurateur needs $50,000 to renovate his kitchen. Rather than ask for a loan from a bank (notorious for rejecting risky businesses like restaurants), he applies for the money from Transmedia, which gives him the money outright--it's not a loan, so no interest is charged. In return, Transmedia receives from the restaurant double the face value of the cash in the form of food credits to be used by Transmedia cardholders.   <p> The $50,000 cash infusion for the restaurant becomes $100,000 in food credits, which cardholders dine out on. Since a restaurateur's food and beverage costs rarely add up to more than 30 percent (with most other expenses fixed), the hundred grand in food credits is really only costing him $30,000. In the meantime it puts alot of new customers in his seats and allows him to renovate his kitchen.  <p> <p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Even waiters like this discount card.</font></b><p>  <p>As for the cardholder, let's say she goes to the restaurant with a friend and racks up $200 worth of food and wine. When she presents her Transmedia card for payment, the bill reads $200, and she is taxed and is expected to tip on that amount. Transmedia records the sale as well as a 25 percent credit and forwards both to the member's Visa, MasterCard, or Discover account.  <p> Transmedia makes its money from a $50 annual fee from cardholders, from the spread between food credits and the 25 percent discount, and by franchising the concept around the United States and licensing it in Europe. Launched in 1984, the Transmedia program is now offered in more than 5,000 restaurants across the U.S., the Caribbean, South America, Australia, and Europe. At a time when business-meal tax deductibility has been cut to 50 percent from 80 percent, the program is attracting more and more corporate accounts, including 2,000 Prudential Securities executives.  <p> <p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Restauranteurs use the discount card to reel in fresh customers. The downside is when regulars plunk down the card.</font></b><p> <p>By and large, restaurateurs who have participated in the program are quite happy with it, especially the ease with which they can get cash and attract new customers all at the same time."It's been working wonderfully," reports Roberto Donna, chef-owner of Galileo, one of Washington's priciest Italian restaurants."It gives people who think we're too expensive a chance to try us out. Some people are simply scared to walk through the door, but with the discount they can afford us, and we've found 40 percent of them come back to dine here again." Donna also reminds his service staff to pay extra attention to Transmedia customers, who now form 4 percent to 5 percent of Galileo's business, so that they will not feel embarrassed by presenting a discount card.   <p> There are drawbacks for the restaurants, however. "We do get new customers, of course, but some of our old customers also use the card to get that discount," says one restaurateur. Even worse, from the restaurant's point of view, is that the discount applies during peak hours and to meals that are already offered at a special rate. On the other hand, if you're carrying the card, this no-ifs-ands-or-buts policy has enormous appeal.  <p> <p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Thrifty diners aren't limited to second-rate restaurants. Even the best establishments now honor the card.</font></b><p> <p>Traditionally, the best restaurants have been wary of joining dining-card programs because they don't want to be thought of as discount houses. A look through Transmedia's directory (updated and sent out to members every six weeks) suggests that this program has broken through.   <p> In Washington, D.C., you can eat at Occidental Grill, a favorite of local lobbyists. The New York list includes the wildly popular and theatrical Tatou, Bellini by Cipriani (an offshoot of Venice's Harry's Bar) in the theater district, the lavish Sign of the Dove, the perpetually packed Coco Pazzo on the Upper East Side, and even Chanterelle, which just received four stars from the New York Times. Philadelphia's choices include the superb La Truffe, the baroque DiLullo Centro, and the beautiful Meiji-En, a Japanese restaurant overlooking the Delaware river.   <p> A similar program called IGT (In Good Taste) is good for discounts on a wide array of goods and services, including plane tickets, clothing, jewelry, and concert tickets, but its choice of fine-dining restaurants is not nearly as extensive as Transmedia's. Membership is $48 for the first year and $25 a year thereafter. For informationon IGT, call 800-444-8872; for information on Transmedia, call 800-422-5090.  <p>  <hr>  <p>This article appeared in the February 1994 issue of Worth magazine.Data updated in December 1995.  <p>

						Sinking foundation? Leaky roof? That new-home warranty can givehomeowners a false sense of security. It may be coming apartat the seams, too.  <p> By Kathleen Murray  <p> Several years ago, James Blythe's $150,000 home in Warrenton,Virginia, started listing to port. Cracks fissured the walls;doors and windows could no longer be closed in their warped frames. <p> Blythe took comfort in his ten-year new-home warranty, whichhe assumed would cover the $34,000 in damages his house had sustained.But his confidence may have been misplaced. Home Owners WarrantyCorp. in Arlington, Virginia, which insured Blythe's builder,went bankrupt last October after state insurance regulators discoveredthe company was short $45 million.  <p> Home warranties were created in the 1970s to pay for repairsto new houses if the builder was unable to do so. To secure coverage,builders paid warrantors a premium, which was passed along tobuyers. A typical warranty provides ten years of coverage againstmajor structural flaws and mechanical defects and shorter periodsof coverage for less serious problems. By 1994, HOW, the largestof six national home-warranty companies, covered 2 million newhomes with ten-year warranties, commanding half the market. <p> **Homeowners filing claims may find themselves settling forless--60 cents on the dollar less.** <p>HOW wasn't the only large warrantor to experience financial difficulties.In 1993, the next-largest home-warranty company, Home BuyersWarranty Corp., based in Aurora, Colorado, was placed under supervisionby state regulators after the insurance company that backed itfailed to meet a new, higher capital reserve requirement. Thecompany resumed normal operations in September of that year,after the insurance company received an injection of new capital. <p> Blythe is one of about 1,500 homeowners with HOW warrantieswho have filed warranty claims that were not settled as of lastOctober. And because HOW is paying only 40 cents on the dollaron claims for homes built in the last decade, these people maybe stuck paying for thousands of dollars in repairs. More than1.5 million other homeowners will wind up with completely worthlesswarranties should the company go out of business.  <p> **Look who really benefits from warranties.** <p>This does not surprise homeowner advocates. According to JordanClark, president of the United Homeowners Association in Washington,D.C., the purpose of warranties is less to indemnify new-homebuyers than to provide cheap protection for developers. For example,warrantors often charge builders just $600 for a ten-year policyon a $300,000 home, leaving themselves vulnerable to big losses.And though home warranties are supposed to cover all major structuraldamage, many warrantors try to avoid payment by including a clausestipulating that a house must be unsafe, uninhabitable, or unsanitaryto qualify for a claim. According to R. Jean Fischer, founderof the Ridgemere Institute, a home-warranty consumer group inNashville, this practice violates insurance laws.  <p> "Warranties are deceptive and give the homeowner a false senseof security," says D. Brent Lemon, a Dallas attorney who hasfiled dozens of cases against HOW. They may even limit a buyer'srights. For example, in Texas, homeowners by law get four years'worth of protection against construction defects, while the averageten-year warranty provides two-year coverage. If Texas homeownersaccept the builder's warranty, they lose the more extensive state-mandatedprotection. <p>  <p>**Read the fine print, check the soil.** <p>In an effort to protect themselves, warrantors have begun toclarify their contracts. Residential Warranty Corp., for example,"now makes a point of writing limited' continuously throughoutits warranty," says Tom Bothell, a company spokesman.  <p> Federal and state oversight of this business is lax, so it'sup to home buyers to protect themselves. Read the warranty carefullyand be sure you understand the extent of its coverage. Most warrantiescover only defects in manufacturing and materials for one yearand don't cover such nonstructural damage as flooring or furnitureruined by flooding. However, a home insurance policy can be usedto fill in those gaps. <p>  <p>Anyone signing a contract on a new home should check the builder'sreferences, licenses, and insurance. Fischer recommends thathome buyers review floor plans and code inspection reports, talkto architects and local inspectors, and pay an independent soilengineer the few hundred dollars it costs to determine if thehome is built on solid ground. <p>  <p>Homeowners should also hire an independent engineer to inspectthe house. It's not cheap--anywhere from $500 to $1,500--but"considering your house is likely to be the biggest investmentyou'll make," says Fischer, "it's worth the money."   <p>  <hr>  <p>This article appeared in the October 1995 issue of Worth magazine. <p> Copyright 1995 Capital Publishing Limited Partnership.

						Car-lease shoppers have begun cruising the Internet. Armed withinsider information, they're turning the traditional hagglingprocess into a contest between equals.  <p> By Ellen DePasquale  <p> In increasing numbers, potential car buyers are becoming potentialcar leasers, and thousands of them have turned to a new resource:the information superhighway.   <p> Leases now account for 30 percent of all deliveries of new cars,up from just 7 percent a decade ago, according to Business TrendAnalysts, a Commack, New York, marketing research firm. It'sonly natural that leasing information should sprout up on theInternet.  <p> The Internet helped David Goldstein, owner of a software-productioncompany in Seattle, make his decision to lease. While waitingin a car dealership to look at a $13,700 Plymouth Neon last February,Goldstein noticed an ad in a local paper for a leasing deal onan Infiniti. That night, he downloaded some numbers to his homecomputer from several online services and crunched out some leasingcosts. He found that his monthly outlay would be the same forpurchasing the Neon as for leasing a $24,325 1995 Infiniti G20.  <p> **Before you can crunch the numbers, you have to find out whatthey are.** <p>"I was able to plug in the figures I had and determine that theInfiniti payment should come to $208 a month," Goldstein says."The dealer came back with $210, which I accepted." Indeed, luxury-cardealerships seem to be the best place to hunt for leasing bargainspartlybecause of manufacturer subsidies and partly because of strongresale values, both of which help lower monthly payments.   <p> If leasing seems worth pursuing, the first step is to find outhow much the dealer paid for the car which will determine howmuch he's willing to take for it.   <p> CompuServe offers car data sheets that include the manufacturer'ssuggested retail price and dealer invoice prices as well as chargesfor available options. Each sheet, provided through an agreementwith Automotive Information Center in Acton, Massachusetts, costs$1.50. Prodigy and America Online, as well as CompuServe, provideaccess to magazines such as Car and Driver and  Consumer Reportsthat have information on car values. The online services alsoprovide user forums, such as CompuServe's Automobile Forum, wherepeople around the country offer tips and opinions on leases andcar models.  <p> **After finding the best wheels, go back online to learn tohaggle for the best deal.** <p>With price information in hand, a shopper can then check outFinanCenter's Auto, Boat, and RV Loan Department, a divisionof Banker's Portfolio Exchange in Tucson, Arizona (the Internetaddress is http://www.financenter.com/resources/autoloan/index.htm).This site helps calculate the cost of leasing a car and offersa downloadable page of key clauses in lease agreements, whichillustrates various ways in which contracts can be written. Italso identifies points that should be specified and negotiatedwith the dealer, such as charges for excess wear, early termination,and excess mileage.  <p> Those who decide to lease can then use the Internet to set upa deal through the Auto-By-Tel web site (http://www.autobytel.com).This service maintains a database of dealers who pay a fee toAuto-By-Tel to receive requests from potential buyers or leasers.Prospective leasers enter their name, address, phone number,and type of car desired; a dealer in the area will then callwith his or her leasing terms. Armed with all the other informationgleaned from the Internet, leasers will be ready to negotiate.The leaser has to go to a dealer showroom only to sign the papersand pick up the keys. Thanks to the Internet, the traditionalhaggling over price has become more of a contest between equals. <p>  <p>MEANWHILE, ON YOUR LOCAL DRIVE <p>You don't need to go online to get help with a car lease. TheCD-ROM Popular Mechanics' New Car Buyers Guide 1996 ($29.95 fromBooks That Work; 800-242-4546) offers similar information tohelp shoppers make up their minds about a car lease. It providessticker prices and dealers' invoice prices as well as lease-versus-buycalculations.  <p> There are also several software programs that can help in understandingthe leasing process, the terms, and the monthly-payment calculation.The best are Expert Lease ($99.95 from Chart Software; 800-418-8450),a stand-alone application that includes MSRP and dealer invoiceprices, and AutoFinII, a spreadsheet that works with Lotus 1-2-3and Microsoft Excel ($49 from Village Software; 800-724-9332).Both of these programs can instantly calculate how changing oneelement of a lease affects monthly payments. Given data suchas the length of the lease, any capitalized-cost-reduction payments,residual value, and the interest rate, they will calculate anexpected monthly payment to compare with a dealer's offer.  <p>  <hr>  <p>This article appeared in the December/January 1996 issue of Worthmagazine.  <p> Copyright 1996 Capital Publishing Limited Partnership.

						You wouldn't put off a yearly physical. Why treat your financeswith any less regard? The experts offer eight ways to keep yourwallet healthy, wealthy, and wise.  <p> By Bruce Upbin  <p> At the start of the new year, it's easy to let money mattersget lost in the shuffle. Now is a better time than later to straightenup your financial house. We asked the experts for their besttips. Follow these and save:  <p> **Get health benefits in tip top shape.** <p>Most companies circulate forms that let employees adjust benefitplans each year. Pay attention--many have a Thanksgiving deadline.It may be the last time workers can take advantage of one oftoday's most cherished benefitsemployer-provided flexible spendingaccounts for health care costs. Many large corporations let employeesset aside as much as $3,000 in pretax salary to pay for non-reimbursablemedical expenses. By using pretax dollars for physicals and eventhe cost of traveling to the doctor, workers can cut non-reimbursedmedical expenses by 40 percent or more. These plans are particularlyadvantageous if you are expecting your medical bills and insurancecopayments to increase this year, but keep in mind they do notcover payments for elective cosmetic surgery.  <p> Individuals should sit down with their checkbook, add up howmuch they spent on medical costs this year, and sock that amountaway in a flex plan for 1996. "If you want to switch from youremployer's indemnity plan to its health maintenance organizationor preferred-provider plan, you'll probably want to lower yourflex-account balance because you won't be paying as much foroffice visits," says Martha Priddy Patterson, chief employee-benefitsanalyst at KPMG Peat Marwick in Washington, D.C. Also, be sureto spend whatever is left in the 1995 flex account--leftoverbalances cannot be rolled over into 1996 plans once the yearis out.   <p> Two-earner households should also consider having one spousesign up for the other's health plan if each is now covered separately.Many companies who let employees drop company-provided healthinsurance will refund a portion of unused benefits back to employees.Before exiting, however, workers should make sure employers willlet them reenter, in the event of a layoff, divorce, or death.A company's benefits department can give more details about thisoption, but workers should be ready with proof that a spouse'splan will cover them.  <p> The self-employed should tally up their health care costs andget set to write them off.   <p> **Save the most for your golden years--before it's too late.**<p>As Senator Bill Bradley hollers that inadequate retirement savingsis a "major security issue for Americans," Congress continuesto take aim at retirement savings accounts, as it has for thelast ten years. From limitations on IRA contributions to thenew 20 percent withholding rule on certain plan distributionswhen taxpayers leave their place of employment, retirement accountshave gotten whacked.   <p> Put away the maximum allowed in these plans (currently $9,500for 401(k) plans), and consider after-tax contributions as well.Also, explore other retirement-savings accounts such as SEPsor Keoghs if you earn income from projects separate from yourjob.  <p> **Step-up home security to reduce your insurance premiums.**<p>Don't wait until a policy is up for renewal to begin cuttinginsurance costs. Insurance agents often slash premiums for homeimprovements or reduced auto usage before a policy's anniversary."Installing new wiring or a burglar or smoke alarm can slice2 to 5 percent off your premium," says Loretta Worters, a spokeswomanfor the Insurance Information Institute in New York. "More sophisticatedalarm systems can get you a 15 to 20 percent discount." Car poolersand home-office workers should also negotiate cheaper automobileinsurance by arguing that they have a shorter than typical commute. <p> **Update all your financial documents--from insurance to pensionforms--to account for family changes.** <p>Marriages, divorces, deaths, and births all should be properlyreflected in financial paperwork. "Double-check trusts, wills,life insurance policies, and pension forms to ensure that allintended beneficiaries are listed," says Jeff Saccacio, a partnerwith Coopers & Lybrand in Los Angeles. And indicate childrenby their full name to avoid mix-ups from remarriages and adoptions. <p> **Stop the bank from sucking up your money.** <p>Stop paying high fees for bank services. Sky-high bank fees continueto silently suck up depositor money. Since 1990, the percentageincrease in regular checking-account fees has risen three timesthe rate of inflation, according to a 1993 study done by U.S.Public Interest Research Group, a consumer-watchdog organizationin Washington, D.C. "Recent bank mergers spell even higher costsfor consumers because larger banks charge more for their greatervariety of services," says Edmund Mierzwinski, a U.S. PIRG spokesman.Many bankers are eager to lower or eliminate fees for customerswho consolidate several accounts at their bank. Also, considerusing a mutual fund that gives check-writing privileges for monthlychecks amounting to $250 or more, but watch out--these checkscan carry a $2-per-check fee and create a tax bill since theyrepresent shares sold.   <p> **'Tis the season for generosity--even if it's not entirelyaltruistic.** <p>Consider a fat holiday gift to kids. Now is when many parentsconsider shifting wealth to their more lightly taxed offspring.The IRS lets taxpayers give $10,000 each to as many people asthey wish, tax free. It's a smart way to keep estates under the$600,000 mark, after which assets are taxed from 37 percent toas high as 60 percent. Trustees who make annual gifts to existingirrevocable life insurance or education trusts must mail beneficiariesa notice stating that a contribution was made on their behalfand specify the amount, or they won't qualify for the exclusion. <p> **Rethink your investments.** <p>High-income taxpayers should take advantage of the spread betweentheir top tax rates and the 28 percent capital-gains tax by investingin top-shelf growth stocks or growth funds. New York financialplanner Norman Dawidowicz also suggests that investors ask fundmanagers or their bankers to pay out interest on liquid accounts,such as money markets, every six months instead of quarterly.While the interest income won't be immediately available, makingthis move by November 1 means the payout would be scheduled forApril 1996, effectively shifting tax owed to next year.  <p> **Don't drown in debt--consolidate it.** <p>Borrowers who pay 15 percent interest in dealer financing fora $25,000 car, or 18 percent or more on a $10,000 credit cardbalance, should consider cutting that cost by consolidating thisdebt into a 8.5 percent home-equity loan or credit line. Cardholderswho roll over balances, as 65 percent do, will save $950 transferringa $10,000 card balance at 18 percent to a home-equity loan at8.5 percent (not including loan fees). Also, up to $100,000 inhome-equity interest is still tax-deductible.   <p>  <hr>  <p>This article appeared in the November 1994 issue of Worth magazine.Data updated in December 1995.  <p> Copyright 1994 Capital Publishing Limited Partnership.

						Cyberspace holds more financial and business data than you could
ever use. Here's Worth's guide to 25 key financial sites.   
<p>
 By Ted C. Fishman  
<p>
 Six months ago the hydra-headed cyber-thing called the World
Wide Web was best known as a playground for connoisseurs of certain
Danish photographs. No more. The Web has rapidly evolved into
the most prolific and democratic provider of investment and personal-finance
information ever. About 2,000 Web sites offer advice, data, and
financial services, and the number grows daily.   
<p>
 For investors, there are two primary benefits to this technology:
virtually unlimited access to financial data, and a research
medium that weaves together disparate sources of information
through hot links.  
<p>
 Because one never knows just what lies beyond the next hot link,
the Web is terrific for generating investing ideas through sheer
serendipity. The problem is that it can be bewildering to navigate,
so it helps to have a reliable guide, at least until you get
your sea legs. So we scouted out some sites that will save you
time, and maybe money. Good hunting!  
<p>
 ON-RAMPS FOR THE CYBER-SAVVY  
<p>
 *CNNfn, The Financial Network http://cnnfn.com 
<p>
*Dow Jones Business Information Services http://dowvision. wais.
net *Reuters NewMedia http://beta.yahoo.com/headlines/ current/business/summary.html<p>
<p>
 These are the best of the business news sites, and all are free.
Reuters and CNNfn usually have more breaking news, while Dow
Jones puts sections of The Wall Street Journal online. The paper
is free, and stories about the companies covered in the news
are linked to background information in Dow Jones's databases.
CNNfn is allied with Nexis-Lexis, the leading electronic archive
of newpapers and magazines, which allows users to search for
previous stories on current topics. The Nexis-Lexis database
is also available separately; it's exhaustive and expensive.<p>
<p>
 *American Stock Exchange http://www.amex.com 
<p>
*Chicago Mercantile Exchange http://www.cme.com 
<p>
*MarketPlex of the Chicago Board of Trade http://www. cbot.com/mplex.htm<p>
<p>
 Most of the world's major financial exchanges have a presence
on the Web (excluding the New York Stock Exchange). These three
set the standard, providing information--ranging from statistics,
to basic educational materials on stocks, futures, and other
derivatives, to quotes on their contracts, some of which are
delayed. The Board of Trade and the Merc sites supply agricultural
statistics on grains and livestock, as well as links to the government
and news agencies that collect them.  
<p>
 *GNN Personal Finance Center http://gnn.com/gnn/GNNhome.html<p>
<p>
* PR Newswire http://www.prnewswire. com/cnoc/prnewswire.html<p>
<p>
 GNN, the Internet-only offshoot of giant America Online, has
one of the best-laid-out sites, and its personal finance areas
are among the liveliest on the Web. Recent articles include "The
Bag Lady Syndrome," on the fear of poverty felt by many financially
secure women. GNN also tracks 30 or so of the new finance-related
sites that spring up every week. PR Newswire has long been the
world's primary outlet for corporate public relations, posting
press releases in quantity, from companies large and small. This
is public relations, mind you, not journalism, but it's still
a good place to see what's on the front burner at the companies
and industries you watch.   
<p>
 *Briefing by Charter Media, Inc. http://www.briefing.com 
<p>
*University of Michigan Gopher Site gopher://una.hh. lib. umich.edu:70/00/ebb/indicators/ei.txt<p>
<p>
 Data heaven. Both sites offer summaries of virtually every economic
indicator under the sun, and then some. Briefing charges for
some of its stuff. The University of Michigan site, though not
technically a Web site, is accessible from the Web and free.<p>
<p>
 *Quicken Financial Network http:/ www. intuit.com/quicken  
<p>
 Intuit's latest release of its Quicken personal-finance software
is designed specifically to take advantage of the Quicken Financial
Network and comes bundled with a customized version of Netscape's
Web-navigating software that will take you right to the site
and let you browse it for free. For $9.95 a month, users get
seven free hours of Internet access, one of the cheapest Web
on-ramp deals. The Quicken site, like the software, includes
tools to help you balance your books and keep your tax records
up-to-date. It also supports online banking, with links to major
banks. The Network is linked to a sister service for mutual fund
investors, which mantains detailed ratings, price histories,
and analyses of more than 5,000 funds, plus free access to the
databases of Morningstar Mutual Funds, the premier ratings service.<p>
<p>
 *Insurance News Network http://www. insure. com 
<p>
*Quotesmith Corporation http://www.insure.com/Quotesmith  
<p>
 Insurance News Network offers reliable news, ratings, consumer
information, and statistics on the insurance industry. Recent
postings summarized crash tests on popular cars. INN also provides
Standard & Poor's Insurance Ratings and Insurer Reports, a good
resource to determine if your insurer can and will pay out when
you need it. Quotesmith offers free and confidential price-comparison
charts for term life insurance.  
<p>
 *Securities and Exchange Commission http://www.sec.gov  
<p>
 Find out if that cold call came from a broker with the wrong
kind of record. The SEC site lists every enforcement action the
agency takes. It also holds the largest online repository of
corporate information, the EDGAR Database. EDGAR includes the
statements companies must file with the SEC whenever they take
actions that could affect their stocks.  
<p>
 *Internal Revenue Service http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/ bureaus/irs/irs.html<p>
<p>
 An assortment of resources is available for the beleaguered
taxpayer, including copies of every form and instructions on
filing (electronically if you like) and getting help. If browsing
here is too much fun, try checking the tax tables.  
<p>
 *Debt Counselors of America http://shops.net/ shops/ GET_OUT_OF_DEBT<p>
<p>
*TRW Information Services http:// www.trw.com/iss/isdiv.html<p>
<p>
 Debt Counselors of America is a not-for-profit organization
for those with credit and money-management problems. Its site
offers software to help people sort out their affairs, details
on credit and money scams, and advice on debt consolidation.
TRW, the nation's largest credit-reporting service, gives a straightforward
account of how it compiles its reports, as well as instructions
for reviewing credit records and correcting them if necessary.<p>
<p>
 *PAWWS Financial Network http://pawws.secapl.com 
<p>
*Quote.Com http://www.quote.com 
<p>
*MIT StockMaster http:// www.ai.mit.edu/stocks.html  
<p>
 PAWWS and QuoteCom provide current price quotes on stocks and
other instruments for less than it costs to subscribe to dedicated
quote vendors. Both services offer delayed quotes for free. Prices
vary, depending on the services ordered, but $50 buys a package
of information that exceeds most individual investor's needs,
including a large variety of reports and stock ratings. PAWWS
will also keep track of your portfolio--free if you use its specified
discount brokers. MIT's site is a storehouse of historical stock
and mutual fund charts detailed enough to please the most hard-core
technical trader. Its data files can be incorporated into your
own charts and spreadsheets.

						Think you can save a bundle by hopping over to one of the much-hypedphone plans? That's what the long-distance carriers want youto think. They've spent more than $1 billion to convince you. <p> By Kathleen Murray  <p> The rate skirmish among long-distance phone carriers is beginningto look like the Hundred Years War. AT&T, MCI, and Sprint collectivelyspend more than $1 billion a year trying to steal each other'scallers with promises of big savings. But all that advertisingmoney disguises very small distinctions. The competing discountplans offer "savings [that] really are comparable," says CharlesBain, a researcher at Washington, D.C.based TelecommunicationsResearch & Action Center, a public interest group that trackslong-distance rates.  <p> The Big Three have each marketed new, less expensive callingplans. AT&T's True Savings will cut 25 percent from its standardrates if you make at least $10 worth of long-distance calls ina month, 30 percent if your bill is over $50. MCI's New Friendsand Family discounts MCI's standard rates by 10 percent oncemonthly charges hit $9.5020 percent for calls to other MCI usersspecified on the Friends and Family list customers give to thecompany. Sprint Sense, eschewing discounts, has gone to a flat-rateplan, charging customers 10 cents a minute for night and weekendcalls and 22 cents a minute for daytime calls.  <p> The resulting phone-bill differentials are minimal. A recentTRAC survey shows that for 50 long-distance calls a month, mostlymade at nights and on weekends and totaling about 522 minutes,MCI will bill $58.94, Sprint $57.63, and AT&T $58.54. The discountplan offered by a rapidly growing new phone company, LDDS, basedin Jackson, Mississippi, is comparable.  <p> **Once you've picked a plan, stay on top of it. To get the bestrate you've got to ask for it.** <p>Naturally, the carriers insist these savings are a big deal."Even if it's only $3 [a month], that still adds up," says ChrisMannella, MCI's director of brand marketing. "We've still gotthe lowest rates out there."  <p> That may be, but standard rates are going up at all the majorphone companies, even as they steadily drop in the various savings-planrates. This is a crucial distinction, because carriers do notautomatically give current users their lowest rates. In fact,Recent studies by PNR and the Yankee Group, two consumer-researchcompanies, show that two thirds of long-distance users may stillpay standard rates.  <p> According to TRAC, there's also little difference in the voicequality of the major services. So why take the time to switch?Ken McEldowney, executive director of Consumer Action, a consumer-advocacygroup in San Francisco, says because of the intensifying competition,now is a good time to evaluate your long-distance service, ifyou haven't done so in the last six months. A heavy useronewho spends $150 a monthcould save more than $500 a year overthe standard rate.  <p> **No one service can claim to be the lowest. Night owls anddaytime dialers are served best by different plans.** <p>AT&T commands 60 percent of the market and charges the higheststandard rate. A person billed at that rate who paid $57.87 monthlyfor long-distance service could reduce that to $41.27 by switchingto AT&T's True Savings plan. To get the best deal, start by askingcarriers specifically for discount-plan rates. Once you havethe competing plans, look at your own calling pattern. "No oneplan or company is best for everyone," McEldowney says. MCI'sNew Friends and Family plan, for example, is often cited as thelow-cost leader. But that assumes you're calling other MCI customersthat you've listed as regular contacts.  <p> If you make a lot of calls during the day, a plan like Sprint'sMost II, which offers volume discounts of up to 35 percent, maycost less than the Sprint Sense flat-rate plan. Flat rates, includingLCI All America, LDDS Home Advantage and Matrix SBN Flat Rate,may be cheaper if your call volume is light or if your callsare coast-to-coast.  <p> Alternatively, if you travel abroad frequently, you might findAT&T worth the slightly higher cost. American travelers oftenreport that AT&T makes it easiest to dial the U.S. direct fromoverseas as well as get access to American operators.  <p> **Figure out your phone habits before you let your fingers dothe walking.**  <p>McEldowney recommends looking at bills for at least three monthsto determine your calling pattern. For the most recent TRAC studyof rates, services, and features, send a stamped, self-addressed,business-sized envelope and $3 to TRAC, P.O. Box 27279, Washington,D.C. 20005.  <p> Currently, all carriers face intense rate pressure as the BabyBells and even cable companies get set to offer long-distanceservice. So, once you've found the right plan, relaxuntil thenext round of discounts.  <p> Toll free numbers for customer service and opening an account: <p> Frontier (Allnet) <p>(800) 783-2020  <p> AT&T <p>(800) 222-0300 <p>(800) 235-0900 (Spanish)  <p> LCI <p>(800) 524-4685  <p> LDDS WorldCom <p>(800) 275-0100  <p> Matrix <p>(800) 282-0242 <p>(800) 890-0323 (Spanish)  <p> MCI <p>(800) 444-3333 <p>(800) 950-HOLA (Spanish)  <p> Sprint <p>(800) 746-3767 <p>(800) 877-0280 (Spanish)  <p>  <hr>  <p>This article appeared in the July/August 1995 issue of Worthmagazine.

						Making hotel reservations has just become easier--and cheaper.Hotel consolidators are buying up blocks of rooms in cities bothhere and abroad. When they go on a shopping spree, it saves youmoney.  <p> By Rudy Maxa  <p> Once upon a time, there were two basic hotel-room rates: thegeneral or "rack" rate and the package rate. Today, the lodgingindustry is a consumer crapshoot.  <p> Your best deal may be to book through a relatively new groupof wholesalers called hotel consolidators, who buy large numbersof hotel-room nights and pass the savings along to last-minutecustomers. Whether you are in San Francisco, Washington, London,or Paris, consolidators can save you a lot of money. And whena particular hotel or every hotel in an entire city--here orabroad--is sold out, a consolidator may be your best shot ata bed for the night.  <p> Consolidators require nothing more than a credit card number;most use it to guarantee your reservation, and you pay the hotel.Cancellation policies vary, but most require a 24-hour notice. <p> **Here's where you can save a C note a night.** <p>Here are some representative savings:  <p> Hotel Reservations Network (800-964-6835) offered a room atthe elegant Rihga Royal in Manhattan for $237 a night, includingthe 13.25 percent hotel tax (all prices and availability areas of July 1995). When the hotel was called directly for a weeknightroom, the rate quoted was $295, before tax. The consolidator'srate amounted to a savings of about $100 a night.  <p> The Essex House overlooking Central Park said its lowest rate,a national corporate rate for a double with no view, was $243,excluding tax. HRN offered a tax-inclusive rate of $189, savingalmost $91 per night. And while the recently renovated DrakeSwissotel on Park Avenue said over the phone that its cheapestweeknight rate was $224, not including tax, HRN offered a tax-inclusiverate of $160--nearly $100 per night less.  <p> In Beverly Hills, California, the Summit Hotel on Rodeo Driveoffered a "special promotional rate of $150 a night," excludinghotel taxes of 14 percent. HRN charged $113, including tax, fora room on the same night--about $60 less.  <p> **They're (nearly) everywhere you want to stay.** <p>HRN, based in Dallas, lists rooms in most major U.S. cities,as well as some in Europe, including London and Paris. HRN  isopen Monday through Friday, including most holidays, from 8 a.m.to 6 p.m. Central time.  <p> The catalog of properties from New Yorkbased RMC Travel Centre(800-782-2674) includes hotels in all major U.S. and Canadiancities (except Honolulu). Rates for the Essex House and the Drakewere identical to those offered through HRN. An oceanview roomat the trendy Shutters on the Beach in Santa Monica, California,cost $275 a night, but $400 before tax if you had reserved throughthe hotel. RMC is open for business Monday through Friday from9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern time.  <p> Among other consolidators, Quikbook (800-789-9887), which callsitself "America's Number One Hotel Discounter," advertises discountsof up to 70 percent in 21 U.S. cities. Room Exchange (800-846-7000)promises discounts in all major U.S. cities, the Caribbean, Mexico,and Hawaii. You prepay for your room and receive a voucherwhichis fully refundable if you cancel 48 hours before arrival. Thecompany also has started listing European and Asian properties,such as London's Dorchester ($285 plus a 17.5 percent tax, orabout $80 below the regular rate) and Hong Kong's deluxe Peninsula(starting at $259, about $100 less than the hotel rate).  <p> **You can also save off the beaten path.** <p>There are also regional specialists, such as Central ReservationService (800-548-3311), which offers reservations in Miami, Orlando,Tampa, and New Orleans as well as for some New York and Los Angelesproperties. California Hotel Reservations (800-576-0003) specializes,naturally enough, in California and recently added Portland,Oregon, and Seattle to its portfolio. Atlanta-based Hotels Plus(800-235-0909) specializes in discount hotels in England andmainland Europe, as well as the Middle East and South Africa. <p> As in any bargain hunting, shopping around pays off. And justbecause one consolidator has nothing available on the date youwant doesn't mean another won't.  <p> **Dial direct to get an even *better* deal.** <p>Calling a hotel directly for a room is often (but not always)better than calling a central reservations number, because localsrespond to day-to-day business conditions. For example, whenI called a reservation clerk at Ma Maison Sofitel in Los Angeles,she said that, since business was slow that day, she'd extendthe weekend rate of $129 before taxes, $30 less than the normalweekday rate. (HRN offered a tax-inclusive rate of $148.)  <p> Hotels will often give you a corporate rate even if you don'twork for a corporation, so always request it (unless there'sa lower rate). Also, watch for advertised specials, such as Hilton's1995 summer rates for its foreign hotels, which undercut theconsolidator prices.  <p> In the United States, hotels often equal or undercut consolidators'rates on weekend stays.  <p> As in any bargain hunting, shopping around pays off. And justbecause one consolidator has nothing available on the date youwant doesn't mean another won't.  <p>  <hr>  <p>This article appeared in the October 1995 issue of Worth magazine. <p> Copyright 1995 Capital Publishing Limited Partnership.

						On Wednesday, December 4, John Westergaard chatted live about microcap stocks and the market in 1997. Westergaard has been described by Louis Rukeyser of "Wall Street Week" as America's leading "guru" of small cap stock investing. He is president of Westergaard Publishing Corporation and its investment banking affiliate, Westergaard Financial Services. The following is an  transcript from the evening's chat, edited for clarity. The opinions expressed are Mr. Westergaard's, and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Worth OnLine, Worth, or Capital Publishing.<p>
WorthEdit3:     Good evening. Welcome to Worth OnLine's weekly chat show "Conference Call," where each week we bring you leaders in the world of money and finance. Tonight, we're joined by John Westergaard, president of Westergaard Publishing Corporation and its investment banking affiliate, Westergaard Financial Services. Mr. Westergaard, I'd like to start off by asking if you'd take moment to explain your unique investing style?<p>
Westrgaard:     The idea is that one looks for the dream that is motivating the founder and management. The approach is thematic. What's the big idea into which a company is playing.<p>
Rbn3:     In the past you liked an alarm monitoring company, Response USA (RUOK), do you still?<p>
Westrgaard:      Response USA (NASD: RUOK) is a good example. It's playing into the general fear of crime and therefore the need to have protection electronically of one's home and business. It's also playing into the home healthcare market where people at home need a device to alert caregivers when there's trouble.<p>
NVaze:     How about Platinum Technology (NASD: PLAT)? Is it a strong buy?<p>
Westrgaard:     Don't know the company. Have management send me a file and I'll take a look. <p>
Rbn3:     Response USA fell from 9+ to 3- in the past 3 months. Why?<p>
Westrgaard:     Rbn3, I can't answer that because I don't understand the collapse of the microsector this fall. RUOK is a strong buy at these levels. Check Westergaard Online. We'll follow up.<p>
Worldpaul:     Any news on ACTV (NASD: IATV),what were the results of the test market for the network?<p>
Westrgaard:     Can't say much, Worldpaul. Management is not saying a lot. I know the test results have been good, but when the L.A. rollout will be announced, I don't know.<p>
LzPowell:     You are hot on ADDM (OTC issue) but I have had reports that their "computer" advertising board does not hold up.<p>
Westrgaard:     Lz, not true. You're going to see some big news re advertisers on ADDM. The key will be calculators designed as products -- coke cans, Mars Bars, etc. The ad board is not important.<p>
TG568:     Bought Navistar Intl. (NYSE: NAV) at 15. Should I sell?<p>
Westrgaard:     Would accumulate the stock here. Don't sell.<p>
Rbn3:     You follow restaurants on your page, any thoughts on Elephant and Castle Group (NASD: PUBSF)?<p>
Westrgaard:     Roger Lipton does all our restaurant work. Maybe you should get him on here, Worth?<p>
Lepsteidad:     w/20K,best bet=Hi yield,blue,or growth stock?<p>
Westrgaard:     Lepsteidad, what???<p>
Lepsteidad:     With $20,000 to invest, go with stocks with high yield, blue chips, or small companies for growth?<p>
Westrgaard:     Leipsteidad, you've got a shorthand there that sounds like it's designed for the floor of the mercantile exchange.<p>
Rbn3:     Are microcaps too vulnerable to short raids to be viable for the small investor?<p>
Tombases:     Does the amount of closely held shares give a clue as to the future price movement?<p>
Westrgaard:     Rbn3 and Tombases: Short raids can be a problem with thin markets, no question. As for closely held shares, I like it when management owns a lot of stock.<p>
Tombases:     A follow up please:  Define "a lot of stock" as a percentage,  i.e.  25 percent, 40 percent?<p>
Westrgaard:     25 percent or more.<p>
Dog149:     How do you feel about biotech?<p>
Westrgaard:     Dog 149: I love Life Medical Sciences (NASD: CHAI). Basic technology out of the Technion in Haifa.<p>
AFurman105:     What's happening with Graham Fields?  We heard it was hot.<p>
Westrgaard:     Graham Fields (NYSE: GFI) is a top favorite of mine. Smith Barney issued a 22-page report today. This is a play on home health care.<p>
APurner:     Anything in the banking sector?<p>
Westrgaard:     We don't follow banks. I've tended to get my head handed to me over the years in financial type stocks.<p>
Cuff Star:     You ought to check out Sterling Bank Corp. (NYSE: STL), it's going for a ride.<p>
Westrgaard:     Cuff - I used to keep my account there but have no thoughts on the stock.<p>
Worldpaul:     Mr. Westergaard, do you think there will be a surge in price when ADDM comes off the pink list?<p>
Westrgaard:     As for ADDM off the electronic bulletin board, yes I think it will go bananas.<p>
LzPowell:     Do you follow REITS?<p>
Sesample:     What do you think of New Mexico & Arizona Land (AMEX: NZ)?<p>
Lepsteidad:     Internationals look good now? <p>
Westrgaard:     REITs - no. NZ - no. Internationals? I read that to mean the international oils. I like the small cap domestic producers.<p>
Carlyfro:     Mr. Westergaard, I would be most interested in your thoughts about Thermo Tech Technologies (NASD: TTRIF).<p>
Westrgaard:     Carly - Thermo Tech Technologies has always intrigued me. I'd like to get to know the people better.<p>
DJeffer500:     Expect small caps to rocket due to the January factor.  What are your top three, Mr. Westergaard? Why?<p>
Westrgaard:     DJ -- as for the January factor, be very careful this time around. I'm suspicious that the market has already topped out and January could be very dangerous.<p>
LSobczyk:     Do you think Orthologic Corp. (NASD: OLGC) is a good buy now?<p>
Westrgaard:     LS - I love OLGC at these levels. A major company in the making.<p>
LFISKY:     Any thoughts on Olympus Ventures, Inc. (NASD: OLPV)?<p>
IKEMICKI:     Lots of people are talking about Vical (NASD: VICL), do you follow the company?<p>
AVVV:     What are your views on Morgan Products (NYSE: MGN)?<p>
MiGerk:     How about Sun Microsystems (NASD: SUNW)?<p>
Westrgaard:     No thoughts on Olympus, Vical -- ask management to send me a due dilly file and I'll take a look. Don't follow Morgan. Don't know Sun Micro but my gut tells me they're going to clean up in the next several years due to the year 2000 date conversion problem. Are you all familiar with the Y2K problem? Come to www.westergaard.com to find out.<p>
Rbn3:     You seem to be a bibliophile -- any stock play on that theme?<p>
Westrgaard:     I'm not a collector of books but I read a lot, mostly history and biography.<p>
IKEMICKI:     How about K-Mart (NYSE: KM)?<p>
Westrgaard:     Best way to play K-Mart is to buy ADDM.<p>
APurner:     Mr. Westergaard, any thoughts on Delta Airlines' (NYSE: DAL) interest in Continental (NYSE: CAI)?<p>
Westrgaard:     I like the Delta-Continental merger from a passenger's perspective. Delta is a premium airline and Continental has come a long way but I'd still feel better with Delta running the show.<p>
ALAgrief:     What's your opinion on Toys R Us (NYSE: TOY) stock as a Christmas gift for a child?<p>
Westrgaard:     ALA -- Stock is a cute idea, better than some dumb toy. <p>
ALAgrief:     Thanks, Mr. Westergaard -- you're right, toys and flowers are short shelf life items!<p>
APurner:     Mr. Westergaard, which sectors do you feel will be attractive in '97?<p>
Westrgaard:     AP - I believe the microcap market is going to do well with a focus on stocks where you have visibility through 1998. Check out Magal Security Systems (NASD: MAGSF) -- revenues this year $18mm, next year $27mm, 1998 $40mm. Predictable in my view.<p>
CONFED ED:     Do you think Netscape (NASD: NSCP) will go down in '97?<p>
Westrgaard:     Confed: I'd rather own AOL (NYSE: AOL) than Netscape.<p>
CONFED ED:     Concur, but I have puts on Netscape.<p>
Westrgaard:     Puts on Netscape may be o.k.<p>
LzPowell:     Other than you, who has a good solid stock picking philosophy?<p>
Westrgaard:     Lz - as for good stock picking philosophy, my favorite is Bill Nasgovitz at Heartland Funds.<p>
DJLMCC:     Did I miss any comments about SGT?<p>
Westrgaard:     DLJ - No, I haven't commented on SGT. It's a '98-99 story is my sense of it. Very big!!!<p>
TOXIC5JAY:     Mr. W. Do you plan to start another mutual fund? I owned your old one. Your fund would have made a lot of people wealthy. Please consider another one. You're great.<p>
Westrgaard:     No, no more mutual funds for me. I spent too much time listening to other people's ideas and lost my own creativity.<p>
VICKI NO E:     Mr.  West do you like BioSource Int (NASD: BIOI)?   GREAT company!!!!!!!<p>
Westrgaard:     Vicki - Have BioSource send me a file.<p>
GSLECK:     I used to work at ERA in '73 . Is anyone (other than you) still around? Follow Innovus? Worked with George Howick, now just invest on my own -- am doing OK.<p>
Westrgaard:     George Howick is one of the finest people I've ever worked with. He's now a professor at DePauw.<p>
Triinv1010:     Any thoughts on Y2K? Who are your favorite players, if any?<p>
Westrgaard:     Trinn - Strategia (OTC issue) looks interesting on the Y2K problem. A bulletin board stock about to come onto Nasdaq.<p>
Scillitani:     Where do you think the market is going? 1 month, 6 months, 1 year?<p>
Westrgaard:     I'll be making a major market prediction this weekend.<p>
Scillitani:     How do I get your predictions?<p>
Westrgaard:     Go to www.westergaard.com and register and you'll get a daily E-mail. No charge.<p>
DJeffer500:     Will the prediction be on www.westergaard.com?<p>
Westrgaard:     I'll be holding a press conference at 10:30 on Friday at 11 West 42nd, 4th floor, in connection with a Y2K Conference I'm co-hosting.<p>
DJeffer500:     Will you recap Conference on www, since I won't be there?<p>
Westrgaard:     Will recap my ideas, yes.<p>
TOXIC5JAY:     I have two kids starting college in 2 years. What 1 stock or fund would you suggest?<p>
Westrgaard:     E-mail me at john@westergaard.com with your question.<p>
GSLECK:     Follow Tarrant Apparel Group (NASD: TAGS) -- small private label retailer??<p>
Westrgaard:     TAGS - retailers have also been a weak spot for me as I said earlier with financials.<p>
Worldpaul:     ACTV -- how do you feel about their school learning program they have?<p>
Westrgaard:     The school learning is very interesting but the big play here is sports in my opinion.<p>
DJeffer500:     Mr. W, your 3 favorite midcaps poised for a breakout?<p>
Westrgaard:     I put up a list of my six favorites for 1997 today. Three are ADDM, CHAI and MAGSF.<p>
FSandonato:     What about gold, please respond.<p>
Westrgaard:     I've never been a gold bug, but concern over the Y2K problem could make me one.<p>
JOR7733:     How about CEL-SCI (NASD: CELI)?<p>
Westrgaard:     CEL-SCI has done an astonishingly good job. Can't argue with success.<p>
JOtt5149:     Do you have a favorite sector going into 1997?<p>
Westrgaard:     My favorite sector is the micros. They'll do well in the face of a poor blue chip market.<p>
DJeffer500:     Call me naive. What are some micros?<p>
Westrgaard:     DJ - micro caps are stocks with less than $300mm market caps.<p>
FSandonato:     Stock of the year?<p>
Westrgaard:     Stock of the year? Life Medical if clinicals substantiate what we believe on their hair restorer.<p>
CWJ9:     Has this bull market run out of steam?<p>
Westrgaard:     The market for the 20th century hit its high last week.<p>
Connie C R:     Hit its high because of the Y2K problem?<p>
Westrgaard:     Yes.<p>
JhnnyFv:     What is Y2K problem? Please explain.<p>
Westrgaard:     Y2K is year 2000 date compliant issue. See our site for details. www.westergaard.com<p>
WorthEdit3:     I'm afraid that's all the time we have this evening. Mr. Westergaard, thank you so much for taking the time to join us this evening. It  has been a pleasure having you with us.<p>
Westrgaard:     Thank you all. I hope you'll all visit Westergaard Online at www.westergaard.com. <p>
WorthEdit3:     And thank you, everyone, for stopping by "Conference Call" tonight. <p>

						On November 13, 1996, Worth OnLine featured James Dines for  "Conference Call." Dines, who last appeared on this live chat show in July, is the editor of "The Dines Letter." He is also a contributing advisor to Decision Point's Top Advisors Corner on AOL. His most recent book is called "Mass Psychology." The following is an edited transcript of the evening's chat. The opinions expressed within are those of Dines, and do not represent the views of Worth OnLine, Worth magazine, or Capital Publishing.<p>
 Welcome to "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's live weekly chat show series. Our guest tonight is Mr. James Dines, who will make a brief statement and then the floor will be open for your questions. Mr. Dines, the floor is yours.<p>
DinesLtr:     Our last signal was a "buy" on 31 July 1996, right near last summer's Bottom. Shortly after Mr. Dines' last appearance on Worth OnLine, on 17 July 1996, he warned that the market was getting "drastically Oversold." At that time he was also bullish on gold, and just in the last few days they have been rising strongly. He still favors blue-chips such as Placer Dome, Barrick, and Getchell Gold. For growth, Euro-Nevada and Franco-Nevada. For high current income Battle Mt. convertible preferred. Lower priced speculative buys are Agnico-Eagle on the New York Stock Exchange at 13 and Laramide (LAM.TO) at $1.20 (US). Favored oils are Royal Dutch, Texaco and Exxon. In banks, Bankamerica has been favored but is due for a profit-taking pullback, whereas JP Morgan looks ready to move up from here. Pre-Paid Legal Services an amazing growth stock. In high-techs, Cascade, Fore Systems, Xylan, Vitesse Semiconductor, Cambridge Technology and Advanced Fibre Communications. Mr. Dines new book "Mass Psychology" has already been called a "classic," as have his first two books. Book describes "profit inversion," wherein investors will change their goal from profit-seeking to "getting out even." All gamblers secretly want to lose, which is why they keep gambling until they do lose, and "Mass Fear knows no price" so people will sell out at the lows "just for the money." Now open for questions.<p>
HRay984392:     Are you still bullish on pre paid legal?<p>
DinesLtr:     HRay: Yes.<p>
WALLSTLOVE:     How about a contrarian viewpoint in gold? Everyone is down on gold now. Buy now, right?<p>
DinesLtr:     all Street Journal published very bearish article a few days ago reflecting mass pessimism and a clear buy signal by the Dines Theory of Positive Negativism. They are still buys now as in our opening statement.<p>
Amboy69:     What about GLG?<p>
WALLSTLOVE:     Gold just seems stuck at the 380 range, though.<p>
DinesLtr:     Do not make the mistake of confusion the action of gold bullion with gold stocks. Amateurs assume they move together, which is logical, but if the world were always logical it would be men who rode sidesaddle. See opening statement listing some of our favorites. Homestake will move with gold bullion prices because it does not hedge in gold futures markets. The others are okay, but believe you could do better, especially Laramide (LAM.TO).<p>
DCDCKC:     How about silver bullion/coins (specifically silver dollars) in a major bear market?<p>
DinesLtr:     Our Major buy signal for precious metals on 9 Nov 92
predicted that stocks would outperform bullions, and there has been no change. Coins will move with bullion markets, and believe you could do better with silver shares such as Silver Standard (SSO.V) or Coeur d'Alene.<p>
DCDCKC:     Opinion/recommendation on Argosy and Bralorne-Pioneer on Vancouver Exchange?<p>
DinesLtr:     DCDCKC: They should be market performers, but are not on our Supervised Lists.<p>
RQTBL1:     Nothwithstanding today's move, since the untimely demise of Mr. Penna, the market for AEM has been acting debilitated. How do you assess the stock's future price potential.<p>
DinesLtr:     RQTBL1: Agnico-Eagle (AEM) has a very solid and growing reserve picture, so despite the loss of Mr. Penna our buy signal at 3.88 on 30 Sep 91 still stands.<p>
RQTBL1:     On a relative basis do you believe AEM will outperform the XAU? Thank You!<p>
DinesLtr:     I believe so.<p>
WALLSTLOVE:     How about S. African shares? I own Blvoorich.....<p>
DinesLtr:     Blyvoor and other South Africans have been underperforming the entire international spectrum of gold mines, although ASA got above 40 today. South Africa going through transition period, and will have problems with labor unions, but longer term should do well. Their mines are typically extremely deep, so their costs are in danger of getting too high until the price of gold goes up substantially, so miners are shifting exploration toward the rest of Africa. The Dines Letter strongly believes in international diversification of a gold portfolio because even if South Africa closes down, that loss of gold production should send gold prices elsewhere soaring.<p>
CITYOFCH:     Opinion on ECO please?<p>
DinesLtr:     Echo Bay should be a market performer, relatively unexciting until they build up their reserve position, and meanwhile have declining Relative Strength and is below Moving Averages. Let's see how it performs in period of current gold strength.<p>
Amped INTL:     Are the Russians still dumping enough gold into the market to hold prices down?<p>
DinesLtr:     Amped: Russian dumping is not holding gold prices down, it is the central bankers who have sold all of their other reserve heirlooms and want to sell their gold either to give to charity or to exchange for interest-earning US government bonds -- in other words exchanging the world's safest reserve asset (gold) in exchange for US government bonds (paper from the world's largest debtor). When this house of cards caves in, central bankers who did it to us will probably have been safely dead by then. <p>
WALLSTLOVE:  ECU can't get act together=exploding gold reserves.<p>
DinesLtr:     ECU is not the main factor. Egomaniacal Americans think that our own inflation rate is the sole determinate of gold prices, whereas inflationary fears elsewhere in the world, especially central Europe and Asia, are sparking most of the buying, from former communist nations who only recently have been allowed to buy gold. ECU is just another pathetic effort to replace gold, which already is the world's universal currency, echoing American efforts for a constitutional amendment for balanced budgets instead of allowing gold to enforce it. There is a fearful day of reckoning coming, with all of the world's major currencies backed only by paper for the first time in history, as outlined in my second book "The Invisible Crash."<p>
TV CRUNCH:     Mr. Dines, you called the last turn in the bond market. Are bonds a buy now?<p>
DinesLtr:    TV CRUNCH:  We turned bullish on bonds again right on the bottom, a lucky shot, and we continue to look for lower interest rates, but reserve the right to reverse ourselves at any time. Indeed, we have just this week cashed in our profits with a sell signal on the Dow-Jones Utility Average at 234.84, and some bank stocks look
ready for a Technical Correction.<p>
WALLSTLOVE:     What small cap stocks do you recommend?<p>
DinesLtr:     Our Supervised List #5 consists of "penny" stocks,
containing several low-priced golds. Repadre Capital Corp (RPD.TO) has a superb Uptrend, we have already mentioned Silver Standard and Laramide, but also like Pan American Silver (PAASF), TVX Gold also solid, and should be producing 1 million ounces per year by the end of this decade. We have recently added Chase Resources (CQS.TO) and International Pursuit (IPJ.TO).<p>
RV15181:     Call options on AOL?<p>
DinesLtr:     America Online (AOL) is a company in transition and has
been in the headlines lately. The stock has been leveling off in the 25-35 area, but it is below its Moving Averages and has declining Relative Strength. It's probably a solid bet longer term, but I do not see a clear reason that would send it higher on a short-term basis to warrant buying call options. Why not buy call options after the next
setback in the gold stocks?<p>
RQTBL1:     Has your opinion changed RE: IMF sale of gold bullion, in light of recent dialogue?<p>
DinesLtr:     No. Countries like Canada and Belgium have been steady sellers of gold because they have been bearish on it, which is a classic buy signal by the Dines Theory of Positive Negativism. Idea of selling gold to give proceeds to charity will continue to crop up reflecting the ignorance of the need to link paper currencies to an item of value, be it gold, silver or oil. See my second book "The Invisible Crash" for an in-depth discussion.<p>
HRay984392:     Some of us missed your opening statement; brief review?<p>
DinesLtr:     Are you asking me to describe the universe and give two
examples? Our buy signal for the Dow-Jones Industrial and Transport Averages luckily issued at last summer's rock bottom are still intact, but we have just flashed a DJU sell signal at 234.84, and additional sell signals might be forthcoming after further strength. If DJI gets down to 5960 and DJT 1980 would be sell signals, while a drop by the Dow-Jones Bond Average to 101.0 would likewise be a sell signal. Still extremely bullish on gold, silver & platinum shares, but not bullions, an for specific recommendations get a printout of this or be here earlier at our next appearance. Nobody asked about platinum, and my favorite in the world is Stillwater Mining on the American Stock Exchange with a superb deposit in Montana. Has anybody read my book "Mass Psychology"? How many of you have noticed that Mexico's peso has been crashing to new lows? The liars running the Mexican currency blame that on "armed revolutionaries" instead of confessing that they are running the printing presses full blast, not only so that they could steal more money, but also to continually devalue the peso in order to give their exporters an advantage. My second book "The Invisible Crash" predicted "The Coming Competing Currency Devalutions" and here they are. To attract people to a cheapening peso they send interest rates soaring, which is a catastrophe for business and unemployment that drives the poor to crime that only makes business worse. It provides US demagogues with a reason to avoid free trade with Mexico, harming both sides of our borders, not to mention providing a reason for the very existence of armed revolutionaries! Linking the peso to gold or silver would be a major solution, driving interest rates way down, but we do not know how to convince them. A revolution is a shout to the deaf. (The above is from the latest Dines Letter, and echoes our concerns about other currencies internationally.)<p>
RQTBL1:     Yes, I read your book, but I am having trouble applying its precepts.<p>
DinesLtr:     Which precept in particular troubles you, for example?<p>
RQTBL1:     I cannot understand how to analyze  the criteria for "Mass Spark" nor how to apply it?<p>
DinesLtr:     That is a good question, and a sophisticated point. A "Mass Spark" is that specific moment when the Mass shifts direction, and is more readily observable in the wheeling of a flock of birds or school of fish where no signal has ever been detected. We have never found a way to predict it but can detect it as it is happening, as we did when we flashed out buy signal last summer, when The Herd
got excessively pessimistic and something suddenly "snapped" that sent stocks reversing upwards. My "Mass Psychology" book is the first serious effort in the field but is hardly definitive. Hopefully, somebody who reads it will be able to build on the areas not yet understood by anybody.<p>
DGeorge164:     Mr. Dines, I enjoy your newsletter. I have been a subscriber for the past year. Do you offer an online service over the Internet?<p>
DinesLtr:     Thank you. And glad you are enjoying The Dines Letter. As it turns out we are in the process of studying going online, so if you drop us a note we will let you know of our decision.<p>
DGeorge164:     Homestake Mining has not moved ahead since your initial buy signal in December '93. Are you still bullish on this stock?<p>
DinesLtr:     Yes. Homestake will move with gold bullion, and is
included in portfolios as a hedge of gold bullion catching up with the leading bullishness of gold mining shares. Homestake is one of the very few gold shares that has not moved up, but will do exceptionally well when gold bullion erupts because they do not sell gold forward in the futures markets. <p>
We have been bullish on oils all the way up and believe that Netanyahu will trigger an explosion in the Middle East. Furthermore, we mention in the last Dines Letter that here in San Francisco we are informed that raccoons are growing longer hair than usual, local bees are unusually aggressive, rodents are accumulating larger stores of seeds, so this could be an unusually severe winter that uses more petroleum products.<p>
FNTIES:     Is Coke a good stock to hold on to?<p>
DinesLtr:     Coca-Cola in superb Uptrend, and would place stop loss just below the October low at 47-5/8 at 46.<p>
ROY1R:     Pegasus Gold has dropped from $15 to $10 in the last 3-4 months, is it now a buy?<p>
DinesLtr:     Pegasus is not one of our favorite gold stocks, however it is resting at an important Support Area at 10, so if there is going to be an upside reversal it should come from around the 9 to 10 area. An Upside Breakout at 11 would be encouraging, while a rise to 13 would be an Upside Breakout that could reverse its declining Relative Strength.<p>
KArmant112:     Would you recommend selling AT&T to buy Lucent? Some people are saying Lucent has more potential<p>
DinesLtr:     AT&T is in a Downtrend and we do not envision much more than a rise toward the 40 area. While Lucent is in an Uptrend, it has risen from 30 to 51 since July, and is overdue for some profit taking. Prefer to buy on a possible dip toward the low 40s, but if there is an upside breakout to 52, that might send it higher. Keep in mind with estimated earnings of only $2 it already has a rich Price Earnings Ratio of 25.<p>
RQTBL1:     An obvious corollary would be the move to  precious metals from paper currency. If such cannot be predicted, are we not all in the midst of a gigantic guessing game?<p>
DinesLtr:    Since nobody knows the future for certain, all efforts at discerning the future contains elements of guessing. However, in The Dines Letter we have been looking for the Mass Spark to come from the arena of Mass Fear. Many people worldwide hold US paper dollars because they trust them more than their own paper currencies, but at the first whiff of fear there should be an
electronic stampede out of paper currencies and into precious metals. While we cannot predict when it will happen, we can certainly observe the earliest indications of its advent, probably featuring collapses in paper currencies, which is why The Dines Letter spends so much time on international currency markets. Note that strength in gold mining shares in recent days coincided precisely with declines by the US dollar in Tokyo, and also the Mexican peso, which need close observation to see if they get enough out of hand
to trigger a Mass Spark out of the stock market and into gold. Do you understand? To order The Dines Letter, call 800-84-LUCKY. To order "Mass Psychology" call 800-550-1000.  Thank you.<p>
WorthOnLne:     Well, that Concludes this edition of "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's live weekly chat series. Thank you for joining Worth OnLine and Mr. James Dines  for this evening's chat. The Worth staff extends its appreciation to Mr. Dines for being our guest.<p>
DinesLtr:     Thank you and may you live every day of your life.

						On Wednesday, November 6, Greg Dorsey joined Worth OnLine for "Conference Call." Dorsey is editor of the Web-based "DollarWise Investing," which analyzes underfollowed, undervalued stocks selling for less than $25 a share. Prior to starting DollarWise Investing, Mr. Dorsey edited "Wall Street Bargains," a monthly newsletter devoted to low-priced small stocks and mutual funds. He is also currently an associate editor at the award-winning "Personal Finance" newsletter. The opinions expressed within are those of Dorsey, and do not necessarily represent those of Worth OnLine, Worth magazine, or Capital Publishing.<p>
WorthEdit1:     Welcome, Mr. Dorsey. We'll begin with a question that was posted on our message boards. Adman495 asks: Recent articles have stated that Qualcomm stock is heading for a fall,<p>
GDorsey1:     It seems the market is on fire. But most of this is blue chips. Qualcomm could be headed for a fall. Chart sure looks ugly. Wall St. expecting $1.25 next year. Could be hard to meet. No room for error.<p>
WorthEdit1:     Should small stocks investors be excited about the rally in the past few days?<p>
GDorsey1:     WorthEdit1: Small stocks have barely budged in last few days. Don't expect much more for blue chips near term.<p>
BABY SOROS:     What are your opinions on two small cap stocks- SMTC and DOCSF.<p>
GDorsey1:     Baby Soros: PCDocs--don't think much of it. Prefer Fulcrum FULCF also down big.<p>
Sdray112:     Opinion on THDO (3 DO)?  Thanks<p>
GDorsey1:     Not much future in 3 DO.<p>
RKanterman:     How can we get your newsletter?<p>
GDorsey1:     I'm glad you asked. Write us a 1750 Old Meadow Rd., Suite 300, McLean, VA 22102.<p>
FRANK16145:     What about ZTEC? It has some great numbers.<p>
GDorsey1:     Frank: Regarding ZTEC--looks interesting, but will always trade at low P/E since it's a commodity player.<p>
Ksp001:     Any thoughts on IMAT ?<p>
GDorsey1:     Ksp001: Oil stocks are hot now. They've pulled back a bit here, but I'm looking for much higher oil prices over the next several years. Check out NBR, RB, FLCN; all drillers.<p>
FRANK16145:     What banks in the 20 or so dollar range look good..??<p>
GDorsey1:     Frank: Silicon Valley Bancshares is an excellent choice in that range.<p>
SCavett441:     Bethlehem Steel?<p>
GDorsey1:     SCavett: Beth Steel is an interesting speculation, could do 70-80 cents next year.<p>
BABY SOROS:     What else do you like besides oil stocks?<p>
GDorsey1:     Copper for the same reason as oil. Strong worldwide demand. Asarco is fave.<p>
FRANK16145:     What about TRK??<p>
GDorsey1:     TRK--racing is hot these days. Strong gate sales should lead to strong earnings. Buy.<p>
Charchy:     What P/E does 70-80 put Beth Steel at? I know their book value is @ 8.<p>
GDorsey1:     Beth Steel is fairly valued now. But with worldwide growth sparking those projections could be low.<p>
BABY SOROS:     Greg- do you take a bottom up approach or a top down (a macro or micro approach)?<p>
GDorsey1:     A little of both. Look for both broad economic trends and then examine best stocks in categories likely to benefit.<p>
BABY SOROS:     So, therefore you see the oils and coppers moving upward- any sectors you see as pans?<p>
GDorsey1:     PC manufacturers.<p>
RKanterman:     Greg, do you recommend any restaurants?<p>
GDorsey1:     RKanterman: CBRL, stock has come down here.<p>
FRANK16145:     What sector excites you the most right now..?<p>
GDorsey1:     Copper and oil are by far my favorites.<p>
GLSUTER:     Forest Oil Corp. (FOIL). Hold or sell??<p>
GDorsey1:     Forest Oil will also benefit in the coming paradigm, but the real fire will be in the drillers.<p>
BABY SOROS:     So PC manufacturers will get hurt, I agree, which companies will get hurt the most?<p>
GDorsey1:     Gateway and Dell are good shorts here.<p>
BABY SOROS:     Great, I'm short DELL. What is your reasoning- price wars upon us, lack of demand, why?<p>
GDorsey1:     Lack of demand. Japanese entering market, cutting into margins.<p>
BABY SOROS:     Man it's scary I have the same reasoning-- Greg you think shorting is the way, or puts for the average small investor?<p>
GDorsey1:     The problem with puts is time value erosion while you're waiting for the decline.<p>
BABY SOROS:     I agree Greg, but it's hard sometimes for average investor to find stock to short, so long-term puts only way.<p>
Mav1579:     I have 1500 shares of DEC, 2000 shares of T,  2000 KM,  1000 AOL, 2000 BS. What's your opinion?<p>
GDorsey1:     No offense to our gracious host, but I wouldn't touch AOL. T is a winner. DEC may be OK long term.<p>
Taccat2:     GREG  are you familiar with ASTEC?<p>
GDorsey1:     ASTEC Industries:  from a value point of view is very cheap, but be patient.<p>
Charchy:     Do you believe in buying H & R Block before tax season? I happen to be a C.P.A.<p>
GDorsey1:     No, earnings are already factored into share price. No seasonal play.<p>
AGrace7945:     Greg  your opinion on PD - Phelps Dodge - thanks.<p>
GDorsey1:     Phelps also looks good, a more conservative play than Asarco.<p>
Dan M999:     What do you think about TXN?<p>
GDorsey1:     I like TXN. Buy now.<p>
Mav1579:     What about XOMA?<p>
GDorsey1:     XOMA, I don't know why it's down so much. Not real thrilled with pattern for small biotech.<p>
MackMufi:     What about Bay Networks?<p>
GDorsey1:     Other networking companies offer better opportunities--Cisco for example.<p>
BABY SOROS:     Mack- I like BAY, if you care, they finally have strong management and good products.<p>
Gbullpin:     Sun Glass Hut International?<p>
GDorsey1:     It will be a long time before Sun Glass reaches old highs. Might be a short-term trade for a few points.<p>
Nogoth6430:     Greg, how about ADT?<p>
GDorsey1:     Crime's up. Gotta love it.<p>
Nogoth6430:     Any target on price on ADT?<p>
GDorsey1:     25 in the next six months.<p>
MackMurfi:     Will Republic Ind. hit 35 by Jan.?<p>
GDorsey1:     Republic could hit 35 by the new year.<p>
RKanterman:     Greg, do you think CAKE can finally get it together?<p>
GDorsey1:     CAKE is fairly valued after recent decline...hold.<p>
JPULTZ10:     What's your short term thoughts on GNTA and CLYS?
?
GDorsey1:     Genta, a bit small and way too speculative for my tastes.<p>
SBonner627:     What do you think of USBS?<p>
GDorsey1:     USBS looks interesting. It's a buy here.<p>
Gbullpin:     How about Adelphia?<p>
GDorsey1:     Is that cable TV?<p>
Gbullpin:     Yes, cable service, too.<p>
GDorsey1:     Balance sheet looks ugly. Years away from any sort of earnings. Avoid.<p>
HKirschenm:     Any opinion on High Plains (HIPC)?<p>
GDorsey1:     High Plains's undervaluation mystifies me.<p>
BILVOL:     How about Novellus?<p>
GDorsey1:     I like Novellus. Overseas sales should ensure strong earnings. Buy.<p>
Nogoth6430:     What is your out look on AAPL?<p>
GDorsey1:     Apple always shines a faint light of hope. Japanese buyout probable in next few years. Decent speculation.<p>
Dan M999:     Greg, what do you think about AMD?<p>
GDorsey1:     AMD is an also-ran. Buy Intel.<p>
AK716:     How about TRV?<p>
GDorsey1:     TRV not likely to set world aflame, but good company.<p>
JOKECAAM:     USAir announced today it was buying upwards of maybe 400 planes.  Is this a stock to buy? I've heard USAir may go to 28-30.  Now at 18-19.  What do you think?<p>
GDorsey1:     No faith in the carrier.<p>
WorthEdit1:     That's all the time we have. Thank you, Greg, for your insights, and thanks to all of you for joining us for this evening's "Conference Call."<p>
GDorsey1:     Good night and thanks for coming.<p>
WorthEdit1:     Greg, tell them how they can get your newsletter.<p>
GDorsey1:     Visit www.investars.com.<p>
WorthEdit1:     It's a great service--we at Worth OnLine subscribe! Once again, thank you, Greg for taking the time to be here tonight.<p>

						On Wednesday, October 30, Victor Flores joined Worth OnLine for "Conference Call," our live online chat show. Flores is portfolio manager for the San Antonio-based United Services Global Investors. As geologist/chief investment officer, he makes more than 20 site visits a year to find suitable stocks for the company's World Gold Fund and Gold Shares Fund. Year-to-date, Flores's U.S. World Gold Fund (which buys non-South African gold equities) is up 26.2 percent. Following is a transcript of the evening's event, edited for clarity. The opinions expressed are those of Victor Flores, and do not express the views of the Worth OnLine, Worth magazine, or Capital Publishing. <p>
WorthOnLne : Welcome to "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's live weekly chat show series. Our guest tonight is Victor Flores (SN:USFlores). The floor is now open for the first question.<p>
Mmlm2      : Any comments on copper prices? I don't believe the China diversion theory. <p>
USFlores   : Mmlm2: Our opinion is that China did contribute to both running up the price of copper by withholding inventories and then to the decline by betraying Sumitomo.<p>
Caboman2   : Hello Victor, Do you have an opinion on Alta Gold? <p>
USFlores   : Caboman: We hold Alta in the World Gold Fund, compared to the valuation of similar companies Alta is undervalued. We have a target for the company up around $6. <p>
ZJEW       : Your comments on Ashanti?<p>
USFlores   : ZJEW: Ashanti has been a tough one because the stock has performed so poorly. I have visited the site twice; it is truly one of the greatest gold mining assets on Earth but it has been harder than they thought to bring the production up to planned levels. They have now completed the merger with Golden Shamrock which gives them a great growth profile. This is an 18 month story, but I would buy Ashanti with that view. <p>
Rebel boy1 : Your thoughts on Bema Gold's latest drilling announcement?<p>
USFlores   : Rebel: Bema's latest release was disappointing because it was low grade.<p>
EWS Leong  : What is your 1, 3, 5 year outlook on gold?<p>
USFlores   : EWS: Our view on gold continues to be constructive, driven by strong demand from the emerging markets.<p>
DCDCKC     : Victor, your comments on Aurizon/Toronto and Gold Canyon/Vancouver.<p>
USFlores   : DCD: We like Aurizon because it is an undervalued producer for its size. Gold Canyon we are not particularly fond of.<p>
Hallkcj    : How does Conseco look?<p>
USFlores   : Hall: Sorry, I don't follow Conseco.  <p>
KIT31KAT   : Opinion on Rea Gold?<p>
USFlores   : Kit: We like Rea. The start up at Mt. Hamilton mine has been tough, but the company has a good growth profile from Bisset in Canada and Uruguay.<p>
Caboman2   : In your opinion, is there any hope for Benguet?<p>
USFlores   : Caboman: Not too fond of Benguet. <p>
AVTinc     : How do you feel about gold Nusmatics<p>
USFlores   : AVT: Gold coins are a different world from gold stocks.<p>
Mmlm2      : At what price will copper stabilize? Any opinion on ASARCO? I am loaded on calls.<p>
USFlores   : Mmlm: Lots of copper questions. Inventories are down, copper still in backwardation, copper is good for a bounce here up to perhaps $0.90. Hold your Asarco calls. <p>
Ggruntt    : Opinion on BMG?<p>
USFlores   : Grunt: We hated the terms of the deal to acquire Hemlo; issued too much stock. Now the company is a buy for its moderate growth. <p>
AVTinc     : USFlores then your projections for gold mutual funds?<p>
USFlores   : AVT: I love the US World Gold Fund. Other well managed funds include Scudder and IDS. The gold funds will continue to do well if the industry continues to make significant discoveries.<p>
Cleotis69  : Feelings on Santa Fe Pacific Gold?<p>
USFlores   : Cleo: Santa Fe has a great deal of capital expenditure ahead. I would buy in the $9-10 range.<p>
Mkttmr4298 : When is the XAU going to move to the upside?<p>
USFlores   : XAU will move when gold moves. It is an index of large companies.<p>
Walt205    : What do you think of Fidelity American Gold? If you have an opinion. <p>
USFlores   : Walt: Fidelity American gold is very well-managed.<p>
DLarva7924 : Do you feel this is a timely venture into gold stocks, Mr. Flores?<p>
USFlores   : Dlarva: everyone should have 5-10% of their portfolio in gold stocks. It is a good diversifier. <p>
JGCFP1988  : Any comments on Golden Star Resources and near term potential?<p>
USFlores   : JGC: Golden Star has done a great job of capitalizing on the potential of gold exploration, but it is a difficult stock to value because it is always ahead of itself (stock price).<p>
Walt205    : I would like to get into a small, speculative gold company with realistic prospects. Ideas?<p>
USFlores   : Walt: Argosy Mining, great exploration project in Slovakia (AGO on Vancouver).<p>
DErnst3660 : The only demand for gold now is in India. What if Russia releases all its gold?<p>
USFlores   : Strong demand for gold throughout Asia, not only India. Russia has been accumulating, rather than selling, its gold (what little it has).<p>
DErnst3660 : The Russians can get gold from the ground at a fraction of our cost and they have plenty.<p>
USFlores   : The Russian gold industry has been in decline for decades. They have no capital for infrastructure or development.<p>
DErnst3660 : I don't believe that.<p>
USFlores   : Just look at the statistics of Russian gold production.<p>
Al2bert    : What is your opinion of Crystallex?<p>
USFlores   : Crystallex has done a good job of turning itself around. I have a lot of respect for the new CEO. Worth (no pun) keeping an eye on.<p>
Mmlm2      : Saw on AOL a major dumper of 20,000 oz silver. Any comments?<p>
USFlores   : Mmlm 20,000 oz of silver is a drop in the ocean.<p>
RGKEG      : Who are the Russians selling to?  Somebody is buying.<p>
USFlores   : RGK Gold producers (not just Russia) are selling to consumers of jewelry around the world.<p>
RGKEG      : The amount Russia has been dumping?  With no effect on price? Somebody must be holding.<p>
USFlores   : RGK: Russia is not dumping. They're production and reserves are small. Little impact.<p>
DErnst3660 : Jewelry doesn't account  for that much gold. Gold is stuck until something big happens.<p>
USFlores   : DEm: Correct, Gold is rangebound $380 - $400. Jewelry demand accounts for 75% of gold demand worldwide.<p>
DErnst3660 : I am not wearing the gold I own.<p>
USFlores   : DEm: You don't, but millions of Chinese, Indians, Europeans, Latin Americans are.<p>
DErnst3660 : Can they really afford to buy enough to drive prices up?<p>
USFlores   : DEm: Yes, by about $10 per year. <p>
RGKEG      : $10.00 a year? Big deal. Jewelry demand alone is not going to help gold in the long run. What about its value in relation to currencies, looking forward?<p>
USFlores   : RGK Jewelry demand will not lead to run in gold prices, but will support $10/year increase.<p>
Mmlm2      : Back to copper: if lime inventories decline 13000 again to 120k tons, any run in copper?<p>
USFlores   : MMlm: Yes, there is a possibility that a further drop in inventories will lead to a bounce.<p>
RogerDee99 : When do see South African gold stocks prices improving?<p>
USFlores   : Roger: this is a 18 to 24 month process. South African gold stocks will move with better US$ gold prices and with further restructuring.<p>
Cleotis69  : Gold is coming to major support, do you see upside before downside?<p>
USFlores   : Cleo: Gold very well supported by physical demand at $380. <p>
PEACHMO    : Victor, any opinion on Redfern Resources?<p>
USFlores   : Haven't followed Redfern for a while. Couldn't say.<p>
Cleotis69  : Why the break in January over $400.  Was it pure hype or demand?<p>
USFlores   : Cleo: driven by speculative demand. Gold fell when the physical market did not support<p>
RGKEG      : The downside here seems negligible.<p>
USFlores   : RGK: $10 per year is great for gold stocks.<p>
WALLSTLOVE : Mr. Flores, how about South African mining shares?<p>
USFlores   : WallSt: South Africa stocks look attractive, but currency is treacherous.<p>
Cigar64    : Any opinion on Homestake?<p>
USFlores   : Cigar: Homestake needs to find or buy something to continue growing. Not there yet.<p>
TNorth1662 : Hi, Victor. What are your thoughts on BEMA Gold, short & LONG TERM? Thanks.<p>
USFlores   : TNorth: Success of Bema will depend on drilling at Cerro Casale in Chile. So far it is big but very low grade. Need to hit some high grade to make it minable.<p>
DErnst3660 : U.S. producers are sitting on tons of gold they have mined but can't sell have not sold<p>
USFlores   : Dem: Not true, US producers sell every last ounce they produce.<p>
WALLSTLOVE : Mr. Flores, another way to play gold is put stock in your mutual fund company which I own, it seems to be stuck in a trading range though.<p>
USFlores   : Wallst: You are right. US Global Investors, symbol GROW. Stuck in a range because investors don't understand our situation. Have a look at our third quarter earnings when they are released!<p>
Sailmann   : Mr. Flores, do you have an opinion on Chase Resources? <p>
USFlores   : Sailmann: Chase is drilling a low grade copper property in Philippines. Not impressed.<p>
Cvtcvt     : Mr. Flores: any thoughts on silver mining stocks?<p>
USFlores   : Cvt: Most silver mining stocks are overpriced.<p>
DErnst3660 : SSC is not overpriced.<p>
USFlores   : DEm: I beg to differ I believe SSC is very overpriced.<p>
WALLSTLOVE : any plans for any new funds?<p>
USFlores   : Wallst: Stay tuned!<p>
Xuming     : Any opinion on CALVF on Nasdaq? <p>
USFlores   : Xuming: If CALVF is Caledonia, not impressed.<p>
Xuming     : It is Caledonia. The stock has fallen sharply of late, but the company is still doing a lot of drilling. Potential? <p>
USFlores   : Xuming: Would not own Caledonia.<p>
JOEBOSIR   : Mr. Flores, any opinion on Glamis Gold or Horsham?<p>
USFlores   : JOE: Glamis is OK, some growth, but already in the price. Horsham: buy Barrick instead.<p>
RLamon9684 : How are you reading Midas now  -- Euro and Franco Nevada?<p>
USFlores   : RLamon: Midas discovery growing: own Euro and Franco.<p>
Mi2501     : What about Echo Bay?<p>
USFlores   : Mi: Echo Bay has no growth. No growth = declining stock price.<p>
TNorth1662 : Mr. Flores, What do you think will happen to AGNICO EAGLE now that they have lost Mr. Penna.<p>
USFlores   : TNorth: Just met new Chairman, same management team is there.  Agnico will do fine.<p>
JOEBOSIR   : Mr. Flores, heard something today on CNBC about European countries selling gold reserves privately.<p>
USFlores   : JOE: Lucille Palermo from Van Eck Fund was explaining why the gold market got spooked. She went on to say (I agree) that further European gold sales are unlikely.<p>
DErnst3660 : I will continue to short gold until it hits $365/ounce.<p>
USFlores   : DEm: I would cover at $386.<p>
Devpuck    : If interest rates continue to fall will these stocks continue to take the gas pipe?<p>
USFlores   : Dev: On the contrary, low interest rates are great for gold which is great for gold stocks.<p>
Mmlm2      : Again on ASARCO, do you think with a book value of 45 the price at 26 is attractive? Can they be a takeover? Interest rates will rise after Clinton wins.<p>
USFlores   : Mlm: I don't think of Asarco as a takeover.<p>
Mmlm2      : Why?<p>
USFlores   : Mlm: Our view is that rates will rise after the election, regardless of winner.<p>
Cvtcvt     : Mr. Flores: do you know anything about Goldbelt, recently mentioned in the Gold newsletter?<p>
USFlores   : CVt: Goldbelt is trying (so far without success) to develop a project in Kazakstan. I would stay away from Kazakstan.<p>
Devpuck    : It appears to me that there is an inverse relationship between price of gold and interest rates. DO YOU AGREE?<p>
USFlores   : Dev: low interest rates good for stocks in general. Good for gold because gold does not produce income. Good gold price = good gold stock prices.<p>
Devpuck    : But in the recent period of DECLINING interest rates these stocks have gotten WHACKED. Gold is down over 50% from 1979 levels... I don't get what you are saying??<p>
USFlores   : Devpuck: not related to interest rates. Related to industry fundamentals.<p>
Devpuck    : If interest rates continue to fall (experts think they will)  will these stocks still be in the tank? Why if the price is low will gold stocks do well?? <p>
USFlores   : Devpuck: Gold is down 50% because it was driven to $800 by speculators.<p>
Devpuck    : It has nothing to do with interest rates or inflation... Is that your claim???????<p>
USFlores   : Dev: Correct.<p>
Devpuck    : Interesting.<p>
USFlores   : Dev: Back then (15 years) gold was driven by speculation re: inflation and interest rates. Today it is driven by jewelry demand.<p>
Devpuck    : But there will be speculation now that interest rates will fall even further in next few months.<p>
USFlores   : Dev: Hard to say. Our economist predicts an upward bias in rates post election.<p>
TGFGNUT    : If you haven't already discussed American Barrick, please do.<p>
USFlores   : TGF: Barrick is still the best managed gold company in the world. Still growing, still a buy.<p>
Mmlm2      : Does it pay to buy puts and calls on T-bills?<p>
USFlores   : Mlm: We do not use puts and calls to manage our T-bill exposure.<p>
WGeffeney  : What impact does South African social unrest have on future South African gold prices?<p>
USFlores   : WGeff: Social unrest has little impact, there are other alternatives (dollars, marks, etc).<p>
DLarva7924 : Would you agree that it will be a long time before there are significant variations in gold?<p>
USFlores   : DLarva: our view is gradually rising prices at $10 per year.<p>
TGFGNUT    : What should gold stocks do if there's a recession in 1997?<p>
USFlores   : TGF: Better question is: what will gold do in '97? If we have a slowdown in '97 then rates will come down.<p>
Trac16cat  : Russia is setting up a gold exchange..... Impact?<p>
USFlores   : Trac: Probably small. At least it reiterates our view that Russia is not a seller.<p>
Cvtcvt     : Mr. Flores: I'm interested in your thoughts on Miramar also...<p>
USFlores   : Cvt: Miramar is not a stock we have liked, even though it has done well. Their Con Mine in Canada is a high cost producer.<p>
RLamon9684 : International Pursuit/buy or sell?<p>
USFlores   : RLamon: International Pursuit. Drilling low grade copper deposit that will never be mined. SELL International Pursuit (IPJ on Toronto).<p>
WGeffeney  : Any general feeling on South African gold shares in future?<p>
USFlores   : WGeffeney: Industry finally restructuring. This is good. Buy some. <p>
Mmlm2      : I am skeptical on all these Canadian gold stocks. Any comments?<p>
USFlores   : Mmlm: Investors have made LOTS of money by judiciously investing in them.<p>
PEACHMO    : Victor, any opinion about geologist/CEO John Grieg BC?<p>
USFlores   : Peach: I like John Grieg. A solid fellow.<p>
BANKFUND   : Any thoughts on chances Canyon Resources/Phelps will get big Montana permit?<p>
USFlores   : Bankfund: I think there is a very good chance. McDonald Meadows is a great deposit which happens to sit on State land. The state will get a royalty if the mine is built.<p>
RLamon9684 : Rlamon  Your thoughts on El Callao?<p>
USFlores   : RLamon: Not crazy about El Callao.<p>
Jcolb747   : What is the outlook for gold and/or related stocks/funds?<p>
USFlores   : Jcob: Outlook for gold: good, with gradually rising prices. Gold Fund: depends on gold.<p>
FAMSEVEN   : Your thoughts on Bema Gold?<p>
USFlores   : FAM: Lots of folks on the line tonight asking about Bema. Will depend on whether the drilling in Chile hits some high grade zones. I think their project is not minable at current grades.<p>
Inagy      : Mr. Flores, what are your thoughts on Battle Mountain Gold?<p>
USFlores   : Inagy: Hated Hemlo deal: issued too many shares. Now that it's declined it is a buy.<p>
TGFGNUT    : Mr. Flores...Any quick rules of thumb to determine fair value of a gold stock?<p>
USFlores   : TGF: Market capitalization per ounce of reserves. Should be less than $250 for senior gold producers, less than $125 for medium size companies, less than $50 for exploration.<p>
RLee968757 : Mr. Flores, any word about United Services Gold Shares? <p>
USFlores   : RLee: Gold Shares dependent on successful restructuring of South African mining industry.<p>
Inagy      : Mr. Flores, what are your thoughts on Hecla Mining?<p>
USFlores   : Inagy: They did a very poor job at Grouse Creek, must prove to the market they can develop properties properly. Wouldn't buy yet.<p>
Inagy      : Hecla is at 10 year low at 5 3/4. What price is a good buy? <p>
USFlores   : Inagy: We might be close on Hecla! <p>
JMccu42574 : Does not GLG have 3 million in cash, no debt?<p>
USFlores   : JM: GLG just raised a lot of money to bill the Indian Rose project. I would not consider it. A takeover candidate at these prices.<p>
RLamon9684 : Is Joutel worth a fling? <p>
USFlores   : RLamon: Not interested in Joutel's Cuban stuff, but the stuff in Canada is not too bad.<p>
FAMSEVEN   : Heard about change in mining laws in China, mining industry supposedly on fire.  <p>
USFlores   : FAM: The process of changing China's mining law has gone very slowly. We still have no precedent, no projects successfully developed by Western companies. We'll see...<p>
RLee968757 : Do you see any light at the end of the tunnel in South Africa?<p>
USFlores   : RLee: Yes! The restructuring is underway. New companies being formed with potential for growth and more efficient corporate structures<p>
Mmlm2      : Mr. Flores: Do you see any downside for ASARCO below 25?<p>
USFlores   : Mmlm: Asarco: looks good, could go lower. Just kidding. Stock well supported in low 20s.<p>
BANKFUND   : Mr Flores: Is Canyon Resources a buy before they get the Montana decision?<p>
USFlores   : BankFund: Of greater importance is the startup at the Briggs Mine in California. If Briggs works well, Canyon a buy even before Montana decision. Montana is gravy!<p>
Trac16cat  : Your opinion on Alta Gold?<p>
USFlores   : Alta: buy with a $6 target.<p>
WorthOnLne : Thank you for your time Victor.  You did a fantastic job! That Concludes this evenings "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's live weekly chat series. The Worth staff extends its appreciation to Mr. Flores for being our guest this evening.<p>

						On Wednesday, October 23, Jim McCamant, editor of the "Medical Technology Stock Letter," joined Worth OnLine for a live "Conference Call." The "Medical Technology Stock Letter" provides expert analysis of developments and investment opportunities in the area of medical biotechnology. Although the biotechnology "crash" of 1992 has made positive returns hard to come by in recent years, the stocks recommended by McCamant's MTSL rose 108 percent in 1995. Follows is a transcript from the evening's event, edited for clarity. The opinions expressed are those of Jim McCamant, and do not represent those of Worth, Worth OnLine, or Capital Publishing.<p>
OnlineHost : Welcome to "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's live chat show series. Tonight we welcome Jim McCamant, widely recognized as the leading authority on biotech stocks. Tonight, McCamant will talk about the buzz on biotech stocks before Oppenheimer's Seventh Annual Healthcare Conference. Welcome, Mr. McCamant. First we'll hear some opening remarks from our guest.<p>
MTSL       : This is a great time to look at biotech with the stocks up from July lows but still a lot of bargains available.  More opportunities as we hit tax loss selling time... The key is that the science is making excellent progress and products are moving to market.<p>
Question   : Chris 44j asks: What is your short- and long-term outlook for Isis Pharmaceuticals?<p>
MTSL       : ISIP has been a buy recommendation for a number of years.  Now a buy under  $20. Short-term price action will be impacted by the large short interest and news on clinical trials or additional corporate partnerships. Long-term we think that their leadership in antisense and excellent management will make the company a winner.<p>
Question   : Vromans asks: What is wrong with XOMA? The balance sheet looks great but the stock price continues to decline. <p>
MTSL       : Investors seem to have been upset by their recent private placement, it is creating an opportunity. We think they will have some more good clinical results by year-end and the stock should move up.<p>
Question   : ArthurF916 asks: What are ImunoGen Corporation's prospects?<p>
MTSL       : We have its as a buy under $8.  The company has one product in Phase III trials and more on the way.  They are also a potential buy out as the stock is a big discount to private market value.<p>
Question    : DeboraMJ22 asks: Where is EMIS going? Is oral delivery of complex medications a distant hope, or a near future reality?<p>
MTSL       : It will take longer than most investors expect to get drugs to market, but the concept is finally being proven.  The stock should stay volatile as a result.<p>
Question   : Fishfar asks: I understand that Acuson's ultra-sound technology is state-of-the-art, but too expensive. Can this company find a market and grow earnings?<p>
MTSL       : Acuson is a leader but this market is very competitive.  I think they will be a long-term winner, but you should buy it when it is down not after it moves up.<p>
Question   : Which of the second tier biotechs have the greatest potential to move into the top tier?<p>
MTSL       : A number of companies are in that process. Isis which is mentioned above, Agouron and ICOS are ones we like.  Also, Centocor, Nexstar and others which are turning profitable will be moving up.<p>
Question   : What do you think of Amgen?<p>
MTSL       : Amgen is the clear leader and is fairly valued on current earnings, our problem with the stock is the relatively weak pipeline.  We think news on competition for their two existing products could hurt the stock and thus we would avoid it.<p>
Question   : Do you follow Martek Bioscience?  What do you think about the company?<p>
MTSL       : The technology is interesting. Their additives for baby formula is needed and will be adopted. The question is how soon and when will completion emerge.  We are neutral on the stock.<p>
Question   : When should we expect a turnaround in Chiron's stock price?  Also, what is the potential for Chiron/JNJ's Regranex wound healing agent? <p>
MTSL       : Chiron's stock seems to be building a base and a move up could come almost any time.  CHIR is favorite among the large biotech stocks.  It has great products coming along and great science. We consider it a core position in the group. The wound healing agent has big potential and they will file for marketing approval next month. Maybe that will get the stock moving.<p>
Question   : ACavan asks: What are your short and long term thoughts on Enzo Biochem?<p>
MTSL       : Enzo is a stock that we are negative about. They never seem to fulfill the hype.  The loss of the patent suit to Calgene removes a lot of the potential and we would sell the stock.<p>
Question   : What do you think of Glaxo, and its chances of coming around?<p>
MTSL       : Glaxo is a great long-term success story and will continue to prosper long-term.  We do not follow it closely because we see much bigger potential in the biotech stocks.<p>
Question   : You didn't mention Ligand among those second tier companies with the best prospects of moving up?  How do you feel about their prospects?<p>
MTSL       : Ligand does fit into that category and we are recommending purchase below $14.  We think the value may be slower to surface because it is a complicated story, but long term excellent. Value may be slower to surface because the technology is complicated, but great long term.<p>
Question   : Is AMAT still a buy here, what has been driving down?<p>
MTSL       : AMAT is in semiconductor equipment.  We do not follow it.<p>
Question   : Which of the companies doing diabetes research do you like the best?<p>
MTSL       : Our favorite stocks in diabetes area are Amylin, which is product in Phase III, and Shaman which just signed a great partnership with the German Merck to develop drugs to treat type II diabetes. Both stocks are attractive at current levels with SHMN a real bargain.<p>
Question   : Biogen's pipeline looks very weak compared to Chiron's, so why has BGEN been on such a run and CHIR isn't?<p>
MTSL       : Most Wall Street analysts take a very short-term view.  The biotech version of momentum investing. We think that is a big mistake and the long-term values in Chiron are much greater.<p>
Question   : Long- and short-term comments on Sibia Neuroscience, please.<p>
MTSL       : Sibia seems interesting but we do not yet have an opinion.  The neuroscience area is very competitive and we think investors should move carefully in this sector.  We have recommended both Cocensy and CytoTherapeutics in this sector.<p>
Question   : When do you think Somatogen will get market approval for OPTRO?<p>
MTSL       : We expect OPTRO to be approved in late 1988, or 1999.  This would be about one year after filing. We think SMTG is very attractive at current levels, as some negative reports from UBS have driven the price down.  There is also a large short position now, so any move will be accelerated.<p>
Question   : Any thoughts on AFFX?<p>
MTSL       : A very interesting company, with interesting technology, but we think that is already in the price of the stock.  So we are neutral here. <p>
Question   : At the last Worth Chat, you mentioned a company called Celtrix.   I can not find a symbol or any info on this company.  Possibly, I jotted down wrong company name, would appreciate any info on this.  Thank you.<p>
MTSL       : Celtrix is a smaller biotech company symbol CTRX.  We like the IGF with its binding protein that they are developing.  Big potential but not in the stock.  It is also a take over possibility.<p>
Question   : Immunex has been a dead issue for several years, is there any life left in this company?<p>
MTSL       : Yes, in fact they presented some very positive Phase II data on their treatment for rheumatoid arthritis at the recent rheumatology conference.  It showed a very high response rate and they are beginning a Phase III.  Near term result will be helped by the approval of Noatrone to treat prostate cancer.  We have it as a buy under $18.<p>
Question   : Is Somatagen still leader in blood substitutes?  Any idea of approximate time to market? Where is your buy limit?<p>
MTSL       : Somatogen is one of leaders.  We expect Baxter to be first to market, but they will be supply limited as they use outdated blood.  Somatogen is  most likely to be on market in 1999.<p>
Question   : What is your opinion on Cephalon's Myotrophin? Why did they sell the Beltsville, Maryland pharmaceutical manufacturing facility? Is that a bad sign?<p>
MTSL       : They sold plant because Chiron will manufacture for sale.  Marketing application should be filed by year end.  This product should get approval in about six months.<p>
WorthOnLne : We have time to answer two more questions.<p>
Question   : What is the future for ATIS-Advanced Tissue?<p>
MTSL       : They have some interesting products and we think they will be modest success, but all of the positives seem to be in the price already and we like other stocks more.<p>
Question   : What is your favorite gene company, recombinant, protein expression, anti cancer approach, etc.?<p>
MTSL       : We think that gene therapy is a difficult area and have been cautious.  Our one recommendation is GeneMedicine which has some interesting products in clinical trials and is very cheap at current price levels.  We have it as a buy under $6.<p>
WorthOnLne : I'm afraid that's all we have time for tonight.<p>
OnlineHost : This concludes this edition of "Conference Call." Thanks for taking part in the chat. And thank you, Mr. McCamant, for joining us for this evening's "Conference Call."<p>

On Wednesday, October 16 at 8 P.M. EDT, Michael Murphy joined Worth OnLine for our live chat show, "Conference Call." Murphy, is the editor of the "California Technology Stock Letter," focusing on medical and technology stocks, and the "Overpriced Stock Service," a short-selling investment advisory newsletter. Following is a transcript of the live event, edited for clarity. The opinions expressed are those of Michael Murphy, and do not represent the views of Worth, Worth OnLine, or Capital Publishing.<p>
WorthEdit1 : Welcome to "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's live chat show series. Our guest tonight is Michael Murphy, who will talk about third quarter earnings reports and big news from the American Electronics Association's Fall financial conference. His screen name is JMurphy477. First we'll start with a question posted on our message boards for you.<p>
WorthEdit1 : FBARONE asks if GNTA is still a buy or should he "head for the hills before you do."<p>
JMurphy477 : Genta Inc. (NASD:GNTA) is a strong buy.  They should announce their restructuring by the end of this month.  Two investment groups ready to finance the two halves of the company.  Stock is at $1.  I think it goes straight to 3 when the deal is announced.  <p>
WMair      : Wmair wants opinions on IDTI and CRUS.<p>
JMurphy477 : Integrated Device Tech. (NASD:IDTI) a very strong buy.  Announced Sept Q loss yesterday, took stock down only $5/8 today.  Up and away from here. Cirrus Logic (NASD:CRUS) has moved up sharply but can be bought under $27 for a further move to $45.<p>
WorthEdit1 : Do you still feel like Genus could go to the high teens this year?<p>
JMurphy477 : Genus Inc. (NASD:GGNS) should hit high teens within 12 months.  The semi-equip stocks probably won't do much until December. Quarter EPS are out of the way -- late January -- but we think 1997 will be up, not down as Wall Street expects.  <p>
CAnd34     : Thanks for being here, is the most money going to be made in cell altering or DNA studies?<p>
JMurphy477 : That's a tough one.  Both are going to be very lucrative.  The gene sequencing companies collect royalties and have no drug development risk. The gene therapy companies will have successful drugs and with only 2 drugs, Amgen (NASD:AMGN) has a $16 billion market cap.  We own them all.<p>
Gilliatt   : Thoughts on CSCC ?<p>
JMurphy477 : Cascade Communications (NASD:CSCC) is in a wonderful business but competiton is increasing rapidly.  My guess is they can continue to grow rapidly, but at a lower profit margin. The stock is 127 times earnings (116 times the estimate) so I'd rather wait until the deteriorating profit margins are in the stock.<p>
Gilliatt   : CSCC is also about 30 times sales. Iomega (NASD:IOMG) was only about 8 times sales at 55.<p>
BradT45527 : What's going on with Shiva?<p>
JMurphy477 : Shiva (NASD:SHVA) is going to be a big player in remote access, but that area (mobile devices) has been slow to take off.  Although the stock is down from $87, I'd rather see it under $30 before buying.<p>
CAnd34     : If President Clinton wins again, will bio tech and meds tank again?<p>
JMurphy477 : Reelection of Clinton should be no problem, because there will be a Republican Congress and no way will they reintroduce the health care bill. That was the cause of the fear last time.<p>
TILT96     : What are your thoughts regarding Novell? <p>
JMurphy477 : Novell (NASD:NOVL) is a sell.  Don't get in a fight with Microsoft (NASD:MSFT). <p>
Wall441043 : Does MU have a future...have DRAM prices turned around?<p>
JMurphy477 :  DRAM prices have stopped plunging and bounced a bit. But they should resume their 28%/year normal decline.  I think Micron Technology (NYSE:MU) will lose money in a couple of quarters, so would sell the stock here.<p>
Tipman     : When is he going to tell us what he is recommending now?<p>
JMurphy477 : Tipman We are recommedning semi stocks (IDTI, CRUS, Cyprus Semiconductor (NYSE:CY), LSI Logic (NYSE:LSI), SEEQ Technology (NASD:SEEQ). Also semi equipment... Applied Material Tech. (NASD:AMAT), GGNS, Mattson Technology (NASD:MTSN), Plasma & Materials Tech. (NASD:PMAT) and Ontrak Systems Inc. (NASD:ONTK). Also some things that haven't moved: Ross Systems (NASD:ROSS), Euphonix Inc (NASD:EUPH), Exabyte Corp. (NASD:EXBT), Sonic Solutions (NASD:SNIC) and lots of biotechs.  Half our money is in biotech.<p>
Jpiper77   : Is MU a short sale here?<p>
JMurphy477 : I wouldn't short MU because we should have a broad tech stock upswing through February/March. In that environment MU could hold flat or inch higher, but an IDTI would double.<p>
BigRedd425 : What do you think about the "box" companies as opposed to the semi's?<p>
JMurphy477 : Good question. The box companies spend less on R&D and benefit from low component prices. So right now, the box companies that sell to corporate America -- International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Compaq Computer (NYSE:CPQ), Dell Computer (NASD:DELL) -- should be in good shape. Long-term we think more value is added at the chip level; I'd rather own Intel than Compaq but nothing wrong with owning both right now.<p>
Amobius    : Both HOLX and LUNR have dropped, would you buy them here?<p>
JMurphy477 : Hologic Inc. (NASD:HOLX) can be bought here. There is a big medtech conference January 6-8 that will focus attention on these stocks. Lunar Corp. (NASD:LUNR) I don't know.<p>
JLund1609  : Any thoughts on NETC?<p>
JMurphy477 : I just don't see how the ISPs sell anthing but commodity Internet time in the long run. AT&T (NYSE:T) is bound to offer $3 to $5 monthly flat fee access within a year or so. I would sell them all, even Netcom Online Communications Services (NASD:NETC).<p>
Le Roy7    : Could you comment on your favorite shorts?<p>
JMurphy477 : Favorite shorts?  Not too many right now. We are short Qualcomm Inc. (NASD:QCOM), which has the wrong technology for digital cellular.  We're short some development stage med tech -- Organogenesis (ASE:ORG) and Epitope Inc. (ASE:EPT).  Also Thermolase (ASE:TLZ).<p>
GSCA71268  : Michael, since the NASDAQ is heavy on technical stocks, would you short the entire NASDAQ?<p>
JMurphy477 : This is the wrong time of year to short technology. Big AEA Financial Conference Oct 28-30 plus amny brokerage firm conferences right through next April.  Analysts start to focus on how good things can be in 1997, instead of how disappointing 1996 is and the stocks move up.  We are fully invested today. <p>
MadSlav    : Any thoughts on Calgene? <p>
JMurphy477 : Calgene (NASD:CGNE) is not expensive but it will be a long time doing much. Turns out developing agbiotech is no easier than developing biotech drugs. We don't own it.  Ask McCamant on 10/23 chat.<p>
TopCat7529 : What's your favorite stock to buy tomorrow for short term gain?<p>
JMurphy477 : Favorite stock in electronics is IDTI.  In biotech is GNTA for next 4 weeks, Ligand Pharmaceuticals (NASD:LGND) for longer.<p>
DohertyMA  : Biotech comments?  Cephalon?  AGPH?<p>
JMurphy477 : Cephalon is doing well in clinicals and the stock should move higher as they progress.  Good hold. Agouron Pharmaceuticals (NASD:AGPH) I think is ahead of itself on interest in protease.  I'd swap it for LGND, Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals (NASD:RZYM). Vical (NASD:VICL) etc.<p>
PoliceHead : Mr. Murphy, do you read AOL's message boards for any reason whatsoever? For what reason?<p>
JMurphy477 : Gulp!  Yes, I do read Motley Fool, but mainly for potential short ideas. Stocks then to get total market capitalizations all out of proportion to their business opportunity, even when they are good companies like IOMG.  We are short Diana (NYSE:DNA), Chesapeake Energy Corp. (NYSE:CHK) now. I read and post to Silicon Investor on the Web -- it is excellent.<p>
Elmo 83    : What's your opinion on CSCO?<p>
JMurphy477 : Cisco Systems (NASD:CSCO) is fully priced, Bay Networkds (NYSE:BAY) is cheap, both are a wonderful business -- building out the 'net. I spent the last 3 weeks in China -- lots of Internet access in the big cities -- everyone wants access.<p>
Gempler    : Seagate?<p>
JMurphy477 : Seagate Technology (NYSE:SEG) is the best of the drive companies. We hold it. It's had quite a run, so our new buys are focused in semis/semi equipment, but we also like the SEG convertible bonds for income accounts, even at these levels.<p>
Barbarczuk : AAPL??? Upcoming analysts conference -- usually a positive sign?<p>
JMurphy477 : Today's Apple Computer (NASD:AAPL) positive earnings were very good news. Mostly from cost cutting. I'd still like to see a vision different from and better than Wintel.  Stock traded to $30 in aftermarket, probably will trade in a $20 to $30 range into the spring.<p>
DerekDeV1  : Do you follow HMTT, good earnings and great product! Also FRLN, network routers etc.<p>
JMurphy477 : HMT Technology (NASD:HMTT) is a good little disk company, but I don't understand the valuation compared to Stormedia Inc. (NASD:STMD) or Komag (NASD:KMAG). Farallon Communications (NASD:FRLN) makes great products and the total market cap isn't gross.  We're doing a lot of work on it now.<p>
Ooop1      : USRX please.<p>
JMurphy477 : US Robotics (NASD:USRX) is in great shape because they dominate the retail channel.  Retailers love them.  The modem biz has topped out (no higher speeds), so they have to make a tricky technical transition to ISDN and cable modems.  But they can buy the technology.  I call the stock a hold today, buy under $50, sell at new highs. <p>
R0515      : Any thoughts on OAKT? Earnings on 10/22.<p>
JMurphy477 : Oak Technology (NASD:OAKT) was a one-product idea.  It worked, nothing has since. I think we should wait to see if they can get something else going and turn profitable. This is a difficult turnaround because every other choice has lots of comptetiton. <p>
CAnd34     : Sybase buy or sell?<p>
JMurphy477 : Sybase (NASD:SYBS) is a sell.  Well behind Oracle (NASD:ORCL) in technology and far, far behind Informix (NASD:IFMX).  Both ORCL and SYBS have to completely rewrite their RDBMS.  At least ORCL has a large market share to carry them through.<p>
Amobius    : VISX came down with BEAM. Is VISX a good value? Excimer laser in review, exped?? <p>
JMurphy477 : Re: Summit Technology (NASD:BEAM) and VISX (NASD:VISX), be careful.  The FDA data on these eye lasers was poor.  70 percent still need glasses. About 10 percent lost night driving vision permanently. Small percentage had really serious deteriorating vision. And it isn't reimbursed, it's cosmetic.  I think this will be a slow go.<p>
Elmo 83    : BAY a buy?<p>
JMurphy477 : Re: BAY a buy. Favorite "very low" prices would be Genta $1, Adaptive Solutions (NASD:ADSO) $1 1/8. <p>
Ormerod1D  : What is your best long term pick? <p>
JMurphy477 : Best long term pick is VICL, Vical, the leader in gene therapy.  Sells today for $15 3/8.  Should be 10 times that in 5 years. <p>
JBShaw     : Mr. Murphy, any comments on AOL?<p>
JMurphy477 : America Online (NYSE:AOL) -- hope nobody's lurking -- we're short and holding.  I don't think the current $300M ad spending will work.  Longer term, constant profit margin pressures.<p>
Elmo 83    : CUBE- buy sell or hold?<p>
JMurphy477 : C-Cube Microsystems (NASD:CUBE) is a hold at best.  Good people, good technology.  But IBM is out with hot competitive chips at lower prices.  CUBE will never see 65% growth margins again.<p>
R0515      : Why do you like IDTI so well? Price range in one year?<p>
JMurphy477 : IDTI is 50 percent SRAM, where prices have flattened. They are the low cost supplier. They own the next "SRAM" technology, fusion memory.  The other 50 percent is value added logic chips.  Stock down 70 percent.  No one on Wall Street likes it.  Analyst meeting November 1st. <p>
Ty4545     : What are your thoughts on GENUS?<p>
JMurphy477 : GGNS will have weak Sept and DEC q due to semi plant pushouts, but we expect pushouts to become pullins starting in March -- a fast turnaround -- Wall Street thinks 1997 will be down.  Wrong!  It will be nicely up.  <p>
SIMMIR     : Michael, why has INSITE VISION turned into such a bust since you said over a year ago that it would be worth $30 in 2 years?<p>
JMurphy477 : Insite Vision (NASD:INSV) -- They are executing well and should announce 2 more corporate deals before year end, then file for first FDA approval early in 1997. Will have a strong presentation at H&Q Medtech Conference Jan 6-8.  We are loaded up with the stock. <p>
SSPARSONS  : Any comment on NINE Visual?  They are competitors with SIII in 3D graphics tech.<p>
JMurphy477 : Number Nine Visual Tech (NASD:NINE) is a good focused company on graphics. S3 (NASD:SIII) seems to get chips out a little faster and skim the cream.  <p>
Elmo 83    : CRUS- buy sell or hold?<p>
JMurphy477 : CRUS seems to get smaller chips out and get the volume.  I'm not sure what NINE can do about that.  I'd rather own S3 or CRUS.<p>
Ficionado  : Mr Murphy, any input on RDRT -- Read Rite Corp?<p>
JMurphy477 : First Read Rite (NASD:RDRT) is not going to have a great quarter, but people are looking to 1997.  RDRT did get qualified at a couple of major customers, and 1997 will be a strong disk drive year -- typical desktop system will have 2 gig at beginning of year and 4.3 gig by next Christmas.  For new money I wouldn't chase RDRT, but it's a good hold.<p>
RickGudorf : NVLS (Novellus)? <p>
JMurphy477 : NVLS is caught in the pushout of semi plants.  I think it and Lam Research Corp. (NASD:LRCX) are dirt cheap.  We've recommended so many semi equipment stocks in CTSL I'm hesitant to add more, but those 2 are buys.<p>
KRISTYVARN : What about LSI Logic? Good Investment?<p>
JMurphy477 : LSI is a good buy still -- broad exposure to PC for upswing. Cable modem -- too early, but I'll bet USRX, FRLN and Global Village Communication (NASD:GVIL) get a big share of market. <p>
Petroman2  : Mr. Murphy, Madge seems to be basing here... time to buy or avoid?<p>
JMurphy477 : I don't follow Madge Networks (NASD:MADGF), although the business obviously is great.  <p>
SIMMIR     : Michael I love SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <p>
JMurphy477 : AND I LOVE SUGEN (NASD:SUGN) MORE THAN YOU DO.<p>
RBHMMM     : Elaine Garazelli is selling ALL. Comments, Mr. Murphy, on her last letter that the BIG crash is coming?<p>
JMurphy477 : Big Crash?  Not likely unless inflation really explodes -- no sign, or the economy slows sharply -- no sign. We could have a bear market in 1997 just by going from 18 times DJIA eps to 13 times EPS. Use index uts. to protect your portfolio, but stay invested in technology. Many times DJIA goes down and tech holds flat or goes up.<p>
Llau2828   : Is PRST a short? <p>
JMurphy477 : Prestek (NASD:PRST) is a short, but put a stop loss in at $90. <p>
GBernst23  : Mr. Murphy, your thoughts on USRX, short term.<p>
JMurphy477 : USRX: a good short term buy.  <p>
KRISTYVARN : What about Intuit, Mr. Murphy?<p>
JMurphy477: Intuit (NASD:INTU) is not quite there, but we'd love to own it under $25.<p>
Garfi      : Long and short-term outlook for biotech company -- Chiron?<p>
JMurphy477 : Some repeats here.  Chiron (NASD:CHIR) is a great core holding -- like a biotech mutual fund, they have so many things going on -- and it's cheap under $20. <p>
Rev Shark  : SNIC?<p>
JMurphy477 : SNIC -- just listed it as a cheap stock a few minutes ago. Great play on DVD. <p>
JimMAXED   : Has anyone ever heard of CA?<p>
JMurphy477 : Computer Associates International (NYSE:CA) is a broad-based software co, very exposed to mainframes. Solid, not exciting.<p>
RBHMMM     : What about Silicon Graphics?<p>
JMurphy477 : Silicon Graphics (NYSE:SGI) -- look out for. MSFT competition. 900 of SGI 3000 engineers have quit this year!  Thanks, everyone.<p>

Among his prophecies have been the Tokyo Market Crash, the day the DJIA broke 3000, the day gold broke 400, and the '89 mini-crash. Weingarten's Astrologers Fund Inc., New York, is introducing three funds next year--the Jupiter Fund (growth) and the Saturn Fund (value/income), and the Pluto Fund (hedge). He is also the author of "Investing by the Stars." Follows is a transcript of the evening's chat, edited for clarity. The opinions expressed are Henry Weingarten's, and do not reflect the views of Worth, Worth OnLine, or Capital Publishing. <p>
WorthEdit3 : Welcome to "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's live chat show series. Every week we give readers the opportunity to chat with the leaders in money and markets. Check our site (Keyword: Worth) for a calendar of upcoming events. Tonight, Henry Weingarten will discuss what's in the stars for the overall market, individual sectors, and specific stocks.<p>
WorthEdit1 : Okay, Henry, I'm going to start with a tough one. Some say this astrology thing is a ruse. What do you say to the non-believers?<p>
AFund      : Well I was an astrologer for 20 years BEFORE doing the markets. Wrote several books etc. on the subject. Also my forecasting record is outstanding as seen on our Web site -- articles and forum on AOL. So while obviously good for marketing, IT WORKS.<p>
Markets are determined by
1) fundamentals
2) technicals
3) market timing and psychology 
4) is CHARTED by astrology<p>
Probergum  : What are your feelings about the market after the election?<p>
AFund      : DOWN DOWN DOWN. That is for November. Of course we go up again with January-March, then down again.<p>
AFund      : I believe November a very down month for lots of reasons -- both astro and non-astro. Non- astro -- fed will raise November 13. Even if they don't -- market will be afraid until then. End of October, market afraid because of uncertainty of election. Also there are astro reasons November down. But we are know markets NEVER GO DOWN so WILL BE UP in January and February. Thereafter March on-- don't bet on it!!! We will be shorting more than currently!!!<p>
RWaldock   : Do you come to the same conclusions as Arch Crawford?<p>
AFund      : I don't know Arch's opinions all the time, but recently he wrote that we agreed THIS TIME. However Arch is more pessimistic about the world than I believe I am. I always feel like an optimist when I talk with Arch.<p>
WorthEdit1 : TSalem3368 asked : What's good play tomorrow?<p>
AFund      : Actually wasn't playing anything tomorrow -- we made a lot on a short on a company that all of us are familiar with -- won't mention names, but was 35 on Monday :) Currently need 30 :) Actually BEST PLAY: I would say to write November calls on OEX if that is your type of play. Also like silver (physical). Will think of some others shortly.<p>
RWaldock   : Are you bullish till November?<p>
AFund      : No, see October as trading month -- with downward basis -- that is to end 5959 (77 X 77) quite high -- most professionals scared sh**. Little good valuation. Maybe 6000 -- maybe 6100, but so what? Risk/reward terrible. I would say we will be lower end of month than now and we are Just looking for good shorts in general, except some special microcap plays.<p>
Serpay     : What's a Pisces to invest in these days<p>
AFund      : Pisces question too general Serpay.  Based on whole horoscope!!!!<p>
WorthEdit1 : How much does the INVESTOR's sign matter in this market?<p>
AFund      : Signs don't matter MUCH. Some people are VERY much like their signs -- I am a LEO for example, a textbook Leo. I like markets because I get to be right every day (almost :) In a moment will give you a perfect play for Leos but some people are not also moon, ascendant, and planets play a role. Much too general need time, place, and date of birth to see whole chart, then can judge. Some details in Investing by the Stars by Henry Weingarten. ALSO best astrological trade? Buy a Leo for what he/she is worth. Sell them for what they think they are worth!!! <p>
RWaldock   : Where do you see Nasdaq and Dow bottoming out next year and when?<p>
AFund      : Who said next year is a bottom, maybe 98. Seven years often down years but 8 not necessarily up. No recession for a long time. Too long a time most economists and I agree see one next year or two -- I emphasize two!!! Certainly we can go to 5000 EASILY and 1000 on Nasdaq. Remember with Jupiter, Uranus and Jupiter Neptune conjunction in 1997. This will be PEAK FOR MARKET then more realistic as time goes on. You think the markets always go up -- remember 1980's real estate always went up. Never lost in real estate until... Well, same with stock market. However...always good plays. If you bought real estate in 1987 may or may NOT be even without inflation. Will be same for markets -- in next two years!!!<p>
WorthEdit1 : How heavily do you weight astrology in your overall analysis of a stock?<p>
AFund      : I am primarily a financial astrologer. I do charts of incorporation and times of first listing, sometimes also CEO or key personnel. I also look at technicals and investing in trading mostly astrology and technicals in investing mostly fundamentals and astrology. That is my edge the market surprises!!!!<p>
Serpay     : Does the Sign of A CEO affect your decisions on stocks?<p>
AFund      : Signs-- no his whole horoscope, but only if identified with company or a start up. Many times CEO is creamed and stock goes up right? Other times, golden parachute and stock tanks. If identified like Lee Iacocca with Chrysler etc., then yes.<p>
SISU SUE   : What microcaps look good to you?<p>
AFund      : We are looking at a number of junior gold and anyone who has ever visited my site knows I love IHI -- my favorite stock pick, the next Microsoft. Also the baby AQX.A just 25 undervalued more 150%. But check out keyword: astrologers fund for a number of picks. But if just one  V.IHI or IHITF. 1-800-838-8090. Check it out.<p>
AWENCH3373 : Should my astrological chart be in sync with a company I want to invest in?<p>
AFund      : A Wench- depends. If you are running the company, yes. If you are a major shareholder, yes! If you want to buy at a good time, yes. But in general no, however if you ever sell a stock that goes up right afterwards or vice versa your horoscope's NOT in sync. For long term holdings and major holdings, yes. Wear a portfolio like clothing -- you should be comfortable with it. Besides, an awful lot of work to chart for some companies we look at the buyers' horoscopes!!! When buying a small cap company, look at your chart. If it goes well you will probably do well. <p>
WorthEdit1 : Can you give us your international outlook?<p>
AFund      : Yes! love Japan for 1997. Called the top and bottoms in those markets in my book. For example, yen UNDERVALUED. So Japan #1 for 1997. Mid-1998-1999  I like Italy -- lire undervalued now. And I like Canada -- 1997 again. And Australian/New Zealand real estate in the next few years, due to Asian money pouring in.<p>
BeyReg     : I am an astrologer, but I do not practice financial astrology -- any hints??<p>
AFund      : 1) read my book Investing by the Stars
2) go to conferences November 1/2  in NYC and May 16-18 NYC
3) read other books
4) get books with horoscopes of DJIA and S&P 500 and take one or two examples and try to predict. When successful, another one or two. When successful, put up REAL MONEY!!!! TEST, most ideas don't work. Will be posting interesting study in Britain in markets which had several failures of popular theories, not mine!!!!<p>
Antonia123 : Gold...time to buy or sell? What do the stars say?<p>
AFund      : Gold I LOVE gold  -- ONLY GOLD IS AS GOOD AS GOLD. Wait till after November games are over XAU 173+ that's more than 50% in 8 months, especially after January. Silver even better. Of course until November watch out for Rubin/IMF Games we do have inflation. Anyone eaten recently? Bought gas etc.? Only computers down :) <p>
Joshi1111:  Any stocks under $10? <p>
AFund      : Josh under $10 -- why not IHI only 1.75?<p>
MF Value   : AFund... XAU at 173... I doubt it. Especially not by the end of the year.<p>
AFund      : MF value- I called both days gold took out 400 and top day at under 420. I called last two moves on XAU could be wrong. But wait until May -- if so, then tell me I'm wrong. Okay to doubt but that is good sign no one wants gold, very small market cap under coke size. So little goes very, very long way. Also don't forget Yeltsin, China, Middle East, US dollar... we will see!!!<p>
MF Value   : Well... I've bought puts twice in 4 months when it hits 130+. Haven't suffered yet. Actually covered the other day at 115.<p>
AFund      : Hey two ways to make money, MF, up or down? Traders do it both ways.<p>
Joshi1111  : Why do you pick IHI, and its expected price?<p>
AFund      : IHI is the next Microsoft -- International Hi-Tech Industries. This is a revolutionary process totally different. <p>
Joshi1111  : Do you have a toll-free number? <p>
AFund      : I do not -- have forum on AOL keyword: astrologers fund or Web site www.afund.com. Anyways, there is an IHI posting there which tells my views, why I think it's going to $10, then $30, then $100!! Read it there! Or call company for details and check it out yourself.<p>
SLSheehan  : How has lunar eclipse in Taurus affected the market?<p>
AFund      : Well, Taurus is the sign of NYSE. <p>
JodyWilli  : Do you think the eclipse will trigger a downturn?<p>
AFund      : But has to be same degree area -- which eclipse triggers volatility in markets? Often today a 100 point play in a day or two. Also triggers UP moves. Depends on planets involved or between eclipses.<p>
JodyWilli  : With Saturn moving onto the US 5th house cusp, what do you think this will mean?<p>
AFund      : Jody don't use houses so can't answer that question -- use angles only. <p>
BeyReg     : I have Taurus in my 12th - good for investing? <p>
AFund      : Taurus on 12th same thing not my style of astrology-see Study of Astrology, for example.<p>
WorthEdit3 : KaiPorter asked: do you avoid investing on certain points in the cycle that involve emotionalism such as Pisces.<p>
AFund      : Depends on whether you believe in market timing, also depends on which investments. I do market timing and global stock selection. There, I believe I can time market reasonably well. But also as a trader we go both ways. I would certainly be leery of putting NEW money in now. There are also tax issues in selling. Last week, we close-wrote calls on LU, a few weeks earlier on SL I agree cash is fine from these points. Garzarelli a little too early, but advice VERY very sound.<p>
Rplusd     : Hi everyone. Can the astrologer tell me what will  happen to mortgage rates in December?<p>
AFund      : In general we see rates going up through midyear -- then stabilizing and down as we enter into a recession. So the earlier the better to lock in rates. Also real estate will outperform stock market next year. Hard assets better than physical assets in 1997-98 in our opinion.<p>
WorthEdit1 : TestyDi asks about the outlook for oil and energy stocks. <p>
AFund      : Testy: oil okay till January but near end of this cycle -- we are cashing out and hedging oil positions a bit early.<p>
TEBOMAN    : Southern California real estate may never come back<p>
AFund      : TEB speaking of Real estate in general also pockets that are different same with stocks, but in general REITS giving 6-7%. Good investment today, such as SSS<p>
JodyWilli  : Do you think the govt. will be printing out more money next year? Have you looked at AT&T?<p>
AFund      : Jody- Government always prints money. Do follow ATTp -- would buy at 40. Sold at above 55. Lucent sold at 45. Would buy 30-35. T will do okay, not great. Same with MCD next year.<p>
JodyWilli  : I mean because of not being able to pay our loans?<p>
AFund      : Jody- as to loan of US dollar is peaking and in trouble. Haven't done astrological work yet. I do this December 7 each year in my annual report.<p>
JodyWilli  : Thank you - I felt that too and needed validation.<p>
AFund      : BUT little upward move and some bond trouble in the not distant future.<p>
MF Value   : AFund... do you think you actually call the markets better than those fancy Wise men on Wall Street...?<p>
AFund      : As we both know 79-81% of people underperform indexes. The astrologers are in the 19-21%.<p>
MF Value   : The stars tell you what companies and industries are going to do well...?<p>
JodyWilli  : MF Value - check out latest survey of advisors on Wall Street -- all consistently wrong! <p>
AFund      : Only problem is playing against chickens and monkeys, not dartboard of other money managers!<p>
MF Value   : You can make calls on the 11 stocks that make up the XAU by the stars...?<p>
AFund      : MF just the stars tell me what companies and industries as do my other fundamentals and technical resources. I track the XAU index by the birth of the index; don't play individual ones -- this is co-checked with silver and gold horoscopes.<p>
RWaldock   : peak?<p>
AFund      : Don't play the in same way as NYSE, but expect it early next year at least the technology sector with Jupiter/Uranus in February. Excessive valuations will retreat<p>
MIB42      : Do you have an investment fund letter?<p>
AFund      : I do not do an investment newsletter. I am a money manager. We have forums on AOL keyword: astrologers fund or www.afund.com. Also have a mailing list you can E-mail, it is free. We have hedge funds and some public SEC-approved funds to be released next year. Currently manage money for high net worth individuals.<p>
SLSheehan  : AFund--How about Iomega (IOMG), makers of Zip and Jaz? <p>
AFund      : IOMG will be in trouble. We called the top to the day at 55. Looking for shorts in the 27-30 range -- watch out IOMG. Remember they have strong competition next year. If in, I would advise getting out at 25-30 if you are that lucky again. IOMG is in trouble NOW!!!!! Look at our May 23 report to the day we sent out to thousand at 55. Probably one or two more times, then covered and then reshort etc.<p>
Joshi1111  : Penny stocks???????? 1-3 months<p>
AFund      : Joshi penny stocks some up some down. Depends on the PROMOTER!!!! AS MUCH AS HOROSCOPE!!!!! Anyway, those games over NEXT year.<p>
RWaldock   : If market is bad in 1997, will your funds sell short?<p>
AFund      : Of course we will sell short. Of course we buy special situations. But more shorting next year, first write calls then short then buy puts depends on how close to the number of down times<p>
JodyWilli  : IOMG's chart looked bad around the 18th of this month -- did you look around that date?<p>
AFund      : Playing at moment technically -- more than astrologically sometimes you don't need astrology to make money, although astrology ALWAYS helps.<p>
PVinny     : Anyone have some light to shed on HWP - I am long 2000 shares and its seems it time to sell.<p>
AFund      : HWP: a little past time, but you have good profit. We were in for almost two years, less up room now, lots of Japanese competition coming so cover soon.<p>
RWaldock   : When will you have prospectuses available and where?<p>
AFund      : RW E-mail me, can't offer yet.<p>
JodyWilli  : AFund - save time, what stocks do you like for this month?<p>
AFund      : Jody this is mostly time for trading -- not investing. Buy in late November/early December for one last big blow out. But why buy here -- where is value- not Planet Hollywood :) This is trading month with downwards basis. November down down down for new people. Our aids play in ENZ about 19- at 22+ we stop loss.<p>
RWaldock   : What are your annual returns? Range?<p>
AFund      : RW depends on clients. We have some with large gains and others more conservative, individualized by client portfolio.<p>
Tryme18182 : What does astrology say of this month?<p>
AFund      : Good question. Eventually a few winners but next two years (fundamentally) ALL ARE IN TROUBLE. Will lose money, so avoid!!!!!!! Or buy only on traditional value (not here). However in 1998 forward YES BUY BUY BUY. But not now -- will lose money, not make it .Too much competition needs to go dead first.<p>
JBelang    : What about Intel?<p>
AFund      : Intel good company obviously, but that is a sector we are looking to short. Microsoft as close to 150 as we can get, IBM at 135 as close as we get. INTL not yet, but after Jupiter/Uranus and with Japanese who knows? These are momentum plays and some fundamental. I am a cosmic VALUE player. Where is value? Show me? I see little!<p>
RWaldock   : What main factor will start the 1997 decline?<p>
AFund      : Good question: stopped making that guess a long time ago. More important to know WHEN than why. I can think of lots of reasons. But will be a triple whammy to get these crazy people out of the market. My guesses are: less than 10 billion market inflow, two lots of call buying, and then a trigger -- war, assignation, bond default, etc. which will get the blame. An inflation number of Reality for example would do it. <p>
SLSheehan  : AFund -- You say it's more important to know when than why, you said, so WHEN do stocks plunge?<p>
AFund      : They do in a series. Remember, everyone knows stocks only go up and every dip is a buying opportunity. So a phased down move 1: November, move 2: March, move 3: read my December report! <p>
Joshi1111  : Any other stocks under $10?<p>
AFund      : Joshi write me- CCRI will go about another 35% in the next two months. E-mail me and will figure out a few.<p>
CrookManor : What do you see as the stable stocks of the future, aka Wal-mart of the present?<p>
AFund      : Crook VERY good Q: make a shopping list of good quality stocks, then make a wish list of price and wait!!!!! You may not get all but you will get some. Lots of GOOD COMPANIES OUT THERE, but very very few good prices of stock. So choose your list and when they are dumped in next year's vicious rotation cycle, buy buy buy. Remember even if market up -- they will rotate them viciously this year.<p>
CHOP180    : Any opinions on CAI Wireless Systems  CAWS?<p>
AFund      : NO don't track CAI.<p>
JTaylor815 : What do you think of Wind River?<p>
AFund      : Same -- don't track<p>
CrookManor : Do you recommend buying from these recent hot IPO's??<p>
AFund      : IPO's unless in early are good short candidates!!!! If you get in right time -- before than you make like LU at 27 otherwise more tricky but most lose about 6 months -- no astrology here -- so chart them.<p>
Please check out my Web site, forum on AOL, read my book and E-mail me if you have more questions.<p>
WorthEdit1 : Alright, I think Henry's typing fingers are about to fall off. Thanks, Henry, for the lively chat!<p>
AFund      : Now I leave you all with my question!!! CAN YOU AFFORD NOT TO HAVE A FINANCIAL ASTROLOGER IN YOUR FUTURE?<p>
WorthEdit3 : That Concludes this edition of "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's live weekly chat series. The Worth staff extends its appreciation to Henry Weingarten for being our guest this evening.<p>

						On Wednesday, September 25 at 8 P.M. EDT, James Glassman, a noted expert on the Social Security system, joined Worth OnLine for our live chat show, "Conference Call." A political commentator who appears regularly on CNN and PBS and a columnist for the Washington Post, Glassman is the author of "Social Insecurity," which appeared in the September issue of Worth. Following is a transcript of the live event, edited for clarity. The opinions expressed are those of James Glassman, and do not represent the views of Worth, Worth OnLine, or Capital Publishing.<p>
WorthEdit3 : Welcome to "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's new live chat show series. Every week we give readers the opportunity to chat with the leaders in money and markets. Check our site (Keyword: Worth) for a calendar of upcoming events.  Tonight Glassman will be talking about why he thinks it's time to do away with the biggest government program and let people invest for their own retirement. Good evening, Mr. Glassman. It's good to have you here tonight.<p>
JKGlassman : Thanks, it's get to be online. I've never done this before.<p>
WorthEdit3 : I think tonight should be an exciting time, then! I'll open the floor to questions.<p>
RWaldock   : I have a question.  If we put retirement in stocks, won't that tank bonds?<p>
JKGlassman : Not at all. First of all, I would guess that a great deal of retirement money would go into bonds. Any retiree would be foolish to put his or her nestegg exclusively into stocks.<p>
RWaldock   : How would we make up the deficit without being able to raid social security?<p>
JKGlassman : Well, we're about to be in that position anyway. Starting in 2012 or so, we'll be paying out more from the Social Security fund than we take in. So Social Security won't be a means to balance the budget, but a way to unbalance it.<p>
WorthEdit3 : In your article, you talk about the need for Social Security reform. What's do you view as the biggest fault with the current system?<p>
JKGlassman : I see two completely different problems with the system. First, I believe it is intrinsically immoral. It's a Ponzi scheme. The people who came in early got paid by the people who came in later. There is no link between work and reward. But Americans believe that there is. They have been deceived by their own government. <p>
Second, and probably more important, the current system discourages thrift, savings, looking to future and self-reliance. Instead we look to the government for sustenance. All of us! Not just the neediest. This is a sad state of affairs.<p>
RWaldock   : Do you see Social Security becoming another form of welfare if there are not changes?<p>
JKGlassman : Social Security already is a form of welfare. It is not truly a retirement system, the way that your company pension plan or 401 (k) is. Instead, young people, currently working, pay the retirement and widowhood stipends of older people. It's welfare, but worse, it's not means-tested.<p>
RWaldock   : If it IS means tested, then it IS welfare!<p>
JKGlassman : Well, we can get into all sorts of semantic hair-splitting, but the point is that it's welfare that goes to mainly to people who don't need it -- in the sense that they can take care of themselves.<p>
North bro  : Question? What is the best mutual funds at this time?<p>
JKGlassman : North bro asked about best mutual fund. Turns out I just did a column looking at that question. I used my own parameters, which I won't go into here, but my answer was Fidelity Contrafund. By the way, my assessment of the best mutual fund focussed on two things that many investors ignore -- and that they'll need to keep in mind if Social Security is privatized: low risk and a good track record over a long period of time.<p>
DEITHA     : What do you think of the so-called inflation bonds announced today?<p>
JKGlassman : I am very enthusiastic about the inflation-linked bonds that were announced today. It's one of the major accomplishments of this administration. The idea was originally Milton Friedman's! These bonds will be especially important if Social Security is privatized. What they do is guarantee that your nestegg will not be depleted by inflation. The bonds will pay a real return determined by the market (maybe 3% for a long bond) PLUS an inflation adjustment based on the CPI. Anyway, I love the things and plan to buy some myself. <p>
RWaldock   : Jim, what would happen to the bonds if there is DEflation? <p>
JKGlassman : I have not checked the details, but my understanding is that the bonds will pay a minimum inflation premium of 0% -- though don't hold me to that. Also, I think the chances of deflation are close to nil. It's a risk I would be willing to run even without the guarantee. I think that the bond will actually force government to be *more* resonsible in holding down inflation. This, by the way, was the argument of Milton Friedman.<p>
RWaldock   : Back to Social Security, so many people get Social SecurityI, including tons of "crazy" kids' abuse of the system!<p>
JKGlassman : The disability portion of Social Security, to which you refer, is an utter disaster. Something has to be done about it. It has become a major scam, and, as you point out, it is abused by parents of perfectly healthy young children, as well as by drug addicts and alcoholics. But that's a topic for another time.<p>
BoBo462917 : Jim, what would happen to the S&P 500 if Social Security was privatized?<p>
JKGlassman : BoBo, you ask what would happen to the S&P 500 if Social Security were privatized. My guess is that the change would be very bullish for the markets. More money would pour in as a result of private investors putting their former-Social Security money into stocks. But, even more important, privatization would bring new people into the stock market and would increase the investment (even the non-Social Security investing) of those already in the market. This was the experience in Chile!<p>
BoBo462917 : Would the rise in the value of the SP500 be warranted? Or would it just be a supply and demand phenomenon?<p>
JKGlassman : Well, the increase in stock prices (just as the increase in the prices of everything else) is always supply and demand phenomenon.But there's no doubt that one result of increased demand (that is, more investors buying stock) would be to increase supply (that is, more new businesses issuing stock).<p>
BoBo462917 : So this isn't the environment for the value investor. It's a momentum paradise!<p>
RWaldock   : Wouldn't the S&P become the Nifty 500?<p>
BoBo462917 : Exactly RWald<p>
JKGlassman : Oh, I wouldn't say that the value investor would not benefit. With more people buying stock (and putting more money into the market in general), a lot of overlooked value stocks may become popular. I don't believe, by the way, that stocks stay "value" or "growth" throughout their lives; they go through phases. Certainly, some value stocks would become growth stocks.<p>
BoBo462917 : What are the odds of a portion of Social Security being truly privatized in a Clinton administration? Or even a Gore administration?<p>
JKGlassman : Good question, but it requires a kind of long answer. First, I think that Clinton likes the idea of privatization. He's sent signals that he understands and appreciates what happened in Chile. The problem, however, is that, if Social Security is privatized, the underpinnings of the welfare state, so beloved by Democrats, will be loosened. Don't forget that the Clinton administration wanted the government to take control of more of the economy (through Hillary Clinton's health plan). Privatization would mean the govt would control less, and the dominos might fall. So, I doubt that reform would occur in a Democratic White House with a Democratic Congress.<p>
JKGlassman : Let me ask the rest of you a question. I assume some of you are young -- in 20s and 30s. Why aren't you outraged by the current system? Why haven't you mobilized politically? Do you think that young people ever will? They are the victims of the current system. They pay out a big chunk of what they earn to people who don't necessarily need it, and they (young people) have almost no chance of benefiting from the system. Aren't you angry?<p>
BoBo462917 : I have watched the baby boomers move through the system in such a destructive way that I've become numb. As real estate prices shot up, I found myself a new person in the real estate market. As an investor, I come in after a 12 year bull. Medical care is next. So is Social Security.<p>
RWaldock   : Perot is talking about generational accounting, and they won't let him speak! <p>
Treyb69    : I'm 26 and outraged!  People over 50 control 80% of all wealth, why am I paying their CC?<p>
Hoser lv   : (age 39) Yes, I'm outraged.  I intend to leave the U.S. when the economy collapses.  You?<p>
SfwIII     : I'm early forties, I'm outraged, and I don't think that even I will see a penny.  I do think that privatization will happen, but it will take the actual disaster.<p>
Treyb69    : WHy can't they do something as simple as means testing?<p>
RWaldock   : I don't think means testing is fair for Social Security<p>
Treyb69    : And when the actual disaster happens, it'll be too late.<p>
BoBo462917 : When the boomers come of age, there will be no chance of altering the entitlements portion of the budget. <p>
DEITHA     : Must re-educate older people. Social Security is not an insurance program - it is welfare on back of children.<p>
Hoser lv   : Trey - agree that means testing will become essential ... but I won't be here.<p>
Treyb69    : Means testing is fair, Social Security is a social insurance, not a savings plan (in current form).<p>
SfwIII     : Means testing proves that it is welfare, and not a pension.  That is why they can't do it. <p>
JKGlassman : Let me jump in here on means-testing. The answer to Social Security in the past has always been some tweaking: raising the retirement age, increasing taxes, maybe means testing. But that makes Social Security an even *worse* deal than it is now. If you are 35, when you retire, if there is Social Security at all, you will be getting a return of negative 1.5 percent on your contributions. With means-testing, etc., you return will be even *more* negative.<p>
Treyb69    : It is welfare, it'd be cheaper if we just all realized that.<p>
RWaldock   : Jim, I thought the less you paid in, the more you got out and vice versa???<p>
JKGlassman : Good point. Social Security is already means-tested to a great extent. But not the less you pay in, etc.<p>
Treyb69    : Either scale it back to support just the most needy, or privatize it and make it work.<p>
Smk122346  : JK: Because there is no true trust fund, how much Social Security overfunding for the deficit takes place?<p>
JKGlassman : Currently we take in about $50 b. more in revenues from Social Security than we pay out each year. That $50b goes to reduce the deficit, and, in return, special bonds go into the trust fund. <p>
SfwIII     : The point is that it is a tax.  It is not an investment, you don't get a return any more than you get a return on your sales tax.<p>
DBaird5147 : You guys are nuts! Social Security was supposed to keep you from becoming homeless! Not easy street.<p>
JKGlassman : Let me respond to DBaird...the true purpose of Social Security was *never* made clear. Some people think it's a safety net, but many, perhaps most Americans see it as a large part of their own retirement nest egg. <p>
Treyb69    : Not to knock the elderly, but who could ever think they'd be taken care of, and they didn't have to take care of themselves?? <p>
Valhal     : JK: I've read that Chileans, with their private plan, 
             now have a larger nest egg, after only<p>
JKGlassman : As believe that in a free society, all of us have the obligation to take care of ourselves. Now, clearly, some people can't, and we ought to have some kind of welfare at retirement for them. But why construct a system in which 260 million americans are forced to participate in order to take care of maybe 10 or 20 million who can't help themselves.<p>
Treyb69    : Yes, we ought to take care of those who don't, but not people earning 75k a year on investments and pensions, etc.<p>
DEITHA     : Social Security was never meant to be full support - only supplement, I think.<p>
Valhal     : My problem with Social Security is that it is such a drag on the economy. Do you agree?<p>
Smk122346  : Does not deficit reduction, regardless of who created it, benefit young and old alike?<p>
JKGlassman : Yes, deficit reduction helps eveyrone. But let's not confused deficit reduction with what some of us want to do with Social Security. <p>
Treyb69    : If we just do the first level of privatizing, every person under age 35 is a millionare by retirment.<p>
JKGlassman : What we want is for individuals themselves to take care of their own retirements, not to have the government do it for us. It's not more complicated than that. <p>
Treyb69    : That creates tremendous investment and a growing economy, not by giving handouts.<p>
SfwIII     : I think that the government investing Social Security money in equities, as some have proposed, is worse than now.  It gives the government effective control over the companies, even if they can't.<p>
Smk122346  : Social Security is a tax. It is not a retirement vehicle. You transfer wealth from one to the other.<p>
Hoser lv   : Smk - agreed - more like a Ponzi scheme hiding as a tax. <p>
JKGlassman : I absolutely do not want the government investing in equities. I want individuals doing it. You're right, Sfwill, it would be much worse than the current system, even.<p>
REXNESocial SecurityIE  : So, why not sell the right to "manage" the Social Security retirement "accounts" to the highest bidder!?<p>
JKGlassman : REX, exactly right. But not allow just one manager. Do what they do in Chile. Let Americans choose their own manager from dozens of possiblities, the way we choose mutual funds today.<p>
Treyb69    : If they set up PSAs it becomes a true savings plan, even factoring in the large transition $<p>
Hoser lv   : Mr. G - with the U.S. dismal savings rate, what's the 
             odds most will save enough?<p>
JKGlassman : One reason we have such a low savings rate is that many Americans assume they don't have to save because Social Security will be there for them...<p>
Smk122346  : The next Ponzi is to issue bonds that have a guaranteed return, the hell with inflation.<p>
JKGlassman : We have to get back into the habit of saving. We have to get back to self-reliance, which is something that a privatized Social Security system would do.<p>
DEITHA     : Means testing might encourage less saving for own retirement.<p>
Treyb69    : Buy gold, at some point our awful fiscal policies will catch up.<p>
MIKEWON    : I know Chile is smaller but their system of privatization seems to be working with out the onvesting  for the people.<p>
JKGlassman : The Chilean system is a real success story. One thing that happened in Chile was this...  The system requires workers to put 10% of their pay into a private retirement account, like a mutual fund. But what happened was that workers got into the habit of saving! The savings rate jumped to over 25% in Chile.<p>
Treyb69    : What are some realistic solutions, and how long before we could see one?<p>
Hoser lv   : Yes, JK, the political issue of Social Security is like an "electric fence" - touch it and you die.<p>
REXNESocial SecurityIE  : A "Sallie Mae" type corporation should provide American's with an ownership opportunity in the organization that "managed" their retirement funds, wouldn't it???<p>
DNic880    : Will Social Security be alive for me in 2030?<p>
JKGlassman : DN, I am afraid that Social Security is unlikely to be alive for you in 2030, which is why you should start getting active politically on the subject NOW. <p>
Hoser, you say that Social Security is like an electric fence... Actually, that is changing somewhat. Steve Forbes in fact brought up privatizing Social Security during his brief campaign and got a good response, and people in Congress like Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz) are talking openly about it and getting re-elected anyway. I wouldn't despair., but the key is for young people to organize and oppose the AARP, etc. <p>
Smodim     : DN, and start saving like mad now!<p>
Smk122346  : A realistic solution is to elect those people who have solutions, like Forbes did!<p>
Treyb69    : I see it harder and harder with the % of elderly rising.  They have a large voting block. Alan Simpson (R) Wyoming, has a plan.<p>
JKGlassman : Trey, yes, Simpson has a modest plan, along with Bob Kerrey of Neb. that allows you to shift 2% of your Social Security money to private funds.<p>
Hoser lv   : JK - yes - but look at the presidential mud using Social Security as an issue for the elderly.<p>
MShults    : Why get active-our so called reps don't respond.<p>
JKGlassman : MShults, you said that politicians ignore you. My experience is different. Politicians cannot ignore organized voting groups, which is why they respond to seniors.<p>
Treyb69    : Young people do not have common goals/visions, that's our largest polictical weakness. <p>
JKGlassman : Trey, true about uncommon goals, but this is an issue that affects all you people.<p>
REXNESocial SecurityIE  : Get a clue.. young people have goals that are different, not uncommon.<p>
Treyb69    : JK, I know, but few too many people care about it, and vote on different issues (e.g., student loans).  This is much, much bigger....<p>
TGFGNUT    : What's chance Social Security will be changed from social insurance to a welfare system?<p>
JKGlassman : TGF, If Social Security is privatized, there will still be some provision for the very poor.<p>
DNic880    : Why cant I do my own savings and sign a release to let me out of this system?<p>
TGFGNUT    : How many people know there's a "social bias" in the Social Security benefit formula?<p>
JKGlassman : DNic, you ask the key question. Right now, you cannot opt out. You are not allowed. We want you to be able to opt out.<p>
Hoser lv   : JK - I'm so convinced the U.S. will continue to do the wrong thing, I'm making other plans. <p>
Treyb69    : Don't any of them, except for Kasich, want to do the 'right' thing? <p>
Valhal     : DN this scheme falls apart sooner than later if anyone is let out!<p>
MShults    : Do boomers care enough to organize??<p>
JKGlassman : Hoser, I sometimes despair of the US doing right, too. But look at what's happening today in Europe, with Germany and France at 11 percent unemployment-plus.<p>
Maelmoro   : Do you think there is a chance that the 1993 tax on Social Security payments may be reduced or eliminated?<p>
JKGlassman : Trey, I like Kasich, too, but there are some good Congressmen on this issue, starting with Jim Kolbe. I suggest all of you write him and tell him you support what he's doing.<p>
Smk122346  : I believe US unemployment, if accurately measured is around 10-11% as well.<p>
JKGlassman : Simpson, unfortunately, is retiring. But there is lots of support for privatization. I know that Gingrich is backing the Kolbe group. <p>
TGFGNUT    : It's like health insurance; if Feds didn't force people to pay for Social Security we'd have 40 million people without pensions....Oh woe.<p>
Treyb69    : Chris Shays, from my home state, is good too. <p>
JKGlassman : However you measure it, unemployment in Germany is at least twice what it is in US.<p>
JKGlassman : TGF, you raise a good point. One thing about Social Security -- even for a libertarian like me -- is that if we privatize it, we are going to have to make it mandatory. Otherwise, we will have to take care of millions of profligate types. <p>
Smk122346  : East Germany was a basket case.  Much like Arkansas
JKGlassman : Smk, the reason for high unemp in France, Germany and Italy, etc., is not E. Germany, it is the huge out-of-control costs of the welfare state that have been loaded on business;.<p>
BoBo462917 : What do you think of the inflation-indexed bond based on the CPI?<p>
TGFGNUT    : Making pensions mandatory doesn't sound very libertarian to me!<p>
JKGlassman : Bobo, inflation-indexed bonds, as I have said before, are a great idea. Are you asking specifically about the CPI as an index?<p>
Treyb69    : JK, BW just ran a blurb on how rich the dole's in Europe are.  No incentive to work.<p>
DNic880    : JK- What do you tell people who are putting money into this system will never see any of it?<p>
JKGlassman : Trey, not only is there little incentive to work. There is also little incentive for businesses to hire. It is too expensive, given the social costs loaded on businesses, to hire anyone for life.<p>
BoBo462917 : I guess I'm asking about the fundamental methodology behind it. Which includes the fact that it's using the CPI. <p>
JKGlassman : The CPI isn't perfect, but it's not bad.<p>
Smk122346  : Inflation indexed tax rates did not work.<p>
TGFGNUT    : JK...are you a card-carrying Libertarian?<p>
JKGlassman : As for my libertarian card: No, I'm not a party member, but my political leanings are in that direction.<p>
Treyb69    : Too bad everyone just couldn't be a productive member of society, no drugs, crimes, etc. I mean, what has our society become, awful!<p>
TGFGNUT    : But the CPI has added untold billions to the Social Security system!<p>
JKGlassman : TGF, the CPI is an imperfect measure of the cost of living. I completely agree.<p>
Valhal     : JKG: Doesn't the CPI overstate the actual inflation?<p>
Smk122346  : Too let the Feds legislate a problem away is not the answer.  Address it.  Solve it.<p>
JKGlassman : Yes, CPI overstates inflation because people respond to rising prices in one area of the economy by increasing their demand in another, and the CPI doesn't take that into account. One of the best ideas being floated last year was to adjust the CPI and thus bring down some of government's costs in the drive to balance the budget. I strongly supported that move, backed by Sen. Moynihan, among others.<p>
Smk122346  : That sounds like you just vetoed static budgeting.  <p>
JKGlassman : Well, I think we are winding down here. This has been a real treat. A last question from anyone?<p>
Smk122346  : When do you retire.JK<p>
JKGlassman : I am 49 years old. I hope I never retire, but I'll be 65 in, what?, 2022.<p>

						WorthOnLne : Welcome to "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's live chat show series. Our guest tonight is Michael Paolercio, CEO of Michael Anthony Jewelers, one of the largest publicly-held jewelry companies in the United States. By holding licenses for everyone from Looney Tunes to Barbie to all the major sports leagues, the company sells to some of the largest retail outlets. Tonight he'll be answering questions about the fine jewelry industry, the outlook for mass-market retailers, and the gold market.<p>
MAJewelers : Thank you Worth OnLine for welcoming us to Conference Call.<p>
WorthOnLne : To begin, tell us how Michael Anthony got started.<p>
MAJewelers : Twenty years ago, my brother and I had a dream to start a business together and build it into something that we would both be very proud of. Anthony has the jewelry background, being a bench jeweler and having had a lot of experience doing jewelry manufacturing. My background is in sales and marketing, having received my degree from City University of New York. I've had the opportunity to work in the textile industry, exposed me to the art of buying, selling, and making deals happen. <p>
Our first retail experience was in flea markets in the NY area, and in the front of my uncle's beauty salon in Manhattan. We took our first loft on 46th street in 1979 and attended our first jewelry trade show in 1980. Our first big break came in 1981, when gold prices started to drop dramatically from the all-time highs. We began a gold leasing program and transferred the risk of owning gold back to the banks and focused on being a jewelry manufacturer, not a gold speculator. <p>
The business continued to grow dramatically, and by 1983, our sales had topped $25 million and it was apparent that our capital needs would soon require outside financing. By October of 1987, our sales had grown to over $50 million. We were ready to do a public offering. We were successful in raising over $11 million dollars of equity financing to continue the growth and begin the acquisition of smaller and less capitalized competitors. In the last 8 years, we have acquired over 10 companies. Our sales have grown to over $150 million.<p>
WorthOnLne : Shlef asked about the outlook for the gold market. Can you give us any foresight on what's ahead?<p>
MAJewelers : Gold prices have been relatively stable the last few years. They have been within a trading range of between $375 and $420. Very recently, there has been a lot of pressure on gold prices because of the selling by the World Banks, and gold hit a low yesterday of $383 on the news that the IMF was selling 5 million ounces.<p>
Mls4025    : Is there any truth to the rumors about you're merging with a large West Coast gold company?<p>
MAJewelers : We continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities with other companies that manufacture and distribute jewelry products. We are confident that opportunities exist that will expand our customer base and add new product offerings.<p>
WorthOnLne : You just released second quarter earnings. What were they and what's important?<p>
MAJewelers : Sales for the second quarter were $27,706,000, an increase of $2,804,000, or 11 percent from sales of $24,902,000 in the prior year's comparable period. The net loss for the quarter was $625,000 or $.08 per share on 8,256,000 weighted average shares outstanding, compared to a net loss of $931,000, or $.11 per share on 8,502,000 weighted average shares outstanding in last year's comparable period. We are pleased to report an 11 percent increase in sales over last year, especially for our weakest quarter. Gross margins also increased over last year. <p>
Nakadi     : Is there a good jewelry index (maybe excluding gold) that one can use to evaluate this as an asset class and compare to other investments. <p>
MAJewelers : The World Gold Council provides quarterly statistics on retail sales for the industry.<p>
AJDOMAN    : DOES Michael Anthony manufacture outside of the U.S.? <p>
MAJewelers : Michael Anthony manufactures over 95 percent of its products in the U.S.<p>
Mls4025    : Do you see the continued consolidation of large retailers as big negative for your business?<p>
MAJewelers : First of all I don't think there is anything I can do about the consolidation in the jewelry industry or any other industry. The larger the players are, the more important the large suppliers are to them.<p>
TomsGems   : Does 18Kt gemstone jewelry sell better in the USA than 14Kt jewelry? <p>
MAJewelers : 14k jewelry is the predominant karat of choice of the American consumer with 10k being the second choice and 18k reserved and limited only to a very limited higher-end consumer.<p>
AndersonIV : Are diamonds in the si / gh range a good buy? I've heard that DeBeers will raise prices 10 percent.<p>
MAJewelers : I can't believe DeBeers would try to raise prices that dramatically in the short term. Historically, the increases have been in the low single digits. Where do you buy your diamonds?<p>
Mls4025    : Do you have any plans to sell directly to the consumer via the net?<p>
MAJewelers : Michael Anthony has no interest in selling directly to the consumer. It would be in direct competition with our customers. But we are setting up a Web site that will be activated within the next few weeks to answer all questions. You'll find product information, locations where you can buy the product, and up-to-the minute financial information about Michael Anthony.<p>
Mls4025    : How many licenses do you hold for karat gold jewelry products?<p>
TomsGems   : Do auctions online for fine gold/gemstone jewelry have any promise for the future?<p>
MAJewelers : TomsGems: I would be very skeptical to purchase any jewelry without having had the opportunity to properly inspect and appraise.<p>
AJDOMAN    : How large scale is the patent violators/ counterfeiters of your jewelry? <p>
MAJewelers : NBC's Dateline program profiled the jewelry industry a few months ago and featured Michael Anthony as a model for the industry in respect to quality karat integrity and compliance with trademark laws. There seems to be a constant invasion of counterfeit licensed products available to the consumer and the Jeweler's Vigilance Committee is investigating and prosecuting violators. We report counterfeiting to the licenser and try to find out who the counterfeiter is and press for help for the licensee.<p>
AJDOMAN    : What kind of money is transacted to acquire patent rights such as the NBA?<p>
MAJewelers : In addition to the significant up front fees, there are royalties that are paid on an ongoing basis. We hold almost 100 licenses, ranging from the sports professional leagues, to Warner Bros., to colleges all across the country.<p>
WorthOnLne : Are you introducing any new products in the near future?<p>
MAJewelers : We recently introduced a new line of gemstone jewelry featuring natural sapphires mined in Montana. This new line, The American Sapphire Collection, is consistent with our strategy of expanding the Company's product lines in order to increase sales of higher margin products.<p>
LEA LTD    : Are you the guy on QVC???<p>
MAJewelers : I have appeared on Home Shopping Network, but today my brother Anthony has a regular program once a month featuring USA Gold.<p>
TomsGems   : Is ultrasonic cleaning recommended for most gemstone jewelry? For opal & emerald jewelry?<p>
MAJewelers : Definitely not. Ultrasonic cleaning should only be used for all gold, and faceted stones only. You don't put in pearls, opals, or any other soft stone like turquoise.<p>
TomsGems   : Ultrasonic for only faceted gems?  What about sapphire cabochons, etc.?<p>
MAJewelers : I would be very careful about putting any unfaceted gems of less than 8 on the hardness scale in an ultrasonic cleaning machine.<p>
WorthOnLne : Who are your biggest customers?<p>
MAJewelers : WalMart, JC Penney, Service Merchandise, Sterling, Home Shopping Network...<p>
Mls4025    : What about Best Products?<p>
MAJewelers : They are a very small customer.<p>
LEA LTD    : My husband has a 14 karat gold bracelet that turns his arm dark colors...could it be 14 karat???<p>
MAJewelers : 14k gold very rarely turns someone's skin a darker color. If the person has had this happen before, it could be 14k. But if it doesn't happen with other 14k jewelry, it could be a fake.<p>
WorthOnLne : Has the company bought back any shares?<p>
MAJewelers : Over the past several years, we have repurchased over 500,000 shares and we currently have a buy back program in place for up to 750,000 shares.<p>
Mls4025    : What do you consider the biggest concern in your 
             business today?<p>
MAJewelers : That gold prices would begin to skyrocket, and that would cause instability in the marketplace.<p>
WorthOnLne : How does the price of gold affect your profit margins?<p>
MAJewelers : As gold prices increase, so does the cost of leasing inventory and financing receivables. This would hurt our profit margins.<p>
WorthOnLne : Is the jewelry industry cyclical like most industries?<p>
MAJewelers : I would think that the industry is cyclical in nature. But in the recent recession, gold prices have remained relatively stable, and sales of jewelry products continued to increase.<p>
NJones2785 : The gold supply seems to keep increasing because of tech improvements.  Shortage how, when?<p>
MAJewlers: I don't believe that there is a shortage of physical gold. With the constant selling of World Banks, I don't think supply will affect demand. Therefore prices should not increase.<p>
NJones2785 : Why else would your costs increase?<p>
MAJewelers : Increasing labor costs would increase the price of our products or decrease our profit margins.<p>
R 1 M S    : How much would the price have to increase before you're affected?<p>
MAJewelers : Gold would have to trade above $450 per ounce before we could see a decline in revenue.<p>
R 1 M S    : Do you see gold going to $450.00 an ounce in the near future?<p>
MAJewelers : I don't think so.<p>
Mls4025    : Do you offer any type of guarantee for your products?<p>
MAJewelers : MIs4025: Michael Anthony offers a lifetime warranty on all its products.<p>
Mls4025    : Has this guarantee increased the amount of returns in the past 10 years?<p>
MAJewelers : The amount of returns is such a small percent because the products are of the highest quality.<p>
LEA LTD:  What is your current rate of returns?<p>
MAJewelers : It is currently 10 percent to 15 percent of sales.<p>
WorthOnLne : What's ahead for the fine jewelry industry?<p>
MAJewelers : If Mother's Day is any indication of how Christmas will be, I think we will all be happy with the results. Many of our retail customers have given up spending advertising dollars in the off months and have plans to really blitz the air waves with TV and print advertising in Dec. when consumers are out there buying gifts.<p>
R 1 M S    : What about the price of Diamonds? <p>
MAJewelers : Diamond prices for the best quality goods have increased slightly. But the lower end continues to have pressure and therefore prices are dropping.<p>
NJones2785 : Saw recent story on U.S. sapphires.  Do you know the company?  Do you buy them?<p>
MAJewelers : We have recently signed an agreement with American Gem Corp. of St. Helena, Mt. to purchase millions of dollars.<p>
Mls4025    : Won't the loss of a week between Thanksgiving and Christmas hurt all retailers?<p>
WStras     : Would you be a buyer of gold now as an investment?<p>
MAJewelers : No, I would not. Unless it is a beautiful piece of jewelry for yourself or your wife, I think there are a lot better places to put your money than in bullion.<p>
LEA LTD    : Do you manufacture all your products in the U.S.? <p>
MAJewelers : 95 percent of our products are manufactured in the U.S.<p>
R 1 M S    : Where do you currently buy gold, diamonds, gemstones and do you have Tanzanites?<p>
MAJewelers : R1ms: All of our gold is purchased as 24k pure gold from a variety of gold banks and gold dealers. And, no, we don't have tanzanites. <p>
LEA LTD    : What other countries do you manufacture in???<p>
MAJewelers : We don't manufacture in any foreign country. But we do purchase a limited amount of products manufactured overseas.<p>
NJones2785 : How would layman learn to recognize quality gems without buying fortune's worth?<p>
MAJewelers : I'm sure there are classes available at colleges around the country, as well as plenty of books and trade magazines.<p>
WorthOnLne : Can you tell us what you predict the mass-market retail sector will do based on orders?<p>
MAJewelers : Worth: Right now we have received significant commitments from all our major retail customers.<p>
R 1 M S    : Are you buying here or abroad- Belgium - Where?<p>
MAJewelers : We buy direct from Israel as well as local importers.<p>
WorthOnLne : How do you see this upcoming holiday season shaping up?<p>
Mls4025    : Are those commitments for this year running ahead of this time a year ago?<p>
MAJewelers : I think we can see double digit increases from jewelry retailers this holiday season.<p>
Scottsli   : Does anyone have an opinion on Venture Stores ?<p>
MAJewelers : Scotts: Venture is currently a customer of Michael Anthony and our business is slightly ahead of last year.<p>
Seagulls   : Are you going to address the low price of your stock? The market goes up, yours  goes down.<p>
MAJewelers : Seagulls: The book value of MA shares is in excess of $5.50 and we are working hard to communicate that to Wall Street. With respect to other publicly traded jewelry stocks, MAJ has outperformed its peer group and we see ourselves continuing to outperform the group.<p>
NJones2785 : Do you think gold jewelry better store of value than bullion or coins?<p>
MAJewelers : On the one hand you can wear the jewelry, but on the other hand you cannot turn it into cash as easily as bullion or coins. But it's a lot more fun to wear!<p>
TomsGems   : As a rule, does fine gold/gemstone jewelry routinely come with a (GIA) grading or appraisal?<p>
MAJewelers : The GIA only does an evaluation as to the quality, color, and weight of a diamond or other precious gems. It does not establish retail or wholesale value.<p>
NJones2785 : I may have missed.  Do you have direct retail stores?<p>
MAJewelers : No, we do not sell directly to the consumer, it would be a conflict.<p>
LEA LTD    : Do you foresee any acquisitions to gain market strength for the future?? <p>
MAJewelers : We are always looking at acquisition opportunities. We talked about this earlier in the chat.<p>
R 1 M S    : Who does set the value- DeBeers ?<p>
MAJewelers : RIMS: DeBeers sets the value for rough diamonds. The marketplace sets the price of finished goods.<p>
TomsGems   : Who in the industry is "authorized" to appraise jewelry? Can a Graduate Gemologist appraise? <p>
MAJewelers :  A certified gemologist could clearly identify the quality, color, and possible weight of your diamond if he had the right equipment and there is a weekly report called the Rappaport that lists the wholesale value of diamonds to the trade. But only a range--they are not buyers or sellers.<p>
NJones2785 : Easy to find, but what's your stock symbol?<p>
MAJewelers : Our ticker symbol is MAJ. We are traded on the AMEX.<p>
R 1 M S    : How many shares are authorized and how many are sold?<p>
MAJewelers :  20 million authorized, and approximately 8.2 million outstanding.<p>
R 1 M S    : Preferred- common, or what is available?<p>
MAJewelers : Common stock only.<p>
MKlein7OO  : WILL Jan Bell survive?<p>
MAJewelers : Jan Bell is a good customer of MAJ, and they have one of the best balance sheets in the industry. We are optimistic about their future.<p>
WorthOnLne : Any last questions for Mr. Paolercio?<p>
MAJewelers : It has been a pleasure to be a part of the Worth OnLine Conference Call show. I look forward to coming back on in January to report on holiday sales.<p>
WorthOnLne : And thank you, Mr. Paolercio, for taking time to answer our questions this evening. That concludes this edition of "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's live weekly chat series.

						<font size=4><b><i>EARN MEGA PROFITS IN MICROCAP STOCKS.</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						On Wednesday, September 4 at 8 P.M. EDT, Clint Willis joined Worth OnLine for our live chat show, "Conference Call." Willis is the author of several recent Worth cover stories, such as "Search for the World's Highest Yields," "Finding the Next Microsoft," and September's "Going Small." Following is a transcript of the live event, edited for clarity. The opinions expressed are those of Clint Willis, and do not represent the views of Worth, Worth OnLine, or Capital Publishing.<p>
WorthEdit6 : Welcome to "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's live chat show series. Our guest tonight is Worth magazine contributing editor Clint Willis--author of cover stories "Search for the World's Highest Yields," "Finding the Next Microsoft," and this month's "Going Small," a story about the potential for mega profits in microcap stocks. They're volatile and little-followed -- and if you don't see that as good news, you're out of your depth.<p>
Willis, founder of The Writing Institute in Portland, Maine, has written for more than 100 publications, including The New York Times, Travel & Leisure, and The Washington Post. He is also a former member of the New York State Securities Analysts Association.  Tonight, Willis will be discussing tactics for finding the small stocks with potential for the biggest returns on Wall St. Clint is using screenname WillisEdit. Please feel free to ask questions now.<p>
FHADI      : Clint, how important do you feel the number of outstanding shares is?<p>
WillisEdit : The key thing is the market cap, because that determines liquidity--the smaller the better.<p>
Tursillo   : Clint-liked your article on finding the next MSFT. Wondering about timing on buying a stock like that?<p>
WillisEdit : Timing doesn't matter--you're investing for a decade. <p>
Tursillo   : But sometimes you can be three years early or more. That's a lot of opportunity given up.<p>
WillisEdit : True. But the key is to be at a place where you have confidence. If that happens three years earlier, great. If not, you're still gonna make money in the long run.<p>
Tursillo   : So you are totally fundamental.  Do you look at relative strength or anything technical?<p>
WillisEdit : Tursillo--you got it.<p>
BeanPiez   : How do investment firm's health care info technology research analysts-- go about their research on H.I.T various vendors other than vendor presentations? Are there objective forums to help research specialized areas?<p>
WillisEdit : Yes, newsletters like California Medical Technology Stock Letter--but generally I think you're better off doing your own work on smallest caps.<p>
FHADI      : I'm following a few micros right now. one has a p/e ratio of 2.5. Can that compare to a blue chip? I mean if coke had a 2.5 p/e ratio I'd sell my car.<p>
WillisEdit : I see your point, so would I. My guess is that this smallcap has problems--but check it out.<p>
TThomas212 : Where should I begin to locate microcaps<p>
BeanPiez   : Yes TThomas212. Willis -- can you give two or three of the best ways to locate information?<p>
WillisEdit : I'd try computer screens like the ones described in the box with the article. After computer screens, try calling the companies directly, then suppliers and customers...You'll be amazed at how much info they'll give you on the phone.<p>
TThomas212 : Is there any publication that follows microcaps other than Red Chip Review?<p>
WillisEdit : Yes, but I haven't seen any nearly as good.<p>
WorthEdit6 : Article can be found in the Worth archives on Worth OnLine -- Intelligence, Archives...the article he just mentioned is called "First, Find the Haystack." from the September 1996 issue of Worth.<p>
Tursillo   : Clint-are you familiar with the Cabot Market Letter? Despite all the criticism, he has several hard and fast rules for looking for the same types of stocks you do.<p>
TThomas212 : Does Red Chip segregate the stocks by region?<p>
WillisEdit : I'm not terribly familiar with Cabot's letter; I've heard it's ok.<p>
TAnder4835 : What can I find in the library to help me<p>
WillisEdit : Occasionally you can do a clip search and find articles about a small company.<p>
Tursillo   : TAnder-a good library will have several investment newsletters.  Also, try the S&P stock guides (little brown or green books).<p>
WillisEdit : Tursillo--the newsletters in the library won't have the tiniest stocks. <p>
Tursillo   : Clint-how tiny are you talkin'? <p>
WillisEdit : I'm talking under $25 million market cap, man.<p>
Tursillo   : Oh-yes, you are right.<p>
BeanPiez   : Do microcaps suffer from the same cycles as larger cap stocks?<p>
WillisEdit : Not at all. These companies have their own problems/opportunities in their niches... that's why they're so fun to follow.<p>
TAnder4835 : Tell me more about screens for the micro. By the way, great article.<p>
FHADI      : Can you incorporate macroeconomic trends when analyzing stocks under $25 million?<p>
WillisEdit : Yes, you can--using similar principals. But remember, we're looking for niches here.<p>
BeanPiez   : Does it make more sense than focusing on a particular sector and learning its "ins and outs"?<p>
WillisEdit : No. Look for good companies that have a great common sense story and the cash and talent and market to carry it through. You don't need to become an industry expert.<p>
TAnder4835 : When I niche pick I look in my own backyard--MI--more information at hand.<p>
WillisEdit : Great strategy--also, you can go see the companies.<p>
TThomas212 : tander4835  I am interested in MI microcaps. What have you done to identify them?
Tursillo   : Clint-did you see the interview in an August issue of Wall Street Transcript about microcap managers? (Don't remember which week.)<p>
WillisEdit : What did it say?<p>
Tursillo   : Very detailed interview with several top microcap managers about their style, etc.<p>
WillisEdit : Were they smart?<p>
Tursillo   : I suppose.  It seems like microcap managers are a different breed.<p>
HAYVEN     : What is a good amount to invest in a small cap stock?<p>
WillisEdit : No more than you can afford to lose.<p>
TAnder4835 : How does insider trading effect microcaps?<p>
WillisEdit : Great question. Often, insiders own huge pieces of these companies--a good ...important... sign. But that could affect price movements.<p>
TAnder4835 : I check the Michigan Free Press and the Detroit News, then I check S&P for details. The newspaper gives good stories on small companies.<p>
WillisEdit : tander--wherever you're looking, I'd emphasize that your call to the company is key (and visit).<p>
FHADI      : Clint, can you use "value investing" with microcaps? Like watching a stock go from 3 to .50, then investing?<p>
WillisEdit : Fhadi--don't buy it just cause it's down. But sure, it's great to buy a good one when it's cheap. I didn't spend a lot of time worrying about valuations. These things tend to be bargains when the company is good, just because so few managers can buy them cause of liquidity problems--again, I'm talking about market cap under $25 million which is really really small.<p>
Tursillo   : Not to change the subject, but do you own any "next Microsoft" stocks besides those you put in the article?<p>
WillisEdit : I don't buy these myself--I can't; I'm a journalist. Anyway, that's a slightly different article, with a different approach. a tougher one, I think, for most people than this microcaps gag, which is really easy (if you will do the work).<p>
Tursillo   : Fair enough.<p>
BeanPiez   : Are there any good online resources for researching microcaps? Or even to follow them?<p>
WillisEdit : See the box, "First, Find the Haystack":  we mention Morningstar U.S. Equities on Floppy. Sorry--that's a disk--it's not online yet.<p>
BeanPiez   : Is there a place/resource where microcap stock prices are collected so that its easy to follow price changes?<p>
WillisEdit : The pink sheets for many of them. A broker can get you the info. But I wouldn't buy these with the idea of tracking prices daily. <p>
BeanPiez   : More based on fundamentals you talked about in the article?<p>
WillisEdit : That's right--who runs the company, do they have a niche, can they deal with competition... what would destroy them, are their products good, do they have some cash, are they really, really good at what they do.<p>
WillisEdit : Have any of you invested in firms with market caps below $25 million? If so, how'd you do?<p>
TAnder4835 : Yes, I did well with the help of h$H, he kept me abreast and I called the companies. A lot of the companies have Internet sites.<p>
WillisEdit : tander--good point. We didn't use those; are they any good?<p>
FHADI      : What is h$H?<p>
TAnder4835 : An investment service on the Internet , use Yahoo! to locate.<p>
WorthEdit3 : FHADI--you can find H$H at www.hh-club.com/. It is a subscription service which seeks companies priced at less than $1.25 per share.<p>
TAnder4835 : Re screens--how do you use them?<p>
WillisEdit : They let you screen for a variety of criteria. We looked for companies with decent earnings growth, low p/e's, good cash position and the like. What we found was this: few companies pass on all counts; instead, you'll have a fast-growing company with no cash or a really cheap stock with little growth. That's when you call the firm and try to scope out what they're up to...but the screens did help get us started.<p>
I've never understood why a low stock price tells you anything--it's low market cap that tells you a company's size as an investment.<p>
BeanPiez   : What's the most interesting thing you learned about microcap investing during your research?<p>
WillisEdit : The most interesting thing was that there are lots of great little companies (although far more bad little ones) that no one on Wall Street cares about--and they will talk to you until you're sick of their voices. It's just a great place for the small investor. You have to have some confidence in your ability to judge a management's character and intentions over the phone, but that's not as hard as it sounds. You can tell if someone's a fool pretty quickly. <p>
TAnder4835 : How do I set up a screen<p>
WillisEdit : It's pretty straightforward, but each program has its own directions. Just get access to a database program and then type in the criteria according to their codes and they do the rest.<p>
FHADI      : So, is stock price one of your least concerns with micros? <p>
WillisEdit : fhadi: price per se is not important--I don't care if a stock trades for $1 or $50 a share--value is another story. If a firm splits its stock 2 for 1, the price halves. Does that change its value as an investment? No.<p>
TAnder4835 : Are you talking to the CEO or PR? <p>
WillisEdit : Not the PR! Not the PR! Talk to the CEO. He or she (mostly he) will talk to you in 9 of 10 cases.<p>
TAnder4835 : Where do I get the database program, which is the best?<p>
WillisEdit : Call Morningstar at 800 866 3472 for Equities on floppy at $295 year monthly updates and $145 quarterly updates (I'd go with quarterly for my purposes--finding good looking stocks). <p>
BeanPiez   : Can you tell me exactly what market cap is? (Sorry, I know this is a basic question.) <p>
WillisEdit : Good question. Market cap is number of shares outstanding times share price.<p>
FHADI      : What key questions do you ask the CEO?<p>
WillisEdit : Ask them to tell you what the company does, why it does it better than anyone else, why no one else can come in and do it better and what their plans for the future are. How will they get bigger without attracting competition that will blow them away? Then sit back and listen.<p>
FHADI      : I've been sold a lemon by a good car salesman, what should I be picking out of the CEO's statement that will actually affect stock price?<p>
WillisEdit : You mean the statement in the annual report? Or just his statements to you on the phone or in person?<p>
FHADI      : On the phone.<p>
WillisEdit : You should be listening to the answers and then deciding if they make sense to you. If they just spout great news, that's not necessarily convincing. but if they are actually saying things that are interesting, that's a good sign. That seems vague, but the best policy is just to listen and decide if you think the story makes sense.<p>
TAnder4835 : Other than screens, is there a cheap way to pick?<p>
WillisEdit : Yes. Read the local paper and talk to friends in business, but the screens are by far the most efficient way to get a bunch of interesting names to call. Again, I'd stress you don't just buy a company that screens well. God forbid.<p>
TAnder4835 : Kudos to you Clint --thanks for the info.<p>
Vision1972 : Of your top eight microcap picks, which has the most life left?<p>
WillisEdit : Sorry, I don't closely  monitor 'em once the piece goes to the magazine. I'd call the companies before you invest.<p>
WorthEdit6 : That concludes this edition of "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's live weekly chat series. The Worth staff extends its appreciation to Clint Willis for being our guest this evening.<p>
WillisEdit : Thanks--good luck everyone, and thanks a lot to Worth.

						OnlineHost : Welcome to "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's new live chat show series. Every week we give readers the chance to chat with leaders in money and markets. Check our site (Keyword: Worth) for a calendar of upcoming events. Find out what really does work on Wall street with our guest tonight --  James O'Shaughnessy, author of "What Works on Wall Street."<p>
"What Works on Wall Street" is an analysis of 30 years worth of CompuStat stock market data that shows how the 15 most popular investment strategies have actually performed over time. Tonight James O'Shaughnessy will talk about his results. His screen name is JPOSOCM. Mr. O'Shaughnessy will begin taking questions.<p>
Would you like to say anything before we post the first question, Mr. O'Shaughnessy?<p>
JPOSOCM    : Sure, I'm happy to be here on Worth Online, and I think we've found some exciting results from the past 45 years of data.<p>
Question   : How did you go about this project?<p>
JPOSOCM    : We used the S&P Compustat database going back to 1951. Compustat is the most comprehensive database available today. It covers over 10,000 stocks in North America alone. We then tested a large number of the Streets most popular strategies such as buying low PE stocks, high yield, high earnings growth, etc. The results are for the longest time period. We rebalanced the portfolios every year, to once again reflect a holding of whatever factor we were interested in.<p>
Question   : Where would you put money today for 4 year old granddaughter?<p>
JPOSOCM    : In the best strategy we uncovered -- that is called "Cornerstone Growth" in the book. It buys stocks with (1) back-to-back earnings gains over the last five years, (2) Price-to-sales ratios below 1.5 and (3) the best 50 stocks by price momentum. <p>
Question   : What does your research say about mutual funds vs. stocks vs. bonds? <p>
JPOSOCM    : Stocks destroy bonds over the long term, with even horrible stock stratetgies beating bonds by wide margins. The mutual funds with the clearest buying strategies are the best to look at, with those that say "trust me" bringing up the rear. Look for clear, concise statements about how they buy and sell stocks. The more strategic a fund, the better its results.<p>
Question   : Are the results from your book good forever or are they just fads of the moment?<p>
JPOSOCM    : Just the opposite of the fads of the moment. We cover over 44 years of performance data on a whole host of strategies. Fad stocks are usually easy to see by their high PEs, high PSRs and high price to books. The strategies we uncovered as the best usually buy just the opposite, with a focus on good value ratios, or good value and good relative strength.<p>
Question   : Buying 50 individual stocks is a little beyond my means.  Do you have any suggestions for finding a mutual fund which approximates the Cornerstone Growth strategy? <p>
JPOSOCM    : I can't comment on mutal funds because we have four in registration with the SEC.<p>
Question   : If your results are of the last 50 years, what does that say about my investing life time which only has about 25 years to go?<p>
JPOSOCM    : I think whatever your time frame, these results lead you to the best strategey for you if you only have 10 years left to go 'til retirement, you'll want to invest in a lower risk strategy, if more, you can opt for a strategy with more risk.<p>
Question   : In a highly valued market like the current one, how many stocks would have a price-to-sales ration of 1.5 like you use in Cornerstone Growth?<p>
JPOSOCM    : More than 100 stocks currently have eps gains for the last five years and PSRs below 1.5 out of the 1000s in Compustat.<p>
Question   : Do you have any comments on the Dow Dividend strategy?<p>
JPOSOCM    : I love the Dogs of the Dow. I studied that back to when the modern 30 stock Dow was born in 1928 and found that it beat the S&P 500 in every decade from the 30s to the 90s. It's also an excellent strategy for the individual investor to use since it buys only 10 stocks.<p>
Question   : Did you cover technical analysis in the book?<p>
JPOSOCM    : No, just the quanatitaive use of fundemental data, with the possible exception of price momentum.<p>
Question   : How can your average Joe use these findings?<p>
JPOSOCM    : Use them to know what to avoid and what to focus on. For example, if you've got a hankering to buy a stock with a very high PE or price-to-sale ratio, you'll take a look at the results of high PSR stocks and maybe take a second look. Likewise, you might pay more attention to the lower PE or PSR stocks since they did so much.<p>
Question   : Overall, what's the time frame one should hold a stock for? <p>
JPOSOCM    : We rebalanced these portfolios once a year.<p>
Question   : Does your book cover the pros and cons of sector investing?<p>
JPOSOCM    : No, we look only at underlying factors. I think you're much better off with specific factors instead of sectors.<p>
Question   : Is your book really a battlecry for Benjamin Graham's value investing?<p>
JPOSOCM    : Value ratios alone work very well, but we've also found some great growth strategies. Usually all the best growth strategies involve strong relative price strength. One of the best strategies buys cheap stocks (PSR<1) with the best price momentum.<p>
Question   : Do you have any strategy for someone who has no need for income, but rather wants to preserve captial with moderate growth oover a 25 year period -- with the intention of leaving it all to the kids?<p>
JPOSOCM    : Yes, I would suggest taking a look at what I call the Cornerstone Value strategy in the book. I buy market leading stocks with high dividend yields. Over the last 44 years, it has done about 4 times as well as the S&P 500 with a similar level of risk (when measured by standard deviation of return.)<p>
Question   : What do you think about the market vs. the savings of the Baby Boomers for the next 10 years?<p>
JPOSOCM    : I think that the boomers savings can only help the market over the next 10 years.<p>
Question   : My broker advises that I buy B shares to avoid paying fees if I hold for 5 years. Is this correct?<p>
JPOSOCM    : I'm not sure I'd have to see the fund.<p>
Question   : Name some of the cheap PSR stocks.<p>
JPOSOCM    : Some of the low PSR, high relative strength stocks are CompUSA, DELL, Gateway, Safeway, US AIR.<p>
Question   : How long have you been an investor in the stock market and what do you know about network marketing. Is it a good strategy?<p>
JPOSOCM    : I've been an investor on my own hook since 1979, a pro since 1988. Networking marketing I don't know about.<p>
Question   : What is your idea of a good solid investment?<p>
JPOSOCM    : If you are a long-term investor, you can't beat the stock market. Even if a bear is right around the corner. <p>
Question   : Have you discovered any market timing secrets?<p>
JPOSOCM    : The best market timing compares the market's earnings yield + dividend yield to T-bills. When they get too close, you might be in trouble.<p>
Question   : How much capital does one need to become involved in the stock market? <p>
JPOSOCM    : I would start with $5,000 if you are investing in mutal funds, more if individual stocks.<p>
Question   : I read both of your books and my question is will your Cornerstone Growth strategy work better rebalancing every 6 months instead of 12 months?<p>
JPOSOCM    : Slightly, but I think it's a wash after the transaction costs.<p>
Question   : Are there ways to use DRIPS to follow your advice or does rebalancing a portfolio every year make that difficult?<p>
JPOSOCM    : I think you could use DRIPS, provided you sell them when they no longer meet the critieria.<p>
Question   : If you rebalance the portfolio every year, have you analyzed the effect of capital gains taxes on your strategies?<p>
JPOSOCM    : I have looked at the costs, and we're trying to get it unifed for the next version of the book.<p>

						On Wednesday, August 21, Professor Martin Gruber, chairman of the Department of Finance at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University, joined Worth OnLine for a live Conference Call. 
Gruber is the author of a recent study that shows you may not be getting what you pay for from your mutual fund. During the hour-long chat, Gruber discussed the findings of his study and the relation of mutual funds to index funds. Following is a transcript of the live event, edited for clarity. The views expressed are those of Martin Gruber and do not represent the views of Worth, Worth OnLine, or Capital Publishing.<p>
WorthOnLne : Welcome to "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's live chat show series. Every week we give readers the opportunity to chat with the leaders in money and markets. Check our site (Keyword: Worth) for a calendar of upcoming events. Our guest tonight is Martin Gruber, chairman of the Department of Finance at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University. Tonight he'll be answering questions about the findings of his study. The following is an abstract of Professor Gruber's paper "Another Puzzle: The Growth in Actively Managed Mutual Funds." <p>
"Mutual Funds represent one of the fastest growing type of financial intermediary in the American economy.  The question remains as to why mutual funds and in particular actively managed mutual funds have grown so fast when their performance on average has been inferior to that of index funds. One possible explanation of why investors buy actively managed open end funds lies in the fact that they are bought and sold at net asset value and thus management ability may not be priced.  If management ability exists and it is not included in the price of open and funds, then performance should be predictable. If performance is predictable and at least some investors are aware of this, then cash flows into and out of funds should be predictable by the very same metrics that predict performance. <p>
Finally, if predictors exist and at least some investors act on these predictors in investing in mutual funds, the return on new cash flows should be better than the average return for all investors in these funds. This paper presents empirical evidence on all of these issues and shows that investors in actively managed mutual funds may have been more rational than we have assumed."<p>
(The text of the whole article is available in the July issue of "The Journal of Finance.") <p>
Professor Gruber can begin to take questions now...<p>
To begin would you talk briefly about the general conclusions of your study of Mutual Funds?<p>
ProfGruber : One of the important conclusions is that past performance is an indicator of future performance. Funds that did well in the past tend to do well in the future. Another indicator is expense ratios. Funds with lower expense ratios tend to do better in the future. Another conclusion of the study is that actively managed mutual funds, on average, do about 60 basis points a year worse than index funds with the same objective.<p>
Vesta8     : Is this 60 basis points lower true for all types of funds?<p>
ProfGruber : No, this study is of domestic common stock funds.<p>
RedHeelr   : What do you see for International Funds, especially those for the Asia Pacific rim?<p>
ProfGruber : These funds provide an advantage to the investor because of diversification. They tend to move differently than the U.S. funds and thereby adding some investments in these funds to a U.S. portfolio can lower risk. <p>
RedHeelr   : What do you consider a lower expense ratio? <p>
ProfGruber : Let me talk about expense ratios on domestic stock funds. The average expense ratio is about 130 basis points per year. However, many funds are just out there with expense ratios of below 30 basis points per year. Anything below 130 has lower than average expense ratios.<p>
International funds and specialty funds tend to have higher expense ratios than domestic stock funds. Bond funds tend to have lower expense ratios. The expense ratio for a fund includes management fees -- that's the fees paid for professional management. These usually account for about one half of the expense ratio. The rest of the expense ratio is made up of administrative fees and may include 12b1 fees. 12b1 fees constitute advertising and marketing fees. The law allows the investor in funds to be charged directly for marketing fees, sales contests, or other advertising costs. They can give away television sets to salesmen and charge the fund holder for the expense.<p>
RedHeelr   : So if I see an ad for my fund in Worth, I'm directly helping to pay for it?<p>
ProfGruber : Well, it depends on whether or not the fund has 12b1 fees. Not all funds have them. This would be reported in the prospectus of the fund, where the maximum 12b1 fee will be stated. 12b1 fees can be as high as 75 basis points per year.<p>
RedHeelr   : What is the difference between the actively managed funds and index funds you mentioned?<p>
ProfGruber : Index funds do not employ analysts or portfolio managers. They simply duplicate an index. There are over 100 index funds offered to the public. There are funds that duplicate the S&P Index; there are funds that replicate the performance of the largest 400 stocks; there are index funds that replicate the performance of all bonds in the market; there are index funds that replicate growth stocks or value stocks. As an example, an S&P Index fund should offer almost exactly the same as the S&P Index. Because these funds don't employ analysts or portfolio managers, their expense ratios are usually very low. Index funds exist with average expense ratios below 20 basis points a year.<p>
AUTISM ASA : I appreciate your point about expenses, but there are many funds such as PBHG which have low expenses and no 12b expenses and have beat the indexes<p>
ProfGruber : One of my earliest points was that one of the indicators of good performance in picking actively managed funds that will do well is to pick funds with low expense ratios. A second indicator is to pick funds that have done well in the past.<p>
BeachBoyX8 : Many funds are new with no past.<p>
ProfGruber : It's very difficult to pick winners among funds that have no past. One of the problems is that funds that start up and don't do well tend to be merged in the funds that have done well, so that when one looks at the performance now of a fund that started a few years ago, what one would see is a record of the funds that are new and have done well. What you don't see is the record of the funds that started and did poorly. Current databases and lists of funds in business publications talk about the past performance of funds that exist today. In the past 10 years, 21 percent of the stock funds that existed 10 years ago no longer exist as stock funds. Lists of common stock funds will not contain information about these fund that did not continue.<p>
SUGAR711   : Prof, you indicated in your "promo" that the average manager could and cannot beat the S&P 500 average... why do you feel this way? my funds are all just doing fine, and I have a portfolio made up of 17 funds in 20 accounts.<p>
ProfGruber : Congratulations. What I said was that in the past, actually 30 years, as well as in the past 10 years, the average fund has not beat the S&P Index. I believe that with careful analysis using some of the factors I've already discussed, it's possible to find funds that do beat the S&P Index. The average investor over the past 30 years, has not done that. There are no doubt investors that have.<p>
RedHeelr   : Why do actively managed funds do worse than index funds with the same objective?<p>
ProfGruber : On average, they do worse because they engage in much higher transaction costs because they are trading -- that's what active management does --  and because they charge the investor much higher expense ratios so that the active manager has to have information sufficient to more than compensate for the extra  1 1/2 to 2 percent which the investor pays over and above what he would pay if he or she were to buy an index fund.<p>
BeachBoyX8 : Isn't the performance of the manager critical- i.e. Van Wagoner's new funds have been flying high.<p>
ProfGruber : The manager's performance is critical. Some managers have enough analytical ability and skill to compensate for the extra 2 percent. On average, all managers don't have enough skill to compensate for the extra 2 percent. The higher the expense ratio in a fund, the more skilled the manager must be to compensate for the investor paying such high expense ratios. Thus, the higher the expense ratios, the more advanced the investor should require in buying and selecting a fund.<p>
SUGAR711   : If one does their homework, they should be able to pick 5-star rated funds with great 3, 5, and 10 year recs.<p>
ProfGruber : In my paper, I show that if one were to select every year the 10 percent of all funds with the best performance, one would do slightly better than purchasing an index fund.<p>
SUGAR711   : Prof, I agree, but a good manager such as a Robert Stansky or a Michael Price beats the averages consistently, and all other talented managers should be able to do the same.<p>
WorthOnLne : If mangers that did well in the past, do well in the future, does that affect cash flow?<p>
SUGAR711   : 7000 funds out there,... <p>
ProfGruber : There's a direct relationship between past performance and future cash flows. The 10 percent of the funds which did best over the past year have cash flows of about 25 percent per year, while the 10 percent of the funds that did poorest have negative cash flows equal to 15 percent of capital per year.<p>
N090       : What is the best mutual fund?<p>
SUGAR711   : There is no one best mutual fund! Do your homework, and you pick the best fund for your needs and situation.....<p>
ProfGruber : N090--There IS one mutual fund that will do best next year-- I just don't know which one it is!<p>
WorthOnLne : Do you think the average individual investor has the time to do the "homework" necessary to pick high performing funds?<p>
ProfGruber : Some individual investors actually take pleasure in investigating funds to pick high performing funds. If an investor does not want to put any time and effort into selecting the funds he will buy, then index funds should be the preferred choice. History would seem to indicate that investors who are willing to look at past performance and expenses can, on average, do slightly better than index funds.<p>
Ronufer    : We read that international funds will outperform U.S. funds. When will we see this?<p>
MLTIPTON   : In starting out in mutual funds are there any funds without the minimum deposit?<p>
ProfGruber : I think there are funds with very small minimum deposits.<p>
MLTIPTON   : Who would you suggest to talk to?<p>
ProfGruber : The easiest thing to do is to go to the library, look up in the Morningstar service, or one of the other mutual fund reference books, such as Lipper, and they will list the minimum balance for all of the mutual funds. <p>
WorthOnLne : Morningstar has a site on AOL.  Keyword: morningstar.  You might fund some of the info you are looking for there.<p>
Ronufer    : What kind of bond fund belongs in a tax-deferred retirement account?<p>
ProfGruber : Ron--Certainly do not buy municipal bond funds because you can't take advantage of the tax savings. Both corporate bond funds and corporate bond funds have a place in such an account. {error}<p>
WorthOnLne : Do you recommend index funds over managed stock mutual funds? And if so, why?<p>
ProfGruber : As I've said earlier, it is possible to select a portfolio fund that outperforms index funds if one is willing to take the effort to study past performance and past expenses. If you don't want to make this effort, then I suggest index funds as the preferred vehicle. Again, let me say that I base this on the fact that for the past 30 years, and over the past 10 years, the average investor in mutual funds and the average dollar placed in mutual funds, has not done as well as index funds. <p>
WorthOnLne : What do you feel are the most important implications of your study of historical mutual fund performance?<p>
ProfGruber : The most important implication of my study is that there is persistence in mutual fund performance. That is that past performance tends to be an indicator of future performance. This persistence is clearest in the case of poor performing funds, funds that perform poorly relative to an appropriate benchmark. The persistence also exists with respect to good performance, although it's not as marked as it is with poor performers. Another important finding of the study is that actively managed mutual funds, while they have done slightly worse than index funds, they have underperformed index funds by less than the expense ratios. So that management, on average, in actively managed mutual funds has had stock selection ability, it's just been worth less than the fees they've charged the investor to get access to that ability. <p>
WorthOnLne : Then would you attribute the performance of *star* fund managers like Peter Lynch to extraordinary ability, or consistent good luck?<p>
ProfGruber : Either ability or luck!<p>
RedHeelr   : So, expense ratios, index funds and past performance. Any other findings?<p>
ProfGruber : The new money which has followed high past performance into funds has tended to earn a return about 20 basis points per year better than index funds.<p>
RedHeelr   : Here comes my ignorance--Basis Point?<p>
ProfGruber : A basis point is a hundredth of a percent, so that 100 basis points equals one percent.<p>
Thank you for your questions! <p>
WorthOnLne : A complete transcript of this event, will be posted in the Today box on our opening screen next week.

						On Wednesday, August 14, Samuel Stewart, founder and president of Wasatch Advisors Inc. joined Worth OnLine during "Conference Call," our live chat show series. Along with co-manager Karey Barker, Stewart manages the Wasatch mid-cap fund, with $180 million in assets. The fund invests in fast growing, small- to mid-sized companies with market capitalization of between $300 million and $5 billion. Stewart talked about his approach to tackling the current market and answered questions about specific industries and selecting a mutual fund. Following is a transcript of the live event, edited for clarity. The views expressed are those of Samuel Stewart and do not represent the views of Worth, Worth OnLine, or Capital Publishing.<p>
MSS1040    : What about biotech, especially CELI?<p>
WasatchAdv : Many biotechs have lots of hype.  We usually like to see earnings. <p>
Gjjjones   : Interested in a no-load mutual fund...check writing to use to buy and sell stock...any good suggestion for online trading?<p>
WasatchAdv : No direct recommendations regarding checks or online trading.<p>
Dianne4036 : When researching a stock, are there particular things you suggest looking for?<p>
WasatchAdv : Lots of ways to skin a cat, read The Money Game. We like to find small companies that will become big ones.<p>
WorthOnLne : What are your thoughts on the current market?<p>
OldHippie  : Just got a 25,000 dollar windfall...suggestions?<p>
WasatchAdv : Have to know more about your goals.<p>
OldHippie  : Want to safeguard some of it...half would be open to speculation.<p>
WasatchAdv : How long do you plan to invest, risk tolerance? Always suggest mutual funds for both diversfication and pro management, our Mid-Cap is good for speculation.<p>
LC 517     : Just got $150,000, need $10,000 in income yearly and make the rest grow? Help?<p>
WasatchAdv : Probably use conservative stock fund and use some income and some principal to meet need.<p>
LC 517     : Any way I can meet my goals without touching the principal?<p>
WasatchAdv : Likely, invest in Income fund such as Wasatch-Hoisington <p>
Ron 1 Putt : Into Eaton Vance India Fund (Heavy)--Down 30% Any Thoughts? <p>
WasatchAdv : Big political risk...but suggest you focus on long run...but forget that you are down and make fresh decision today.<p>
LC 517     : How do you feel about utilities stock?<p>
WasatchAdv : Utility stock would be ok but a bit trickier than you might think due to deregulation.<p>
Dianne4036 : Where are the stocks with the greatest profit potential?<p>
WasatchAdv : Would suggest that MOST investors use funds not stocks.  Funds with best potential are small, growth stock oriented.<p>
Dianne4036 : Why funds, not stocks? (I admit I don't have a lot of time to fuss with my portfolio.)<p>
WasatchAdv : Because competition is real tough...don't play poker with the pros.  This is a 24x7 business.<p>
LC 517     : Equity funds vs. tax free, free funds? <p>
WasatchAdv : Apples vs oranges, depends on yur needs.<p>
LC 517     : I want to double my $150,000 in five years.<p>
WasatchAdv : Money magazine recommended Wasatch fund for doubling in 5 years. This is a realistic goal for growth fund.<p>
LC 517     : What particular funds do you suggest?<p>
WasatchAdv : Our own, of course, that's where my money is.<p>
LC 517     : How do I begin investing with Wasatch as I am new to investing?<p>
WasatchAdv : Call 800-551-1700 for prospectus and investors kit.<p>
LC 517     : Are there fees involved?<p>
WasatchAdv : Our funds are all no load..no up-front charges...a management fee is deducted.<p>
JSbihli    : What size are mid-cap companies? Why would I want to invest there?<p>
WasatchAdv : From $500 million to $1 billion, companies still in process of being discovered by big companies like Merrill Lynch.<p>
Dianne4036 : The mid-cap one took a beating recently. What do you say to those investors?<p>
WasatchAdv : Good question...basically tell them our focus is long term and the MidCap is designed to have lots of volatility, big rewards require risks.<p>
JSbihli    : What are your biggest percentage companies in your fund?<p>
WasatchAdv : ESRX, MCHP, WCOM.<p>
JSbihli    : Do you think WCOM will venture with anyone? who? EDS?<p>
WasatchAdv : js: i've heard rumors about mfs, haven't heard eds<p>
Dianne4036 : What is "long term" in the fund world? And does that mean investors should time when they buy into one?<p>
WasatchAdv : To us it is 5 years. The best time to invest is 20 years ago, the next best is today.<p>
Dianne4036 : I'm 29, so what should my time frame be?<p>
WasatchAdv : dian: peter lynch used to say that he invested as though the market was going up every day because over the long run that's what it does.<p>
Dianne4036 : But everyone's screaming about the pending shakeout. It makes me want to stuff money in the mattress!<p>
WasatchAdv : Depends upon when you want the money...if for retirement, you've got 30 years.<p>
Dianne4036 : On average, how often do investors move their money from fund-to-fund in 30 years?<p>
WasatchAdv : dian: one of the reasons to go w/ a pro is to let them worry...Shouldn't be in stock market unless you are focused on long term. Better in the market than a mattress.<p>
Dianne4036 : But even as an investor in funds, I feel I must do my due diligence--making sure there's no churning..<p>
WasatchAdv : My rec: find a fund or 3 that you like and don't switch unless something drastic happens. Due diligence is good find a style that you believe in, not who has the hot hand.
JSbihli    : What is the value of your fund?<p>
WasatchAdv : Today's nav is 17.11 up .08.<p>
JSbihli    : What was your high this year?<p>
WasatchAdv : High was 20.61 on 5/15 and low 15.02 on 7/15..this is a speculative fund<p>
JLBVette   : Do you think there will be continued volatility in the market?<p>
WasatchAdv : jlb: bernard bauch (remember him?) said the market will fluctuate.  Was true then (1929)...still true today.<p>
DMKline    : What are the three main criterion that you look for in a midcap company?<p>

             organization.<p>
JLBVette   : What is your asset size?<p>
WasatchAdv : $130 million<p>
JLBVette   : Any plans to close fund?<p>
WasatchAdv : No, because the stocks it uses are bigger than aggressive (closed) and micrcap (closing).<p>
RJVVVVV    : I've got a 6 month old daughter, which of your funds should I go w/:  Micro/ Mid/Growth?<p>
WasatchAdv : Micro<p>
RJVVVVV    : Main reason why?<p>
WasatchAdv : Because the micro is our scarcest commodity..will close in a few months and also uses the smallest, rarest stocks.<p>
MAmizer    : CCEE or NMPS??<p>
WasatchAdv : ma: no opinion<p>
JLBVette   : What is your YTD return and return for month of July?<p>
WasatchAdv : Stop asking embarrassing questions... YTD: -6.45%. <p>
JLBVette   : I didn't mean to embarrass you. What makes you decide to buy a stock?<p>
MAmizer    : NMPS - worth looking into - FDA approval for bladder cancer test, highly accurate.<p>
Dianne4036 : What kind of asset allocation do you recommend for fund investors?<p>
WasatchAdv : We don't recommend allocating assets based on market conditions but based on goals.<p>
JLBVette   : Do you have any favorite sectors to buy?<p>
WasatchAdv : We look for small companies that we think can become big ones. Because we are growth oriented, we always tend to have lots of money in technology and health care.<p>
JLBVette   : Have you ever looked at KITS or PCNI?<p>
WasatchAdv : jlb: no<p>
Dianne4036 : When do you sell? Specifically, what fundamentals make you get out?<p>
WasatchAdv : Sell for two resons:  most important if we no longer believe in growth potential of company.. 2nd is if valuation becomes excessive.<p>
Ved Flyer  : What is your outlook for tech stocks for the next year?<p>
WasatchAdv : We like techs here, though there may be another down draft due to semi equipment.<p>
JLBVette   : What % of earnings growth do you like?<p>
WasatchAdv : Minimum 15 percent but most important is sustainability of growth rather than rate.<p>
Dianne4036 : What are the three most recent stocks you've decided to limit your exposure to?<p>
WasatchAdv : dian: one is heilig meyers due to disappointing sales, another pham<p>
JLBVette   : Do you like to see a lot of insider ownership?<p>
WasatchAdv : Love to see insider owning.<p>
JLBVette   : I like to buy low debt companies, what about you?<p>
WasatchAdv : Lots of ours have low debt, but we focus more on business prospects.<p>
Dianne4036 : pham?<p>
WasatchAdv : Phamis Health care info systems, large contracts slipping a bit.<p>
Dianne4036 : I see. What was your exposure and how big of a bite did those take from the fund's overall performance?<p>
WasatchAdv : pham was 5% and fell nearly in half before we sold, costing us 2.5%.<p>
JLBVette   : Was you fund positive before July?<p>
WasatchAdv : Slightly positive.<p>
BradT45527 : Could you comment a little on Heilig Meyers?<p>
JLBVette   : How old is your fund?<p>
WasatchAdv : 1992<p>
WasatchAdv : We like hmy due to its focus on smaller towns..kind of a mini Walmart.<p>
JLBVette   : Do you buy foreign stocks?<p>
WasatchAdv : A few.<p>
JLBVette   : What has been one of your most recent buys & what sparked your interest?<p>
WasatchAdv : Added to our mchp position<p>
JLBVette   : How many stocks in the fund<p>
WasatchAdv : 33<p>
JLBVette   : You take big bets on a few stocks then.<p>
WasatchAdv : Yes, we don't want portfolio to get stale..you pay us to be on top of our companies. Like mchp due to idea of embedded computers, in cars, in tv clickers, etc mchp is well-managed and was right on top of recent weakness before most anyone else.<p>
JLBVette   : What is your expense ratio, turnover ratio?<p>
WasatchAdv : 1.75%, turnover lower than you might think at 30%<p>
JLBVette   : 30% turnover, so you do hold onto your stocks for a while then.<p>
WasatchAdv : Yes, we hold for a long time while companies get big.<p>
Plouie     : Do you have an opinion on the semiconductor equipment makers?<p>
WasatchAdv : They are tempting here but it might be a bit early.<p>
Plouie     : I would tend to agree.<p>
OAbdulla   : What has been the return of DJIA since the Crash of 1987?<p>
WasatchAdv : I think Dow got down to 1700 so it's more than a triple off low.<p>
OAbdulla   : I don't understand your answer of more than a triple off low?<p>
WasatchAdv : 1700 to 5600<p>
OAbdulla   : Give me a percentage.<p>
WasatchAdv : 200%+<p>
OAbdulla   : Is that good according to history?<p>
WasatchAdv : Awesome..but don't usually get in at bottom or sell at top<p>
PJSDOG     : is there anyway to tell what a mutual fund is buying or selling on say a monthly basis, rather than waiting for a annual report.<p>
WasatchAdv : Hard to do consistently..we don't give out info and most don't.<p>
JLBVette   : Do you think your negative return will scare off potential investors, since overall market is positive.<p>
Sarjs4     : Sam, where do you see this market in October of 1996?<p>
WasatchAdv : Not much different from today, but we don't really focus on stock marke calls. Economy is healthy, inflation in check. So stocks should do ok. <p>
Sarjs4     : Do you like financial stocks, such as savings and loans, aka thrifts?<p>
WasatchAdv : We like some but you've got to be careful.<p>
Plouie     : Have you ever had an instance of company management misleading you? And what types of warnings signs may signal caution?<p>
WasatchAdv : More often unintentionally than intentionally. Best take on management is experience plus gut feeling.<p>
Sarjs4     : What do you think about thrifts in the California area? Do you hold any in your funds?<p>
WasatchAdv : We own a small loan business cfac based on la..like a thrift.<p>
Sarjs4     : You had a very impressive return last year. even with the market's current volatility, do you think you can duplicate it?<p>
WasatchAdv : sa: don't think we can duplicate 95 consistently..better to focus on long run goal of about 15 percent.<p>
RMan1604   : I put money into your fund in March.  Tell me it was just bad timing.<p>
WasatchAdv : I put money in, too..it was unfortunate...stick with it.<p>
KGlaz21458 : Which of your funds do you recommend most at the present time?<p>
WasatchAdv : Micro because it is closing soon.<p>
WasatchAdv : Thanks to all! Wife and kids await.<p>

					</center>
					<font size=4>
						On August 1, Charlie Silk, the man Peter Lynch called the "world's greatest amateur investor,"joined Worth OnLine for "Conference Call." Faced with the age-old question "How do you find a good stock?," Silk set about trying to find good stocks among small companies. His search eventually led to Cook Data Services, in which he bought $10,000 worth of stock for $3 a share. Now known as Blockbuster Entertainment, which was selling at $450 a share when Lynch wrote his article in April 1994, Silk's $10,000 investment made him a millionaire. What follows is a transcript of the event, edited for clarity. The opinions expressed here are those of Charlie Silk and do not reflect the opinions of Worth OnLine.<p>
OnlineHost : Welcome to "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's live chat show series. Check our site (Keyword: Worth) for a calendar of upcoming events. Our guest tonight is Charlie Silk, the man Peter Lynch called the "world's greatest amateur investor." Silk will share some of his investing secrets and talk about what, when, and how to buy, when and why to sell, and all things in between.<p>
First we will hear a few comments from Mr. Silk.<p>
WorthSilk  : Fallen angels within the NASDAQ national market system can be a very intriguing arena to explore for interesting investment candidates. These downtrodden issues have the potential to become very attractive valuation investments. With further research and analysis, you may discover a gem which could again turn into a growth/momentum stock that could prove to be handsomely rewarding. <p>
The name of the game is knowledge. The more legitimate information you obtain and absorb, the better your chances are of realizing significant appreciation of your capital. Conversely, if you don't do your homework, the investment you make may be harmful to your wealth. <p>
My past studies have shown that the huge number of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and secondaries that have been underwritten since 1991 provide a vast universe of neglected stocks to explore. Since these stocks are under-owned by institutions, there is no incentive for Wall Street analysts to follow or report on them. Since I am a private amateur investor who is neither a registered rep or a registered investment adviser, it would be inappropriate for me to answer requests about specific stocks. Nor do I wish to discuss those securities in which I currently hold a position. <p>
What I hope to accomplish is to present to you my methodology in finding these pearls that are hidden in the vast NASDAQ universe of more than 5,000 stocks. In addition, I'd like to share with you my thoughts on where the market may be headed in this very volatile environment.<p>
Question   : How would you define a "fallen angel?"<p>
WorthSilk  : My definition of a fallen angel is a stock that is making a new low in price and has fallen at least 50 percent below its past 52 week high.<p>
This is my arbitrary technical measure which eliminates those stocks that don't have the volatility I'm looking for. Generally, they appear in abundance when there is a sharp correction in the market or during a bear market. For instance, from April 10 1996 to June 5 1996, I found only 70 individual stocks that meet this criteria. Only 2 were worthy of further investigation. The number is growing due to the severe selloff in the NASDAQ market.<p>
Question   : How do you screen stocks out of the universe for further investigation?  What criteria?<p>
WorthSilk  : I've developed a very quick and easy method to determine if I want to pursue a further detailed analysis of the stock. My parameters: <p>
1--what is the cash per share of the stock? Does the cash per share equal at least 40 percent of the stock price?<p>
2--If the total of the current liabilities and long term debt exceeds the total current assets, I immediately reject the stock from further consideration.<p>
3--After calculating the net current assets per share, a comparison of this value is made to the stock price. If the net current assets per share is approx. twice the share price, it may be worthy of further research<p>
4--Is the book to value per share at least 3 times the share price? If it meets a combination of the above factors, I call the stockholder relations spokesperson of the company and request all available published information on the corporation to be sent to me.<p>
Question   : When researching a stock, are there particular things you suggest looking for?<p>
WorthSilk  : Value investors buy stocks when prices are beaten down relative to earnings and other fundamentals. A low price doesn't mean that it is cheap. If the corporation has assets that aren't being dissipated, then the real issue is whether the knockdown price has been overdone. Cash rich companies can make great investments. They offer investors hard assets that hold up the value of the stock. The company's future is more important than its past.<p>
Don't get dazzled by a product. Don't get fooled by a fad. Don't let emotions get in the way. Study all the information you can get. Don't pay too much for the stock. The company's future is more important than its past.<p>
Question : Mr. Silk, where are the stocks with the greatest profit potential?<p>
WorthSilk  : My favorite market to find those stocks with the greatest upside potential is the NASDAQ market system. Very few analysts follow companies in this universe, and therein lie the undiscovered gems. A '92 study showed that 76 percent of NYSE companies are followed by more than 2 analysts. Only 38 percent of NASDAQ companies meet the same situation. The percentage of analysts following must have dropped to significantly lower numbers due to the huge increase in IPOs underwritten since 1992.<p>
Question   : When picking stocks, what should I be concerned with? <p>
WorthSilk  : There are many more people who buy and sell stocks based on simplistic thinking than those who devote their time to investigate the underlying facts. A tip could be hazardous to your wealth! You may be at the bottom of the information food chain. Learning how to do basic research just takes time. You can't read about it. You just have to do your homework. Be aware of the fundamentals behind the financial statements. Evaluate them as you would if you were buying a business. And finally, try to get the most assets and earnings power for your dollar.<p>
Question   : What can you tell me about when to sell stocks? <p>
WorthSilk  : Often people sell their winners and keep their losers. People don't want to admit they made a mistake. A good way to get rid of potential losers is to determine if the reason you bought it is no longer valid. If you get a negative earnings surprise, generally other disappointments may occur. Sell it as best you can. Few investors have the emotional psyche to hang on to the big one in order to get the huge payoff. It takes a strong mind and a willingness to go against the crowd. If you do your research and find the fundamentals are solid and improving, stay with the stock, especially if it is a sound company. If you have a significant gain and the market is moving up strongly, think of selling a portion into the rise. If the stock has made a strong upward move and the trading becomes very heavy with little further advance, sell a good portion of your stock, you may find that it could pull back 25 to 30 percent.<p>
Question   : What are your comments about the "current market situation?"<p>
WorthSilk  : Although the direction of interest rates has the most critical effect on the direction of the market, I feel there is a more important force at work at this time. You must be cognizant of how mutual stock funds dominate the stock market. <p>
Eighty percent of trading on the markets is now undertaken by institutions. An unprecedented amount of funds that have flowed into stock mutual funds since Nov. 95--about $170 billion in the last eight months. For the most recent period, Feb. to May 96, a very high percentage of the money went into aggressive growth funds--from 30 percent to more than 50 percent in some months. <p>
Aggressive growth funds mainly concentrate on momentum stocks. With this approach, most of their stocks are purchased when trading volume in a stock accelerates dramatically and with ever increasing price levels. The only other consideration is the supposed fast earnings growth of the company with little regard to other fundamental values.<p>
Question   : What is your feeling on dividend reinvestment plans?<p>
WorthSilk  : They are immaterial because very few companies on the NASDAQ pay dividends.<p>
Question   : Mr. Silk, please tell us your views on technology stocks.<p>
WorthSilk  : Technology represents 10 percent of the U.S.'s gross domestic product (GDP) and in less than 10 years it could double. High tech is the country's future. And it is going to keep growing. <p>
Computer networks--growth of 30 percent to 50 percent
PCs globally--growth of 15 percent to 20 percent
Global cellular phones--growth of 40 percent<p>
Anybody who is a growth-oriented investor has to consider high-tech stocks. The tech stock sector is one in which most investors do not understand what they own. They buy at too expensive prices and sell too cheap. They often panic in a market reversal. The momentum players have driven up many smaller tech stocks. They dive into the same stocks because they have the same stock picking criteria. When the high tech stocks start to become hot, they attract traders and the public. If these stocks come up short on fundamentals, especially earning disappointment or revenue shortfall, they are aggressively sold. There is no way that they all can get out on the same day. Prices melt very fast, especially on the NASDAQ market. At the time of market declines, there is no liquidity. Market makers will not absorb much stock since they don't have large pools of capital. These market makers are in the moving business--not in the storage business.<p>
Question   : Charlie...Is your method applicable to foreign stocks? If so, what country do see opportunities today? <p>
WorthSilk  : Israeli stocks on NASDAQ--there are 70--and the reporting criteria is similar to the U.S. and very easy to understand. Find the public relations firm that represents these companies in the U.S.<p>
Question   : Any other negatives on the horizon as far as you can see?<p>
WorthSilk  : From now until the end of the year, we are coming up the tax loss selling season. For most mutual funds, their tax reporting year ends Oct. 31. At that time the funds are obligated to pay out 95 percent of their net realized gains to stockholders. If the fund does not sell their unrealized losses, they would need to pay out more cash than would be prudent. When the losses are realized, the pressures will be put on those stocks that have declined significantly. The flood of sales would then overwhelm the market makers. Bids will melt for those fallen angels, depressing them even more.<p>
Question   : How about shorting small cap stocks? Is that part of your methodology?<p>
WorthSilk  : It is very difficult to borrow small cap stocks. If you can, you could be subject to a short squeeze if the stock runs up and delivery is demanded. You could lose your shirt, pants, and house. <p>
Question   : What would happen if there is a strong outflow from stock mutual funds?<p>
WorthSilk  : Since June 5 to July 17, a little more than 5 weeks, the NASDAQ composite index has fallen over 19 percent from top to trough.<p>
WorthSilk  : A bear market is considered to be a 20 percent or more drop from the high. The average cash reserves of the stock funds has fallen from a high of 9.2 percent in '92 to a 6.8 percent average in 1995. The absolute cash reserves are higher now because of the huge growth in stock mutual fund assets. When an aggressive growth fund has to redeem requests for withdrawals, the cash reserves may be inadequate to meet redemptions. At the same time, infusions of new net incoming money will stop. In order to meet redemptions, the fund has to liquidate more of their positions of the portfolio. This will prove to be a double whammy. The value of the fund's momentum stocks will be shrinking in value also.<p>
Question   : How do you create wealth in the stock market?<p>
WorthSilk  : The only way you can do it without starting with large funds is to compound your stock winners and avoid losers.<p>
At 50 percent after 5 parlays--$68,000
At 100 percent after 5 parlays--$320,000
At 200 percent after 5 parlays, it will turn into $2.4 million.<p>
Find value-oriented stocks selling for between $3 to $10 which are basically NASDAQ issues and which have become fallen angels. Eliminate from consideration those stocks which had serious revenue declines and/or very significant losses that would prevent a turnaround. Do due diligence in order to establish a buying entry point. If your entry point turned out to be too high, additional purchases at lower prices could be warranted. A sign of bottoming out could be indicated by huge volumes being traded with very little additional price erosion. This could be a classic case of accumulation. <p>
The best time to find these candidates is when there is a sharp market correction or while we are in a bear market environment. <p>
Question   : What are the danger signals at a top?<p>
Price to earnings ratio is high. The dividend yield is low--anything below a 2.8 yield is a warning. Rising interest rates caused by Fed tightening of credit. Unwinding of a speculative frenzy, especially when small investors jumped in with both feet. Sheer numbers of IPOs, while there are hints of a downturn in quality.<p>
It all signals that investors are being satiated with the abundance of IPOs when 50 percent of stocks fall below their 200 day moving average.<p>
Question   : What do you consider a low P/E ?<p>
WorthSilk  : I consider a low P/E to be under 10.<p>
Question    : Mr. Silk,  if P/E is the key indicator, how does one get the overall P/E of the market if there is such a thing?<p>
WorthSilk  : It's a toughie. Generally you can just look at the P/Es on the broad market. There is no one calculation that I know of.<p>
WorthSilk  : Reversal of cash inflows into stock mutual funds combined with cash levels at a very low percentage to total assets. Margin debt at very high levels. A top is near when volume behavior patterns such as: Volume continues strong but prices don't advance significantly; feverish trading in small stocks rising along with heavy volume; if volume lessens, it can be a problem--fewer buyers to help drive up prices; volume on down days are greater than volume on up days; much lower volume when stocks are making a new peak--a warning the demand for stock is weakening<p>
Question    : Is it wise to invest in the Japanese or foreign markets now?<p>
WorthSilk  : If you can read Japanese and understand their  accounting, maybe.<p>
Question     : What signs to look for that a correction is coming or a bear market is ending?<p>
WorthSilk  : Do your research and arithmetic. Look for good strong companies with strong balance sheets, an attractive P/E ratio, and significant market position for their products. Generally a bear market bottoms after a severe selloff on heavy volume. If investors are downbeat, it suggests that they have complete most of their selling and they won't inflict more damage. The bear market typically ends in the middle of a recession and when doom and gloom abounds. It is best to buy stocks when they are unpopular. The gutsiest investors, after a decline, play the small stocks for a rebound.<p>
Question     : What's your favorite sector right now?<p>
WorthSilk  : My favorite sector is beaten-down high-tech stocks with good cash positions.<p>
Question  : How can one get advice from you on a regular or irregular basis?<p>
WorthOnLne : You can send request for communication with Mr. Silk to me, WorthOnLne, and we'll forward it.<p>
WorthSilk  : I'm often asked about IPOs. As an individual investor, you generally can't obtain a portion of a new issue. Most of the offering stock is given to institutions which are predominantly pension or stock mutual funds. Investment bankers are trying to get the highest possible price for their corporate clients. Salespeople and traders at brokerage houses try to reward their institutional and large investors for past business. If it is truly a good deal, you won't get a piece of the action. If you are not a large customer of a brokerage house, and you are offered a piece of an IPO, it is probably that no one else wants it.<p>
Question  : Today AMAT traded mega shares and no change in price...is this what you call accumulation?<p>
WorthSilk  : If it is at its low price, it could be a sign of accumulation. But if it is it mid-point or high price, it could be distribution. <p>
Question  : Not to appear totally dumb, but distribution from whom to whom? Thanks<p>
WorthSilk  : You don't know who the buyers and sellers are.<p>
Question    : Do you feel financial consultants are helpful or is it better to invest on your own?<p>
WorthSilk  : You should really read as much as possible and get an awareness before you even consult with a financial advisor. You may end you knowing more than what he or she does!<p>
Question : What are the benefits of exploring the IPO after market?<p>
WorthSilk  : Since Jan. 1991 until the present, there have been about 3,000 IPOs. IPO stocks are not very liquid, and when the characteristics of the market changes, the exit door is going to be very crowded. A lot of the short term performance is psychology drive and hence it can lead to dramatic downside disasters. Sometimes it is best to wait a year or more before reexamining whether to buy or not to buy a once hot IPO. You must choose a fallen IPO very carefully. It may have stumbled for a very good reason. With careful research you may be able to find some whose decline is totally unjustified. You may find, with good analysis, an undiscovered gem.<p>
Question : Why do you put so much emphasis on the cash that a company has in the till?<p>
WorthSilk  : Cash is always king. Cash is never trash. Ample cash gives a company many options:<p>
1: They can repurchase outstanding by buying it on the open market or making deals with large holders
2: They can purchase technology or other assets that will complement or enhance their product lines.
3: They can receive an interest income stream 
4: They can buy another company--a danger enters here if it's in a non-related business.
5: They have no hard nose banker looking over their shoulder demanding repayments
6: They will never go bankrupt if they use their cash wisely.
7: The company may be an attractive acquisition candidate itself.<p>
It is important to measure the cash status each quarter. If the amount of cash is moving downward dramatically, and there is no reason forthcoming, ignore the stock from consideration, or if you own it, sell.<p>
Question   : Other than mutual funds, are stocks the answer to higher than 5.25 interest rates?<p>
WorthSilk  : This is a dangerous and volatile time. You had better be safe, not sorry. Keep your powder dry, and be ready to pick up good bargains in the stock market down the line when you will get better capital appreciation. Short-term bills or bonds are a safe haven now.<p>
WorthOnLne : This concludes this edition of "Conference Call,"  Worth OnLine's live weekly chat series. The Worth staff extends its appreciation to Charlie Silk for being our guest. Thank you all for the great questions!

					</center>
					<font size=4>
						Jim McCamant, one of the leading authorities on biotech stocks,  joined Worth OnLine's CONFERENCE CALL chat show on July 24 for the discussion "Boom or Bust for Biotechs?" McCamant's newsletter, "Medical Technology Stock Letter," which has been in publication since December of 1983, is a leading source of information about the biotech industry. <p>
McCamant will return to Worth OnLine's CONFERENCE CALL on October 23, 1996 at 8 pm EDT. <p>
What follows is a transcript of the evening's event, edited for clarity. The opinions expressed within are those of Jim McCamant and do not necessarily present the views of Worth or Worth OnLine.<p>
OnlineHost : Welcome to "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's new live chat show series. Every week we give readers the opportunity to chat with the leaders in money and markets. Check our site (Keyword: Worth) for a calendar of upcoming events. Our guest tonight is Jim McCamant, editor of "Medical Technology Stock Letter." Mr. McCamant is going to talk about trends and current events in the biotech industry. <p>
Question   : What do you think about Amgen and its future prospects?<p>
MTSL       : Amgen is a good company and the leader in the industry, but the product pipeline is not great. We think the stock will lead the advance, but the long term risk is more competition for their two approved drugs.<p>
Question   : Novartis released a statement on July 17th that the new company planned to use its influence as a shareholder of Chiron to support the granting of non-exclusive licenses under certain gene therapy patents of Viagene.  Is this perceived to be a conflict?<p>
MTSL       : No, not a conflict; Chiron is the leader in gene therapy. They will work well with Novartis which owns 49 percent.<p>
Question   : What is your opinion of Somatogen and its blood substitute product Optro?<p>
MTSL       : We are very optimistic about Somatogen.  We think Optro has the potential to be a billion dollar product. We are recommending purchase of SMTG.<p>
Question   : Why do you not like Amgen's pipeline which has a drug for hep C coming out next year as well as leptin in the future?<p>
MTSL       : Amgen's hep C product will compete in an already established market --  small potential.<p>
Question   : Who do you see as the "winners," if any, in the development of synthetic blood?<p>
MTSL       : Leptin is a long shot as no evidence that overweight people are short on leptin. We expect SMTG to be the big winner, but Baxter is likely to be on the market first. Baxter has a problem in limited supply as they use outdated human blood.<p>
Question   : Is Cortex in negotiations with a pharmaceutical partner?  If so, at what stage?<p>
MTSL       : Yes, we believe they are, but do not know stage. These deals can take a long time.<p>
Question   : How would you recommend a casual investor benefit from the potential that several biotech companies may make blockbuster returns? It seems like panning for gold.<p>
MTSL       : The easiest investments are those with a number of products in the pipeline and broad technology. In this group we like Agouron, Isis Pharmaceuticals, Ligand and Icos.<p>
Question   : What is the current status of Systemix, in your opinion. Is it holding its own or are there too many competitors with similar products?<p>
MTSL       : Yes, there are many competitors and it is too early to pick the winner.<p>
Question   : What is your outlook for the market in the next three to four weeks, in light of the recent fall in the Dow?<p>
MTSL       : They are in the process of being bought by Sandoz. We think the biotech stocks are forming a bottom in this area and expect a rally soon. The stocks are down an average of 25 percent with no bad news and many down 50 percent.<p>
Question   : What is the market potential for Prostacint, Cytogen's new prostate cancer imaging agent?<p>
MTSL       : Prostacint is the most promising product from Cytogen, but we hesitate to predict sales since they fell well below estimates on earlier product.<p>
Question   : Do you know anything about a pharmaceutical firm whose ticker is SCIO?<p>
MTSL       : Have followed Scios for many years formerly called California Biotech. The company has moved very slowly but they do have two interesting products in the clinic.<p>
Question   : What forum do we have to follow your buy/sell recommendations as you discover winners moving to the front of the pack?<p>
MTSL       : The MTSL letter is available to subscribers at $320 a year. We are happy to send samples and they are available online at http://streetnet.com<p>
Question   :  Do you have recommendations for biotech companies in the agricultural sector?<p>
MTSL       : Yes. We also follow ag/bio in second newsletter.  Our top recommendation is Calgene. We also like Mycogen and Biosys at current prices.<p>
Question   : Biotech stocks seem to go through three to four year cycles.  Where are we currently in the cycle?<p>
MTSL       : Our best guess is that in prices we are about halfway but further in time.<p>
Question   : Jim, what resources do you use to keep your predictions ahead of the public in predicting what will happen in the biotech industry?<p>
MTSL       : The best source is from companies talking about their competitors.  We also attend a lot of meetings. This is in addition to a lot of reading. Often investors ignore information that is available.<p>
Question   : Do you like UBS (US Bioscience)?  How do you feel about their recent split (2 for 1)?<p>
MTSL       : We are neutral on UBS, not clear view of revenues. The reverse split makes it easier for institutions to buy the stock. Management from Genentech and funded by Glaxo. They claim to have cure for common flu. Symbol BHTA.<p>
Question   : Which Biotech stock do you feel is selling at the greatest discount?<p>
MTSL       : There are a number of stocks that have gotten very cheap. Certainly one of the biggest bargains is Somatogen, with its big potential and great partner in Lilly.<p>
Question   : Do you see the Carticel product from Genzyme tissue repair being an economically viable product in the new managed care environment?<p>
MTSL       : Yes, but cost will reduce demand, acceptance is likely to be slow but some will pay.<p>
Question   : Gilead Science, long and short term targets. Also, opinion of Emisphere tech, with oral heparin delivery system?<p>
MTSL       : Gilead is one company we have reservations about. Big cash hoard insures survival, but not excited.<p>
Question   : Do you have a long term outlook for Immune Response?<p>
MTSL       : Oral delivery will eventually make some company money, but Emispheres is only one of many. We would avoid drug delivery companies for now except Alza. Immune Response has some interesting technology, but we are negative on the HIV vaccine and would avoid the stock.<p>
Question   : I've currently invested about 85 percent of my portfolio in Chiron, Celtrix and Somatogen based upon your newsletter.  Should I sleep well tonight?<p>
MTSL       : If you are a long term investor, no reason to worry.<p>
Question   : About Scios, their price has been steadily falling to $5 -- $6.  When do you recommend building a position?  What time frame do you give it? What is a good sell price to target?<p>
MTSL       : We have not recommended Scios, because of earlier disappointments, but stock is cheap here.<p>
Question   : What is your opinion of ISIP at this time?<p>
MTSL       : ISIP is one of our favorites.  Great management and a clear leader in antisense.  We think it will be big long term winner.<p>
Question   : I would like to know if you have heard of a Canadian company called Micrologix Biotech, involved in development of various peptides for restoring the effectiveness of antibiotics. Thank you.<p>
MTSL       : Micrologix seems interesting but not enough information yet to have an opinion as investment.<p>
Question   : How do you rank the companies in the liposome industry?<p>
MTSL       : We have not recommended any but think Nexstar is the most attractive stock. They seem to have best amphoceterin B product and more in pipeline.<p>
Question   : What is your time frame for the next major event to happen within Celtrix and Somatogen?<p>
MTSL       : Next event from Celtrix is likely to be partnership, but also a candidate for buy out. Something likely in next few months.
Somatogen will be results from current clinical trial and starting other.  Likely to get news in the fourth quarter.  Also a partner for other indications of optro about then.<p>
Question   : What is your feeling on Biogen?<p>
MTSL       : We are modestly negative about Biogen.  One of the least productive research efforts in the industry.<p>
Question   : Concerning Prostascint and Cytogen...Why would stock drop so precipitously on such GOOD news of approval?<p>
MTSL       : The drop in Cytogen mainly reflects the bad market. Investors are selling on news. This reflects the fear which has resulted from the drop in stock prices.<p>
Question   : When do you think the market will increase the value of companies like Agouron based on their recent HIV progress?<p>
MTSL       : AGPH stock has been held back by stock offering.  We expect it to bounce when it is done. The big excitement will come late this year or in first quarter when they file for marketing approval.<p>
Question   : What is your outlook for Ecogen Inc. (EECN)? Long and short-term?<p>
MTSL       : Ecogen should work out long-term but sales have grown more slowly than they expected. Ecogen may require some patience.<p>
Question   : What is your opinion of Imclone Systems, big recent correction, have you heard any news?<p>
MTSL       : Imclone's stock got ahead of itself.  An interesting company but we have not recommended.<p>
Question   : New issue Millenium has been forming many alliances do you see a bright future for them?<p>
MTSL       : Yes, but much of that is already in stock price.  The genome companies are too popular.<p>
Question   : When Chiron's CEO purchased 100,000 shares of his company on the open market, what, in your opinion was he preparing for?<p>
MTSL       : He believes strongly in future for Chiron and had money available as a result of Ciba's purchase last year.  We share his enthusiasm and it is our clear favorite among large biotech stocks.<p>
Question   : Do you know anything at all about current realities vis-a-vis 'forest biotechnology stocks'?<p>
MTSL       : We know of no companies doing much in that small sector.<p>
Question   : I'm interested in Macrochem, a company with a topical delivery system called SEPA.  Ibuprofen and Prostaglandin are now in Phase I/II tests for topical application.  Do you have an opinion about the company and do you think it's a good investment? Thank you.<p>
MTSL       : Macrochem is interesting, but not convinced they can make it all work.  No opinion for now.<p>
Question   : I own the Fidelity bio tech fund. Is this the way to play this market?<p>
MTSL       : We are not fans of Fidelity biotech fund, but not a lot of mutual fund choices.<p>
Question   : Good evening, I would appreciate you opinion on Enzo Biochem?<p>
MTSL       : We think Enzo writes great press release, but not impressed with the technology or the management.<p>
Comment    : What is up with Biosys?  The stock price has really declined in the past few months.<p>
MTSL       : The biggest problem is no sponsorship.  We think they will make their consolidation strategy work. The stock price will eventually follow if they keep running the business well.<p>
Question   : It seems that over the past year Ligand stock has been heavily shorted.  Why?<p>
MTSL       : Most of shorts are hedger who own ALRTZ and have warrants on Ligand, but some active shorts more recently as the stock ran up.  Good company, but complicated for investors to understand.<p>
Question   : Will FDA permit a filing by Immunogen based on their Phase II results?<p>
MTSL       : No final answer yet, but our guess is that they will. Likely to be for lymphoma associated with AIDS.  A filing next year either way.<p>
Question   : If you could pick one biotech stock that has the best bet of being an absolute out-of-the-park home run over the next decade, what would it be?<p>
MTSL       : Isis is our first choice, but there are a number of others that should make you lots of money.<p>
Question   : Who else (other than US), is researching genetically engineered PolyClonal Antibodies that can reproduce in the Human Blood Stream?<p>
MTSL       : We know of no one active doing this.<p>
Question   : Given that there are still many months left in 1996, how do you see the Biotech sector doing by year end?<p>
MTSL       : We expect a good rally from these levels, but after that, much will depend on the broad market. With the continuing progress and more good news coming the sector should have a great year.<p>

						<font size=4><b><i>MEET A STOCK-MARKET SWAMI</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						On Wednesday, July 17, 1996, James Dines joined Worth OnLine for a live chat. Dines, a stock-market prognosticator and editor of The Dines Letter, discussed market timing, mass psychology, and investing in precious metals. A transcript from the CONFERENCE CALL: MEET A STOCK-MARKET SWAMI follows, edited for clarity. The opinions expressed are those of James Dines and do not necessarily represent the views of Worth magazine or Worth OnLine.<p>
DinesLtr:	"Virgin bulls" who have never seen a bear market have lost their innocence, and the first tremors of Mass Fear are foretelling the OTC illliquidity; the next Downwave begins. Market drastically oversold, so probable Technical Rally will be last chance to get out. Challenge has shifted from capital gains to capital preseveration. Hold buying power for the next opportunity. Interest rates irrelevant to market, which is a function of dollar/yen ratio, not easy to envision, but yesterday's rally began when the yen rose against the dollar; 1995 bull market was because dollar crashed, and when dollar recovered market began to run out of gas. Few understand this relationship. <p>
Worldwide Web foretells what we label "The Coming Death of the Middleman," in which entire industries will be replaced (from telephone to TV Guide). Pre-Paid Legal Plan, one of the few stocks we would buy here because it is the xx bullions. Golds are a hedge against a currency crisis (see crash in Mexican peso last year and crash of dollar against Japanese yen, followed by crash of yen afterwards). XAU average deceptive because heavily weighted by Barrick and Placer Dome, which were sold to help investors meet margin calls elsewhere. Conservative investors should buy Barrick, Placer and Stillwater Mining. For speculative accounts, we recommend Agnico-Eagle Mines (AEM), Gold Canyon Resources (GCU.V), Penoles (world's largest producer of refined silver, and virtually unknown). <p>
My new book "Mass Psychology" my third and final business book, has already been called a classic, as have the first two books. High-tech mania idolized Fools and Beardstown Ladies, will be looked back on in wonderment. Book describes "profit inversion," wherein investors have changed their goal from profit-seeking to "getting out even." All gamblers secretly want to lose, which is why they keep gambling until they do lose, and "Mass Fear knows no price" so people will sell out at the lows "just for the money."   We are now open for questions.<p>
Question:	Gold doesn't seem to be a hedge against anything anymore. Is it simply a commodity for the jewelry business?<p>
DinesLtr:	We are not bullish on gold which has been flat for many years. We are bullish on gold shares which are higher than any other group so far this year.<p>
Question:	What are your thoughts on technology mutual funds between now and year-end, and then into 1997?<p>
DinesLtr:	We are negative on all mutual funds because of illiquidity during selling panics, especially in hyperinflated technology groups.<p>
Question:	With inflation relatively "in check," does it surprise you that gold is not the place to be?<p>
DinesLtr:	Precious metals bullions have been flat for years, but gold mining shares have soared.<p>
Question:	Jim where do you think gold will be priced at by year's end?<p>
DinesLtr:	They are discounting a subsequent rise in gold when central bankers will finally stop suppressing it.<p>
Question:	I have heard a rumor that gold is on the rise due to Middle East problems and the U.S. economy. Is there truth to this?<p>
DinesLtr:	Gold will probably still be around the $400 area. Gold is flat.<p>
Question:	Recs on gold stocks, please?<p>
DinesLtr:	Opening statement recommended blue-chips Placer Dome, Barrick, Stillwater Mining. For speculatives we recommend Agnico-Eagle, Gold Canyon Resources & Penoles.<p>
Question:	Are interest rates going to drop or raise?<p>
DinesLtr:	We have been looking for rising interest rates for some time, and see no change yet.<p>
Question:	I am 28...married and starting to plan for retirement.  This year I will start to put away at least 10k/year.  This may be too general but if funds are 'negative' where do you think it should go?<p>
DinesLtr:	This is a dangerous time in the market and would remain in cash for the moment, except perhaps for an investment in Pre-Paid Legal here around 13.<p>
Question:	Jim, it would appear that even with all of the gold mining shares that are available to the public, the capitalization of such could not take even a small fraction of the capital available to the market when the real rush into mining shares begin.<p>
DinesLtr:	Correct. All the gold mining shares in the world come out to around $80 billion, and if all 8,000 mutual funds decided to put a small percentage into precious metals shares, every share would be swallowed up immediately and group would go ballistic. We believe we are in the early stages of discounting that.<p>
Question:	With the recent decline in stock values, what sector type stocks do you suggest for protecting value or rebounding back to former share values?<p>
DinesLtr:	Playing Technical Rallies in a new bear market is extremely dangerous and not for beginners. If you still hold stocks, protect them with stops and try to liquidate on strength. Market extraordinarily oversold, so powerful rally might begin, and if you wish to play it, the smart way would be with index call options to limit your risk.<p>
Question:	Do you think Mirage Resorts is a sound investment?<p>
DinesLtr:	If Mirage Resorts gets down to 22, we would liquidate it but at over 20 times next year's estimated earnings of $1.15, it is no bargain basis price/earnings ratio. Plus it's in the gambling group, and gambling and gambling stocks at this time doubles your risk. Hasn't recent market plunge slowed you down?<p>
Question:	You have talked about gold quite a bit, but what about silver?<p>
DinesLtr:	Silver is one of the most underpriced commodities in the world, now selling for below the cost of production of $8. In 1960 I baptized it "the poor man's gold" because it tends to sell at a ratio to gold -- so rising gold prices will drag silver higher. I also like platinum and palladium. Platinum made its bear market low way back in 1985, and a recent Dines Letter showed a decade-long saucer bottom formation.<p>
Question:	Forgive my ignorance (I am a beginner)...but what is a Pre-Paid Legal?  Or can you direct me to the answer?<p>
DinesLtr:	Pre-Paid Legal Services, symbol PPD on the ASE, is the first publicly traded company selling legal insurance. For only $15 a month you get unlimited telephone access to a law firm, a free will prepared or updated, and 65 hours of lawyer's time. They accept preexisting conditions and you can drop out at any time. It looks like an insane bargain to us, and earnings are unsurprisingly soaring. They earned 55 cents in 1996, and should earn around $1 next year, so the P/E Ratio is only around 13. It is the birth of a new industry and will grow like wildfire.<p>
Question:	I'm a lawyer and it is impossible to provide legal services at those rates.  If you ask me the company is ultimatly headed for bankruptcy or lawyers will be working for minimum wage.<p>
DinesLtr:	Yes! (Just kidding.) If you want to see their brochure, call our 800 number (800) 550-1000 and we will send it to you. We would be very interested in your opinion after you peruse it. Incidentally, that's what doctors once said about managed health care and health maintenance organizations, and their incomes have indeed declined. Welcome to the new world of competition.<p>
Question:	Do you feel that the stock market correction  ended yesterday?<p>
DinesLtr:	Yes, temporarily only. This bull market is in deep trouble because the high-tech crash has changed Mass Psychology from profit-seeking to "getting out even. "  And overhead supply will inhibit rallies. After the next rally -- unless we get into new all-time high ground -- we are looking for seriously lower prices.<p>
Question:	With small-cap stocks performing so well in recent years,why do you think it necessary for one to settle for the lower returns of the metals?<p>
DinesLtr:     Check your small-cap stocks, as many of them have crashed. There are times in the stock market to switch from seeking higher returns to capital preservation. Whippets running the mutual funds have never seen a serious bear market and it will be a religious experience. Buying depressed golds, with minimum downside risk, could yield the kind of explosive returns we saw in the late 1970s when many of them went up 20 times or more . This generation has no concept of Mass Fear driving investors to the safe haven of gold, making them "glamor stocks."<p>
Question:	Your comments on the direction of China in the next five years.  How soon before we can buy shares of Chinese private companies, or is this a possibility?<p>
DinesLtr:	The Dines Letter was the first newsletter to turn bullish on China in 1979, and remained bullish until 1992 when we turned bearish, and still are. China is running the printing press and cannot figure out why they have ruinous inflation, and have had many such inflations in the past -- such as the 1949 inflation that ushered
in communism. They desperately need a gold standard, but there is no voice to tell them that. When Chinese stocks begin to make new Upside Breakouts, we will consider going back in.<p>
Question:	What is your outlook for the gold and silver mining index (XAU)? Short-term and long.<p>
DinesLtr:	XAU is an inferior representative of the precious metals shares because it overweights a few blue-chips such as Barrick and Placer. We use the Dines Gold Stock Average with 17 golds -- equally weighted -- and we actually have history back to 1960 BC (before computers). If you saw our long-term chart of it in The Dines
Letter, you would see that the long-term trend is still up.<p>
Question:	What is your view on precious metals, with special reference to Silver's recent collapse.  Are lows in?<p>
DinesLtr:	Your use of the word "collapse" demonstrates lack of perspective, as prices have been around these levels for a long time. I strongly recommend that you study our long-term charts in precious metals. In fact, we turned bullish on silver at $3.65, at which time we gave the only unconditional guarantee in our 36 year history when we guaranteed that silver was "within $4 of its absolute bottom." We are now in the base-building phase of silver's next bull market, which is always slow and designed to keep the public out until they can be let in at the top.<p>
Question:	What companies do you see as strong in the near future in the chemicals industry?<p>
DinesLtr:	My favorite is Monsanto Chemical because they're the only ones bright enough to have moved heavily into the ag-biotech area, which has more promise than the Internet. One of the many prophecies in my "Mass Psychology" book is that all diseases will be eliminated from the earth within 20 years because computers will
precisely design drugs engineered to block computerized representations of bugs. Monsanto has held up fairly well here, but we would leave a stop in at 26. Even still, in a general bear market, with estimated earnings of $1.75 next year, it is not cheap, although it has positive Relative/Strength. Personally, you would be better off holding cash and awaiting a possible buy at lower prices.<p>
Question:	When you say "we are in the early stages of discounting that" - do you just mean the prices are relatively low, for now?<p>
DinesLtr:	Stocks are barometric rather than thermometric, and discount the future. All stocks act based on the Mass Psychology of the people who tend to buy them, which is why bonds move sedately like the conservative people who buy them. Stocks and commodities move on entirely different cycles, discussed in the "Anomaly" section of my book. Commodities players are neutral on the metals, but stock buyers are anticipating bullions' upside upside breakouts later, which is according to our plan. We are still in a very early stage of the precious-metals' bull market based on our Major buy signal of 9 Nov 92, and we already have very substantial profits built up.<p>
Question:	What do you think of gold futures options, and which if any would you buy here?<p>
DinesLtr:	We are neutral on the bullions and bullish on the stocks. We are against buying options on the bullions until there is a sustained Uptrend in place. You are too early. However buying "leaps" on gold stocks (calls) would be a very sophisticated speculation.<p>
Question:	What are the indications that we are now in a bear market.  When did it start; and how deep and how long do you think it will last?   Is Greenspan engineering this volitility?<p>
DinesLtr:	Bear market in high-techs began in July 1995 in semiconductor group, and was gradually joined by more groups in early 1996. Early June saw the bear show its fangs openly for anyone to see, and weakness is spreading in classic bear-market fashion. Last to fall will be DJI blue-chips, which is why OTC has gone down so much more than the DJI. Worse, huge number of inexperienced investors numbed to fear by dogma of "holding for the long-term," have yet to panic, which they will at the lows because all gamblers secretly desire to lose. When the stampede to get out of mutual funds forces redemptions, or when the whippets running mutual funds with too-little cash reserves finally panic and sell, who will buy? That is why recent Dines Letters have warned that the
next bear market will be so steep and deep that investors will arrive at the bottom slightly younger. Fedhead Greenspan should be replaced by allowing interest rates to fluctuate in the free market and It is an outrage that the government pretends to know how to "fine tune" the economy better than capitalists. In any event, if there is a crash, they will pin it on Greenspan concocting a reason that he "created uncertainty."<p>
Question:	Jim, I've been involved with the National Committee for Monetary Reform since 1971.  Jim Blanchard hosted many of the the national conferences at that time. Are you at all active in this area?<p>
DinesLtr:	I'm the founder of the Hard Money Movement, in 1960, and my second book "The Invisible Crash" is called "the bible of the goldbugs." Had we been on a gold standard since 1960 as we had recommended, government deficits would have been impossible and we would still be the richest nation in the world instead of its largest debtor. I welcomed Jim Blanchard into the business in the 1960s and have been strongly supportive ever since.<p>
Question:	Is Homestake Mining a good gold share choice?<p>
DinesLtr:	Homestake and Newmont are good for those who want gold-mining companies that do not hedge their gold production by selling the forward futures markets. Management is finally getting more aggressive in searching for new ore bodies, and we would try to do new buying in the low teens.<p>
Question:	Business Week suggested that Natural Resources are going to be strong going into next year. How do you feel about this sector?<p>
DinesLtr:	Natural Resources: Bullish. Oil stocks are one of the few strong areas left in the market along with papers. Again, however, if the DJI goes below yesterday's lows, for a Confirmatory Downside Breakout, all bets are off and we would then expect only the precious metals to assume market leadership for the first time in
two decades for a new generation of investors.<p>
Question:	If you had an extra $20,000 to put into the market at present where would you put it and why?<p>
DinesLtr:	I would put a small amount of it into Pre-Paid Legal (PPD), some of the previously mentioned gold-mining shares, and hold some cash for possibly better buying opportunities ahead in industrials.<p>
Question:	I have recently purchased PanAmerican Silver (PAASF).  It appears that its chart characteristics are interesting.  Do you have a comment?<p>
DinesLtr:	PanAmerican Silver, along with Silver Standard, have stolen a march on the whole mining industry by aggressively acquiring silver properties that will not be profitable until silver rises to profitable levels. What you are buying with PanAmerican is "wealth in the ground," and there is a place for it for patient investors. After having risen from 4 to 11 last year, PanAmerican is stabilizing at around 7, which will probably hold and is a good buying area.<p>
Question:	Which gold stock under 5 dollars has the greatest potential?<p>
DinesLtr:	Gold Canyon (GCU) at around $4 (US).<p>
Question:	I've encountered numerous stock brokers soliciting my business. Many are between 29 and 36 years of age.  They tell me that Bear markets are unlikely to ever occur again. Indeed they say they've always made money for their customers? Rude Awakenings?<p>
DinesLtr:	That opinion has always been said at market Tops, such as the famous prediction by Professor Fisher in 1929 that stocks had reached a permanent high plateau. Cycles are normal. As part of your stock-market education make a point of reading the great classic book "Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds" written in 1865, and also my third and final book "Mass Psychology." I didn't write them both. The first one was written by Mackay and should be in your local library, but is well worth owning.<p>
Question:	Royal Oak Mining has had its share of trouble this past year. Will management regain a firm hand on the reins and redirect this company towards what might be some solid potential?<p>
DinesLtr:	Royal Oak is not one of my favorite low-priced speculatives, but when gold prices move up significantly, it will share in the uptrend. I think you could do better elsewhere.<p>
Question:	If we've been in it for the long term should we stay with our mutual funds?<p>
DinesLtr:	Mutual funds: Absolutely not. In a selling panic there will be no way for everyone to get out at the same time because they simply do not own enough cash for that, and frightened banks only lend umbrellas when the sun is shining. If you want to own stocks for the long term, stop being lazy and buy stocks yourself that you own, collect your own dividends on, and pay no annual fees. The only time we recommend mutual funds is for overseas markets, such as in India where buying local stocks is beyond most of us. You can buy a stock like Kodak and General Motors and hold it for the rest of your life.<p>
Question:	What is your reaction to buying futures options on gold here, say the Oct 410's?<p>
DinesLtr:	Futures are only for very sophisticated short-term traders, and since we are neutral on gold bullion, we are not overly excited by buying them. Have you thought of call options, which at least limit your risk?<p>
Question:	Do you know of a good book with formulas that use volatility as a asset?<p>
DinesLtr:	Try your library, but there is an excellent Technical magazine called "Stocks & Commodities" and also try the earth's largest bookstore (which incidentally carries our book on "Mass Psychology" (amazon.com)<p>
Question:	Jim, I recently purchased a little company called Greenstone Resources at $2.50 and currently trading at @ $11.00 US Do you know of it and what do you think about it?<p>
DinesLtr:	Greenstone Resources has three operating mines (Colombia, Nicaragua & Panama) along with properties in Costa Rica and Honduras. You've made a magnificent profit! Why not sell a small part of it, enough to get your original investment out, and "scale out" on further strength? Has outstanding Relative Strength. Suggest you phone the company (416) 862-7300.<p>
Question:	Mr. Dines, how do you think the market will perform till the end of the year?<p>
DinesLtr:	Near-term rally, followed by lower prices, possibly seriously so. Golds should outperform on upside.<p>
Question:	Jim, you were once bullish on bags of silver coins.  What is your position today?  Is there too much premium above the melt content?<p>
DinesLtr:	We were bullish on silver coins when the silver content was worth more than the face value. Coins will move with the silver market, and we are more enthusiastic on the silver shares than the silver bullion. You can keep some gold and silver coins in your safety deposit box "just in case," but most investors should be in shares
because you can get dividends while you're waiting for the bull market to resume. Large investors should always keep their money in more than one country, one of which should always be the US, because "exchange controls" will be a feature of a currency crisis,
and few even comprehend what exchange controls are. Or that it is possible for a free country to impose them. The first one was imposed when Americans could not transfer more than $10,000 in cash without informing the government. The second one was a discussion about a special tax on rich people who were cancelling their US citizenship to evade taxes, similar to what the Nazis did in the 1930s, but that proposal has so far been defeated. It will recur.<p>
Question:	Jim-Why would gold stocks go up if price of gold stays flat?<p>
DinesLtr:	Your question has already been answered. Psychology of stocks buyers different from commodity buyers. Stock buyers anticipate a rise in the price of gold bullion, which has been postponed by suppressive gold sales of central bankers who know that people watch gold prices as a measure of inflation. By suppressing gold prices, governments conceal inflation, like sticking a fevered patient into ice water instead of curing him. US government gold at Ft Knox is priced at the ludicrious level of $42.50 but will not sell any at that price. Truly, denial can be more than merely a river in Egypt.<p>
Question:	Mr. Dines, I believe that there is a generation of stock buyers who have done well chasing hot stocks.  I get the feeling that we had all better start looking at the unloved and unliked sectors of the hard asset and resource play.<p>
DinesLtr:	Smart comment. The Dines Letter agrees. Thank you for your questions. If the answers made sense to you, follow our work with a one-year "Fair Trial" subscription to The Dines Letter by calling 800 84-LUCKY. Last question:<p>
Question:	Mr. Dines, I'm a beginner in this great adventure of buying and selling stocks.  How would you recommend a beginner such as me to learn how to recognize a good investment?<p>
DinesLtr:	The Dines Letter specializes in beginners, welcome aboard!  Good night.<p>

					<font size=4>
						On July 10, Don Phillips, president of Morningstar Inc., joined Worth OnLine for "Conference Call." Phillips joined Morningstar in 1986 as the company's first analyst. In the February 1995 issue of Worth, he was named one of the world's 50 most influential market movers. What follows is a transcript of the event, edited for clarity. The opinions expressed here are those of Don Phillips and do not reflect the opinions of Worth OnLine.<p>
OnlineHost : Welcome to "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's new live chat show series. Every week we give readers the opportunity to chat with the leaders in money and markets. Check our site (Keyword: Worth) for a calendar of upcoming events. Our guest tonight is Don Phillips,  Tonight, Phillips will talk about mutual fund trends and performance records.<p>
Question   : What do you think of the Voyager Agressive Growth mutual funds family ?<p>
DonPMstar  : Hard call for the long term. Voyager has looked good in a very favorable market, but so too have a lot of funds.<p>
Question   : What are growth prospects for Health Science Funds? (TRP)<p>
DonPMstar  : The managers we talk with still love the demographics. Invesco runs a closed-end health fund trading a steep discount that's worth looking at.<p>
Question   : Please give details on how you plan to handle the new one-year stars.<p>
DonPMstar  : We plan on having the NASD realize they shouldn't ask us to calculate one-year star ratings.<p>
Question   : Why doesn't Morningstar rate Variable Annuities?<p>
DonPMstar  : We do rate VAs. Ask your library to subscribe to our service.<p>
Question   : How certain is the performance of an index fund will behave like the actual index?<p>
DonPMstar  : Indexing isn't rocket science. The funds from bigger complexes are fairly likely to look like the index minus the expense ratio.<p>
Question    : Hi I'm Bill Bales of Quote.Com,Inc.--are there funds that invest solely in internet stocks? Great job with Mstar--do you plan on going public?<p>
DonPMstar  : There are a few new funds planning on focusing just on the internet. I'm not so sure about the investment savvy of these outfits, but they are eager. I'd consider a more diversified tech play -- preferrably a closed-end tech fund at a discount like New Age Media.<p>
Question   : Hi Don -- Which fund family do you see as having the best track record in a growth-oriented fund for the long haul?<p>
DonPMstar  : A great choice would be Vanguard US Growth. Low expenses, big growth names, good mangement.<p>
Question   : What are your thoughts on the format of the recent PBHG Limited offering, especially the lack of information provided to shareholders in fund marketplaces?<p>
DonPMstar  : People were understandably upset. I don't think the fund industry has handled openings or closings of popular funds well. In PBHG's defense, the demand was unprecedented.<p>
Question   : What are your thoughts on the Boomers' effect on long term market growth?<p>
DonPMstar  : The demographics will clearly put upward pressure on the market. As boomers impose their preference for fund investing on the next generation through 401k plans, that will add more fuel to the fire. It doesn't mean we won't have big bear markets anymore, however.<p>
Question   : What are the 5 hottest mutual funds for the near term?<p>
DonPMstar  : If you mean in sales, look at Van Waggoner. A trend in motion stays in motion. It's the speculative stuff leading the pack. That's a very real cause for concern.<p>
Question   : Do you have a Web site or is one planned soon?<p>
DonPMstar  : For now, we're on AOL and Galt, and a few other sites.<p>
Question   : How does MStar keep track of new funds that are introduced?<p>
DonPMstar  : The funds send tons of advance notice lobbying to get included in our databases.<p>
Question   : How does Morningstar Principia (OnDisc) plan on competing with Value Line's Fund Analyzer on a price basis?  Will it be easy to sell a product that is slated to be 3 times more expensive?<p>
DonPMstar  : Principia does a lot more than their product. Look at our new Ascent product. It's more directly comparable and costs much less.<p>
Question   : What do you think the future is on Fidelity Magellan considering its bond assets and new manager?<p>
DonPMstar  : It'll be a more conventional stock fund. I think it has an outstanding chance of being in the top third of stock funds for the next decade, but little chance of being in the top 10 percent.<p>
Question   : When should I sell a fund ?<p>
DonPMstar  : When your needs or its core features change.<p>
Question   : You have mentioned 2 closed funds.  Do you like this kind?<p>
DonPMstar  : I love closed-end funds. Neglect implies opportunity. Interestingly, when I visit with fund managers I often see them using our closed-end publication for their own investing.<p>
Question   : Do you feel Garret Von Waggoner can keep up with all the new money being thrown his way?<p>
DonPMstar  : I think Garret will get sidetracked at some point by the asset growth. I also think he'll lose a lot of money in a bear market. I'd still like his fund in my portfolio.<p>
Question   : Where will growth be next year?  Large, small, mid cap?<p>
DonPMstar  : Small is still so hot, it may continue. As a contrarian, however, I favor yield oriented investments now. Have you seen some of the discounts on closed-end government bond funds? You can get a dollar's worth of yield for 90 cents. We spent so much of the '80s telling people not to look just at yield. Now we're telling them to remember it!<p>
Question   : How should a fund be closed?<p>
DonPMstar  : Close a fund quickly and neatly, but leave it open to current holders. PBHG in retrospect, should have held a lottery among current shareholders, perhaps.<p>
Question   : What do you think about the proposed SEC graphic disclosure rules in the Journal today -- seems like companies would be publishing information that would be a lot like what you publish.<p>
DonPMstar  :  More information is good. The problem is if there is one set of rules, rather than a free market system with lots of different systems, funds will jigger their procedures to fit the rules, which may not be in shareholder's best long-term interest.<p>
Question   : Suggestions on good reading material for a beginning investor interested in high risk?<p>
DonPMstar  : Phil Fisher's Common Stocks, Uncommon Profits. Also read Lowenstein's book on Buffett -- it's great.<p>
Question   : Tell 2 Best Aggressive mutual funds for one year investment.<p>
DonPMstar  : There is no such thing as a one-year investment. There are only one-year bets.<p>
Question   : What is your definition of the Sharpe ratio and how much emphasis do you place on it?<p>
DonPMstar  : The Sharpe ratio, like our stars, is a backward looking risk-reward ratio. It's a good starting place for fund analysis. Just don't stop there. Ask if the people, practices, and market conditions are similar enough that you can project past performance forward with any confidence.<p>
Question   : Why did you drop your monthly publication on the Morningstar 500?<p>
DonPMstar  : We still publish Morningstar Investor each month. The 500 was and is an annual complement to that newsletter.<p>
Question   : Why would someone buy into a bond fund now with the potential of interest rate increase on the horizon and therefore risk of principal? <p>
DonPMstar  : Is there ever a time with no risk of interest rate rises? Making a puchase decision based on one's view of macroeconomics can be hazardous to your wealth.<p>
Question   : Do you think 20th Century Ultra will continue to do well?<p>
DonPMstar  :  Ultra is a different fund than it was in the '80s. It now owns much larger stocks. It's still a fine fund, but it won't be as explosive--on either the upside or downside--as it was in '88 or '84.<p>
Question   : Do you find that a lot of funds within a fund family are redundant?  They seem to start a new fund just to attract more money.<p>
DonPMstar  : It'a a profit game!!! Yes... I think five shadings of the same style can be redundant.<p>
Question   : What is the ideal size for an aggressive growth fund before performance is affected?<p>
DonPMstar  : Depends on how the fund is aggressive. If it means buying small stocks, $500 million seems a viable cap for many fund managers. If it's trading big stocks quickly, you can probably go higher. It's also a function of the research staff.<p>
Question   : How can share holders let their "voice" be heard in regard to high expense ratios, procedures, etc??<p>
DonPMstar  : We as shareholders need to vote with our dollars. Expenses have risen because we haven't penalized high cost funds enough. I'd suggest not buying any fund with more than a certain expense ratio. For me the cap is 1.50% and going lower. There are plenty of fine funds left.<p>
Question   : How can I check on a fund manager's background, or history?<p>
DonPMstar  : We publish bios on managers in our reviews. You can also get some info in a prospectus or in public interviews.<p>
Question   : What do you think will happen to Mike Price's funds following the sale?  If Price leaves in a few years, which other fund managers would you say most closely mirror his style?<p>
DonPMstar  : Price learned from Heine, so the style can be taught. The question is how big will the funds get with Franklin's marketing muscle behind them. They've already lost some of the turnaround flavor as they've grown. I'd suspect they'll be very good, but more conventional value funds in the future.<p>
Question   : What do you think of Schwab funds in general?<p>
DonPMstar  : Schwab funds are basically commodity funds--indexes and straight forward bond funds. Thay are competently managed.<p>
Question   : What's the outlook for technology funds?<p>
DonPMstar  : The tech managers--who have to be in tech--still put on a good face. Diversified fund managers who can go anywhere--are paring back their tech exposure.<p>
Question   : What do you think is the best worldwide or foreign fund to purchase now?<p>
DonPMstar  : Tweedy Browne Global Value.<p>
Question   : How much money do you think you need to have for individual stocks to be a benifit over a fund?  Many funds have charges that can amount to over 25% in a 5 year period -- not to mention the commissions they have to pay on 50 --100% portfolio turnover?<p>
DonPMstar  : The commission a fund pays works out to far less than you'd pay. A typical stock fund incurs about 30 basis points a year in commissions. Thus, part of the answer comes down to how often you trade.<p>
Question   : Thoughts on selling a fund when the manager leaves, ie: Fidelity Growth's Bob Stansky being replaced by L. Greenberg??<p>
DonPMstar  : I'd definitely encourage you to hold stocks as well as funds. Greenberg, fortunately, is a known commodity. He's done great at Emerging Growth. I see no reason to sell at this point.<p>
Question   : Is this a good time to be looking at global funds?<p>
DonPMstar  : Yes. You've probably seen your domestic exposure swell with the recent run-up. I'd be looking abroad now to diversify.<p>
Question   : Bottom line - where can you put 5 to 10 thousand and double your money in 5 years ???<p>
DonPMstar  : Las Vegas.<p>
Question   : Don do you feel that people should be relying on the Morningstar ratings to purchase a mutual fund only?<p>
DonPMstar  : Of course not. The ratings are a computer screen. They have utility, but they aren't gospel. They also aren't the devil as our competitors will tell you<p>
Question   : Does your star rating indicate past performance or future?<p>
DonPMstar  : The ratings are a grade on past performance.<p>
Question   : Are there any funds that focus exclusively on so-called "penny stocks"?  If so, how have they performed generally?<p>
DonPMstar  : There was one. It was a dog.<p>
Question   : What are some of new products that M* is planning to offer?<p>
DonPMstar  : We're expanding our Principia line. We have a great new module called advanced analytics that lets you see how a fund's investment style has changed over time.<p>
Question   : Which funds are the future 5 stars?<p>
DonPMstar  : I'd look for smaller funds run by proven managers. Janus has a slew of them, as does T.Rowe Price and Fidelity.<p>
Question   : Do you think that this is the end of the bull market?<p>
DonPMstar  : There certainly are signs that the bull market is long in the tooth. My favorite was a manager who called me recently livid over the fact that our analyst pointed out that a P/E ratio of 50 on his fund might mean high risk going forward! <p>
Question   : How does the load charge of a fund affect your ratings? <p>
DonPMstar  : We deduct the maximun sales charge from our ratings.<p>
Question   : What percentage of funds actually beat the market averages?<p>
DonPMstar  : It depends on if the market is rising or falling and              if small or large stocks are leading.<p>
Question   : Any new funds "on the horizion" worth considering?<p>
DonPMstar  : Funds tend to better the market when small or international do better than large domestic stocks. There's such a cottage industry around hot new funds. I'd spend my time looking for underappreciated older ones. Some are closed-end funds. Others are value funds left behind the sizzling growth funds of late.<p>
Question   : Will MStar manage money by investing in their 5 star fund portfolios?<p>
DonPMstar  : I don't think you can be an objective observer of the money management industry if you are also a participant in it.<p>
Question   : Don , how do you feel about people who chase after the 5 star fund constantly moving several times a year?  Please comment.<p>
DonPMstar  : It's a dumb thing to do. Some people will always look for shortcuts. They bring up the rear.<p>
Question   : What is the typical backgroud of the folks that write the brief commentaries in your reports?<p>
DonPMstar  : Our analysts are generally history or literature majors with advanced degrees from top schools. They are proven analytical thinkers. Some however are lawyers and MBAs. We hire the person, not the degree.<p>
Question   : Do you think the average 401k/IRA investor really understands the funds they have chosen?<p>
DonPMstar  : No. But at least they are investing which gives them the chance to learn.<p>
Question   : What is your opinion of a fund lead by a "team" approach, where several portfolio managers specialize in sectors, versus one central fund manager in the top position?<p>
DonPMstar  :I prefer a sigle manager, but there are some great organizations, most notably the American Funds Group, that work successfully in a team structure. There is no one right way to run money.<p>
Question   : With the large amounts of money moving into mutual funds many of the best performing...ie aggressive funds, may very well close so as not to have any positions so large as to effect a stocks price, do you see the number of funds continuing to expand?<p>
DonPMstar  : We will have more funds. I'd take the sign of many people chasing these small, aggressive funds as a sign of excess and not chase them. <p>
WorthOnLne : Mr. Phillips, many of our readers want to know: Which are five star funds of tomorrow?<p>
DonPMstar  : Don't focus on guessing tomorrow's hot funds. Investing is a means to an end, not an end in itself. Focus on meeting your goals, and you'll have a five-star portfolio.<p>
OnlineHost : That Concludes this edition of "Conference Call,"  Worth OnLine's live weekly chat series. Thank you for joining Worth OnLine and Don Phillips for this evening's chat. The Worth staff extends its appreciation to Don Phillips for being our guest this evening.

						On June 26, Greg Dorsey joined Worth OnLine for "Conference Call." Dorsey, editor of the Web-based service DollarWise Investing, specializes in underfollowed, undervalued stocks that sell for less than $25 a share. The seven stocks Dorsey recommended buying and selling during DollarWise's first few months rose an average of 42.8 percent, with an average holding period of less than two months. Prior to DollarWise, Greg worked with several financial newsletters that focused on low-priced small stocks and mutual funds. <p>
What follows is a transcript of the event, edited for clarity. The opinions expressed here are those of Greg Dorsey and do not reflect the opinions of Worth OnLine.<p>
WorthEdit3 :  Welcome to Worth OnLine's chat series, "Conference Call." Tonight's guest is Greg Dorsey, editor of the Web-based service DollarWise Investing. During tonight's "Conference Call" Dorsey will talk about the current outlook for small stocks and how to analyze them. Again, welcome to Worth OnLine's "Conference Call" series. I'd like to invite Greg to begin to answer questions now. Enjoy the chat.<p>
Lewis1000  : What a day in the markets! Is this the beginning of the end? Might as well cut right to the heart of it.<p>
GREGDORSEY : Hardly Lewis. Just a much needed correction which should end soon.<p>
Lewis1000  : So you're a bull. Okay. Now we know.<p>
GREGDORSEY : It's not so much I'm a bull, Lewis. Look for a rally to the old highs and a deeper correction later this year.<p>
Lewis1000  : Why do you say that?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Lewis, the threat of rising short-term interest rates due to an accelerating economy should send stocks--which are expensive here--south.<p>
SHARON DE  : Greg, do you specialize in any particular area?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Well Sharon, small stocks are my passion, especially ones priced less than $25.<p>
MACBLAST   : Mr. Dorsey, do you have advice for new people getting into the market?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Mac, start by dollar cost averaging--buying equal dollar amounts each month--into funds.<p>
SHARON DE  : BW likes Woodside Petroleum out of Australia at $5+. Do you know it?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Sharon, sorry don't know it. But I like oil drillers here: Nabors, Schlumberger, Ensco.<p>
Dianne4036 : Techs took a beating today. What are your thoughts on the future?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Tech stocks are a little oversold Diane, but I'm not convinced they're at a bottom. I would wait for further signs that demand is picking up.<p>
Teebu      : Mr. Dorsey, what do you know about the Brandywine fund? Is it looking good? Feeling good?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Teebu, Foster Freiss is a great stock picker. You'll do well with the fund.<p>
MauryC7092 : What are some of the small stocks you like and why?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Thanks for asking Maury. Oil stocks, they're very cheap -- Nabors, Schlumberger, Ensco. Select biotech -- e.g. Vertex Pharm, Immune Response; certain software companies -- Manugistics, MDL Information Systems.<p>
SHARON DE  : Do you think America Online (AMER) will be joining your $25 & under category soon?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Sharon, I wouldn't buy AMER at these prices. I don't like the stock.<p>
Emj11      : Why don't you like AOL?  My mom just bought that.<p>
GREGDORSEY : Well Emj, AOL are certainly wonderful hosts, but I think there is more downside risk before the stock moves significantly higher.<p>
Emj11      : Why are these biotech stocks so good?<p>
GREGDORSEY : The biotechs have been beaten up and the most exciting drugs that will be developed in the next few years will come out of these dynamic biotechs. Look for big drug companies to start angling to buy these smaller companies up.<p>
SHARON DE  : Greg, any IPOs you particularly like right now?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Sharon regarding IPOs. I generally avoid them since most trade below offer prices 6 months later.<p>
MauryC7092 : What do you think of Advance Polymers: APOS.<p>
GREGDORSEY : Maury I don't know APOS well, but they're with Dow Chemical, could be a boon to the company.<p>
Dianne4036 : Novice question: Are the criteria any different when looking for good "small" stocks?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Excellent question Diane. You have to do more homework since there's much less coverage by Wall Street. Look for high insider ownership and high and rising operating margins and strong free cash flow.<p>
Emj11      : Have you heard of Macromedia and what do you think?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Emj Macromedia is expensive, relative to earnings, and insiders are selling--not good.<p>
Lewis1000  : Is it your feeling that the 10...15...20 year bull (depending on when you start counting)... is still at work here? What could  make it end? By end, I mean a significant, much more that 25 percent correction.<p>
GREGDORSEY : Lewis a 25 percent correction isn't out of the question within the next 12 months. Higher inflation will set it off.<p>
Bugsy40    : Hi Greg: I've always thought the stock market should be handicapped like the races. Is it possible to pick stock on the basis of odds, e.g., the odds are 3 to 1 IBM will rise in the next 30 days? <p>
SHARON DE  : Bugsy, what a great idea.<p>
GREGDORSEY : Bugsy, if you want odds stick to Vegas.<p>
Bugsy40    : Greg: Seriously, think about it theoretically. When you pick a stock, aren't the chances of your guessing right quantitative? (And thank you Sharon).<p>
Lewis1000  : Bugsy, I think you can really do that already .There are some stock analysis tools that give percentile chances for upward or downward movements.<p>
GREGDORSEY : Settle down Bugsy. Stock picking is quantitative. But  it's not the same as a casino. Your best bet is long term--something impossible to do at a craps table.<p>
DDelores   : What do you think of IOMEGA, long term prospects?<p>
GREGDORSEY : IOMEGA has a great product but it's overpriced here.<p>
Bugsy40    : I saw IOMEGA for $185 at Mac Warehouse, I don't think it is overpriced.<p>
GREGDORSEY : Not the product Bugsy, the stock.<p>
Lewis1000  : Although, the price of the product is a huge factor for IOMG. They are cutting the price in half soon.<p>
SHARON DE  : Do you know/like Xoma?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Sharon, Xoma is working on an interesting product but it's cash strapped--a risky gamble.<p>
Emj11      : As far as earnings are concerned, what do I look for? I am a beginner. (MACR)<p>
GREGDORSEY : Emj you have to ask yourself "Is 50 percent a year growth sustainable?" It's doubtful. So don't pay too much of a premium in terms of the P/E.<p>
Emj11      : What is a normal growth rate?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Emj I look for companies that can grow at 20 percent annually long term. With blue chips that number is typically lower.<p>
Emj11      : How do I compare growth (EPS) by quarter of previous year?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Emj, you want to compare them to the same quarter a year ago and on a sequential basis.<p>
Lewis1000  : Greg, do you think earnings growth is more/less important than price-to-sales ratios with small stocks?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Lewis both are equally important. Without sales earnings won't follow. Unlike earnings, sales can't be manipulated through accounting tricks.<p>
BRBroker   : Greg -- are you in the market (equity) at all?  If so, where?<p>
GREGDORSEY : BR to avoid any conflicts of interest I generally trade only stock index futures.<p>
Lewis1000  : For small stocks, aren't we looking for companies with growth potential, rather than the most efficiently run organizations?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Interesting query, Lewis. I've seen a lot of small companies with great growth potential blow it because of lousy management.<p>
Lewis1000  : Are small stocks effected more by a strong U.S. dollar or a weak one?<p>
GREGDORSEY : The impact of a changing dollar, Lewis, is less important to small companies than large ones, since large companies generally have more overseas sales. But small firms overseas have less sophisticated hedging practices (in general) and can be more adversely affected by currency swings.<p>
Lewis1000  : So a play on small stocks is really a play on America, no?<p>
GREGDORSEY : God bless America, Lewis. It's your patriotic duty: buy small companies.<p>
Emj11      :  How much should a new investor start of with?<p>
Dianne4036 : I'll add to that question: And how should they diversify with small stocks?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Start with whatever you have Emj. You can start with as little as $25 a month with many solid funds like Meridian, Fidelity Low Price or Baron Asset. Dianne, small stocks should only be a part of your portfolio, but a larger part if you're a long way from retirement. IBM and Mircrosoft were once small stocks.<p>
Matt5001   : Greg -- are small stocks actually a smart idea for the neophyte investor?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Matt, there is a world of difference between small stocks that I'm talking about and penny stocks. Small stocks are a worthy investment for folks looking for long term growth as their key investment goal.<p>
Emj11      : Is buying 25 shares of a stock ridiculous?<p>
GREGDORSEY : No Emj. If that's what you can afford in a decent company buy it. You have to start somewhere.<p>
DPCopeland : Greg -- How many individual stocks would be the minimum to achieve reasonable diversification?<p>
GREGDORSEY : DP start with 3 or 4 diversified funds, then go into stocks. You want to hold at least 8-10 stocks to be reasonably diversified.<p>
RonaldJ118 : Greg: What's happening with Greyhound (bus)?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Ronald, Greyhound looks likes a dirty dog.<p>
WMstressed : Greg: Do you follow Top Sourse Tech (TPS)? If so 3-6 month outlook?<p>
GREGDORSEY : WM, TPS is moving closer to turning a profit. I don't follow the stock closely enough to say much more.<p>
WMstressed : Thanks, I share the same view on profitability...<p>
Skybird246 : Do you generally hold stocks for long term or set targets for taking profits?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Hey Skybird. I generally buy with a 3-year target in mind. But if they continue to produce I stick with it.<p>
Skin935    : What are the prospects for Read Rite?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Skin Read Rite is a commodity play. Don't be fooled by its P/E. It'll always trade at a low one.<p>
RonaldJ118 : Bought AMHD, ANLG, & AXC for long term...New products from them on market.  Buy, Sell, Hold?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Whoa, CNBC flashback Ronald. Sorry, I don't follow any of them regularly.<p>
Skybird246 : Yo Greg! If I buy high quality and stay with them, then should I hold on through corrections?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Yesiree bob, Skybird.<p>
RonaldJ118 : What small-mid companies do you recommend now--for short and/or long term?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Ronald, I especially like MDL Information Systems, Manugistics and ADAC Labs are my favorites for the next 3-5 years.<p>
Skin935    : Your opinion on IVAX?<p>
GREGDORSEY : IVAX looks good Skin, but it's a little pricey here.<p>
Hey Skybird and everyone else--you can check out my site at www.investars.com.<p>
All right hard core investment mavens--what other questions do you have?<p>
MauryC7092 : How does Page Net--PAGE--look to you? <p>
GREGDORSEY : Maury PAGE is well positioned but the stock is a darling of institutional investors. I'd wait for it to fall further before buying.<p>
WMstressed : Greg: Are any of the stocks you recommend optionable?<p>
GREGDORSEY : Generally no WM. I don't think in terms of the options market when choosing my stocks.<p>
RonaldJ118 : CAER, NOVL, IMAT, -- also on my list...any good words on these or are they too small?<p>
GREGDORSEY : As far as I can tell Novell isn't moving product. Earnings gains will be hard to come by. IMAT and CAER I haven't a clue Ronald.<p>
RonaldJ118 : Own BAX and CK--good companys? Prospect for long term? What target price should I sell?<p>
GREGDORSEY : You've certainly got your hands full of stocks, Ronald. Both BAX and CK are good companies in good industries.<p>
RonaldJ118 : With $5,000. --what 2-5 stocks would you recommend. Actually, this is Ron's wife, I'm the stock freak.<p>
GREGDORSEY : Good for you, Ron's wife. Questions like these typically get me in trouble. So instead of answering you, I'll ask you to stop by my web site. I'm offering a free 3-month trial.<p>
Well, folks, my pregnant wife is waiting for me at home. I'm afraid I should wrap it up.<p>
WorthEdit3 : Thanks for joining us tonight, Greg! You've been a very informative guest, and have covered a lot of ground for our readers. For any of you who may have missed part of the chat, you can find a transcript of tonight's chat in the TODAY box on our opening screen later in the week. And Greg will be back for a future Worth OnLine Conference Call. Thanks for coming!<p>

						On June 19, Sean Donahue and Carol Pickering, the researchers who discovered "The Next Microsoft," joined Worth OnLine for "Conference Call." Donahue and Pickering did the research and reporting for Clint Willis's June 1996 cover story, "Found: The Next Microsoft." What follows is a transcript of the event, edited for clarity. The opinions expressed here are those of Sean Donahue and Carol Pickering and do not reflect the opinions of Worth OnLine.<p>
WorthOnLne : Welcome to Worth OnLine's chat series, "Conference Call." Sean Donahue and Carol Pickering, the researchers who discovered "The Next Microsoft," are here in place of writer Clint Willis, who could not be with us tonight. Sean and Carol did the research and reporting for Worth's June cover story, "Found: The Next Microsoft."<p>
The article set out to identify the next stock that could earn Microsoft-caliber returns. After a long process of investigation and elimination, the following four companies that emerged as standouts were: CyberCash (Nasdaq:CYCH), Geoworks (Nasdaq:GWRX), Vical (Nasdaq:VICL), and Isis Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq:ISIP). <p>
Sean ("WorthSean") and Carol ("WorthCarol") proabably know more about these four companies than any of us. Tonight they will talk about these four companies, their research techniques, and how you can find the "next Microsoft." <p>
MrGreen99  : GWRX has had a huge seller in it lately. Where was the stock when you first found it?<p>
WorthCarol : Geoworks was at 29.50 when we first started looking.<p>
WorthOnLne : GWRX was at 31.25 at market close today. Since the "Finding the Next Microsoft" article appeared as the cover story of Worth's June issue Geowork's (Nasdaq:GWRX) stock has risen 6 percent. (Data as of 6/18.)<p>
MrGreen99  : GWRX was at 45 two weeks ago. 14 point drop.<p>
STONE221   : With a number of different companies all developing technology for Internet money transfer, why do you think CyberCash will be the one to succeed long term?<p>
WorthCarol : They have a higher level of security than any other of its competitors. It has set up strong relationships with banks that process 85 percent of credit-card transactions<p>
Jacs Galls : OK. Who is the next Microsoft and why?<p>
WorthSean  : That would take a long time to answer, but in a nutshell, Isis Pharmaceuticals could achieve Microsoft-like returns if its products are approved and make it to market.<p>
Jacs Galls : WorthSean have you heard of Fuisz technologies?<p>
WorthSean  : No... <p>
Jacs Galls : Thay make a pill that dissolves intantly with or without water. Tylenol will use technology as well as many other contracts worldwide. I think they have a shot!<p>
JAsta37986 : Does anybody feel that NSCP has a chance at being the next MSFT?<p>
WorthCarol : Netscape hasn't made any money yet. No one knows how they will make money on their browser.<p>
JAsta37986 : How could you possibly say that NSCP does not know how to make money when they had 55 million in revenues!!!!! <p>
STONE221   : What about the deal that Netscape has with Verifone to develop Internet secure money transfer?<p>
WorthCarol : We don't have any info on the Netscape-CyberCash partnership.<p>
IvanM59    : Tell us about MRVC.<p>
WorthSean  : MRV communications is a little company that makes high-speed ethernet switches and fiber-optic drivers. They use declassified Israeli military technology (I hear) and are supposed to
have some of the finest products available, but they are in a market dominated by huge companies like Ascend and 3Com.<p>
Ma1428     : What will it take for ISIP to be the next Microsoft?<p>
WorthSean  : It would take a breakthrough in their drug technology, a breakthrough on the order of a cure for some type of cancer. That drug, when patented and marketed, would be a huge seller, and we all know how much companies can charge for pharmaceutical products.<p>
Ma1428     : How big can it become and how long will it take?<p>
GVissman   : Why has CYCH had the great rise and now is falling rapidly?<p>
WorthCarol : Unfortunately, we've been working on other stories since this came out so I'm not quite sure.<p>
Jacs Galls : Which one of four has most institutional support? <p>
WorthCarol : Geoworks or CyberCash.<p>
HLouie7914 : Anybody buy ISIP yet? Any info on the stock? What would be good target price to purchase ISIP; $20?<p>
WorthSean  : Louie, I'm not a professional stock analyst, but I might wait until it dropped below 20 again.<p>
Johnd 2ba5 : Can Isis increase on patents alone? <p>
DELTA 453  : What about Fore Systems (FORE)? Anybody up on it?<p>
HLouie7914 : Anybody on SEXI (systems of excellence)? Stock grew 
about 500% over a 2 week period.<p>
CBLenke    : Has anyone heard of a company called Telechips?<p>
WorthCarol : (CB) No?<p>
Liesl96    : Can you tell me a little bit more about Isis?<p>
WorthSean  : Isis is the leader in antisense technology, a form of gene-based drug discovery and delivery<p>
Brane MD   : Sorry, what does the new drug from ISIP promise to do???<p>
Ma1428     : ISIP closed 19 5/8 2day.<p>
HLouie7914 : Just recently, ISIP jumped to $24 and settle back down. Anybody know why?<p>
Johnd 2ba5 : Go to Isis homepage to find out more.<p>
Jacs Galls : I like Geoworks Op System for smart phones.<p>
Jilpeb     : What does Geoworks do?<p>
Greg332    : Are there any other companies that supply a service on the Internet like CyberCash?<p>
Wall St000 : Greg: 1st USA and Sterling.<p>
WorthSean  : Greg, yes. Checkfree, Digicash are a couple.<p>
WorthCarol : greg: Digicash and Checkfree, but they're doing slightly different things than CYCH.<p>
JAsta37986 : Hey greg 332 -- yes look at DIGICASH.<p>
Wall St000 : I am a very large holder of CYCH and have read your article.<p>
Greg332    : I have never heard of Cybercash's competition.  Have they been around a while?<p>
Wall St000 : Greg: All IPO this year I believe.<p>
Jacs Galls : What Mutual Fund support does Geoworks Have?<p>
WorthCarol : Jacs: It may be important, we just are not aware of fund support. We didn't research that.<p>
PBrown2213 : What does VICAL do?<p>
WorthSean  : Pbrown. Vical is another biotech company. They do something called gene thereapy, which replaces defective genes in human cells. The technology can be applied to cancers, inflammatory diseases, and possibly AIDS.<p>
PBrown2213 : Re: Vical. Others like CHIRON are doing gene therapy too...why is VICAL different? <p>
WorthSean  : Pbrown...they don't use viruses to deliver the genes to the cells...much safer.<p>
JAsta37986 : Hey Worth, Carol or Sean do you know of @Home net? I think that the @Home Network will be much bigger than MSFT ever was or will be. @Home is building a cable Internet that will eventually replace the current Internet.<p>
WorthCarol : Jasta: We heard word on that. Supposed to be cool.<p>
Ma1428     : What is the likelihood of ISIP having market cap of 60 billion as Worth suggests in the article... what would it take to get there?<p>
WorthSean  : Ma1428, In what time period?<p>
Ma1428     : Next ten years... I am patient.<p>
WorthSean  : Ma1428, ten years may be enough, but in that time period, 20 billion maybe. It all depends on the success of the drugs in clinical trial<p>
Wall St000 : Carol: I saw quite a bit of volume on CYCH at Junes issue. Is there any idea after the Canadian deal as to CYCH earnings this quarter??<p>
WorthCarol : wall: no idea.<p>
Jacs Galls : When do you think Geoworks will see bottom line improvement?? <p>
HLouie7914 : Carol and Sean, do you own any of the stocks we are talking about? If so, how much? <p>
WorthCarol : Hlouie: no, unfortunately we don't.<p>
Jacs Galls : Geoworks -- have any deals put together yet?<p>
BigTimothy : Carol and Sean, should I look into biotech for the best return over the next 5 years?<p>
WorthCarol : Big tim: yeah, we think it's a safe bet.<p>
Bugds      : WorthSean?: Who is doing the clinical trials? ie, Medical Center names or private? <p>
WorthSean  : Bugds, I'm not sure.<p>
Johnd 2ba5 : Sean,Carol Do any analyasts follow Vical and/or Isis?<p>
WorthSean  : Johnd. Yes, David Sone at Cowan & Co.<p>
Greg332    : How do the services of CyberCash and their competition differ?<p>
WorthCarol : Greg: Digicash is trying to create digital money. Checkfree doesn't believe anything is safe on the Internet. They don't have half the security CYCH does.<p>
Greg332    : Doesn't everyone think that the Internet is not safe for transactions at this time? How does Cybercash secure its lines?<p>
WorthCarol : Greg: Certainly, but CYCH is doing a better job of convincing people.<p>
Greg332    : Do you think that eventually the Internet could be secure?<p>
WorthCarol : With 1065 bit logarithic technology. They had to receive Defense Department clearance, they're the only ones to get it. <p>
BigTimothy : How do you evaluate the biotech when I don't have the expertise ? ? ?<p>
WorthSean  : BigTimothy, try Jim McCamant's Medical Technology Stock Letter <p>
WorthOnLne : Jim McCamant will be a guest on Conference Call on July 24 at 8:00 p.m. EDT.<p>
WorthSean  : Jim is a smart man. He's a great person to talk to about Biotech.<p>
WorthOnLne : June issue Isis Pharmaceutical's (Nasdaq:ISIP) stock has risen 86%. (Data as of 6/18.) Isis was at 20.5 as of market close yesterday.<p>
HLouie7914 : Are there reasons not to invest in ISIP?<p>
JAsta37986 : @Home could make NSCP IPO and MSFT IPO look paltry!<p>
KCLA227    : Carol and Sean, the next Microsoft will be a tech or biotech stock?<p>
WorthSean  : KCLA 227, I think biotech.<p>
Johnd 2ba5 : Does Isis have plans to manufacture any of the antisense drugs?<p>
WorthSean  : Johnd, yes, they plan on manufacturing some of their own as well as licensing the technology.<p>
HLouie7914 : Carol or Sean, are other analysts big on ISIS?<p>
WorthSean  : Hlouie, Paul Boni at Mehta and Isaly in New York<p>
BigTimothy : Have you ever heard of Applied Microbiology ( AMBI ) ??<p>
WorthSean  : Big Tim, no, not yet anyway<p>
BigTimothy : Sean & Carol, I really like your writing style - High Content And Good Humor !<p>
WorthCarol : bigtim: thanks<p>
HLCjr      : Wrting style won't make us any money....<p>
WorthSean  : HLCjr, it may make me some money.<p>
HLCjr      : Cute Worthsean...<p>
CBlain4082 : #1 company to invest is international automated 
             system SYMBOL IAUS watch them .<p>
BigTimothy : The BOOK you guys reference in the article, is it Summer Reading ? ? ?<p>
WorthCarol : Bigtim: Sure Tim, take to the beach!<p>
BigTimothy : Cool, I'm going next week to Ocean City MD. I will pick-up a copy.<p>
BERT3825   : How much does that 86 percent rise in Isis's stock have to do with your story?<p>
WorthSean  : BERT, about 25 million for ISIP.<p>
SHumph9524 : What about the prospects for Oracle Corp.?<p>
WorthCarol : shump: Can't help.<p>
HLouie7914 : the next microsoft will be SEXI (500% growth in two weeks)<p>
TAGjek     : I am with you HLouie! GO SEXI!<p>
Bacardi 1  : What does that stand for? SEXI?<p>
TAGjek     : Systems of Excellence<p>
HLouie7914 : They are in video conferencing with PC systems. Any news on SEXI lately? <p>
TAGjek     : Hlouie.. check out news by ticker in Portfolios for today's news on SEXI.<p>
WorthCarol : Hlouie: We didn't research SEXI.<p>
Johnd 2ba5 : Worth, I don't think you're correct, when the magazine hit the stand ISIS was already up!<p>
WorthSean  : Sure, ISIS was between 11 and 13 when we started looking at it, but it had been higher back in the early 90s when biotech was everyone's darling.<p>
WorthOnLne : Any sense of the impact of Worth's article on the stock price? On that of the other companies mentioned?<p>
WorthCarol : I think that the Worth article had a strong impact on all of these stocks one way or the other.<p>
Wall St000 : WorthOnLne: Yes to your question on impact on stock price.<p>
WorthCarol : Wall: I don't see how any press wouldn't have an impact.<p>
JOLLOR     : What does Geoworks do?<p>
WorthCarol : jollor: Geoworks has an oem technology that is being used in smart phones and other consumer computing devices.<p>
BigTimothy : What do you ( Sean & Carol ) think about the Internet computer?<p>
WorthSean  : Big Tim, I don't think it's as great as some say. Everyone needs to store some data at some time or another, so a simple connection won't help too much. What will you download into?<p>
BigTimothy : Yea, but what about large companies???<p>
WorthSean  : Big Tim, I like Intuit a lot, they're pretty big.<p>
BigTimothy : I have a position in SunRiver Corp ( SRVC ).<p>
BigTimothy : Sean & Carol, how can you BUY a stock that is NOT making MONEY ? ? ?<p>
WorthCarol : big tim: do some research.<p>
WorthSean  : Big tim, you're making a bet on the technology, the quality of the management, and the size of market.<p>
Johnd 2ba5 : Vical was the same thing, a piece showed recent price it was 16. 11 time of publication. Need to figure how to get Worth info earlier! <p>
Wall St000 : Carol: Your feelings on VeriFone in regards to CYCH. Same owners we know. But company wise?<p>
WorthCarol : I think Bill Melton's experience definitely helps CYCH.<p>
HLouie7914 : sean or carol, how about ICOS and the fact that Bill Gates own over 10 percent of the company<p>
WorthSean  : Hlouie, he must see something there. I like them, but they don't have a unifying, patentable technology for delivery of a therapy like Isis and Vical do.<p>
HLouie7914 : If GATES invests in something it must be worthwhile, right?<p>
Johnd 2ba5 : I'd like to hear more of ICOS it real cheap<p>
BigTimothy : Sean & Carol, for biotech: How many drugs do you look for in the pipeline? ? ?<p>
WorthSean  : Big tim, I don't know a hard and fast rule, but the more the better, and many different applications is always better, in case one or two or more don't make it to human trial.<p>
WorthOnLne : Could an "average" person get the access to info (talking to CO execs, etc) that you did?<p>
WorthCarol : Info. for the average joe. Calling venture caps. is pointless. They'll ignore you. Try newsletters: Red Chip Review, California Technology Stock Letter and Medical Technology Letter.<p>
Johnd 2ba5 : How far away is Isis from manufacturing? Thought all were in clinicals? Approval? <p>
WorthSean  : Johnd, I can't remember exactly, I haven't been following them since we finished the story.<p>
Triad      : Any news lately of MRVC?  It had quite a run up last week or so.<p>
WorthCarol : triad: Sorry no info. We haven't followed these stocks for a couple months.<p>
HLouie7914 : Carol or Sean, can Isis develop a cure for the AIDS virus?<p>
WorthSean  : Hlouie, I don't think anyone's making that claim yet, but they may be looking in to it.<p>
WorthEdit1 : HLouie--you may want to check out "Robert Gallo Wants To Fight" from the same issue as the MSFT story.<p>
HLouie7914 : If someone found a cure for AIDS, wouldn't you think that company would just skyrocket?<p>
WorthSean  : Hlouie, obviously. But I don't think Isis has a cure for AIDS as one of their focuses. It's mostly anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory application<p>
BigTimothy : Carol & Sean, what is next industry to follow the biotechs over the next 5 to 10 Years ? ?<p>
WorthCarol : Telecom, Internet.<p>
WorthSean  : Big Tim, Someone mentioned "photonics".<p>
BigTimothy : If you say PHOTONICS you are talking about Lucent Technologies. Right ? ?<p>
WorthSean  : Big Tim, maybe. They hadn't yet split off when I was doing my research so I didn't follow them<p>
ShAq54     : Carol or Sean : where can I get detailed information on a regular basis on public companies?<p>
WorthCarol : sha: Newsletters.<p>
ShAq54     : Where do I get newsletters on a daily basis?<p>
WorthCarol : Sha: Daily, I don't know. Any of the ones I mentioned are monthly.<p>
Triad      : What are the best critera today to find the MSFT of tomorrow?<p>
WorthCarol : Triad: Strong management, proprietary tech/oem.<p>
WorthSean  : Triad, look for a company with a defacto monopoly in a huge, growing industry.<p>
Triad      : Do you have any industries that you would currently recommend?<p>
WorthCarol : The ones we like--telecom, internet, and biotech. <p>
WorthEdit1 : I'd like to thanks Carol and Sean for graciously agreeing to participate in the chat tonight in Clint Willis's absence.<p>
WorthSean  : Goodbye everyone, thanks for coming.<p>
WorthCarol : Thanks.<p>
WorthOnLne : Tune in next week for Greg Dorsey (Wed. 8 p.m.), who will talk about small stocks the Street doesn't follow, and Art Bonnel (Thur, 8 p.m.), manager of the #1 Morningstar rated mid-cap fund.

						On June 18, Rudy Maxa joined Worth OnLine for "Conference Call." Maxa, a travel writer and author of "Europe When It Sizzles" from the July/August issue of Worth, gave readers tips and advice on traveling throughout the world. What follows is a transcript of the event, edited for clarity. The opinions expressed here are those of Rudy Maxa and do not reflect the opinions of Worth OnLine.<p>
WorthEdit3 : Welcome to Worth OnLine's CONFERENCE CALL. Tonight, we're joined by travel writer Rudy Maxa. His screen name is SavTrav. Good evening, Rudy. Welcome to Worth OnLine.<p>
SavTrav    : Thank you so much.  Nice to be here. <p>
KY BUILDER : I would like info on apartments in Italy, wine country/Florence/classical music areas?<p>
SavTrav    : One of the best package tour companies for wine tours in Italy is called Campioni Italiani de Veneto.  You may call them at 310-373-2226. As for renting, you may find farmhouses, grand houses, smaller places, and so on by contacting Italian Rentals at 202-244-53445! For general info on Florence, go to the American Express "ExpressNet section" here on AOL (keyword: Amex) and click on Travel Info and browse!<p>
Rabbit7442 : Thanks for any tips for a single traveler.<p>
SavTrav    : Tips for the single traveler:  Can you be more specific?  What part of the world? And what kind of tips?<p>
Rabbit7442 : Ireland, best way to see country without car. Also cruises to Alaska.<p>
SavTrav    : Well, there are only two ways to see Ireland without a car: bus or train. The train system in Ireland isn't as extensive as it is in, say Great Britain, but it could work for you.  There are, of course, bus tours as well. Call the Irish Tourist Board at 212-418-0800 for more details about options. There are some bargains if you're thinking of cruising Alaska.  Now is an excellent time to consider booking to the northwest.<p>
MARTSAND   : We will be touring the south of France. What is best way to get from Perpignan to Barcelona?..<p>
SavTrav    : Don't know Perpignan so I can't help.  What's it near?<p>
MARTSAND   : Perpignan is 30 miles south of Carcassonne<p>
SavTrav    : Jeez, Carcassonne. . . I'd take the train to Toulouse and train it to Barcelona presuming you're on a leisurely schedule.  If you're in a hurry, fly.<p>
KY BUILDER : What village would you recommend in the Italian wine country for a one month stay?<p>
SavTrav    : There are so many wondeful villages in Italy, it's hard to choose.  But if you go about a 90-minute drive north of Venice, you're in Asolo, a charming town with nice places to stay and great, hilly drives. I'd choose Asolo, but there are other options, of course. <p>
Rabbit7442 : What is the best time of year to travel to Irish country?<p>
SavTrav   : Best time of year to travel in Ireland is summer or early fall or late spring.<p>
WorthEdit3 : In the July/August issue of Worth, you give some great tips on traveling through Europe during the peak season. What are some of the best-kept secrets?<p>
SavTrav    : (I'm starting to get envious of some of these trips.) Well, if you're headed to Europe or even Asia, Inter-Continental Hotels has put out a free booklet called "Concierge Confidential."  The hotel company polled its concierges and asked them for their secrets.  It's a great resource.  You may get it free by calling 800-327-0200. Also, if you're in Paris and you MUST see the Mona Lisa, you can avoid the long lines at the Louvre by going around to the back entrance on the Seine side of the rear wing.<p>
Rodreupert : Is there anywhere in the U.S. that is like country and you can just relax?<p>
SavTrav    : I just got back last week from the Napa Valley. That, and Sonoma County are pretty darn relaxing places to me!  No glitz, lots of great food (and, of course, wine). The coastal areas of Oregon, northern California, and Washington are pretty swell, too.<p>
Lewis1000  : Will Europe ever be cheap enough for Americans to travel there again?<p>
SavTrav    : I think Europe will be cheap again, if only because history seems to swing back and forth when it comes to currency fluctuations. I admit it's been a while since the U.S. dollar was king!  But the time will come again, I think.<p>
SavTrav    : Meanwhile, consider Turkey--the best bargain these days in Europe. Another Europe tip: Book your London theater tix before going over.  Call Edwards & Edwards at 800-223-6108.<p>
RSteinau   : My wife and I are planning a ten year anniversary trip to Europe, any ideas?<p>
SavTrav    : An anniversary in Europe?  You can't go wrong. Obviously, Paris, the city of love comes to mind immediately.  But the Amalfi coast of Italy, or the lake region around Lake Como will make you fall in love with life all over again.  And each other.  Depends on the time of year, whether you two are city or country types.  Whether you like pasta or foie gras! I think the most important thing about a romantic getaway is choosing your accomodations correctly.  Check out the Relais & Chateaux catalogue.  Any of their member properties are almost guaranteed to be first class and romantic. Details: 212-856-0115.<p>
Lewis1000  : How about using the internet to buy remainder airline tickets just before the date of travel? Does it work?<p>
SavTrav    : OK, the Internet and remainder airline tickets. I have never used the 'Net to buy consolidator air tickets.  You may well find a travel agency that specializes in consolidator tickets that advertises on the 'Net, however. But almost any agency these days can help you with that. I don't honestly know that there's any advantage of looking on the 'Net, but not having tried, I'm not about to argue one way or another. <p>
Anybody thinking about visiting Asia? Whoops, I forgot this session is supposed to be about Europe.  Oh, well.  I'm game for anything.<p>
Lewis1000  : Thailand's always been an interesting idea.<p>
SavTrav    : I LOVE Thailand, especially the north and the south.<p>
Lewis1000  : Ever been to Vietnam?<p>
SavTrav    : The people are among the most kind and gentle, the cuisine is legendary, and the prices out of Bangkok are favorable. I have not been to Vietnam.  Almost shouldn't call myself a travel writer these days but I was about to go this spring until a family member took ill and I had to cancel. But I only hear good things.  One warning: Be sure you have lodging before you go to Vietnam, as the hotels are apparently always full! And, of course, you'll need a visa.<p>
Lewis1000  : What's the most beautiful, wonderful, interesting place you've ever been?<p>
SavTrav    : Wow, that's a big question.  Beautiful: some parts of the south of France, in the hills. Interesting: Got to be Asia; Hong Kong, Macao, rural Thailand. Wonderful, well, I think I'd choose Kenya, on safari. For a city boy like me, seeing the expanse of African sky, the range of wildlife, and the fundamental feeling that we may all have sprung from that soil was powerful. But, don't get me wrong: I had a fabulous time in the Napa Valley last weekend, too! I do appreciate the western mountains of North Carolina, the Floriday Keys, and so on.<p>
Lewis1000  : What's the right amount to budget for a trip to Europe--A moderate level trip?<p>
KelDuke    : $6000<p>
Lewis1000  : $6000? For what? A night at the casinos in Monaco?<p>
KelDuke    : ya<p>
SavTrav    : Well, a moderate budget for Western Europe would be about $150 a day, I think, if you're careful about where you stay and you avoid expensive restaurants.  You can stay in places for less than $100 a night all over France--the French Government Tourist Office has a free book (it's $18 if you wait and buy it in France) with listings.  Then eat at bistros and you could come in well under $150.  Of course, I'm speaking from the vantage point of a 46-year-old man who isn't willing to do the hostel thing anymore! My daughter could probably do France for $40 a day.<p>
KelDuke    : I would on at least $200 a day.<p>
WorthEdit3 : What do you consider a good deal on an airfare from NY to London?<p>
SavTrav    : Airfare this summer between NY and London on the major airlines is right now about $700, I'd estimate, on average.  But scheduled charters could deliver you to and from for a couple of hundred dollars less. The drawback of scheduled charters is that if something goes wrong--if a plane is delayed because of weather or mechanical difficulties, there's usually no back up. Which means you spend a lot of time--sometimes an extra day--waiting.  But the price is often right.<p>
Lewis1000  : It's hard to do something like that when time is right.<p>
SavTrav    : For info on scheduled charters, check the small ads in the Sunday travel sections of major newspapers, such as the NY Times in this case.<p>
Lewis1000  : Are they all reputable?<p>
KelDuke    : DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ASK<p>
SavTrav    : There have been people stranded when a charter has suddenly closed shop, but I don't think it's a major problem these days. Of course, ValuJet was a big success just about six weeks ago!<p>
Lewis1000  : How about becoming a courier in order to travel  cheaply?<p>
SavTrav    : Becoming a courier is an excellent way to travel very cheaply (but with no check-on luggage) if you have the luxury of time.  As you may know, you can't exactly pick and choose your schedule.  And the more flexible you are, the more last-minute you can leave, the less you'll pay.  For more info, check out Kelly Monaghan's excellent book on the subject, available in most travel sections of bookstores or by calling 800 356 9315. Courier flights are best for students, retired folks, or people who have summers off!<p>
Lewis1000  : Is Mexico known for not having great food?<p>
SavTrav    : Mexico offers fabulous food, you just have to take certain precautions by staying away from fruit you don't peel yourself, salads that aren't prepared at restaurants or hotels that use purified water to clean them, and by drinking only bottled drinks.<p>
Lewis1000  : I went to Ixtapa and went to every four star  restaurant and it's not that the food was bad, it's just that it was so mediocre.<p>
SavTrav    : Possible, very possible; I don't know the restaurants of Ixtapa.<p>
KHick23415 : Any suggestions, business in Brussels either August or October...which month is best and why.....<p>
SavTrav    : Either month is fine for Brussels, though October will obviously be cooler. And less crowded with tourists, as August is prime time for tour groups. I'd choose October if I had to choose.<p>
KHick23415 : Are the prices different?<p>
SavTrav    : The tip is already figured in the meter of Brussels taxis, so don't overpay. And if you're going downtown from the airport, take the 20-minute ride on the shuttle train to Brussel's Central Station for only $3 each way.<p>
Lewis1000  : Ever been to Israel?<p>
SavTrav    : I have been to Israel several times, yes; one of my fave places.  Along with Jordan and Egypt.<p>
KHick23415 : Yes, we stay at Hotel President, near Nord Station. Great hotel and reasonable with Sabena.<p>
SavTrav    : Then you're in good shape, KHick.  Lewis1000, I  remember being quite moved by visting Masada, and Jerusalem is a great walking town, at least the old part.<p>
Lewis1000  : I agree. Jerusalem is a great example of good urban planning.<p>
SavTrav    : If your'e thinking of visiting Isreal but the air ticket is a problem, check out Tower Air's flights from JFK in NY.  Also, World Airlines (in a code-share deal with Continental) is offering a companion half price ticket between NY and Tel Aviv until the last day of July, I believe.  I write about it in my weekly travel column posted here on AOL this wk.<p>
KHick23415 : What is the cheapest way to go from Brussels to Cork, Ireland?  Also how long does it take?<p>
SavTrav    : Never have gone to Cork, so I can't help with time. You could obviously fly, or you could take the Chunnel train to London and fly or train from there.<p>
Lewis1000  : You mentioned Turkey earlier. Wasn't there an election recently where a fundamentalist Muslim took a high office? Would that affect Americans touring there?<p>
SavTrav    : Turkey has long been struggling politically, with fundamentalism being a factor, yes. But so far, I know of no problems being encountered by Americans visiting.<p>
Lewis1000  : Are Belize and Costa Rica still the hot places in Central America?<p>
SavTrav    : Belize was hot about ten years ago and still is (in all senses of the word), particularly if diving is your passion.  Costa Rica became hot about four years ago and continues to enjoy a boom among Americans who like its nearness, its stability, its Pacific coast and its prices.  The tourism infrastructure, however, isn't as developed as it eventually will be.  That, of course, can be a plus for many people.  Most lodging along the coast is simple and functional.  Don't expect luxury resorts!<p>
KHick23415 : When visiting Brussels, to what outlying areas should I bring the teenagers?  Luxemborg?<p>
SavTrav    : Bruge is the most famous town outside of Brussels for touring--its canals and architecture are delights. The teens will especially like the fact the national food is french fries.  With mayonnaise. Vendors cook 'em up and sell 'em everywhere! Remember, Amsterdam isn't too far from Brussels, if you have the time to visit, as well. Watch for pickpockets this summer in big European cities.<p>
KHick23415 : Any suggestions on feeding the teenagers on a reasonable budget while in Belgium?<p>
Lewis1000  : Is Nicaragua the next hot spot in C.A.?<p>
SavTrav    : Don't stop on the open road even if someone suggests there's something wrong with your car. Well, for teens in Belgium you got your French fries, as I mentioned. There are plenty of reasonable places to eat with the usual teen bulk food!<p>
I don't know if Nicaragua is on the brink of being "hot."  Again, little tourism infrastructure there so far. I have not been, so I speak only generally.<p>
Lewis1000  : Is Eurail still the best way to get around Europe on the cheap?<p>
SavTrav    : If you're visiting a lot of cities, yes, it is. There are so many various kinds of Eurail tickets these days, however, shop carefully.<p>
KHick23415 : Be sure to buy the tickets, in Belgium they don't always check, but fines are steep if caught.<p>
Lewis1000  : You sound like you've been through that, KHick.<p>
KHick23415 : Almost, got on 1st class with 2nd class ticket, they got a bit annoyed, but no fine luckily.<p>
SavTrav    : In England, you can buy a Britrail pass.  For info, call 800-677-8585. Always buy Britrail and Eurail passes in the U.S. before going abroad.<p>
In Russia, don't be shy about yelling and pushing if you're in a public place, and people start crowding around you.  They're about to go through all your pockets! And leave no visible luggage in parked rental cars,  ever.<p>
Lewis1000  : I heard Russia is in dire dire straits. Have you seen any of that your own eyes?... Alchoholism, of course unemployment, you name it.<p>
SavTrav    : Yes, I've visited Russia, and there are people in dire straits there, no question. Which is why crime is a problem. If you stick to major cities and keep your wits about you, however, you'll be fine!  St. Petersburg, for me, is well worth the visit.<p>
KHick23415 : Yes my brother recently visited, said bring toilet paper and soap, and jeans for barter...<p>
Lewis1000  : That was the old USSR.<p>
KHick23415 : No, this was last month.<p>
BoxOf64    : NY here, and wanting to go to Vegas. Should I do a Travel Agents pkg or make my own arrangements?<p>
SavTrav    : As for that Vegas question:  check an airline for a hotel/air deal!<p>
WorthEdit3 : Thanks for joining us tonight, Rudy! You've given a lot of great travel advice to all of us. For those of you who missed part of tonight's chat, we'll have a transcript available in the TODAY window of our opening screen.<p>
SavTrav    : Thanks for having me!<p>
WorthEdit3 : Thanks again, Rudy. Good night.<p>
SavTrav    : Good night!<p>
WorthEdit3 : And thanks to all of you who joined us this evening.

						On May 1, James Dines joined Worth OnLine for "Conference Call." Dines, author of "Mass Psychology" and editor of "The Dines Letter" since 1960, talked about investing in precious metals, market timing, and mass psychology. What follows is a transcript of the event, edited for clarity. The opinions expressed here are those of Mr. James Dines and do not reflect the opinions of Worth OnLine.<p>
WorthOnLne : 
Mr. James Dines (screen name DinesLtr) is going to begin tonight's Conference Call by giving us a bit of background information, and answers to some of the most basic questions about his three topics tonight: market timing, mass psychology, and investing in precious metals. Mr. Dines will begin to answer your questions after his initial introductory comments. Please hold questions until he is through.<p>
DinesLtr   : 
1) Precious Metals -- According to Dinesism #10 (The Dines Wolfpack Theory), gold, silver, platinum and palladium move together. The Dines Letter has been more optimistic on gold shares than gold bullion. All portfolios should retain a "core position" in golds and silvers for these two reasons: a) golds often move opposite to the rest of the market (Dinesism #7, Dines Rule of Gold Countertrend) so golds are a hedge against a market decline and b) there is a low-key currency crisis going on (see crash / Mexican peso last year, and crash of dollar against Japanese yen).  <p>
2) Market timing -- The Dines Letter has been bullish all the way up, and remains optimistic as of this time. We are in a "singularity" where the whole world is opening up to free markets, stock-purchase awareness, and the Internet -- the greatest invention since the printing press. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make money on Wall Street. <p>
3) Mass Psychology -- My new book " Mass Psychology," my third and final business book, has already been called a "classic" as have the first two books. This is a "Mass Psychological Market," approaching mania proportions that might end badly, so our next sell signal is crucial. Mania is societal, witness incredible sums paid at Jackie Kennedy's garage sale, spread of legalized gambling (daintily called "gaming" and "entertainment"), and the frantic rise in commodity prices. This is all historic. <p>
LoLoLAW    : 
Where do you think the S&P 500 will be by 12/31/96?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
I expect Standard & Poor's to keep rising until it breaks its Major Uptrendline.<p>
DRHCH      : 
What's the percentage gain in gold for the last quarter?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
First quarter gain, gold bullion - 2 percent -- DIGSA: 29.3 percent. The market's leading group, believe it or not<p>
DWillis782 : 
What do you think about a South African gold fund as an investment?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
I like the South African golds as part of a diversified gold portfolio.<p>
ISSherman  : 
How long do you think the bull market in small caps will last?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
ISSherman--Longer.<p>
PaulRCus   : 
Mr. Dines. I hold some shares of ABX and coins as well. Should I increase both or only one?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
ABX very bullish. Coins not as bullish but not as leveraged as gold stocks.<p>
RBussert   : 
Is it foolish for the small investor to time, or with a 15 year horizon, just hold?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Definitely use timing.<p>
Garsrese   : 
What is a major Uptrendline?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
I'd have to show you a chart of it. Subscribe to the Dines Letter.<p>
DRHCH      : 
How much is one 1922 silver dollar U.S. worth today, Mr. Dines?  I have hundreds.<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Silver coins -- price it with a coin store. <p>
FundWrap   : 
Mr. Dines, China recently cut interest rates -- citing decreased worries over inflation. If China were to relent on their austerity program that they started in July of 1993...what impact would that have on stocks there?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Bullish on China from 1979 to 1992, and now still bearish.<p>
FundWrap   : 
What if China were to loosen monetary policy -- would that make you bullish?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
We would turn bullish on China if stocks developed Uptrends.<p>
Matgot     : 
What is your opinion on telecommunications sector funds assuming a 15-year time horizon?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Matgot: telecommunications sector bullish, but don't think 15 years as this is a mania.<p>
JSHDFR     : 
What do you think about CBOE's new gold index? Better to buy an index or individual stock?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Our Gold Index is much better, and prefer individual stocks.<p>
Zooy       : 
Are you aware of the surge of Iomega on the NASDAQ, and if so, what are your thoughts?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Iomega is an example of a mania and is in an Uptrend.<p>
RBussert   : 
If the  bull market's a baseball game, what inning are we in?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
If the bull market is in baseball -- 7th inning.<p>
BS22039    : 
What is your thoughts on AOL stock?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Thoughts on AOL stock -- Bullish and in our Supervised Lists.<p>
WESEV9     : 
WHEN DO YOU EXPECT XAU TO BREAKOUT TO THE UPSIDE?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
XAU -- Imminently.<p>
RQTBL1     : 
Why do you believe the XAU will break out imminently?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
XAU - Because its components are in Uptrends.<p>
DRHCH      : 
When will the baby boomers crash in their expectations for mutual fund investment?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
At the bottom of the next bear market.<p>
Zooy       : 
But how long would you guess this Uptrend for Iomega will last?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Longer. <p>
Rexkay     : 
How do you feel about copper, oil, natural resources in general?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Bullish on natural resources for last three years.<p>
DCarl43677 : 
What do you think of IBM?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
IBM - short term bearish, long-term bullish.<p>
DMF MA     : 
What are your thoughts on Analog Devices?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Bullish with a stop at 23.<p>
Matgot     : 
What are your thoughts on REITs, both commercial and residential properties?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
I've been bearish on real estate since 1989.<p>
FundWrap   : 
Dines...what role does fundamental analysis play in your stock selection?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Fundamental analysis has a heavy role.<p>
EdS9000    : 
The Magellan Fund has really pulled back on tech stocks and gone to cash, etc. Just a bad guess?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Vinik has his own opinion.<p>
FundWrap   : 
Vinik had to redeploy a lot of money -- 20 billion worth. I think he made a bad bet on interest rates...and he also has too much cash still. That is the problem when the elephant tries to tip-toe out of a 20 billion dollar position.<p>
PaulRCus   : 
Mr. Dines, what about Glamis Gold shares?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Glamis  -- not my favorite gold stock. Stillwater Mining looks fantastic and written up in last issue of The Dines Letter.<p>
DMF MA     : 
Any thoughts on Pier One?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Pier One -- bullish stop 11.<p>
RBussert   : 
How do you feel about asset allocation strategies like constant ratios, etc.?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Asset allocation -- a function of market ignorance. Better to know what you're doing.<p>
Rexkay     : 
How do you see Latin America in general and Mexico in particular?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Bullish on Latin American and especially Mexico because their currency is so cheap and everybody is bearish.<p>
Jake8551   : 
What is your feeling on video conferencing, where is it going?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Bullish, but Internet will absorb it.<p>
Jake8551   : 
What do you mean, Internet will absorb it?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Internet will absorb video conferencing by the nature of the Internet rather than by separate companies.<p>
LEure      : 
What is your feeling about biotechs in general and Interneuron in particular?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Biotechs -- exceptionally bullish, but InterNeuron due for profit-taking pullback.  Try to buy below 32.<p>
DGeorge164 : 
Please explain the increase of the past several years in money supply to inflation.<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Huge question but they are connected.<p>
Lagarhead  : 
Do you think EDS will be able to deliver shareholders value after the spin-off???<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Bullish on EDS, but more so on General Motors.<p>
Peretz42   : 
Have of you heard of Dayton MNG on AMEX?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Dayton Mining -- bullish Uptrend but try to buy below 6.<p>
CAyers4207 : 
WILL STOCKS LIKE IOMG AND ZTEC LAST?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
IOMG & ZTEC for the moment - yes.<p>
LEure      : 
Why do you feel asset allocation is a result of market ignorance? <p>
DinesLtr   : 
Asset allocation is a mechanical system that replaces judgment.<p>
Rexkay     : 
if you have to have bonds-what duration?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Bonds -  short term.<p>
HBrilliant : 
Do you recommend 10-15 percent of assets in gold as others do? How does that balance with gold stocks?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Percent asset in golds varies depending on individual risk. For example, elderly should not even be buying green bananas.<p>
Sattar001  : 
Mr. Dines what about UTX?<p>
DinesLtr   :

Majorrbc   : 
Is picking the best movers in the DOW a good investment strategy?<p>

Yes.<p>
PaulRCus   : 
What about Cisco?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Cisco - a bullish leader making new highs in Major Uptrend.<p>
Christowin : 
How about Bay Network?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Bay Network -- should have been sold long ago because broken Uptrendline with deteriorating Relative Strength.<p>
LEure      : 
How would you approach a retirement 30 years from maturity? <p>
DinesLtr   : 
With skepticism that it can be done intelligently, but be cautious after this bull market ends.<p>
LEure      : 
Why skeptical?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
LEure: Because 30 years is too far to judge.<p>
Zooy       : 
How do you think LeBow's loss with RJR will effect stock? RJR appears to be floating in limbo. <p>
DinesLtr   : 
I prefer Philip Morris to RJR.<p>
PaulRCus   : 
How about REITs in general and Health REITs in Particular?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
REITs bearish, we are unenthusiastic about real estate.<p>
RBurger72  : 
Do you like Pan American Silver at "9"? <p>
DinesLtr   : 
Pan Amer Silver -- Definitely, one of the outstanding silver stocks.<p>
SmallRhino : 
Are you bullish on titanium plays? RMI Titanium or TRE?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
No, markets are still extremely bullish.
Titanium play too publicized, probably due for a profit-taking pullback.<p>
HBrilliant : 
How do you feel about a platinum play for the near term?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Platinum -- exceptionally bullish, and smart way to play it is Stillwater Mining, the only leading producer outside of South Africa.<p>

Stillwater Mining & Penoles (largest underground silver mine in world).<p>

Eli Lilly bullish, with stop at 58.<p>

Yes, it will make comeback but not visible yet.<p>
CAyers4207 : 
HOW MUCH RETURN SHOULD A PERSON LOOK FOR FROM 100,000 FROM A BROKER?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
As much as possible.<p>
DWillis782 : 
What do you think of investing in the Eastern European Markets? <p>
DinesLtr   : 
Too risky. If you can't make money in the US, you're hiding in too much tall grass.<p>
LEure      : 
Where would you sell Interneuron? Lots of promising drugs emerging.<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Not clear, and due for a profit-taking pullback, but should work higher later.<p>

No<p>

Very bullish and in our Supervised Lists.<p>
RGreig     : 
What is your opinion on Motorola?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Motorola: disappointing and can do better elsewhere, but if held leave a stop at 50. A rise to 65 would be more encouraging.<p>
Cosmed     : 
Regarding the economy -- isn't a rate hike more likely now than a rate cut?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Rate hike already in the market and should be ignored. If interest rates rise, dollar will go up and it would be bad for international corporations.<p>
DGeorge164 : 
Do you still favor Royal Oak and ASA Ltd.?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Royal Oak & ASA -- Yes.<p>
JAROD30    : 
Will interest rates rise? If so, how much? And will they ever come back down?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Interest rates are in a Uptrend and until that ends, we have no change.<p>
JOHNVBACH  :

What's your feeling on the Mexico market and its opportunities for us?<p>

Bullish on Mexico and recommend Mexican Fund on NYSE.<p>
PaulRCus   : 
Outlook for Enron Oil and Gas, Please, Mr. Dines.<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Enron -- Bullish, along with whole oil exploration group, but due for pullback, with stop at 24.<p>
Nickpel    : 
Your outlook for gold for the next year?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Outlook for gold bullion -- not as bullish as gold mining shares. The Dines Letter flashed a Major buy signal on gold stocks on 9 Nov 92. 
And still in Major Uptrend.<p>
JSHDFR     : 
What do you think The Dines Plan's biggest benefit is over the current tax system?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
The Dines Plan is discussed in my new book "Mass Psychology," featuring 50 percent tax cuts and privatization of broad sectors of government such as prisons. One of our big recommendations has been Corrections Corp., in a phenomenal Uptrend, 60 times your money so far.<p>
MARTSAND   : 
An opinion on Omnicare(OCR).<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Omnicare : In powerful Uptrend, with stop at 50.<p>
FundWrap   : 
What is gold supply like right now, relative to historical numbers?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Gold supply almost never changes as gold is indestructible. But demand fluctuates radically depending on investment fever. Also ex-communist masses can now buy gold for the first time in many decades.<p>
JOHNVBACH  : 
Short term on Home Depot,  earning report May 16th.<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Home Depot -- unenthusiastic, but if held, stop at 40.<p>
ZX300LM    : 
Would US Air with STEVEN WOLF in charge be a good buy?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Steven Wolf, very unpopular, but US Air in Uptrend along with airline stocks.<p>
Stockdoc   : 
MESA Air included in that airline bull move?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Mesa Airlines -- bullish with rest of group, stop at 10.<p>
FundWrap   : 
What do you think of Japanese automakers now? Is this a good time for them?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
No strong opinion, because it depends on currency fluctuation. Not in newspapers yet, but yen rising and should be bad for Japanese business. I'm so old I remember when the yen was hardly an urge.<p>
RGreig     : 
Your opinion on Oxford Health, with a P/E in the low 60s?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Oxford Health: bullish, a close stop at 42, conservative stop at 36.<p>
Jamellah   : 
Mr. Dines, is the life insurance industry a growth industry?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Life insurance moves with banking and utilities, both under pressure because of prospect of higher interest rates. But we added American International Group at 70 on 10 Apr 95. Now 92 and still very bullish, stop at 87.<p>
RQTBL1     : 
Since the Japanese Yen is a controlled currency why won't the BOJ put a lid on any substantial increase in the value of the JY?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Manipulated currency difficult to forecast but trend of yen is now up.<p>
FGuiffreda : 
What is your long term outlook for Walt Disney?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Bullish, but conservative for moderate growth.<p>
Stockdoc   : 
Do you like Horsham (HSM)?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Okay for diversification into Barrick, oil refining and German real estate, but I prefer owning Barrick directly.<p>
JOHN EE1   : 
What's in store for us Friday when the unemployment figures come out?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Unemployment figures irrelevant, as market is in Uptrend.<p>
LWaldmanmd : 
Your  position on IBM?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
IBM is short-term downtrend and in long-term Uptrend, along with whole high-tech group.<p>
Ravioli    : 
Your opinion on high tech,  i.e. Motorola, Microsoft etc.<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Motorola already answered, and Microsoft due for short-term pullback, but long term is outstanding.<p>
BILL65SAIL : 
How long do you think Uptrend is going to last?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Uptrends impossible to predict, but of the 33 "Dinesisms", number one is that an Uptrend will continue until it actually ends. We prefer to act after trends get penetrated.<p>
KLS29613   : 
Zoltec has been hot lately.  What do you think of it longer term?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Extremely bullish, but getting frothy. Use close stops.<p>
Costello69 : 
What do you think of MCI?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
MCI fairly bullish, but leave stop in at 25.<p>
Serpay     : 
Do you have an opinion on Activision, listed on the Nasdaq?<p>

Activision in long consolidation since September and would not buy until after Upside Breakout.<p>
JohnMattB  : 
What kind of outlook for the transport stocks such as Roadway, Arkansas Best and the industry in general?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Outlook on transport stocks: extremely bullish.<p>
JOHN EE1   : 
That bullish outlook on transports would seem to indicate a drop in rates....no?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
No, good business, when it is good enough, overwhelms the cost of interest rates.<p>
FundWrap   : 
When will gold hit $850 again, and what about the Russian reserves?  Further, just how strong is demand for retail gold in Asia? <p>
DinesLtr   : 
Do not have exact date. When you find out please let me know.<p>
FundWrap   : 
Dines...will do, I am thinking year 2100 : )<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Retail gold in Asia is very strong to hedge against inflated currencies, and is a form of speculation. Plus, buying off their women for whatever they did wrong.<p>
KLS29613   : 
What do you think of OrthoLogic's prospects?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
OrthoLogic - exceptionally bullish with very high Relative Strength and sharply rising sales.<p>
JFlem173   : 
Do you have a favorite among the international integrated oil companies?<p>

Yes. We added Royal Dutch to our Supervised List on 10 Apr 95. Now at 142 with stop in latest Dines Letter at 128.<p>
DWillis782 : 
Do you think gold will reach $500 this year?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
I doubt it, but it will eventually get much higher than that.<p>

How high on the long bond , Mr. Dines?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
I'm not clear, but looks higher for the moment.<p>
JHollan115 : 
When will HWP come down to 94 again?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Hewlett Packard (HWP): very bullish on charts and fundamentals, and is a buy, but do not have the exact date of 94.<p>
KLS29613   : 
Where do you see Zytec going? HCI Group gapped up the other day.  Is it starting an?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Zytec another red hot stock, with rising Relative Strength and volume, strong fundamentals. Let your profits run. <p>
WorthOnLne : 
HBrilliant asked earlier this week on the message boards: "The potential financial crisis facing America will cause either massive inflation or deflation. Which do you foresee?  What will its impact be on gold?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Inflation first and deflation later, and flight to gold will be historic as outlined in my book "Mass Psychology."<p>
MaxLea     : 
What about K MART?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Trying to form an Uptrend from lows reached early this year, but this is much too hot a bull market to fool around with retailing stocks.<p>
HKhosravi  : 
Your opinion on PHYCORE -- short term and long term?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Phycore: Bullish, good sales and earnings growth, in consolidation since November, hold with stop at 39.<p>
FundWrap   :

Johnson & Johnson has been stagnant all year.  Any idea where it's going?<p>
Giri Lam   : 
Will high grain prices hurt companies like Deere? Because three years of crops have been sold forward? <p>
DinesLtr   : 
Deere: chart is extremely bullish and unless it gets below 40, will hold. As pointed out in my book, don't think, look.<p>
Jeremi2029 : 
What is your opinion of Gandalf Technologies?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Disappointing sales decline, and if you hold it, I would leave stop in at 12, but look at it again if it has an Upside Breakout at 16. <p>
ISSherman  : 
What does "stop at" mean?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
A stop is automatic order to sell if a certain price is reached. Read Engel's book "How to Buy Stocks"<p>
MaxLea     : 
Would you invest in Germany now?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
No. Too much socialism<p>
Dholi7913  : 
Some Neural net programs are calling for DJIA to 4000 near end of the year.  What do you think?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Neural net programs have been wrong all the way up.<p>
UMWAJD     :

Bullish for the long term, along with whole energy complex, commodities and other real goods such as gold and oil.<p>
Topeca2    : 
Amati Communications (AMTX) --what is good price to buy now?<p>
DinesLtr   :

MarkT706   : 
Bell Sports gapped up today, do you see significant upside?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Bell Sports -- no opinion.<p>
Stockdoc   : 
Any opinion on global growth of wireless industry Nextell, Geotek, Ericsson, Airtouch Etc.?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Wireless industry headed for phenomenal growth, and the whole group is a buy. We even like General Motors for that reason.<p>
Stockdoc   : 
GM Hughes and Direct TV still in Uptrend.<p>
TFTAY      : 
What's your view on Semi Stocks like INTC, MOT, NSM, and CY?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Semi stocks -- unenthusiastic with poor tape action. Wait for their bull market to resume.<p>
AHegde     : 
What is your outlook on small and mid cap stocks in the next 3-6 months?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Small stocks still outperforming blue-chips and no change in sight.<p>
RQTBL1     : 
Kindly address the IMF sales question. <p>
DinesLtr   : 
IMF sales are baloney. Note that the US has not sold any gold in a half century and prices it at $42.50 in a show of unreality. Denial is more than merely a river in Egypt.<p>
AReyes2586 : 
What will Apple be at in 6 months?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
I do not like Apple.<p>
Sue1290    : 
Are Webs going to make closed end international funds obsolete, or increase discounts?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Webs will have huge impact on international funds, but won't make them obsolete. <p>
ISSherman  : 
Your opinion of TLAB?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Tellabs in Uptrend, but not overly enthusiastic.<p>
AHegde     : 
What do you make of the inflation worries?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
We flashed a buy signal on the commodity indices in Nov 92 and the public is just discovering it.<p>
HERBASSIST : 
Will silver catch up to gold in its 1980 ratio?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Silver will catch up and surpass gold in coming years. It is dirt cheap at $6.50, with a cost of $8 to bring it out of the ground. Last time I was this bullish on silver was 1960 when silver was at 92.5 cents. Adjusted for inflation, silver is now free.<p>
JLL001     : 
Where can you buy gold coins?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
You can buy gold coins in coin shops. <p>
JPolhe6814 : 
Pharmaceuticals will keep going?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Pharmaceuticals will keep rising. <p>
Giri Lam   : 
Silver has much more industrial use than gold....good economy nec for silver bullion?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Only partially an industrial metal, so has semi-monetary value.<p>
Rebesovice : 
Do you expect TEL MEX go up ?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Am bullish on TEL MEX, but so much overhead. Supply that going will be tough. Can do better elsewhere. <p>
Armhead1   : 
How do you feel about Pepsico?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Pepsico: decent blue-chip to buy, with stop at 56.
You've exhausted me.  This will be the last question. Read The Dines Letter! To subscribe: call 800-84-LUCKY.<p>
HERBASSIST : 
What is your best silver stock?<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Am so sure silver will rise with gold because of the Dines Wolfpack Theory that all precious metals move together, that in 1960 I baptized silver "the poor man's gold." Dangerous to buy only one silver stock so I prefer a basket. Penoles is my favorite, largest underground silver mine in the world and totally unknown to modern investment world as of yet. I first recommended it at $1.95 on 28 May 93 and so far it has only doubled, so plenty of room left. Also, Silver Standard and Pan American.<p>
RQTBL1     : 
To Mr. Dines - I just bought Prechter's book and thought that yours was too expensive; you have just changed my mind. Thanks!<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Prechter' s book is excellent and belongs in everybody's library.  My book is not "too expensive," but you mean the price is too high. At $59 a book it is a bargain because it is the only book on the subject and took me over 30 years to write. Order it at 800-550-1000.<p>
WorthOnLne : 
Thank You all for participating in tonight's chat with Mr. James Dines, of The Dines Letter.<p>
DinesLtr   : 
Ask Worth to have us back again some other time!!! Good Night.

						On Tuesday, April 16, Worth's senior financial editor, Jim Jubak, joined Worth OnLine for a live chat show. During the hour and fifteen minute chat, Jubak answered readers' questions about the stock market, investing, and the outlook for interest rates. <p>
WorthJubak : 
Hi, this is Jim Jubak. I've just signed on as WorthJubak. We're open for business.<p>
WorthEdit1 : 
Jim Jubak, Worth's senior financial editor is with us live. Jim, I would like to welcome you to tonight's chat.<p>
WorthJubak : 
Sure enough. So what did you think of the rally today. Really better for Nasdaq than the Dow.<p>
JSHDFR     : 
How much did it go up? I missed the closing figures.<p>
WorthJubak : 
Hello, JSHDFR. The Dow was up about 25, Nasdaq about 14 to a new high.<p>
WorthEdit1 : 
In the May cover story, "Can This Market Be Trusted," you say that the strength of the current market is based on the expectations and behavior of investors. How so?<p>
DewDood    : 
Please comment on Cirrus Logic, PepsiCo, T. Rowe Price, Schwab stocks.....Jim, are you here to talk about stocks?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Well, DewDood, I'm glad to tell you what I know about stocks, but I won't give buys or sells.<p>
DewDood    : 
Jim, what can you tell me about PepsiCo?<p>
WorthJubak : 
DewDood, to bounce back to Pepsi, it seems they've got some problems competing overseas with Coke.<p>
DewDood    : 
Do you think that Coke's reliance on overseas income will be detrimental with the increasing strength of the dollar?<p>
PURITRON   : 
What's with the telephone stocks?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Puritron, I think the days when one thing was "with" all telephones are over.<p>
PURITRON   : 
What is your opinion of WordCom?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Puritron, never heard of it, what does it do?<p>
PURITRON   : 
It's the fourth largest telephone company.<p>
Kaypatel   : 
Jim, what do you think about Diamond Multimedia?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Kaypatel, I don't follow the company in depth. I know people who like it, others think it's pricey.<p>
Realdonna  : 
Read the article about the bubble theory...does the theory make a case for contrarianism??<p>
WorthJubak : 
Realdonna, only in a very specific way. You certainly can't "fight the tape" in this market.<p>
Realdonna  : 
Define your "specific way."<p>
WorthJubak : 
Realdonna, To be a contrarian you might have to invest in something other than stocks, real estate.<p>
Realdonna  : 
OK...so for us who are hooked on the idea of equities for "wealth", what do we do to protect?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Realdonna, in what time frame?<p>
Realdonna  : 
Always a tough decision...think long term...but cannot avoid worrying about short!!<p>
WorthJubak : 
Realdonna: Okay, but what's long term to you? <p>
Realdonna  : 
Some money is in for 10 years or more...but some will be needed in 2-5. <p>
DewDood    : 
Jim, what do you know about Cirrus Logic?????<p>
FEJersey   : 
JIM, WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ABOUT HOLDING MICRON TECH STOCKS?<p>
WorthJubak : 
FEJersey, I believe Michael Murphy on Micron. He thinks they're a commodity chipmaker. Not good.<p>
Kaypatel   : 
Jim, what do you think about S3? Both of my stocks Diamond Multimedia and S3 are hit very badly. Should I hold or sell?<p>
WorthEdit1 : 
Kaypatel--Jim says he will answer questions about stocks he knows, but will not do buys or sells.<p>
Jshively12 : 
Jim,  any thoughts about Merisel (Computer Reseller)?<p>
Buzzard580 : 
What role does foreign money have in the current "bubble?"<p>
ENavori    : 
Hello Jim, your recent article in Worth was very informative. How about Reits?<p>
WorthJubak : 
ENavori, REITs tend to be interest rate sensitive. I'd look for one without big exposure to offices.<p>
Buzzard580 : 
Will the bubble burst after the election?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Depends on how much of this bubble is related to capital gains tax cut hopes.<p>
Buzzard580 : 
What about Greenspan just protecting his job?<p>
WorthJubak : 
I'm not a big Greenspan fan. I think the Fed's been lucky that Japan tanked.<p>
Buzzard580 : 
But isn't it Japan's money that's keeping interest rates down?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Exactly, so Greenspan's been running a tight money policy at the Fed except for foreign $.<p>
Buzzard580 : 
But if Japan tanked, then where was the lost wealth?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Much of the lost wealth is still on bank balance sheets in Japan for a write-off.<p>
TuckerDg   : 
Jim, Any thoughts on merchant banking funds? Can they beat the market over 5 years? <p>
HPG1       : 
What do you think about Dow Dividend Strategy & "Select 10"?<p>
DewDood    : 
Jim, what are your thoughts on interest rates in the next 12 months?<p>
WorthJubak : 
DewDood, I think rates will probably come down a bit over the next quarter but then head back up.<p>
ENavori    : 
Jim, do you favor any sector of stocks -like oil exploration or refining?<p>
DewDood    : 
Jim, is the economy really picking up?<p>
HomerC226  : 
How do you know when the right time to invest is?<p>
RuthsBill  : 
Entered this room late, did WorthJubak say we are in a bubble?<p>
WorthEdit1 : 
RuthsBill, in the May cover story, Jim writes about fears of a market bubble. You should check out, "Can This Market Be Trusted" in the May issue.<p>
RuthsBill  : 
Thanks, I'll try to get the May issue.<p>
WorthEdit1 : 
You can read the cover story right online, RuthsBill. It appears in the Today window.<p>
TuckerDg   : 
Jim, how 'bout merchant banking?  A lot of cash has been raised in the last 2 years.<p>
WorthJubak : 
How are you thinking about playing merchant banks?<p>
DewDood    : 
Jim, what sectors are up-and-coming?<p>
HChang1000 : 
Hello. Do you think dollar will decline to 110 yen?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Hchang1000: I think the yen is actually stronger than it should be in the short term--12 months.<p>
HChang1000 : 
Thanks , Jim<p>
DewDood    : 
Jim, where do you think the Dow will be at the turn of the century?????<p>
WorthJubak : 
DewDood: you know the rule to success in forecasting--do it often.<p>
Realdonna  : 
Jim:  Think health care is generally a good long term buy and hold considering demographics?<p>
WorthJubak : 
It's hard to bet against an aging US population. But I'd look at some small caps here.<p>
DryClean10 : 
Small caps with a weak dollar? Isn't the thinking the opposite?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Dollar is actually strengthening short term which will hurt the Mercks, Pfizers.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
I probably missed part of this conversation, but has anybody looked at the DJ Utility average? The DJ Utility average has been a great forecasting tool for interest rates and then stocks.<p>
WorthJubak : 
We look at a measure from Investech that tracks utilities and financials--negative signs.<p>
DewDood    : 
Jim, would you weight your long term retirement savings towards blue chips or small caps????<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Small caps, mid-caps, balanced, growth & Income- Depending on time frame.<p>
WorthJubak : 
Pooterputt, what about a mix of bonds and small caps?<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Neg. signs. Gotcha!!  Market looks pretty toppy if economy is beginning to boil<p>
WorthJubak : 
Pooterputt, well I certainly would guess that this is near a top for the brokerage stocks.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Be careful of bonds if not holding to maturity. Values can fluctuate rapidly; is shown 1st quarter.<p>
WorthJubak : 
Pooterputt, sure. But you can build a really efficient portfolio using them and aggressive stocks.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
And, banks?  Only consolidation candidates will outperform if rates stay up. Good point on portfolio to retire.  Just remember to hold bonds to maturity. Small caps go.<p>
WorthJubak : 
I heard Michael Metz recently call banks a zero sum game. Made sense to me.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
PE's pretty rich.  Lot's of consolidation coming. 1995 was a great year if you had 'em. Cash, treasuries, small caps, mid-caps.<p>
WorthEdit1 : 
Jim, you've written about the dangers of a market bubble. What should investors do to prepare?<p>
WorthJubak : 
If it's a bubble those who buy sound companies for reasonable prices will do best.<p>
ENavori    : 
Jim do you mean sound companies with low PEs around 10?<p>
WorthJubak : 
ENavori, I always wonder why good companies trade for PEs of 10. But Intel did not so long ago.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Buy when everybody hates stocks. Sell when everybody loves em.  Now maybe the time!!<p>
WorthJubak : 
It's important to remember too that dividends from stocks have historically helped boost returns.<p>
RDent86967 : 
Jim, what do you think about HCA Columbia as an investment opportunity?<p>
WorthJubak : 
RDent86967, I'd  read a lot of glowing comments on HCA. How rich is the price now?<p>
RDent86967 : 
Sorry, don't know price of HCA, but thanks for comment.<p>
POOTERPUTT :
Total return, meaning dividends & growth will work in any market.
Look at INTEL today. Up 4+.  Has been as low as 52 in the past 60 days. Now 64!! Love it.<p>
WorthJubak : 
Pooterputt, Intel seems to show that long-term investors can profit from the Street's short-term focus.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
You got that right. Own it at 52, Holding for the long-haul. The street hated it. Too cheap.<p>
RTAnders55 : 
Jim, how do you view Latin America--short and long term? By country? As a whole?<p>
WorthJubak : 
RTAnders55: So hard to judge these countries as a whole. Especially when so much risk is political.<p>
JSHDFR     : 
Good question RTAnders--what about Venezuela?<p>
WorthJubak : 
JSHDFR, institutional guys seem to hate Venezuela because the government is trying to control currency movements.<p>
PERCHING   : 
Jim, UHS is at @52, near high, up 87% in 95. What're your thoughts?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Perching: I'm not familiar with that symbol. What's the company?<p>
PERCHING   : 
UHS is Universal Health Services- hospital ownership and management.<p>
JSHDFR     : 
Are you into trading foreign markets as a whole? Is this a viable approach to going global?<p>
WorthJubak : 
JSHDFR, do you  mean trading in and out of countries? Or buying diversified funds?<p>
JSHDFR     : 
Buying diversified funds, thanks.<p>
WorthJubak : 
JSHDFR, I think of foreign investing like small cap US sector. Markets are inefficient. That means $. I like foreign funds where the managers work hard--Templeton, SoGen, for example.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
What's the overall attitude towards financial advisors helping individual investors find the right path to invest?  Comments please. Curious. Survey.<p>
WorthJubak : 
Pooterputt, clarify please.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Is the no-load phase waning? Or do investors really need to be taught how to invest long-term?<p>
Phil517    : 
Any small stock investors here?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Hi Phil517. I love small stocks. Any favorites?<p>
PERCHING   : 
Phil517, look at Cooper Companies, Inc.<p>
I2good1000 : 
Is this a general discussion or can we inquire about specific stocks?<p>
WorthJubak : 
I2good1000, I'm not doing buys and sells but we can certainly talk about individual stocks.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
ThermoCardio Systems. ThermoTrex.  Good small stocks.<p>
I2good1000 : 
Can anyone tell me what they think about SUNW?<p>
MSmith7016 : 
What do you think about REIT's at this time?<p>
WorthJubak : 
MSmith7016, better yields than bonds. I like a fund like Ken Heebner's. Lots of off-beat REITS.<p>
ZALL       : 
I'm a very small investor. Can use any help. Thanks.<p>
DryClean10 : 
Would you put OEX options to hedge in this market? And if so, with what time horizon?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Sure you can hedge with options. I don't think this market is going anywhere for 6 months though.<p>
Phil517    : 
My technique is to buy the best advice I can, and follow it. Right now, OTC Insight.<p>
RSMED41204 : 
Jim, what do you think about Datascope (DSCP)? Thanks.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
WorthJubak- Any themes to look at other than tech, healthcare, telecommunication?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Pooterputt, biotech, online banking and financial services.<p>
DryClean10 : 
How about LEAPS? How do these differ from regular options? Not in terms of their definition but in terms of strategies.<p>
WorthJubak : 
DryClean, I try to keep things simple. Buy stocks. If I want to hedge, buy options.<p>
FundWrap   : 
Jubak...what do you think of Japan?  With interest rates heading up, is this the time to be investing there?<p>
WorthJubak : 
FundWrap: I keep getting disappointed by Japan. Country's financial system is still a mess.<p>
FundWrap   : 
Jubak...agree, but what are you prospects for the next year or so?  Are they near the bottom? Hey Kai.<p>
Kai porter : Hi Mark.<p>
WorthJubak : 
Fundwrap: Have you looked at bank balance sheets in Japan lately?<p>
FundWrap   : 
Jubak...not recently.  However, I suspect that they are full of debt. Of course that is why rates are at 0.5% on the discount rate.<p>
WorthJubak : 
FundWrap: They can't seem to write down bad loans. Last budget was a joke.<p>
FundWrap   : 
Jubak...can't say that they haven't tried : )<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Do you really think on-line banking is for real? Look what happened to PFA kiosks! Crash.<p>
WorthJubak : 
Pooterputt, I'm talking about Microsoft, Intuit, Checkfree, Cybercash, Verifone, etc.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Gotcha!!  What about security problems.  Is the average American ready for cyberbanking?<p>
Gary6854   : 
How do you feel about other Markets i.e. SE. Asia or Pacific Rim?<p>
Phil517    : 
What percentage of an aggressive investor's portfolio should now be in foreign stocks?<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
15<p>
KDull86630 : 
What does anyone think about the IPO market? Still room on the upside?<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
NO, NO. NO IPO. Too hot!!!<p>
WorthJubak : 
Gary6854, I'd watch political risk carefully. Korea and Indonesia could blow--then buy.<p>
DryClean10 : 
Jim, financial journalists always talk about stuff to buy and strategies for buying. But what about strategies for selling?<p>
WorthJubak : 
DryClean, I never buy without knowing what price I'd sell at.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Strategy for selling, "Pigs go to the slaughterhouse, Hogs get slaughtered. Be a PIG!"<p>
DryClean10 : 
Then you'd miss 5x stocks like AOL.<p>
WorthJubak : 
Pooterputt, ...and you've never ridden a stock up and then down again? Netscape?<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Once. Learned my lesson on RYFL. Pick a target. Get there. Reevaluate or sell for next move.<p>
I2good1000 : 
WorthJubak, do you have any opinions on Generic Drugs? Is the market expanding?<p>
WorthJubak : 
12good1000, generics are expanding but stocks can't seem to shake the quality scare  a few years back.<p>
BeachBoyX8 : 
IVAX - king of generics is highly rated.<p>
WorthJubak : 
BeachBoy, what about Mylan?<p>
BeachBoyX8 : 
I don't know -- you're giving the advice.<p>
I2good1000 : 
Mylan hasn't had an FDA approval for the last 3 years, IVAX has 14.<p>
BRAWA      : 
When will the next real bull market be and what will most accurately indicate it?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Brawa, it's hard to imagine a new bull until people hate stocks again.<p>
DChittum   : 
Do you think a person in their twenties should be buying mutual funds or individual stocks?<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Mutual funds if you don't have enough money to diversify.<p>
WorthJubak : 
DChittum,  depends on how much $ you've got and time. You need to have enough $ to diversify.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Sorry WorthJubak. I'll be quiet. This is fun.<p>
BeachBoyX8 : 
Will Social Security ever allow individual selection of our reitrement funds ???<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
BeachBoyx8:  Possibly.  It will take a couple of terms in Congress before we get there.<p>
DChittum   : 
How many stocks would you say is a good diversification? And how many industries?<p>
WorthJubak : 
DChittum, and time. Theoretically at least, mutual fund managers spend lots of time picking stocks.<p>
JSHDFR     : 
Follow up to DChittum--How much is the bare minimum to start to diversify effectively?<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
$25 per month in a mutual fund.  Start somewhere.<p>
WorthJubak : 
DChittum, I tend to start by diversifying by style--small and big caps, growth, value, foreign. If you pick the right stocks you can do it with as few as 10.<p>
BeachBoyX8 : 
Which ten would you recommend today???<p>
I2good1000 : 
WorthJubak, Do fund managers who pick stocks in financial magazines have an ulterior motive?<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Good question, 12good1000.  What about mutual funds too?<p>
WorthJubak : 
12good1000, I'm pretty sure that sometimes they do. I have sensed it doing an interview. Ulterior motive can be to flack their fund--everyone expects that.<p>
KayMS      : 
Any insight on Bally Entertainment?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Stayed in the Bally in Las Vegas a few weeks back. A badly run hotel.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Try some of the no-loads or a selected few of the loaded funds.<p>
DryClean10 : 
How effective is technical analysis in a market that's defied this many rules?<p>
WorthJubak : 
DryClean, many of the best tech analysts I know are in despair about this market's signals.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Yes. But what about the average investor who doesn't know any better and always buys the #1 fund for the preceding 12 months and then can't figure out why they don't have enough savings built up for retirement?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Research shows that buying the best short-term performing fund doesn't work too well.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
I know. But the average reader of financial magazines doesn't know that. Or do they?<p>
Buzzard580 : 
Pooterputt, they ought to know it. It's posted on the darn ad. It says "past performance is no indicator of future blah, blah, blah."<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
But they don't read the fine print. They want the best return. NOW.<p>
WorthJubak : 
To all, P.T. Barnum had a point.<p>
BeachBoyX8 : 
Why does a company buying out another company usually go down in price ???<p>
I2good1000 : 
Beach, dilutes shares and ties up cash.<p>
BeachBoyX8 : 
But also can create additional revenue or value from purchased firm.<p>
MHS85      : 
They only go down when management makes stupid valuation decisions like Mercks $6.5 billion.<p>
WorthJubak : 
MHS85, what about a deal like INCO's purchase of Diamond Fields--high dilution, great future.<p>
DryClean10 : 
So what are the techies doing to compensate for the breakdown in their tools? Going on TV and telling everyone the crash is any day now?<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Scratching their heads.<p>
WorthJubak : 
DryClean, some of them have gone into hiding--at least the shorts like Sullivan and Stack.<p>
WorthJubak : 
DryClean, to Stack's credit though, he's gone back in to rework his model and see what it missed.<p>
I2good1000 : 
Reading Warren Buffett.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
12good1000-Good book huh?<p>
I2good1000 : 
Peter Lynch's are better- except for that pick of Sun TV & Appliances.<p>
WorthJubak : 
12good1000:  What about Au Bon Pain?<p>
I2good1000 : 
Was that a winner? All I remember was how he loved Volvos and disliked IBM.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
WorthJubak- What's your call on the DJIA by 1-1-1997?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Pooterputt, I've dodged that twice tonight. Nice try though.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Come on. Stick your head out a little. I'll go for 5850 by 1-1-1997.<p>
WorthJubak : 
Pooterputt, tax code, tax code, tax code. 401(K)s, IRAs, Keoghs.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Tax code? You mean the lack of capital gains treatment?<p>
MHS85      : 
We'll stick with our call of 6000 this year; you've got no where else to go with your $$$!<p>
WorthJubak : 
MHS85: and as long as everyone believes that the market will be just fine.<p>
MHS85      : 
If the market did what it was supposed to, we could trust the experts.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
What experts?  Common sense tells you we are out of whack. Buzzard-right.<p>
WorthJubak : 
Pooterputt, I can find an expert on any side of the question now.<p>
DryClean10 : 
What are the fundamental things that are making this market different than any other in history?<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Boomers! Boomers! Boomers!<p>
Buzzard580 : 
Foreign $$!<p>
BeachBoyX8 : 
And interest rates are low .<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Not really. Interest rates are up 90 basis points since 1-1-1996. Stocks should react.<p>
Sbbaccarat : 
WorthJubak, what is, do you think, the near and long term outlook for biotech?<p>
WorthJubak : 
I'm going to start winding this down. I'll hang for another 10 minutes or so.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
WorthJubak- Great magazine.  Helps me and investors.<p>
Buzzard580 : 
Pooterputt, you sound like an investor yourself.<p>
BeachBoyX8 : 
Which sectors of the domestic market will be strong for the next year or so????<p>
WorthJubak : 
BeachBoy, what's your economic forecast? Cyclicals if growth is hot. Consumers if it's not.<p>
BeachBoyX8 : 
Moderate growth, I believe.<p>
WorthJubak : 
BeachBoy, sounds like a waffle to me. If that's so, I'd probably go consumers. Drugs, Coke.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
What about a return of retail?  Wal-Mart, Ltd. <p>
MHS85      : 
Common sense tells me that if avoid the Yahoos and get Pfizer, JNJ, and AHP, I can retire.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
You got that right. Yahoo! will be dropping soon after hype dries up. Look at Netscape.<p>
BeachBoyX8 : 
And high tech - that's where I'm heavily leveraged ???<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Beach- Own the good stuff.<p>
WorthJubak : 
BeachBoy, I think it will depend on the tech. Margins are falling. Only the tough will survive.<p>
WorthJubak : 
Pooterputt, I don't own any Netscape, but I use the product. Problem is, I didn't pay for it.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
No kidding. Have you seen the ad on TV about free NetScape software?  I can't remember. What they were talking about specifically?<p>
WorthJubak : 
Pooterputt, you can download it for free all over the net.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Oh. I didn't know that.  Kind of a newby.<p>
ToddBinder : 
I would be mad at NetScape if I bought it, then browsed to their site and saw it for free.<p>
RParg      : 
What will happen to interest rates this year?<p>
Buzzard580 : 
If you think interest rates are going up or down in the next two months, say "up" or "down".<p>
DryClean10 : 
up<p>
WorthJubak : 
Over next 2 months. I'd vote down.<p>
MHS85      : 
If any us knew that, we wouldn't be sitting here typing.<p>
Buzzard580 : 
Touch.<p>
JSHDFR     : 
Up or down? You never can tell. But the indicators seem to show that it is going to go up, I believe.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Interest rates higher through July then down in the fall.<p>
MHS85      : 
Temperatures higher through July; then down in the fall.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Remember the election. Clinton again?<p>
Buzzard580 : 
Gold?<p>
JSHDFR     : 
Last week, Worth's editor said he liked gold. Your thoughts?<p>
MHS85      : 
And if he's right, you'll never hear the end of it, but if he's wrong, it's buried.<p>
WorthJubak : 
JSHDFR, I like the fact that supply is falling and demand rising.<p>
JSHDFR     : 
Yes, but indicator of inflation ahead?<p>
Cathoux    : 
Is there a publication called "Who's Who on Wall Street"?<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
But is inflation going to be the real fuel for gold? Or will a political upheaval be it?<p>
Buzzard580 : 
Clinton is a loser.<p>
DryClean10 : 
Dole will take it home.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Dole?  How about Perot?<p>
BeachBoyX8 : 
Forget politics please !!!!<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Sorry Beach, we had to bring it up because it effects the market.<p>
Buzzard580 : 
And there are many theories related to who's the next prez.<p>
BeachBoyX8 : 
Besides Worth, which financial magazines or journals do you read?<p>
WorthJubak : 
BeachBoy I read Barrons, CA. Tech Stock Letter. Thanks a lot every body for dropping by.  Good night.<p>
WorthEdit1 : 
Thanks you Jim for this lively chat.<p>
JSHFDR  :
Thanks, Jim.<p>
PStan9530  : 
Thanks.<p>
WorthEdit1 : 
And thank you everyone for your great questions.<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
Thanks Jim.<p>
MHS85      : 
Since we all pay homage to the DOW, and IBM's such a big part of it, which way IBM?<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
North on IBM<p>
MHS85      : 
How far north?<p>
POOTERPUTT : 
155-175 over a 2-3 year holding period.<p>
MHS85      : 
Then the DOW does reach 6000!<p>
Buzzard580 : 
Thanks Jim<p>
WorthEdit1 : 
A transcript of this event will be posted in the TODAY window on our opening screen.<p>
BeachBoyX8 : 
Alright- good night !!! <p>

POOTERPUTT : 
See how the theory works.  It's like magic. Ha, Ha.<p>
MHS85      : 
And the good thing about your Bubble article is you have at least a 50-50 chance of being right.<p>
WorthEdit1 : 
MHS85--right! Worth and Worth OnLine's editors would like to hear from you. You can post your questions and comments on our message boards. We check them regularly.

						On Wednesday, April 10, Worth's editor, John Koten, joined Worth OnLine for a live CONFERENCE CALL. During the hour-long chat show, Koten discussed the market, investing, and the economy with readers. <p>
WorthEdit1 : 
We are pleased to have Worth's editor, John Koten with us here tonight.<p>
ConsultLar : 
Good evening<p>
JohnK333   : 
Hi.  JohnK333 is my screen name.<p>
WorthEdit1 : 
John, let me start off the discussion by bringing up a topic I'm sure is on everyone's mind. With the recent market mahem, many are wondering, as the May cover story asks, "Should This Market Be Trusted?"<p>
JohnK333   : 
There's good reason to be worried about the market right now.<p>
ConsultLar : 
This may be a significant momentum shift.<p>
JohnK333   : 
We have been in the midst of a historic runnup in stock prices.  There's rarely been anything like it. It's fairly easy to understand how we got to where we are.  A lot of the runnup has also occurred amidst a long-term secular decline in interest rates. 
But now, it looks like the decline in interest rates is bottoming out.  So the question is, can the market keep going up, or is it already overvalued?<p>
ConsultLar : 
Some parts of the market are like Vegas.<p>
SSGuest    : 
It's foreign money that is keeping the US afloat.<p>
JohnK333   : 
I agree with SSGuest, to an extent.  One thing that is keeping the market up...or has been...has been the lack of a better place to put it. And that is really the big question everyone faces right now.  The stock market is sky high.  But where is a better place to go?<p>
JSHDFR     : 
What do you think about prospects in Europe?<p>
JohnK333   :
I am less than excited about Europe. European business is about ten years behind what has been happening in this country.<p>
JSHDFR     : 
Do you agree with Rogers, then, that Africa is the place to go?<p>
JohnK333   : 
I would only go to Africa on Safari.<p>
ConsultLar : 
People have shot memories and want 20-30% returns to keep going.<p>
Matt5001  :
If the US stock market resembles Vegas, where does that put "emerging markets"?<p>
SSGuest  :
Does that mean we can play the European markets like it's 1986?<p>
JMoff0456:
I have heard the Pacific rim, minus Japan, is a good investment. <p>
JohnK333   :
I think Jim Rogers may be right. But I think it would require a huge amount of homework to know the best places to put your money. SSGuest-I would, to an extent. I think Europe is going to be a great investment down the road. But I think Japan may be a very good place to go. I think it will move up faster and sooner than Europe. But there are still big banking problems to work out in Japan. That seems easier, to me, though, than a major revolution in the way of doing business that Europe still needs to go through. <p>
JSHDFR  :
Do you see all of Asia as a good place to invest, or just Japan?<p>
JohnK333  :
I like a lot of Asia. I think it is a better place to go than Europe. <p>
DDWARE  :
How about Thailand?<p>
JohnK333  :
I don't know enough about Thailand to answer your question. I just sent a reporter to Thailand to find out more about it, though.<p>
DDWARE  :
Thanks.<p>
ConsultLar :
What about investing in bonds?<p>
JohnK333  :
We have a good column in the latest issue by Susan Lee about how to invest in bonds. <p>
ConsultLar  :
Thanks.<p>
SSGuest  :
Do you think the Commerce department will survive Ron Brown's death? And does it matter?<p>
JohnK333  :
I am not sure how well the Commerce Department will survive Bill Clinton.<p>
ConsultLar : 
John any specifics here at home, "invest in what you know"?<p>
JohnK333   : 
I can't talk about specific stocks for reasons that only Worth's lawyers can explain. And nothing I say should be construed as personal investment advice.  I don't know your individual needs well enough.<p>
ConsultLar :
Understand.<p>
GeorgeJW   : 
I've heard mixed reviews on health care, Baxter etc. What are your thoughts?<p>
DDWARE     : 
How about specific industries?<p>
ConsultLar : 
But what about market sectors?<p>
BEAN11163  : 
HI JohnK. You guys are doing a great job at Worth.<p>
JohnK333   : 
Thank you, Bean.
Regarding sectors or areas. Jeff Vinik is now making a huge bet on mid-cap stocks.<p>
BEAN11163  : 
Is Fidelity Megellan engaging in market timing?<p>
JohnK333   : 
Bean.  I think so, yes.<p>
Mmcnally1  : 
Will mutual fund holders ever panic out of the market and at what level of the Dow will they?<p>
JohnK333   : 
I think two things will stop fund investors from a panic.  1. Stubborness. 2.  The fact that so much money is now coming into funds through 401(k) programs.
At the big fund companies....as much as half of the money they are getting comes from defined benefit programs.<p>
JOglejr    : 
What do you think will happen with telecomm stocks, specifically BellSouth?<p>
BBryant527 : 
I don't know, can I trust this market????<p>
WorthEdit1 : 
Sorry, JOglejr, John has explained that he cannot answer questions about specific stocks or the Worth lawyers will come after him.<p>
RHalp56026 : 
But isn't the stock market beginning to look like a confidence game?<p>
JohnK333   : 
RHalp56026--How long can this market ignore soaring commodities?
By the way, I am not saying that I think the market will go up or down.  I wouldn't want to insult anyone's intelligence in this room.
What I mean: No one really knows what the stock market is going to do next. And I wouldn't believe anyone who says otherwise.<p>
BEAN11163  : 
Is it not the policy of Fidelity to not engage in market timing?<p>
JohnK333   : 
Bean.....it depends upon how you define market timing.<p>
Mitzrayim  : 
John, do you think bonds and stocks can de-couple? When?<p>
JohnK333   : 
Stocks and bonds are going to have to decouple if the market is going to go higher over the coming year.<p>
Phil517    : 
Having survived 10/87, I think it's the pro's who'll panic, not us little guys.  Agree JohnK?<p>
Mitzrayim  : 
Having survived 1974, it looks like 1974 is starting again.<p>
DINAROB    : 
Mitz--why?<p>
SteveS3184 : 
1974--oil embargo--the start of hyperinflation...not really like today.<p>
JohnK333   : 
I agree that there is a lot of reason to be pessimistic.  I thought the market would wait until after the election to crash.  But in some ways, I think, the election may already be over.<p>
Bugsy40    : 
John, Hi. Who will be the better president for the market: Clinton or Dole?<p>
JohnK333  :
I think Clinton is going to win. I don't think Dole offers enough of an alternative. I also think it is hard to tell what Clinton is going to be like as a lame duck.<p>
BEAN11163  :
Oh god.<p>
DINAROB   :
Any thoughts about the retail sector?<p>
OligoNuk  :
Is the market on a fault line--have we felt tremors or is the worse yet to come?<p>
STOUFFMAN  : 
John are you recommending to pull out of stocks?<p>
JohnK333   : 
I think whether or not you want to be in stocks depends upon your time horizon. I would not want to be in stocks--at least not heavily--for money that I needed a year from now. I would stay in stocks if I had a long-term time horizon. I also would pay a lot of attention to my portfolio right now--making sure that the stocks that I hold represent good values in terms of the company's fundamentals.<p>
K3321   : 
The baby boomers must stay fully invested if the majority expect to have enough money to retire.<p>
BBryant527  :
John, are you currently bullish on the present market or not?<p>
JohnK333   : 
For the short term...the best place to go is in a bank CD.  That's for all time horizon's up to one year. <p>
OligoNuk  :
When is that bill going to go through that lowers capital gains taxes?<p>
Mitzrayim :
Oligo, never.<p>
BEAN11163  :
Right again, Mitz.<p>
JohnK333  :
The capital gains tax cut looks dead right now. Which I think is really bad news. <p>
BEAN11163  : 
John K, if Magellan is market timing, then Vinik is pretty Bearish.<p>
K3321      : 
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.<p>
JohnK333   : 
K3321--you are correct. It is the only chance they have of earning a great retirement. Vinik is bearish. He has been since the end of last year. <p>
BBryant527   :
Which investing styles could be winners in the present market?<p>
JohnK333   :
I'll answer BBryant's question. I think fundamental investing is a really good approach right now...and there are two things I would pay a lot of attention to. First, I think historic price-to-earnings ratios are a good thing to look at when valuing stocks in this market. A good idea might be to avoid any stock rating at a price-earnings ratio above its highest average annual p/e ratio going back to, say, 1979. Second, set a target price at which you will sell the stock. You can do this by estimating the annual growth rate for the companies earnings over the next five years by using a source like Value Line. Take that figure an apply it to per share earnings. Use the historic price-to-earnings ratios I mentioned before to caluculate how high the stock might get if future earnings grow as expected and if the market rewards the stock with a high p/e. Basically, that's your new target selling price.
Of course, you need to monitor the numbers along the way to make sure your target still makes sense, or if you need to readjust the caluculation.<p>
BBryant527 : 
OK, so you would look for stocks with low P/Es relative to where they have traded in the last 20 years? Sounds like very reasonable advice. Thanks much.<p>
Mitzrayim  : 
JohnK, what about if inflation heats up?  Doesn't that change the whole ball game?<p>
JohnK333   : 
Yes....inflation would change the whole ball game. It would cause interest rates to rise....Greenspan to throw on the brakes.  And the stock market to tumble.  Commodities prices are sending a warning right now about inflation. But they don't gurantee a return of inflation. Because they don't account for as big a percentage of what we buy as they used to. And because they will have to rise a lot before things get so expensive that workers start asking for pay increase.<p>
JSHDFR     : 
Will you post this chat tomorrow like you did with Nawrocki's? I missed a part. Thanks.<p>
WorthEdit1 : 
JSHDFR--yes, we post the transcripts of all our chats. Thanks for coming by!<p>
OligoNuk   : 
So it looks like gold might be a good investment after all?<p>
KADAB      : 
JOHNK...When do you see interest rates falling again?<p>
JohnK333   : 
I don't really see interest rates coming down significantly for a long time.<p>
KADAB      : 
Thanks.<p>
Mitzrayim  : 
JohnK, if "they" don't account for as big a percentage of what we buy, than the increases in commodity prices will be more easily absorbed-- leading to higher prices, no?<p>
JohnK333   : 
Mitz...I am not quite sure I understand your question.<p>
Mitzrayim  : 
JohnK, if corn only makes up a small part of a loaf of bread, than an increase in corn prices would be more easily passed along, leading to even higher corn prices - maybe?<p>
JohnK333   : 
No.  Mitz, I think that because higher commodity prices will be more easily absorbed...prices of finished goods will not rise as much. We didn't raise the price of the magazine when paper prices shot up.<p>
Mitzrayim  : 
JohnK, if demand for finished goods does not decrease, won't prices on finished goods continue to rise?<p>
RalphH6397 : 
Johnk333 you didn't have to as subscriptions increased.<p>
Oilstar    : 
That's because Peter Lynch took a pay cut to absorb the paper cost increase!<p>
JohnK333   : 
We don't pay Peter Lynch at all.<p>
Jplank1    : 
Thanks, JohnK for the chat and good advice.<p>
JohnK333   : 
You are welcome Jplank1.<p>
DwightB620 : 
JohnK333...would you say that it is still a good time to roll over in to stock mutual funds?<p>
JohnK333   : 
I think it is still a good time to be in stocks if you have a time horizon of longer than 1 or 2 years.<p>
RalphH6397 : 
JohnK333--comment on the role of money supply on inflation worries. Doesn't seem to be a problem.<p>
TOWERAM    : 
JohnK333, How much of the current market environment is being driven by hedge fund speculation vs fundamental issues?<p>
RalphH6397 : 
TOWERAM, my guess is more than we realize.<p>
REH1059449 : 
JohnK -- where do you stand re load vs. no-load?<p>
JohnK333   : 
I like no-load funds a lot better than load funds.  Very few fund managers can earn the loads they charge giving better performance.<p>
REH1059449 : 
John -- doesn't it make more sense to evaluate funds by LT performance and not expenses which are included in the performance stats?<p>
JohnK333   : 
Yes....REH1. Still, over time....the expenses tend to eat into the returns.<p>
JWatk28989 : 
John333, do you feel think that the global market is more positive than the U.S. based on recent<p>
JohnK333   : 
I think the U.S. market is still more positive than the global market. But I think the global market will beat the U.S. over really long time horizons....like 10-15 years.<p>
JWatk28989 : 
Thanks.<p>
GarySpFc   : 
JohnK333,  How do the various international regions look in the near term?<p>
FINPOWNEWS : 
What is the overall view of the Dow Thursday and Friday?<p>
JohnK333  :
I would say people are nervous about the Dow...for Thursday and Friday.  This hasn't been a good week.<p>
DwightB620 : 
JohnK333...Do you predict the end of the Bull Market direction soon?<p>
Hathgolf   : 
After 3--how do you see the next 2 weeks with all the earnings coming?<p>
JohnK333   : 
Some people think the market is going to 6500 soon.  I think it will get there, but I now think it may take longer than most market analysts think. And I think it may drop aways below where it is now before it rises again.<p>
JFlynn4940 : 
Isn't it a good time for global funds?<p>
JohnK333   : 
It is a good time for global funds if you are really scared about the very short-run for the U.S. markets or if you want to invest for the very long haul.<p>
Peretz42   : 
What do you think of gold?<p>
JohnK333   : 
I think gold is a good long term investment because of high worldwide demand for gold.<p>
StephenKoc : 
What do think of the energy sector?<p>
JJohnK333   : 
I like the energy sector.  I wouldn't be surprised to see higher oil prices given. What other commodity prices are doing right now?<p>
TSAD700    : 
Any thoughts on options market such as sugar or crude?<p>
JohnK333   : I can't give advice here about the options markets.  You need to be a daily player to mess with that stuff.<p>
FINPOWNEWS : 
What about 7% on the bonds tommorrow. Which way once line is crossed will it head?<p>
JohnK333   : 
Back in 72, higher grain prices were the first sign of rising inflation. Oil prices came second--although everyone only remembers the high oil prices.<p>
TOWERAM    : 
72-74 inflation was sparked by oil.<p>
DwightB620 : 
Thank you JohnK333 for your input and time!<p>
Cymbion    : 
JohnK...too much money chasing little earnings growth=much volatility?  Next year's outlook?<p>
JohnK333   : 
Stock prices are probably ahead of earnings now.  I agree.<p>
GarySpFc   :
JohnK333,  I'm still curious as to your thoughts as to what will happen when mainland China takes over Hong Kong?<p>
JohnK333   : 
Regarding China.  I don't know.<p>
HPHolcomb  : 
John, what's your prediction on interest rates?<p>
JohnK333   : 
I already gave a prediction on interest rates. The general direction is up.<p>
TOWERAM    : 
Again, what is your justification for higher rates?<p>
Matt5001   : 
Toweram, two words: Alan and Greenspan.<p>
JohnK333   : 
From here on out.  I think the long-term decline in interest rates has pretty much run its course. Also...right now Greenspan has no political incentive to do anything, to stimulate the economy.  He's a guy who believes in zero inflation.  And we still don't have that!<p>
RYackee    : 
What stock would you buy right now for a wild flyer?<p>
JohnK333   : 
If you want to find a wild flyer read the feature on the search for the next Microsoft in our June issue....coming to your homes and newsstands soon. I also think microcap stocks are a good place to look for wild flyers.<p>
Dan WRBQ   : 
John, is now a good time to sell some shares in stock funds to raise 50% cash?<p>
JohnK333   : 
Dan WRBQ--Maybe.....I would say if you are older...yes.  If you are young, I'd just stay in the market and ride it out.<p>
JohnK333   : 
I'd like to thank everyone for coming here tonight.  I'd like to do this more often and figure out a way to answer so many different questions all at the same time. Your questions have been very stimulating and thoughtful.  Exactly what I expect of people who read our magazine.<p>

						Recently William E. Holzer, Managing Director of Scudder, Stevens & Clark, Inc., Boston, spoke to a group of investors about "Global Investing into the Year 2000." The event, which took place on April 9 in Boston, was sponsored by Worth and Giorgio Armani. Following is a transcript from the presentation:<p>
Missy Godfrey: Good evening. Thank you, thank you. My name is Missy Godfrey, and I'm the publisher of Worth magazine. On behalf of everyone at Worth, I'd like to welcome you this evening. I'd like to thank everyone at Armani for entertaining us in this spectacular space, it really is quite lovely. We're very pleased to be part of this program. For those of you who are familiar with Worth magazine, you know that we pride ourselves on bringing you financial intelligence each and every month. We particularly enjoy bringing all that to life when we can--to bring the experts to you live and bring our readers together to share in their insights. <p>
And it is with great pleasure this evening that we bring you one of the true experts in the field. We'll be hearing William Holzer, who is the managing director of Scudder, Stevens and Clark. He is the product leader for the firm's global investment products, overseeing the firm's management of global mandate portfolios. He is the lead portfolio manager of the firm's global products and a member of the firm's currency committee. As I mentioned, he is one of the all-stars in the field. I'm sure that's why you all came out this evening. And so, without further ado, I'd like to introduce William Holzer. Welcome.<p>
William Holzer: 
Thank you for that kind introduction, and it's very nice to be with you all this evening. I have a few comments, but before that, I thought that I would share something: When I was a little boy, my father told us the story, he comes from southern Germany, and he told us the story about the local baker's shop. The local baker Mr. Katzenberger took on a new apprentice. And the new apprentice was as keen as mustard, and he completed all his tasks in double-quick time and always reported back to the baker and said, "Mr. Katzenberger, what can I do now, Mr. Katzenberger, what can I do now?" And he'd send him off and make him clean the windows or take inventory, etc. . . and it went on for quite a while, until eventually the baker lost his temper and said, "Go hang your backside out of the window!" And with that, the apprentice disappeared. But he came back some hours later and the baker said, "Where have you been?" and he said, "I did what you told me to do." And the baker said, "No." And he said, "What did the people say?" And he said, "Oh why they said, 'Good morning, Herr Katzenberger.'" <p>
I guess the relevance of that, if there is any relevance at all, is that I was hanging out in my office reading the newspaper, when somebody dropped by and said, "Willie, it's time for you to think global, forget about all this international stuff. Think global." And I guess that was a challenge. Tonight I've been asked to talk about the global outlook through the year 2000. <p>
Of course, it's always best to take one's cue from history, and I thought I'd step back a little while to put the foundations down for the talk, and I'd start in the middle ages and do well. Back then, when people came off the land, when there was an agricultural surface that allowed them to do so, they went to live in cities so they could specialize in trades to become candle makers or carpenters or whatever. And if they did that one thing all day, they could be more productive. And to do that all day, they needed their food, their bakers near, their better stores nearby so they didn't have to interrupt their work. So the village or the town was the unit organization that supported the economies, the expert economies, in the state of the day. <p>
And then we got steel works and textile mills, so we needed countries, because they need bigger markets. Then we got the United States where they put down, I guess in 1861, the Union Pacific Railroad which linked both coasts. So you could get in the age of the railroads, all the products -- the wheat and the iron and steel -- around the country, and you could have an integrated market once one other thing happened: once you had financial markets, the commodity market in Chicago, the financial markets in Boston and New York. <p>
Now, the markets generated prices and the prices told the producers what the consumers wanted and the prices told the entrepreneurs what the investors wanted. So you had the perfect setup here, so that the United States could exploit the economies of scale of the day, because they had information, because prices are information. And if you want to understand that, think about Russia. In Russia, they have no market, therefore they have prices, therefore they have no information and in the end of course, they've got no economy. <p>
So now we've come a long way down the road, to perhaps a few years ago. Now, something else has happened, the technology has moved on. So what are the technologies that are relevant? What is the unit of organization that exploits those economies? Our answer is that it's all about telecommunications and computers and the type of organization that exploits the economies of scale that those technologies offer: it is the global corporation, which quite simply, is the corporation that is organized to produce anywhere, to sell anywhere and to raise capital anywhere. <p>
So, that was easy, that was just one morning's work at the desk. The first morning. The conclusion was, that all we needed to do was look around the world and find out which were the corporations that were organized globally or that were growing themselves in that way, because those would prove to be the best investments. And kind of a funny thing happened then. We got the list together, and the list all spoke English. The great global corporations of the world, and think of the one's that you're familiar with, they all speak English. Even the Swedish ones, if you go to visit them, business is done in English. US companies, UK companies, Australian companies, even New Zealand had a couple, New Zealand has 3.5 million people and 62 million sheep and they can still boast a global corporation, which is more than plenty of European corporations could boast. <p>
What was the explanation? The first explanation was that these places had inhospitable home bases, all English-speaking countries have loads of inflation, people consume too much, they import too much and they're fairly skilless people in general. But that didn't wash, we took it a step further and really the answer is a little bit philosophical. But what the answer is, is that these are the countries of the world where the rights of the individual are paramount. And where the rights of the individual are paramount, you let them speak through the marketplace so they generate prices and information. And that optimizes the production of goods. <p>
So, what about the other places in the world? Think about the places in the world that are not like the United States. Where obligation and duty are the dominating philosophy. Where they keep all their savings safely at home, they don't use it to consume stuff and import stuff, yet they insist on exporting stuff and inflation is definitely a no-no. And those places are the places that don't have global corporations. <p>
So far, we've established the definitions so we can go forward and the definitions are: The global corporation that can do anything, anywhere. And these two types of countries in this one global world, and we'll characterize those types of countries as the Light side, and let that be us; and we'll characterize the other types of countries where duty and obligation and where the politicians and the bureaucrats allocate the resources, not the marketplace, as the Dark side; and think about the world that way. <p>
So let's go to the year 2000 now. Think about change from here. Let's do two types of change, let's do quick-paced change and slow-paced change. Let's think about the slow one first. The thing that drives the world through this price mechanism where people speak freely to the producers and the entrepreneurs is what people want and value most. The group that's most powerful is going to make its voice felt most greatly. <p>
In the '80s, it was the Yuppies, the population bulge, and it wasn't restricted to the United States but it also goes for Europe and, in a modified form, Japan also. They all wanted their houses at the same time, so it inflated the price of the houses and then they went to the bank and leveraged those houses and filled them full of consumer goodies, and that's what created the great demand for the Japanese producers and those with a lot of the imports that we took in, of course, cars and VCRs and all the rest. Now, think about those people. They were a little bit older, what did they want most? My guess is that they want a healthy, wealthy retirement, and to get that, they'll have to save more, if they save more, they have to spend less. Think about that, that's important when you consider the state of the world today, because the great wave of money that's coming to the Mutual Fund industry, doesn't necessarily represent new savings, it represents the move of liquidity from bank deposits into long term investments. <p>
The United States saves 4 percent of GDP and the house rides along. The house inflation looked after people's savings and financial welfare and now the inflation they created for themselves in the stock market is doing the same. And if we do save, where are we going to apply the savings? Well, of course, that's why we reinvented the emerging markets that we used to call the LDCs (the Lesser Developed Countries). We've given them a new name. And we need them. Why? Because if we're not spending, we need somebody to do that spending, and they've got the mirror-image demographics. They've got young people that want their first marketplace job, that want their first sets of material possessions. There's a beautiful match here. But you need a matchmaker of course. In former times, the banks tried to be the matchmaker and recycle the Petrol dollars into those parts of the world to get them to grow. And, having worked as a credit analyst, I know how efficient we were at getting that money down to Latin America. <p>
The catch was, of course, that we never got any of the principle back and that's why the thing never worked. But we're trying again now, and we've got these global corporations that can get the money out of global markets, and get the money into those places. We've got managements to make sure they don't rip the money off and stick it in Swiss bank accounts, but actually put the factories up. And these managements are responsible to shareholders. So that tells you a little bit about the next few years, I hope. And there's another thing, the one that I referred to earlier, fast-moving change. And that's why you've got to understand the difference between the Light side of the world and the Dark side of the world. Because, on the Light side of the world, that's where all the inventiveness is, where you unleash the possibilities of the individual. <p>
The analysts dragged me kicking and screaming to Silicon Valley, and it's an amazing place. It's like the center of the world, these people know no limits to the amount of technology they can unleash. They know no limits to distance or commercial possibilities. And these are people, the managements, that come from all over the place; they're not just Americans, but they're people that come to live and work there, to participate in this huge amount of wealth creation. But of course, the wealth creation isn't a gift. What goes with it is wealth destruction. We have to free-up the resources to give these new companies that are being born. And that's socially disruptive and we create companies in garages and they compete with other companies in garages, and I guess some of the garages eventually fall down. <p>
Now, to understand the Dark side, what they do, well, they approach a little bit differently because they've got different relationships to one another, different obligations, as we mentioned earlier. And I guess they're not too inventive, historically. A Japanese analyst, I guess he nearly fell down dead when I said, "The last thing the Japanese invented was the tea ceremony," and it wasn't meant to be an offensive comment, but I guess what the process is, is observing what is happening on the Light side of the world and seeing what succeeds and what fails, and selecting the best of things, then allocating to the selective few. The bureaucrats they say, "You NEC or you Fujitsu, you can develop this chip or this computer," or in Germany, perhaps tell the big rich electricity companies that they can develop the new telephone systems. That's very efficient, it can be done without laying people off, they can be moved within an organization, and this is a very efficient way to run a society of course. <p>
Now, the other part of it that's not so good, let's keep within the argument's bounds, is that the bureaucrats and the politicians call the shots. They don't listen to the marketplace, and then the marketplace doesn't speak, and the marketplace can't receive those global signals that allow one to exploit the economies of being global. The economies are scared of being global. That's a problem, so that's where we find ourselves today, with the United States having a huge bull market, where it's unleashed the technologies, it's benefited by reallocation of resources from the old companies as they wind up and sell assets, and that money is transferred through the stock markets to the great new company. But that has largely taken place and they've been watching and they're beginning to see what the possibilities are, and I would submit that these are the places in the world where there are great possibilities of appreciation, stock markets, if one takes the four or five year view. <p>
It said on the little piece of paper I received, that I would be shown around the store when I arrived here, and I was and it's a beautiful place. And it reminds me of when Einstein went to heaven, being such a special guest, he was met by some people and they introduced him to some fellows and these fellows said, "meet Mr. A, he's got an IQ of 350," and Einstein said, "Mm, we must talk about theology some time," and they went on and introduced him to individual B, with an IQ of 250, "Oh we must talk about thermonuclear dynamics a little bit when I've got a moment," and they went on a little further and he met individual C, with an IQ of about 50-60, and Einstein says, "Hello, pleased to meet you, how'd the stock market do today?"<p>
So I don't know too much about the future, but a little analysis that I've gone through suggests to me as a global investor that companies that look around the world and harvest savings as people change their lifestyles, will prosper, they organize themselves well. It strikes me that companies in any industry, that organize themselves to do business globally will do very well. It strikes me that emerging markets must succeed. If we're not going to consume, they must consume. Who knows how mature their political infrastructures are, how well they can absorb the cash they take in. <p>
But, just as we saw the meltdown in Mexico in 1994, that was followed by a second wave of money, admittedly donated by Mr. Clinton, but of course, he understood there was more to lose by Mexico going under. And that was proved true time and time again, until the experiment works, I guess. Over the next few years, I think the Dark side countries may have better investment policies, especially Germany, where there is huge hidden wealth in their stock market, where they're only beginning to do the rationalization of their big old companies, that we embarked upon in the UK. and in the United States fifteen or twenty years ago. They've got new technologies to pick up and bolt on to their old outdated technologies.<p>
I thank you very much for your attention.<p>
Q:
You mentioned Mexico. Mexico seems to be a scenario where everything gets worse and worse. Do you think we've reached the bottom in Mexico or do you think at some point there will be another grey cloud or perhaps a silver lining? <p>
A:
That's a big question. My analysis of Mexico in the broader sense, would be that they have very much a Dark side economy, an elitist economy in which a small group of people harvest most of the fruit. And, a lot of that fruit is not reinvested in Mexico, but reinvested in other places. It's therefore difficult for me to understand how they will achieve self-sustaining growth. They've had a number of chances, if one goes back through history. The second point would be that its culture is dominated by a thought process that gold and land represent wealth, and if you invest your profits in gold and land, they don't create further production, and they don't create further demand. So, I find it very difficult to understand that Mexico as a country can have a self-sustaining dynamic. I can, however, understand that there is abundant labor that is considerably less expensive than that here, and we will want to take advantage of that, as corporate investors. Do we think that the thing has gotten to the bottom? If one can assume that the politics of Mexico will remain stable, it probably would have. I don't make any assumptions on the politics in Mexico given incidents that are reported. <p>
Q:
Would you comment on the dollar in the next five years? <p>
A:
In the introduction, it was mentioned that I'm on the currency committee, but it wasn't mentioned why I'm on the currency committee. I'm on the currency committee because I opened my mouth and said I didn't think anybody could forecast currencies, to which they said, "Right, you're on the committee, get to it." The idea that I mentioned earlier that people in the United States will tend, on balance, to save more in the future than they have in the past. That should bode well for the dollar, which starts at a very cheap base in a global context, and if the general health of the corporations in the United States is an indicator, that would support the argument. So, if I had to bet, I would tell you that the US. dollar would be a stronger currency. <p>
Q:
You were talking a while about Germany, and I'm not quoting, about an untapped resource, or what might be happening there? Could you indulge me a little about what you think might be happening? What do you think is happening in the German corporate sector, the stock market?<p>
A:
My appreciation of it, is Germany understands that the way that it's run its economy in the past, is not a suitable way of running the economy in the future.  In the past, they had huge personal savings in the household sector which were redirected through the system to pay for the absorption of East Germany. Therefore, they no longer feel quite as comfortable with their future as they did before and they have further concerns; their population is aging very rapidly indeed, and they have the implicit demand somewhere to create jobs in those eastern countries. Why? Because if they don't, a lot of those people would like to live in Germany, and have the right to, and that would put a strain on their social security systems. So, they realize they must change, but creating a consensus in a big country like that is difficult and takes a long time. The Bundesbank understands this and says we must deregulate this economy, not lower interest rates to create jobs, but that will take a while. <p>
Meanwhile, the corporate sector has understood what's at stake. Why? Because they compete with other global corporations, Byron Hertz competes with Dow and DuPont and ICI and all the rest in the world, and they can't let the rest of these companies get ahead by having access to global capital markets, and let the whole thing slip and slide. So they've watched what the Swiss are doing. The Swiss in their own quiet little way have made rapid progress in changing a culture that was very, very dark and hid everything and didn't have open accounting, or what used to appeal to global investors. <p>
Why? Because everybody from Latin America hid their money in Switzerland, and they had interest free deposits from wars going back to the Napoleonic war, but things changed. The corporations got so big, the Sandover, the Ceiba-Geigy, and the Nestle's of this world, they realized the Swiss capital market was longer big enough. They were global corporations, that appealed to global capital markets. <p>
And they've opened themselves up to investors, "we'll give you the information, you can assess the prospects and you'll probably like what you see." And they've done this and it's been beneficial to stop. And the Germans, who are only a little way down the once polluted Rhine from Oslo have seen it and they're making their move. And the German stock market is fascinating because it represents not the German economy, but it represents the technologies of the 1950's and 60's, the airlines, the department stores, the plumbing companies, they're all technologies that are pass and they understand that they must come up to date, and they are doing the reorganization and restructuring, and it's just begun. <p>
Q:
Are there any emerging markets that we or I do not like? The second part of the question is do we take a top-down approach to assessment of those countries and those investment possibilities?<p>
A:
The first part of the answer is, that Mommy said, if you can't speak well of somebody, don't speak of them at all. The second part of the answer is probably more interesting, because it's a topic with which I and, I guess, we struggle. You know, they're emerging markets, because since time began, they've always failed so far. And they used to be called LDC's (Lesser Developed Countries) so, what's going to make them successful now, just because investors throw money at them? Will they be socially and politically mature enough to usefully employ that money, to recirculate it, to create a demand for the next set of capital investments in those places? That's a very challenging question. So the top-down approach says you do evaluate the social maturity of those places, of their approach. So, that's one observation. <p>
A second observation that might be useful is to remember where this money is coming from. This capital is coming from our savings, and we get it there in one of two ways: either through global portfolios, for example, where we can choose from around the world, or through global companies, Proctor & Gamble or Coca-Cola, and they can look at these places and assess the risks and reward implicit in the investment, and I would suggest to you that when Coca-Cola or Proctor & Gamble or IBM goes to the negotiating table with the governments of X, Y, Z little country in Latin America or Asia, the negotiating power lies with the global corporation, and they will seek to invest there, in order to get out more than they take in. <p>
If that's true, how do you successfully develop an emerging market? I don't know the answer, but it was part of the question, and let me give you the favorite one we have is South Korea. Now, that got started on a shoestring as the US left the money because of the Cold War. But once that initial impetus had been created, it's been a closed economy. They don't welcome foreign investment, they try to repel it. Because if they create something good and something that will prosper, they'll want it themselves, of course. So to invite all comers to buy your assets doesn't indicate much good faith in your own assessment of your own chances, does it? So, that closed economy thrives because all the surplus that's created in the productive process is channeled back to capital investment. The main idea to invest every little, and they don't care where the money comes from, as long as it's capital investment, and they've climbed that technological ladder from sneakers and textiles, right to the point where Samsung's the world's leading top producer, and that's one market. <p>
And, I guess China does some interesting things that hold promise. They don't just sit down at the negotiating table with the first guy who shows up, they always invite one from Europe, one from the US and one from Japan. And they chisel them down, so there isn't enough left over that perhaps they can retain something. They've got a very Dark side regime, I don't think we need reminding. So, perhaps that'll work. But we shouldn't be over-optimistic or over-simple about the possibilities, we're riding the crest of the wave, and we shouldn't mix up fashion with good investment.<p>
Q:
Would you share your opinion on the Japanese market economy?<p>
A:
The assessment is that in the 30 or 40 years since the second world war, the formula that made that an unbelievably successful achievement in terms of physical wealth creation, that formula no longer works. Why? Because, they've become such a big portion of the total of the global economy, they therefore need another formula. The other formula would be because they are so large to be an integral part of the global economy. To achieve that, a couple of things, kind of big things, have got to happen. Firstly, the old ways have got to give ways to the new ways, and a younger generation with a different outlook has got to take the helm. And, that's the beginning. It's easy when one interviews government officials, there used to be an old grey and indulgent double-talk, now they're young and to the point when they address comments to you. That's so one can have a changing in the order in the bureaucracy in the political sphere, and that seems to be going kind of slowly. <p>
The other thing that's got to happen, is Japan has got to integrate itself into the global markets. But of course, the Yen is so high and prices are so high in Japan, that if they did that, prices of a lot of things would go down very quickly and cause a lot of distress. Vested interests wouldn't be too pleased. So, now for that to happen certainly would be disastrous for everybody concerned. So, it's got to happen over a long period. So we're going through a multiyear adjustment process as Japan invents its formula and caters to the new circumstances. <p>
Q:
The West German shared stock prices have been doing quite well in the last 12 months, you say.<p>
A:
It's the very first step in a long process that will go a long way, there's lots of hidden wealth, there's lots of reserves upon which to draw. I went some years ago, to the Munich Reinsurance Company in Munich, and we visited them in their head office which looked like a palace, it was such a beautiful building. And, I commented that they must indeed have taken over an old palace, and he said, "No, we had these headquarters built in 19 something-or-other for the company when it was established," and I said, "Well, was it in the balance sheet?" He said, "Oh, it's been written down to one Mark," and I said, "What, one Deutschmark?", and he said, "No, one Reich mark." <p>
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. <p>
Missy Godfrey: And who said finance can't be entertaining? That was more than entertaining though, I think it was informative and insightful for everyone. I hope you all enjoyed it as much as I certainly did, sharing in his information, and the intelligence that he brings to his investing. <p>
Good night.

						<font size=4><b><i>BALLPARK FIGURES</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						Tuesday, April 2, 1996, Worth OnLine columnist Tom Nawrocki chatted with readers live during CONFERENCE CALL: BALLPARK FIGURES. The one and one-half hour event covered topics ranging from paying college athletes to boycotting stadium concession stands. Follows is a transcript of this event. <p>
WorthEdit1 : 	
We are very pleased to have Worth OnLine columnist Tom Nawrocki with us tonight. Tom has written about everything from office betting pools to interleague play in his online-exclusive column, "Ballpark Figures." In fact, Tom, you had a rather controversial stand on the interleague play issue. Why did you think it was a pointless gesture?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
The marquee matchups between, say, the Yanks and Mets will take place every three years. Most of the interleague games will be of the Expos/Rangers or Pirates/Twins variety. These don't promise to be any more popular than the rivalries we currently have, which will occur less frequently with interleague play. And the TV money figures to be less than expected.<p>
WorthEdit1 :    	
Why are they doing it then?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
The owners are desperate for a way to compete with other sports. They basically feel the need to make a splash. I don't think, four years from now, there's going to be much excitement about interleague games.<p>
Ray4611011 : 	
I love baseball, but the owners need to make some money.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
The owners are making plenty of money.<p>
Ray4611011 : 	
Well, think about it: six , eight , one , million goes to everyone on the roster, then lease for the stadium.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
But they're raking in enough to cover those salaries easily. Stadium leases will be dropping steadily as more cities compete for teams. In Baltimore, the old Browns are basically getting paid to play there.<p>
Ray4611011 : 	
Well, I know that ticket prices have gone up, but with an average of19,000 people, they need money. I work for the owner of the Detroit tigers. Our area needs to make money so he will not lose his butt.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
What do you do for the owner of the Tigers?<p>
Ray4611011 : 	
No, part of the same company.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Isn't Detroit going to build a new stadium for the Tigers?<p>
Ray4611011 : 	I do not know.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
NawrockiT, do you think the players and owners will reach a long term agreement, and will it include a luxury tax?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Probably just a token luxury tax. The owners can't impose their position anymore after last year's judicial ruling so they'll have to compromise.<p>
Ray4611011 : 	
Why don't they market their team like merchandise?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
That's a good point, Ray. Especially during the strike, the owners badmouthed their own product!<p>
Ray4611011 : 	Yes, and you saw what happened last year.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Would Mike Ilitch talk about how bad Little  Caesar's Pizza is?<p>
Ray4611011 : 	
I do not think so; that is his bread and butter.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
But Jerry Reinsdorf said he wouldn't pay to see the White Sox play. If he wouldn't, who would? <p>
RobPgt     : 	
I'm interested in turning my interest in sports into some easy cash.  Any thoughts?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Rob Pgt, have you been to Vegas?<p>
Ray4611011 : 	
We pay for those salaries.<p>
NawrockiT  : 
But Ray, the owners charge as much as the market will bear for tickets. If Cecil Fielder gave his salary back, your ticket price wouldn't go down.<p>
Slider3307 : 	
Problem is, people love sports so much, they will almost pay anything.<p>
Ray4611011 : 
Yes, I know, but TV contracts are high.<p>
Slider3307 : 	
It is an artificial market.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Maybe that's a problem, Slider: too many fans.<p>
Ray4611011 : 	
No, not enough.<p>
Slider3307 : 	
They could charge 50 bucks a ticket and I would still want to take my son to the ballgame.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
That's why ticket prices can go up and parks still sell out.<p>
Ray4611011 : 	
Yes, so will I but enough is enough--not like before, I'd go to twenty games, now maybe two or three.<p>
RobPgt     : 	
Slider, would you take your son if it was $500/ticket?  It's a market like any other.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
NawrockiT, baseball tickets throughout the country average $12 whereas football and NBA tickets average in the 30's.<p>
Slider3307 : 	
Rob, it is a market, but would you pay $5 for milk? No, you would say that is outrageous.<p>
Ray4611011 : 	
And look at the stars: how much is Ted Williams worth today?	<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
The Knicks charge $1000 for a courtside ticket, but they sell them all.<p>
Slider3307 : 	
But you will pay $4 for a dog at the game.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Bring your own food to the park!<p>
Ray4611011 : 	
But they only seat 15,000 people while baseball needs 50,000 to 80,000 people to sell out unless it's Wrigley.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
The clubs have a monopoly on food sales that we fans can only break through boycotting.<p>
Ray4611011 :  	
Not really--they get about 10 percent of the money, the owners of the Astros. The city owns the dome.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
NawrockiT, are you advocating a ball park boycott on food and concession sales...?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Why not? The food is way overpriced, and it's bad. And the only way it will change is if people stop buying it.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
NawrockiT, think a $2.50 hot dog is a little steep?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Sportswriters get free food in the press box, so they have no idea what us fans go through. That's why we need to take it into our own hands.<p>
RobPgt     : 	
NawrockiT, you mean you have to watch the games like the rest of us?<p>
NawrockiT  : 
They don't let me in free, sport.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
NawrockiT, do you think the owners now have an advantage since NO ONE wants to go on strike again?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
No, the owners definitely do not have the upper hand. The have to bargain in good faith now since the judge ruled against them last spring. Their lack of bargaining basically caused the strike.<p>
RobPgt     : 	
Do you think college athletes should be paid?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
John Thompson makes a boatload of dough for Georgetown. Why shouldn't Allen Iverson get a little of that money?<p>
SHJStroud  : 	
I agree completely.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
He's the one pulling in the fans, not John Thompson.<p>
RobPgt     : 	
Should Iverson have to go to class?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
If the NCAA regulated payments to athletes (say, $1,000 a month), it would be aboveboard. Did you go to all your classes in college? Iverson has a scholarship. What he does with it is his business. He should have to be enrolled in school, but there's a lot of guys enrolled in school who just major in drinking.<p>
RobPgt     : 	
You think $1K/month is all Iverson is worth.  If they are going to be paid, shouldn't it be based on what they can demand in the market?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Then you get into a bidding war among the colleges. It would become the minor leagues. Whatever college budgeted the most money would get the most players.<p>
RobPgt     : 	
Exactly.  Wouldn't that be fairer? Iverson would reap the benefit he confers on GU.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Iverson would then be reaping that benefit for USC or Florida or whoever was willing to pay the most.<p>
Lmcreation : 	
It would be major league, not minor league with all the money to be made.<p>
RobPgt     : 	
This token payment scheme is the worst solution. Takes away any sense of college athletics being special while still exploiting the players.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Georgetown still has to keep its prestigious law school afloat. They couldn't afford $1 mil for Iverson.
How would it make college athletics any less special?<p>
RobPgt     : 	
Moreover, for many of these college kids it's the only chance they have at real cash.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
That's what I'm saying: Give them enough to live on.<p>
RobPgt     : 	
They get that now.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
But don't make college a bidding war for the top high school players. They *don't* get that now! Cash payments are illegal!<p>
RobPgt     : 	
Why? Schools make millions off these kids' talents.  And then they dismiss them without an education.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Whose fault is it that they don't get an education?<p>
RobPgt     : 	
But, they do get scholarships that cover room, books, tuition, and food.<p>
WorthEdit1 : 	
The only reason they don't get an education is that they don't show up at class!<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Should college basketball be strictly a minor league for the NBA?<p>
RobPgt     : 	
Cut the hypocrisy.  Yes.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Doesn't that take away what's "special" about college athletics?<p>
RobPgt     : 	
Yes.  But at least it would then be fair to the kids.<p>
RobPgt     : 	
Get the man off their backs.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
What we need is a minor league for the NBA, then. I don't want my alma mater, Northwestern, paying $4 mil a year to keep a basketball team afloat. If we went to your scheme, there would be 25 basketball schools competing for the NCAA title and 100 that bow out of any real competition. I think people like college basketball because it's *their school* competing.<p>
Jess14000  : 	
And wouldn't it start to look a lot like pro ball if they got paid?  What would be so special about college ball then?  What would be the distinction if they got paid what the 'market' could support?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Not if they all got paid the same thing. A uniform stipend. Nobody would notice the difference except "the kids", as Rob Pgt is wont to say.<p>
JSHDFR     : 	
Even now, with regulations, so much is done under the table: two big football players at my school just happened to have the same exact make, year, model cars. What do you think would happen if athletes were all the sudden allowed to accept cash payments? Wouldn't it go over the top?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Not if the NCAA regulated it. Goodness knows they regulate everything else about college athletics. It could be like a work-study payment. Consider sports these kids' on-campus job. What's wrong with that?<p>
Edialeda   : 	
What do you think the Cleveland Indians will do this year? Is this the one, 1996?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
The Indians will win the AL pennant. Not much doubt about that. They have already sold every ticket for every game this season. And people say baseball's in trouble. I just tried to buy some tickets for a Rockies game in late June. A Thursday night game, and I couldn't get four seats together. Baseball is almost entirely recovered from the effects of the strike. I think that when the owners and players do reach an accord, it will be a minor story.<p>
WorthEdit1 : 	
What about the bitter aftertaste? <p>
NawrockiT  : 	
That's already dying off, and a full year's worth of games will do a lot to make people forget.<p>
WorthEdit1 :	
But there's still people griping about the $4 hot dogs.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
NawrockiT, did you see the Phillies owner Mr. Giles on CNBC the other day?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
No.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
He thinks that baseball is about 85 percent back, and won't fully recover until a long term agreement is signed and a luxury tax is in effect.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Why should the fans care whether a luxury tax is enacted? That won't bring people back.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
I think he thinks it will even the playing field.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
How could the playing field be any more even? The Mariners and Reds aren't big market teams and they were in the playoffs last year. The Yankees and Mets aren't exactly awash in glory over the past few years.<p>
WorthEdit1 :	
Tell me about your running days. You say you've finished the NY marathon--twice. Is that so?<p>
NawrockiT  :	
Yes, that's correct.<p>
WorthEdit1 :	
What was your time in the marathon?<p>
NawrockiT  :	
1995: 4:14.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
NawrockiT, you think that Toronto's 15 million in salaries is equal to Atlanta's 50 million? And that those teams compete fairly?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Toronto has won two World Series this decade. I'm not crying for the Blue Jays.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
I see.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Do they have to win every year for fans to consider them competitive? I don't think there's much connection between market size and ability to compete. Even the much-maligned Expos had the best record in baseball in 1994. It's very possible to have a winning team on a budget. Just five years ago, people were saying the Indians were going broke. Look at them now.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
NawrockiT, so if a team wants to spend 150 million a year, it shouldn't matter.<p>
NawrockiT  : 
I agree. Because they *won't*. It's not worth it to someone to spend that much on a winner.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
Maybe Bill Gates will get a team.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
All the money in the world can't buy a winner.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
Bill Gates vs. Warren Buffett. What a matchup.<p>
JSHDFR     : 	
Do you think some of these high salaries are inspired by a player's infamy rather than talent?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Yes.  Deion Sanders wouldn't be worth $35 mil if he wasn't on TV every five seconds. <p>
WorthEdit1: 	
What about Ken Griffey's $8 million? Worth it? Why not?<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
That could be what makes those $5 hot dogs.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
The Mariners wouldn't have a shot at the playoffs without him, would they? And they certainly wouldn't have any personality without him.<p>
WorthEdit1 : 
What about someone a notch below. What are they worth?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
They're worth whatever the market will bear. I'm a capitalist.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
NawrockiT, so in that case, money does help buy a winner.<p>
NawrockiT  : 
Not as much as the ability to judge talent. By the time a Steinbrenner throws $5 mil at somebody, he's probably past his prime anyway. Better to be a good judge of talent than obscenely wealthy.<p>
Jess14000  : 	
Then there's always a Bobby Bonilla who's paid a bunch and doesn't deliver right away.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Well, whose fault is that?<p>
Jess14000  : 	
It seemed like all the hype over his salary could have been part of why he wasn't able to fit in with team mates, play well., etc.. What do you think?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Bonilla did just what could be expected of him, but the Mets expected more because they paid him so much. Paying a guy $6 mil doesn't make him a better player. Bonilla was the same player with the Mets he always had been. The expectations were too high.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
NawrockiT, what do you think about Art Modell. Now that's capitalism.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Art Modell is more of a socialist than a capitalist. The Baltimore government is giving him a stadium; you call that free-market capitalism?<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
NawrockiT, I call capitalism going where the best deal is.<p>
JNealon7   : 	
How can the NFL promise teams to one city, while they can't protect a historical team like Cleveland from moving away?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
I don't think even the NFL knows how it's going toput a new team in Cleveland. That was just a PR ploy. They'll probably give them an expansion franchise.<p>
DCP3820593 : 	
Do you think the NY Yankees will move into Manhattan or New Jersey?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
There's no room in Manhattan for a new Yankee Stadium.<p>
WorthRoom  : 	
NawrockiT, putting money first and tradition and history second.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
So it would have to be Jersey. But I don't think it will happen for many many years. The Yanks have a very sweet lease with the city.<p>
DCP3820593 : 	
They say near the water down about 11th street...<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
In the meat packing district? How would they fit a stadium and parking and all that down there?<p>
JNealon7   : 	
I don't know why they want to leave the Branx. The Stadium seems just fine.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
The area isn't even that crime-ridden, despite Steinbrenner's poormouthing. I don't know why he keeps bashing his own product.<p>
DCP3820593 : 	
The mayor of NY is a big Yankee fan and he will do everything he can to keep the Yankees.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
They're not going anywhere before the end of the century. Whitman in NJ keeps boasting of her cost-cutting, so she's not going to find a stray $200 million for a park for the Yankees.<p>
DCP3820593 : 	
They even talk about moving the Yankees to Yonkers near Yonkers Raceway.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Yonkers is poor. There's no way it could afford to build a stadium unless the state got involved, and the state isn't going to participate in moving the Yankees out of New York City.<p>
MRD1947    : 	
Will the players and owners ever reach an agreement?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Yes. Before too long, I think.<p>
DCP3820593 : 	
The city will just have to float a bond to pay for 
the new Yankees stadium.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
There's a lot of closed-door negotiation going on, which is the best way to deal with it.<p>
DCP3820593 : 	
The governor does not want the Yankees to go to NJ he will do whatever he can to keep the Yankees.<p>
JNealon7   : 	
What do you think is the best example of money screwing up sports?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Who said money screwed up sports?<p>
JNealon7   : 	
Or enhancing the games?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Money has always been a part of sports. It's just more visible now.<p>
MRD1947    : 	
Try and get an autograph from a player.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
A lot of those autographs get sold for $$$. I don't know that I'd give something away for free so someone could turn around and sell it.<p>
JSHDFR     : 	
Then what's the difference between selling an autograph for more and scalping a ticket?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Nobody's giving away tickets for free. But we demand that athletes sign autographs for free.<p>
JNealon7   : 	
Do you think soccer can be a viable pro sport?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Well, they've been trying to make it one for 20 years now, and it hasn't made it yet. I think we have enough sports already. When was the last time a "new" sport leapt into America's mind?<p>
JNealon7   : 	
What about basketball?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
The NBA's been around since the '40s. College basketball was popular before that. A lot of schools have soccer programs. But nobody pays any attention to them. Nobody pays any attention to college baseball either, so I don't think that's the problem.<p>
JNealon7   :  	
Do you think that the world cup in the US was a success?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Yes, but a lot of foreigners came here for the games. And it was a one-time event. That novelty wears off quickly. I think the World Cup would always be a hit in the U.S.<p>
JNealon7   : 	
I hear that Univision (Spanish network) is going to start broadcasting U.S. league "futbol" soon.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
Let's go Yanks, most expensive team money can buy!!!!!<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
The Yankees' best players are their cheapest ones: Bernie and Derek Jeter. Ruben Sierra's really expensive, and he's no good. You don't need pricey players, just good young ones. <p>
JNealon7   : 	
Do you think hockey can rise above where it has been for the last 20 years?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
It's kind of sad that hockey is leaving Canada for the Sun Belt, but it can succeed there. I was in Dallas last summer, and saw a bunch of kids ice skating. They looked like hockey fans.<p>
Smaf712    : 	
I'm a Orioles fan.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Are you excited about the Browns coming to Baltimore, Smaf?<p>
Smaf712    : 	
I can't wait.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Are you upset about all the money the city has spent on them?<p>
Smaf712    : 	
I wish they would stay in Memorial Stadium. And they are the Ravens, not the Browns.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Sorry. Ravens it is. Too bad they can't be the Colts.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
The Orioles will fight for a wildcard with Boston while the Yanks win the east.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
The Colts, let's hear it for them!<p>
JNealon7   : 	
They tried to buy the Colts name.<p>
Smaf712    : 	
I wish that it was.  I hope this guy is not another Irsay.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
He is another Irsay! He just Irsayed Cleveland. Or is that Irsaid?<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
Did Baltimore fans actually vote for the Ravens?<p>
Smaf712    : 	
Yes, we really did choose that name.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
How did that come about?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
I bet their primary color is black, since that moves the merchandise.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
Is everyone happy with that choice or were there other names in the running?<p>
Smaf712    : 
There were two other names.  One was Americans and the other Marida's.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
What's "marida"?<p>
Smaf712    : 	
Got me.  Where are you from?<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
NY.<p>
Smaf712    : 	
Were you at the New York opening today against Cleveland?<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
It was in Cleveland.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
No tickets available, my good man. Cleveland's sold out for the season.<p>
Smaf712    : 	
Sorry. I forgot.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
And they say baseball's in trouble.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
True, baseball is alive and well in Cleveland,  as well as Baltimore.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
And Colorado, and Chicago, and Boston...<p>
TonyBBall  : 	
And in Chicago - at least on the North side.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
True.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Wrigley's pretty easy to fill.<p>
TonyBBall  : 	
And Comiskey is pretty tough.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
And it's got that hip cachet that Sox Park will never be able to take away. The White Sox need a good team to sell out. The Cubs just need Floppy Hat Day.<p>
TonyBBall  : 	
I was there yesterday, and nothing beats a day at Wrigley--nothing.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
Especially if you missed work.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
They don't even need to sell the team. They can sell the park. Do you think that's why the Cubs always stink? They don't have an economic need to develop a good team.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
Cubs are horrible.<p>
TonyBBall  : 	
That's true -- but don't get me wrong,  I want winning baseball and so do all true Cubs fans.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
But do the Cubs owners care about winning? Sometimes I wonder.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
Well, you'll have to move for a winning team.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
They're already getting every last penny possible out of that franchise.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
Come to NY, you'll have 2.<p>
TonyBBall  : 	
They signed George Bell, Danny Jackson, Dave Smith, Candy Maldonado -- they spend money.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
When was the last time both the Mets and Yanks had a winning season? 1986, right? <p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
86.<p>
TonyBBall  : 	
They just don't pick the right guys -- McPhail and Lynch will change that.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Dave Smith and Candy Maldonado are hardly Barry Bonds.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
In response to Tony -- hurt, hurt, hurt, too old.<p>
TonyBBall  : 	
There is only one Bonds.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
They seem content to roll along with the Todd Zeiles of the world.<p>
TonyBBall  : 	
iam4zoo - that's my point. The Cubs didn't have the right management, now they do.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
It's not a matter of spending money. It's a matter of being committed to winning.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
McPhail is good, with what he did with the Twins, but what about Lynch?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Building a farm system , scouting, all that. When was the last time the Cubs had a really hot prospect? Shawon Dunston?<p>
TonyBBall  : 	
Brooks Kieschnick. Let's see what Lynch has -- he did a good job of transforming the team last year. <p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Well, we can hope. Contrast that with all the Indians home-grown talent: Belle, Thome, Ramirez...<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
That's why the Yankees haven't won in the past, they traded their farm system for old players.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
That's why having tons of money doesn't win pennants. It's mostly under-30 guys who win pennants for you. The Indians built their dynasty by locking up young players.<p>
TonyBBall  : 	
And pitching.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
Indians used a little of both.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
But the first step is to accumulate all that young talent, and the Cubs haven't done that.<p>
IAM4ZOO    :	
Ryne is not the answer.<p>
TonyBBall  : 	
They got a decent young staff and McRae, Gonzalez, Sosa.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Believe me, I'm rooting for them. A wildcard is not out of the question.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
Sosa and McRae, good picks, who's Gonzalez?<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Luis Gonzalez. Left fielder. Too bad he's not Jose Gonzalez.<p>
TonyBBall  : 	
Luis Gonzalez -- he is not top shelf but a good player.<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
They have a decent outfield then.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Do you think Ryno came back for the money? Or for the love of the game?<p>
TonyBBall  : 	
No -- I think he came back to play.<p>
NawrockiT  : 	
People complain that Rickey Henderson misses 30 games a year. Why don't they complain about Ryno taking a whole year off?<p>
IAM4ZOO    : 	
Ryne Sandberg is to Chicago what Don Mattingly was to the Yanks.<p>
TonyBBall  : 	
My son needs to go to bed -- sorry see ya later. <p>
NawrockiT  : 	
Good night, Tony Jr.<p>

						On April 1, 1996, top investment experts met in Las Vegas for the ISI Money Show. In "The Next Ten Years" panel, sponsored by ISI and CNBC, panelists discussed their predictions for the stock market in the next decade. Panelists included: Elizabeth Bramwell, president and CIO of the Bramwell Funds;  John Dessauer, editor of John Dessauer's Investor's World; James Dines, editor of The Dines Letter; Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter; Don Phillips, president of Morningstar; and Jim Rogers, author/investor. Sue Herera, a CNBC anchor, served as moderator of the panel. Follows is a transcript from this event:<p>
Sue Herera: It's wonderful to see everyone here. It's such a large group this year, which has been just absolutely so enjoyable for me, to get a chance to meet everybody, and many of you are return participants in the seminar, which we love. It's so nice to catch up with all of you. Many of you have made a lot of changes in your lives in the last year since I've seen you and it's a pleasure. And, I think this hour and a half is going to be a lot fun. At least I hope so. <p>
We have a very distinguished and wonderful panel to answer your questions, and I'm also going to ask them some specific questions. This is not an easy panel to be on, The Next Ten Years. Most of us are having trouble with the next month in this market --ten years and they agreed to come -- so I think we should give them some credit for going out on a limb in many cases. What I'm going to do is ask a few questions to each -- some have some fairly interesting predictions for you. The idea behind this is to help you create well and if you have created well, congratulations, and we're going to help you preserve that, I hope. So the idea is to give you some guidance and help you to a wonderful and better future financially. <p>
Now, I'm also going to be taking questions from the audience, so we're going to do a little talk show, a little panelist, I'm going to be running up and down with the microphone, so bear with me. So think about questions that you might have for the panelists, after I kind of get some opening remarks from each of them. It may take me a few minutes, but I'll get to you, and give you the microphone and you can ask your questions, because I think many of you, depending on your particular area of interest, might have questions that perhaps I haven't thought of before, that haven't been addressed by some of the speakers that you've had a chance to hear so far. Are you having a good time so far at this seminar, I hope? Good. I think when we did the promo at CNBC it was, "The perfect opportunity to mix business with pleasure". So, we hope you've had a chance to do that. <p>
Let me introduce the panelists to you. Michael Murphy, Editor of the California Technology Stock Letter. Many of you already know him from appearances on CNBC, as well as in the printed press and other media. Next to him is John Dessauer, Editor of John Dessauer's Investor's World; I will have the privilege of being with John on a later panel as well. Next to him is Jim Dines, and he is Editor of the Dines Letter. Next to him is Don Phillips, President of Morningstar; and then Elizabeth Bramwell, and she is President and CIO of the Bramwell Funds. Then, Jim Rogers, author and investor and very interesting story teller, so I have a few questions for Jim.<p>
So, without further ado, that's the panel and we'll get started. Michael, I'm going to just kind of go in order because that's probably the easiest way for me to do it. Let's start, Michael, with you and your area of expertise. I think what's interesting about this panel, really, is that we have such a wide variety of areas covered here. Jim obviously has been around the world, he invests in a way that many people do not, by going to the country, going to the bank and buying particular currency. He has a specific area and method of investing. Liz covers a much broader area than that in the markets. And, we have Don, of course, who follows the fund area. Jim has many areas of expertise. John, worldwide investor and, I think Michael, perhaps technology is a great place to start, because it has been such a huge area of growth in many sectors of the technology sector itself. I know technology is a tough call, but if you had to put your finger on the hot issues for the next few years, what would they be?<p>
Michael Murphy: Well, in technology, I think if you divide it into two parts, medical and electronics, the medical part of technology, clearly for the next ten years, is going to be totally driven by the biotechnology revolution. A lot of these companies that a lot of people have forgotten about (because the stocks went through a three year bear market through about the middle of last year) have made a lot of clinical progress. For the next ten years, I think it really belongs to those companies. The big drug companies are investing in those companies and are counting on those companies to come up with the new products. So there's a tremendous amount of opportunity in biotech. <p>
The other half of technology, the electronics part, really divides into two parts there. The personal computing-related part, and the communications part. The communications part has grown steadily, grew right through the last recession at 35 percent a year. It's going to keep growing at 35 percent a year. You all, I'm sure, have heard the statistic that half the people in the world have never made a telephone call; ten years from now, everybody will have made a telephone call. So that means a lot of infrastructure has got to be put in place, and a lot of services. Unfortunately, United States companies pretty much lead the world in those areas. <p>
In the personal computing area, there is going to be a lot of ferment and a lot of change. PC's are going to continue to sell as they are. There are about 150 million installed today. There are at least 250 million more people around the world who have the income and education to buy one that haven't bought one yet. And, the prices are going to get structured down into lower and lower priced machines. There will be a $500 Internet machine, their $200 machine you carry around in your hand. The technology is going to continue to spread. My guess is that all of technology for the next ten years is a pretty good bet. The surest part of the bet is in telecommunications and in biotechnology, but there's going to be plenty of opportunities in personal computing during that time span.<p>
Sue Herera: Michael, when you said the big drug companies are going to start looking at the smaller, perhaps more innovative companies, do you then see an increase in takeover play aspect there, because you're looking at the big companies? Or are you looking more at buying the smaller companies themselves? <p>
Michael Murphy: Well, you're right, I hope they don't get taken over too early. We just had one bought out, Athena Neurosciences, and you know, we made eighty percent on the stock, but I think it was bought out too early. We could have made a lot more if we had gotten through to the point where they had actually developed the drug and gotten it introduced and sharply increased the value of the company. We want to be in the biotech companies that are going to be taken over, but I wouldn't argue with somebody who has more conservative money owning certain drug companies that sort of understand this model of putting money out into the biotechs. <p>
For example, when I look at good biotech companies, I almost always find Merck & Co. [NYSE: MRK] or SmithKline Beecham [NYSE: SBE] or Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Inc. [NYSE: RPR] or Upjohn Co. [NYSE: UPJ] in there, investing in specific products. Of course, from their point of view, they're going to wait three years, five years, whatever it takes, see what works. They'll help get the product ultimately through the FDA, get it into the market, they have the rights to sell it, and then they'll buy those companies out. They may pay 500 million or a billion dollars to take a company over five years from now, but from their point of view, that's lower risk than actually doing the development themselves. <p>
Right now today, if you X-out the top seven biotech companies -- the Amgen [Nasdaq: AMGN]-Chiron Corp. [Nasdaq: CHIR]-Genentech, Inc. [NYSE: GNE] kind of company -- the next fifty companies, the total market capitalization of all those companies, is less than one year annual R&D [research and development] spending at Merck. So they could just buy the whole industry if they wanted to. But, they're not going to do it. They are going to just wait and see what works out, and we would rather buy the biotech companies that have a chance to go from development stage to functioning pharmaceutical companies, and then get bought out. <p>
Sue Herera: John, why don't we turn to you now. As you travel around the world, there is so much changing, it's almost impossible to keep up with at this point. To say to you, what's coming up in the next ten years? is certainly not an easy question. What do you see on the forefront?<p>
John Dessauer: Well, the first thing I would say is, is my microphone working? Good. It's okay. The past is prologue, so we start, nobody knows what the future will hold. A good place to start guessing about the future is to look at the past and the present, particularly at our mistakes. And, I think the greatest mistake made by myself and a whole army of other people was made in 1989 when communism collapsed as an economic entity, the Berlin wall came down, and we all thought that Mikhail Gorbachev and perestroika had it right, that you do political reform first and economic -- in other words, democracy -- and all will be well. <p>
Deng Xiaoping in China had the opposite idea, and at the time, I thought he was just plain wrong. You know oppressive communism, brutal people, that kind of thing, we thought China would never make it. Well, now we're quite a long way into the process, and I've spent a lot of time now in China. I'll be going back again the 24th of April for another three-week tour out into the countryside to see the one part of coastal China that I haven't visited yet. From my visits to China, it's quite clear that we were completely wrong in 1989. We can look at Russia today, and some parts of the Soviet Union are doing fine -- Hungary, Czechoslovakia -- but Russia itself is a total mess. I'm told by people there that the Russian Mafia takes 2 percent of the gross in every business in the country today. When you get into that kind of a situation, I mean it's going to be an awful problem getting out of it. So I don't hold a lot of hope for the Russian stock market any time soon. <p>
But on the other side of the globe, both China, and I was recently in Vietnam as well, you can see that Deng Xiaoping did unleash that kind of grassroots economic movement, so China today probably looks like what the United States used to look like back at the start of the industrial revolution, with a big difference. They have modern technology to move them on their way. Lots of challenges, lots of problems facing the development of China, but there are seven hundred and fifty million Chinese. Sixty percent of the population under the age of 25. Ninety percent literacy rate and I am personally, totally convinced that that bunch of folks out there, wandering around China, will shape the future for the global economy; not just for the next ten years, but probably for the next twenty. Their basic philosophy is to work hard, get rich, and live a long time. They're all little Warren Buffetts and I think they're really going to succeed.  But just imagine, three countries like the United States with people Sue Herera's age, 25 and under. Nothing is smooth and there are ups and downs and the rest, but I think if you take that idea home and keep it for the next ten years, it'll keep you out of trouble.<p>
Sue Herera: I've always loved talking with John. Jim Dines, next. You said you have some very interesting predictions. What's going to happen?<p>
James Dines: Well, the truth is that I went through the futurology chapter in my book on mass psychology and I picked out eight predictions that might be profitable to you, and I thought I'd go through them. But first, I'd like to emphasize that nobody one hundred years ago could have seen where we are now and you have to understand that the future is inherently unbelievable. And, you need to be flexible in terms of accepting what might happen. So, maybe it's merciful that we don't really believe what is right in front of us.<p>
The first prediction reminds me of 1962 when gold was at $35, and I said it would surpass the price of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. Seventeen years later it came true and when gold hit $850, it was acknowledged in Barron's Magazine's editorial. And now I'd like to predict again, that gold will once again get above the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. So all portfolios should have a substantial position in the precious metals. <p>
Sue Herera: Gold or gold stocks?<p>
James Dines: I prefer gold stocks over gold bouillon, thanks for pointing that out, Sue. I was just mentioning to Sue before, I first began working with her when I was on station FNN in Los Angeles in 1980. We've been working together for 16 years and it's always been a pleasure. I thought she was thirty, but I guess she's twenty-five.<p>
In my speeches for the last twenty years, I've pointed out that humanity began in East Africa and it's always seemed to go Westward: Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome, France, England, the US, Japan and the Five Tigers. In 1979, I went to the People's Republic of China as a guest of the Chinese government, and came back saying that the 21st century would someday be called the China Century. I agree with John on the bullish potential on that, and I said that it would continue Westward into India and then eventually Africa. Now, why it should move Westward is a mass psychological, interesting query, but I'm not bullish. We turned bearish on China in 1992 for the short term, and I'm still bearish on China. <p>
Three: I view computers as a transitional product toward what I call the "Coming Age of Robots;" they'll be doing most of the world's work. There's a time not far distant when all nations will be economically independent. There won't be enough work for everyone, which will have a phenomenal impact. It's just beginning in the US, there are not enough jobs for everyone, and this is what we have to confront. Combined with what I expect to be a radical extension of human life, I certainly agree with Mike on that. I think biotech is a very important area. There will not be enough work, and clearly a radical new political order will be the primary feature of the next century.<p>
Four: Most of the Internet's attention is directed toward its usefulness and information spread, but I believe it will be the vehicle for Mass Contagion on a level never seen before. You've just gotten a glimpse of it with Netscape, and next will be with Yahoo!. Nothing will be busier than a so-called idle rumor and it will be wondrous to behold how rumors without a leg to stand on get around so fast. Especially gossip, which, of course, is the art of saying nothing in a way that leaves practically nothing unsaid. <p>
Five: I first began to predict in 1985 that within 20 years, physical immortality would become possible. I cover this in more detail in my book, but I'm very interested in the disease called progeria with its radically premature aging, proving to me that there's a genetic clock that can go wrong. I therefore also predict physical immortality by 2005. <p>
Six: I count the fifty-year cold war as World War III, and I've been predicting that World War IV would be a religious war, mostly within religions, and bombs are already going off everywhere on that. But the world is still in denial, and they even describe Yugoslavia's war between their three religions as an ethnic conflict. I say that denial is more than just a river in Egypt. <p>
Seven: Something radical will happen with energy and the governments will eventually seize all oil reserves for military purposes with prices above $100 a barrel. I'm very bullish on oil. <p>
Eight: And finally, the four-year cycle in the stock market is very important. Cycles, I cover that a lot in my book on mass psychology. See, cycles are very important to my work. There was a bottom made in 1957, '62, '66, '70, '74, '78, '82, '87 (that was one year late), '90 and '94, which means there are bottoms every fourth year in the stock market. Therefore, the next important market bottom should be in 1998, suggesting a market top, not later than 1997, possibly even this year, but probably not. There are other cycles in my book I study, like the low point of each decade tends to be reached within the first few years. I learned that from my old friend Edison Gould, who of course got it from Edgar Lawrence Smith, who wrote that book in 1904. Which means that we've already hit the low point for this decade, I'm still very bullish on the stock market. And that's all, thank you.<p>
Sue Herera: So, by the year 2005 I should be thirty, thirty-two and live forever, right? Don, you're next. What should we be doing for the next ten years?<p>
Don Phillips: Well, I think in the fund arena, the game has changed a bit. I think over the last decade, clearly you've seen a move from individual stocks to mutual funds as being the investment vehicle of choice. And, I think the baby boom generation has embraced mutual funds. I think for no small part, because mutual funds make saving and investing seem like something that the baby boomers are very good at, and that's spending. You know with mutual funds, you've got brand names, you've got even dollar prices, you even have sales: "Buy us now while we're waiving the load." So it's exactly like spending, which is a skill that the baby boomers have spent their lifetime perfecting. And now you get to apply it to the savings arena. <p>
But I think there's been a shift now from funds to portfolios. And that's the real challenge. No one's buying their first mutual fund. It's a game in progress. And, certainly things like 401(K) plans and variable annuities force this issue. I think the shake-up you saw at Fidelity a couple of weeks ago was in response to this. The tag against Fidelity in the 401(K) arena was sure, you get Magellan, and it's a good fund, but if you buy Magellan, and then Contrafund, and Blue Chip Growth, you're really getting the same portfolio, warmed over three different times. And, I think some of the competing groups were going in and saying look, we've got a more disciplined line-up and people can really build a portfolio around us because if we call something midcap, it'll be midcap. If we call something value, it'll be value. <p>
That's the response to what's happening in the marketplace. People are thinking about constructing an overall portfolio, not just buying "a good fund". And the problem with this is there are some mathematics involved that aren't very favorable. I mean, you see Fidelity moving in this direction with personal advisory services. You also had in the Journal recently that Vanguard's getting into the financial planning arena. What they're doing is they're recognizing that just offering the funds isn't enough, they have to show people how to construct an overall portfolio to meet their goals. The problem with this is that it's an extra service that demands an extra fee. And the typical mutual fund/expense ratio has been rising over the last decade. <p>
Just within Chicago, Harris Associates, a top quality organization, in the '70s launched the Acorn Fund. And, it was designed that if it was successful the assets would rise and the expense ratio would decline. The expense ratio on that is now about 60 basis points. The same organization launched the Oakmark Funds in the '90s and it's designed such that if it's successful, its expenses would decline to about 1.4 percent or so. And that's the C-change in the fund industry over the last two decades. You don't aim for 60 or 70 basis points. You aim for 150, because that's what the market place will bear. Now, the issue is what happens if you start taking out that 150 basis points that the typical stock fund manager is charging, and you layer another service for assembling the portfolio on top of that? <p>
Merrill Lynch and some of the wire houses are talking about wrap-free programs with no-load mutual funds. If you start adding 1.5 percent to 1.5 percent and ending up with something, say, at 3 percent a year, I think you've got a real tough situation for the investor. Because, what might you realistically project forward over the next decade for bonds? I think you'd take the current coupons, say maybe 6 or 7 percent. For stocks, historical average, maybe 9 percent. Now if you're asking someone to pay something in the neighborhood of 2 to 2.5, 3 to 3.5 percent to get access to security markets that are going to deliver 6 to 9 percent, you're asking someone to forfeit anywhere from 1/3 to potentially half of their return from these markets just for having access to them. And that's something that's going to have to shake out. There's going to have to be a lowering of these fees or vastly superior service somehow, because otherwise the mathematics mean that the investor can't win. And, ultimately, if the investor doesn't win, no one wins. <p>
Sue Herera: Okay. Liz, you're next. You can really address a variety of issues here, from individual stocks to funds. We've talked a lot, just between the two of us about technology. We were having a discussion at lunch about the Internet and how that has dramatically changed the way we all are certainly doing business. What are you going to be watching, and perhaps buying or looking at in the next ten years?<p>
Elizabeth Bramwell: I think the next five to ten years are going to see more change than we've seen heretofore. I think it's a real challenge for a human being to adjust to change and I think, get ready. I think it's only going to intensify. I think the likelihood of people having multiple careers is greater today than ever, I think the phenomenon of part-time work is a permanent feature that's going to be developed even further, and that's not necessarily all bad. So I think there are trends there on an investment side, but at any rate, I think it's exciting to have multiple careers going forward. I think, assuming the free trade stays in place, that the standard of living is going to continue to rise around the world, and the middle class will continue to expand. So it's going to be a good environment for selling American-made goods and services in other parts of the world. I think electronics will continue to develop and be increasingly pervasive. I'm struck by the fact that today, the cost of electronics and an automobile are greater than the actual cost of steel. So we have just an increasing penetration of this kind of thing going forward.<p>
I think, in terms of communications, that more and more of it's going to go online. I was kind of struck in looking at the last Procter & Gamble quarterly statement that they announce that this is going to be their last printed quarterly statement. Now we have a big consumer company, taking their pretty blue quarterly statement, with orange Tide boxes floating across it, and doing away with it for cost reasons, saying "we'll be happy to send you the material, just call our 1-800 number and we'll either fax or send it to you." So, and having done that, you get a cold black and white piece of paper. So, from a marketing point-of-view, I kind of wonder, but from a cost point-of-view, I guess it's something else again. At any rate, later this year, P&G will put its material online, on the Internet. <p>
I think we're going to see this more and more. I think the funds have had a real place in terms of investment portfolios and so forth, but I think as the information is more easily disseminated to the world, that it's also going to become increasingly possible for individuals to structure their portfolios from scratch with individual stocks. There will be a certain group who'll reach a point where I think they'll have all the information that the professional analysts and the portfolio managers have. It'll be online and easily accessible, so it's not to say that professional money managers are going to be replaced, because you know there is an increasing need for that, too, but on the margin. I think also some people will sort of take off and say, "why do I have to buy the index on here or whatever," and will go from there. <p>
I think going forward, a lot will depend on what the political structure is. I think that by 2006 there will be a substantial move to privatize the Social Security system, and the form that it takes will depend on who is in the White House, and who is in Congress. And, I think in the next five, within the next Administration, something will be done on Medicare, because now, two years ahead of time, the expenditures have exceeded the revenue increase, and this is after having raised Medicare tax a couple of years ago and taken the cap off of it. So, I think it's been a substantial tax and basically, I hope they don't do the same thing with Social Security. <p>
Sue Herera: Okay, I'm almost afraid to ask Jimmy about the next ten years. It's either going to be great, or we're going to hell in a hand basket, one of the two. <p>
Jim Rogers: Both.<p>
Sue Herera: Both? All right, Jim. <p>
Jim Rogers: Well, a lot of things are going to happen in the next ten years, but I will try to limit myself to the investment world. First, the last twenty-odd years we've had a bull market in paper assets, stocks; and we've had a bear market in physical assets -- raw materials, natural resources, call them what you will -- that is in the process of reversing. We're about to have a multi-year bull market in raw materials, and we're going to certainly make a top in stocks, somewhere in the next quarter or the next year, or whenever, and the place to be will be in raw materials and natural resources. <p>
You should also know that there will definitely be a recurring currency crisis and the US dollar will get worse and worse over the next ten years. Sometime in the next ten years, we'll have exchange controls in the United States, so I certainly urge all of you to be sure you have some of your money out of the country now, but certainly going forward during that ten-year period, because there is going to come a time when it will be either illegal or very expensive for you to get your money out of the country. And the countries which will be doing well will be Latin America. Basically, the best countries will be the ones that are well-managed, natural resource-based countries, such as New Zealand, Chile, Australia, Malaysia may be one of those: the countries that have a natural resource-base and are well-managed. We'll see great resurgences in Africa, South America. The great country of the 21st century will be China. The best investment advice I can give you is to teach your children and grandchildren Chinese. If you don't want to teach them Chinese, teach them Spanish, because those are going to be the two great languages of the 21st century. I guess that's enough for right now.<p>
Sue Herera: Okay. Are we ready for questions? I think what I'll do is, I'll try and start at the bottom level and work up. I won't even have to do the treadmill tonight, this'll be great. Oprah Winfrey must have a blast doing this! Okay.<p>
Question: Mr. Murphy - Have you ever heard of a biotech firm called MedImmune [Nasdaq: MEDI], and if so, what do you think of it?<p>
Michael Murphy: Well, I have heard of MedImmune. I actually don't follow MedImmune, because it's an East Coast company, and I try just to follow companies that I can get to and get back. But, I will tell you, I have looked at it enough to know, first of all, that it's fairly cheap still -- even though it's come up -- it's fairly cheap. The way to look at a biotech company -- any biotech company -- is to look first to see if it's a quality company, that they have partners that are big drug companies, that they have a scientific advisory board that makes sense and comes from big institutions. Secondly, just look at how much money they've spent on their science, on their research and development over the last five years, and compare that to what the total market capitalization is today. If you can buy a biotech stock for five-times or eight-times (or sometimes even less than that) what they've actually spent, just on their science without any credit for administration or manufacturing or any of that, mostly they're pretty good deals. And if they have good quality scientific partners, especially if anyone has recently come in, looked at their science and invested money or signed a deal, that's reasonable assurance that they've got something real that can get through the drug development process. Then, if you buy a package of those, because they're not all going to make it, that's the way to participate in this whole upturn. <p>
Question: Where will the strength be in international banking in the next ten years? Can you identify any certain entity that will be better than the other?<p>
Sue Herera: I guess that plays, John, perhaps to you, or to you, Jimmy?<p>
John Dessauer: I think of the same time twenty years ago, when I worked for Citicorp and I ran their European money management operations and lived in Switzerland. In those days, John Reid was considered a radical. He was going around Europe and elsewhere in the world, acquiring a consumer banking operation. That's the strength of Citicorp today. And I suspect it will remain a strength of the big banks going on into the future. We'll see more consolidation, and we will see it in other parts of the world, not just in Asia, but in parts of Europe. <p>
Banco Santander, for example, the big Spanish bank bought Banesto when it got into trouble a couple of years ago. And Banesto is now on the verge of delivering the profits for Banco Santander that they expected in the first place. Why? Because retail banking is beginning to develop in Spain. You lift standards of living around the world, the first thing that happens is you start to see consumer banking really develop. So that's the area I would focus on in banking, looking out into the future. Big banks have the muscle power, big banks that are international in scope and that are focused on consumer banking in the developing world.<p>
Sue Herera: How about you Jimmy? <p>
Jim Rogers: Well, the major change: your child, your children are never going to see the inside of a bank, because banking is all going to be done electronically in the next decade. There is a bank in England right now, which was only founded five years ago, and it already has two percent of the English banking market. It doesn't have a single branch. Not a single branch. The English change spouses more than they change their bank, that's a true statistic, I mean the English just, they never change their banks. They'd more likely get divorced than change their bank. But, this bank within five years already has 2 percent of the English banking market. It's all going to be electronic in the future. Your bank may be not even in the United States, your bank may be who knows where. <p>
All these bankers buying-up bricks and mortar are going to wind up, many of them wind up failing, because the future is electronic, and it will be very international because you can be anywhere, and your clerks can be anywhere when you're doing it electronically. The sound banks will be the ones who are investing in this technological change, rather than bricks and mortar and loan officers, and the really sound ones will be in places that have sound currencies going forward -- Switzerland, Denmark, Ireland, Chile, New Zealand. Countries with currencies that will remain sound where people will want to put their money as a stable source of value. That will not be the United States. <p>
Question: Is that the smart card concept that we don't have here, but is very widely accepted in Europe, when you talk about electronic banking? <p>
Jim Rogers: Well, that's part of it. If you think about it, all you really need your bank for, what most people need their bank for, is to get cash. Well, this bank in England which has no branches at all, but has 2 percent of the nation's bank market, they just have all these ATM machines. You just go down and stick your card in, whatever kind of card it is, and you take out your money. The rest of it can all be done electronically, you pay your bills electronically, you make your deposits electronically, you don't need bank deposits any more, as we know them.<p>
Sue Herera: Alrighty. Let's move on.<p>
Question: Mr. Rogers, you mentioned the currency crisis and I was wondering if you could comment on how you see that scenario unfold?<p>
Jim Rogers: Well, the way some of you probably remember that pound sterling used to be the world's reserve currency, and the world's medium of exchange, and when sterling got into trouble, there was a currency problem every year. And every year the world's bankers got together and they solved the currency problem. Well, every year, they came back. That's the way it's going to unfold here, sometimes you'll be in outlying currencies, like the peso or the Swedish krona or something like that, but basically, there's a dollar problem. The politicians are debasing and devaluing the currency, you will see, I don't know, maybe this fall will be the next one, fewer and fewer people will take the dollar, the dollar will go down again. The bankers will all get together to try to figure out the way to prop up the dollar, there'll be a rally, but over the next few years, every year you will basically see a tax on the US dollar and it will continue to erode in the international markets. <p>
Ultimately, some politician is going to be elected and he's going to say, "There is nothing wrong with America, America is the strongest country in the world, we are the richest country in the world." He's going to ignore the fact that we have gigantic foreign debt, and he's going to say, "There's nothing wrong with the dollar, the problem is those journalists who keep writing about problems with the currency, and if they wouldn't write about it, things would be okay. And the other problem, those evil financiers on Wall Street. Those greedy investors, you know if they didn't stop sending the money out of the country, we wouldn't have a problem." And he's going to say, "All of you Americans, we are good, hard working, loyal citizens, we're not doing this to hurt you, we're doing it just to hurt the evil financiers on Wall Street." <p>
And that's when they'll put exchange controls on, at which point, the dollar will collapse again, because it won't work in the long term. When the dollar makes that final bottom, though, it might be the time to buy. In the meantime, you should have money out of the country. Now, it is legal, honest and moral to have money out of the country, as long as you pay your taxes, and I commend all of you to be patriotic, I suggest you send some of your money out of the country. Help the politicians out. They want the dollar to go down, they think it's good for the dollar to go down, that's a disaster in the long term, this has never worked in the long term for any country in the world to debase and devalue the currency. Even the French, the French did it for forty years, they said, "We'll compete with the Germans and we'll compete with the Europeans, we'll just debase the currency." Even the French have given up this absurd policy. So, it doesn't work in the long run, but the politicians will do it, continue to do it, there'll be recurring crisis. Now it's legal and honest and moral, send some of your money out of the country and be patriotic.<p>
Question: Hi, Michael, I remember you were saying yesterday that there were more Wall Street analysts that followed steel stocks than semiconductor stocks, I believe. That being the case, certainly there must be even less for biopharmaceuticals. When do you think there is going to be a change in the philosophy and the people who, the analysts, Wall Street-types, and so forth, may think that there's a bigger future in biopharmaceuticals than toys or whatever?<p>
Michael Murphy: Well, the number I gave was about 90 percent of Wall Street analysts still follow stocks in the old economy, the mass production economy, or even the older economy, the Industrial economy. And, I think the change might come in the next economic downturn in this country, because the old economy -- the mass production economy, specifically, the consumer economy -- I think is in a lot of trouble. The demographics are against it. Growth is very slow. The companies in that business that do well are the ones that have a large overseas component to their earnings, companies like Coca-Cola or something like that. But, those who are locked into the US economy are, I think, having tough times now, and they are showing earnings growth basically by one-time cost-cutting, which can't continue forever, and they're going to get nailed in the next downturn. And at the same time, my suspicion is that in the next economic downturn, the technology will grow right through it again, just at telecommunications did in the last one, and you'll have telecommunications and PC's and biotechnology going through.<p>
In the specific case of biotechnology, in the ten years up to 1994, we had 30 drugs approved, biotech drugs. So we averaged about three a year. Last year, we had six approved. This year, we'll have about 18 approved. Next year, about 30. So we've hit the hockey stick in terms of drug approvals where these companies can change from being development-stage companies. So a lot of folks don't want to buy. Understandably, they're risky. They change from that into small pharmaceutical companies and then we start seeing the acquisitions. And, my guess is that whole process takes about another 3 or 4 years. We're just starting a group of mutual funds, or following a group of mutual funds, and the first one in the series, after some debate, we decided to make a biotech fund, not a broad-technology fund, because I think the timing is so superb right now, to get those stocks bought before we start seeing this flood of approvals. This is really the time to be doing it.<p>
Question: Hi, my question is for Jim Rogers. Since most of us aren't in the position where we can travel all around the world, how would you best recommend investing in individual countries, would you go through webs or would you go through mutual funds?<p>
Jim Rogers: Well, the very best way to invest in a foreign country is to invest in that country directly. Most foreign countries in which you would invest have banks or brokers that have offices in the United States and you can open many of these accounts by mail. You don't have to go Denmark to open a brokerage account in Denmark, normally. So you can do it that way and then buy shares directly. Failing that, you can buy shares in many companies. They trade in the United States, or many of your brokers will buy you shares in say, Ireland, if you want to buy Irish shares; some firms are starting to specialize in this. There is a firm in St. Louis that's called Mark Twain bank, now I've never done business with them, so I don't know if they're any good or bad, but I do know they specialize in this, and they will buy you shares in just about any country in the world. They will also open money market funds for you which are guaranteed by the FDIC, believe it or not, so that you can do this. <p>
Shares are the best way, better than mutual funds. Webs, and for those of you who don't know what a web is, there are two new instruments which have just been created in the last two weeks: One is known as a web, and one is known as a country basket. They trade on the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange. You essentially can buy the indexes in about 19 different countries, in other words, if you want to buy Australian, you buy the Australian country basket, you call up your Merrill Lynch broker, whoever your local broker is, and tell him you want to buy that index and he can do it. You pay for it in dollars, you get your money in dollars and everything else. I suspect that they are going to change international investing in this country dramatically because they are so accessible and they are so terrific. I've never bought or sold one yet, but I suspect I will. <p>
Another reason that they're better than mutual funds, with all due respect to mutual funds, indexes out perform something like 70 or 80 or 90 percent of mutual fund managers in the world so, unless you know the really good one, then you should just buy the index and here's a way that you can buy the index in just about any country you want to. If you don't want to do that, if you think you've found a fund manager whose better than just buying the index, than mutual funds are an acceptable way to do it, but be sure you know something about the fund manager. Remember, all fund managers are not good. The most important part of any investment is who's managing the money.<p>
Question: My question is for you also, Mr. Rogers. You mentioned to take money out of the US now, before restrictions come on. What is the best way to do this?<p>
Jim Rogers: Get on your motorcycle and get yourself a tall young blonde, and go. <p>
Sue Herera: You know, I should have something to come back with, but I don't. It'll just get us in trouble.<p>
Jim Rogers: I know it would. And be careful. No, I don't know, the countries which run sound currencies, you know in the old days you had to run a sound currency if you were a country, the 19th century for instance. But now, most politicians have learned how to debase currency so there are only say ten countries left that have a sound currency. I don't know if you go skiing on your vacations, if you do, maybe you should consider skiing in Switzerland or Austria instead of Colorado. If you like the beaches, maybe you should consider going to the beaches in New Zealand or Ireland, or someplace that has nice beaches.<p>
Sue Herera: A little chilly, Jimmy.<p>
Jim Rogers: I know, I was trying to think of another place with good beaches. Go there. You know, Time magazine once called me the Indiana Jones of finance. I'm going to blow my cover right here, I'm going to tell you how simple this is: If you open a bank account in your home town, or brokerage account, the way you do it is you walk in, you give them identification and you give them a check and you have an account. You know how you do it everywhere else in the world? You walk in, you give identification, and you give them a check. You too, can be the Indiana Jones of finance. You can wheel and deal in any country you want to, just go there on your next vacation and do it. If you don't want to do it that way, there are some mutual fund companies now that have money market funds denominated in foreign currencies. That is a second way to do it, it is not a very good way as far as I'm concerned, but if you don't want to go on vacation to one of these countries, consider that or go to Mark Twain bank. Sometimes you can do all this by mail. You'd be astonished at how the world has opened up now, or the Internet for all I know.<p>
Question: I have a question for all of you. It may be a little simplistic but for the next ten years, if each of you could only pick three stocks, what would they be? <p>
Sue Herera: To buy? You want both long and short? This could take a while, hang on to your questions, why don't we start with you Michael, we'll start at that end and work down.<p>
Michael Murphy:  Well, actually, at this point you have choices I think in both the PC side and the biotech side. And if you're only going to buy one, you buy the absolute best quality company that's beaten down on the PC side, that's Intel. You know at $57 a share, I think it's an absolute gift and they can't push the stock below $50. How ever hard they try, it probably won't go below $55. <p>
I'd pick two on the biotech side, and since we're talking ten years, I'm trying to balance out that long, if it was shorter term, I'd do more electronics, but I'd take Intel in electronics, and on the biotech side I'd take VICAL [Nasdaq: VICL] which is the leading company in gene therapy, which is a fundamental basic technology that is going to be used widely curing diseases. And, I'd also take Human Genome Sciences, Inc. [Nasdaq: HGSI] which is a company, I actually wouldn't buy that stock today, it's a little high, but if you're giving me a ten year period, they're sequencing the human genome and they're going to wind up with about half of the patents on human genes, which is a pile of intellectual property, that they can just take out and exploit every which way over the next ten, twenty years.<p>
Sue Herera: How much would it have to drop before it looked attractive to you?<p>
Michael Murphy: I'd like to buy the stock in the mid-thirties and it's kind of floating around forty-plus, so you know how Wall Street is, the slightest bit of bad news one day and they could knock it down very easily.<p>
Sue Herera: Okay John, you're next.<p>
John Dessauer: Well, ten years is a long call, but on Wall Street we do have to create a portfolio at the beginning of every year, and then you're not allowed to change it during the year. And, last year, I was fortunate enough to be the winner of that contest. Eight stocks, all US, by the way, last year, 100 percent US, were up 63.3 percent. This year, we submitted a portfolio of ten stocks and there were four newcomers in there and no repeaters from last year. A total of ten, four were foreign stocks, and I don't know how you're doing so far in the first quarter of 1996, but I got the score this morning from Wall Street Week and that portfolio is up 23.27 percent so far in 1996. So, year by year, I'm okay. But, ten years out, that's a tough one. Because I remember a company my father was associated with called Xerox. And, in the early 1970s Xerox was a hot stock, and believed to be a company that would do very well. In 1973, before the break, Xerox was $174 a share, it's about $112 today, and there have been no splits. The company has done very well. <p>
So you really have two problems when you look down ten years. One of them is to get a company that does well, the other is to get a stock that the rest of the world will recognize as well as you. So, even though I'll give you three ideas for ten years out, I'd say you've got to really look at them more often than that, maybe every six months or so and see if the future still looks okay. But, the three I would pick, you need a China-play in there, and I think the style becoming recognized as one of the better China-plays is Charoen Pok Phand. That's not a little company, it's over a billion-dollars in market cap. I refer to it as the chicken-feed company, and through about eighty-five joint ventures in China they're involved in the feed for chickens, raising chickens, Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises. Its majority share is owned by a Chinese family in Thailand, but a lot of the shares are owned not only by people like myself, but the Templeton Organization, and I think Fidelity has taken a bite out of Pok Phand also. <p>
Next, I agree with Michael. You've got to be in telecommunications somehow. There the choice gets tougher, though. I mean, I think I would pick again a company that's certainly global, and the phone business, that would be maybe a company like Cable and Wireless [NYSE: CWP]; or in the equipment business, a company like Ericsson [Nasdaq: ERICY], and their stock is down today, and therefore buyable today. Ericsson out of Sweden, ERICY over the counter. I think I've gotten to know Lars Renquist fairly well anyway, and I think he's one of the true visionaries in the business when in comes to technology.<p>
And finally the question we had before, banking. I believe that the world's going to be a better place, rather than a worse place. My choice would be a bank like Banco Santander [NYSE: STD], a big Spanish bank that, by the way, now owns 11 percent of the sixth largest bank in the United States as well as First Union. <p>
Sue Herera: All right, Jim. What do you like?<p>
Jim Dines: First of all, I'm very proud to be on this stage with a lot of really good long-term talent, there is a lot of experience here and I'm sure they would agree with me that The Dines Letter feels that this is a market we've never seen before, that something very unusual is happening now, and there are a number of brand new factors involved. <p>
The first one is that the world is growing up economically as never before, and this is a brand new situation. Managements have never been so motivated for shareholders value, the buyoffs, the layoffs, anything; and, yeah, Mike is right, the old economy is dead, but you know you're getting companies like Eastman Kodak, and General Motors and Allied Chemical that are taking these old prosaic industries and bringing big profits, so you can make a lot of money on these stocks. <p>
I want to talk to you people. You know, a lot of you are beginners in the stock market. You're coming into the market for the first time, you're turning from the poor results in real estate in recent years, and you're pouring into the natural entry place, which is mutual funds, for those who are too lazy to pick their own stocks. But I want you to understand that we are now in a special time. Even the government is thinking of putting Social Security money in the stock market. This is the end of a great mania, and there's a lot of interest, I noticed, in the audience to Jim Rogers, on the international markets. You mean you can't find anything good to invest in, in this country? You want to go to Uganda and buy a bank there? <p>
I'm not sure, you know you better think about sobering up, because this is a very dangerous business, and a lot of you people have never seen a bear market before, and we're going to have one sooner or later. My mass psychology book talks about how all gamblers secretly want to lose, you know, and a lot of people who are betting the rent money are going to have a very moving experience. And, sooner or later, we're going to have a bear market, some terrorist will blow up a nuclear device in a city or a Japanese bank will fail or something weird will happen. <p>
I want you all to reflect before you go crazy on the stock market, that sooner or later, there will be a stampede out of the market. And when it does, there will be not enough buyers around to buy all your mutual funds. You will have the same problem with mutual funds that you had with real estate, and that is the liquidity. So, I think you should consider being a little conservative also. So, having said all that, I will certainly agree with Jim Rogers about getting money out of the country, I've been telling my subscribers that for years and that is to get the money out of the country and invisible it. Because things are going to happen on the currency market and that will be tied into gold. <p>
So which of the three stocks do I like most? First of all, I would pick one gold stock in that group and I would stay with it. To me, the management is more important than the product. I'm very into management. I find that high quality managements, the stocks are always overpriced and you buy them before they always get more so. So, I would stay with Barrick Gold [NYSE: ABX], we got in that stock about 10 and it's about 30 now and I think it's going to 100. The second one would be oil and to me the smartest oil management is Royal Dutch Petroleum [NYSE: RD]. And, don't worry about the high price of the stock, that's another beautiful blue chip you can put in any portfolio. And the third one should be in technology, and it's got to be a company that's going to make it, and I tell you who I bet on, Bill Gates. I think he's smart as hell. Even though he missed the PC revolution he's waking up to the Internet, moving very quickly, signing deals with a lot of other alliances, a lot of other companies. I almost picked America Online instead of Microsoft, you pick either one because they're both good. But those are my three.<p>
Sue Herera: All right, Don. Where are you going to be?<p>
Don Phillips: Well, you said we were allowed to pick funds instead of stocks. <p>
Sue Herera: Yes, yes, that's a given. Unless you want to go out on a real limb?<p>
Don Phillips: I would buy a contrarian, blue chip quality-oriented domestic fund, akin to say Sequoia which is closed, so maybe I'd recommend a Clipper fund, managed by Jim Gibson or Selected American Shares, run by Shelby Davis who just has a spectacular long term record in New York Venture. I'd buy a natural resources fund, T. Rowe Price New Era would be a good choice there or Vanguard Energy. And, I'd buy an emerging markets fund and I'd look for someone with a proven track record there, and there are really two names since Jimmy isn't gracing us with a closed-end fund that he's running. I'd look for John M. Mussey, who runs the Colonial Newport Tiger Fund, I think he's exceptionally bright, and obviously Mark Mobius at Templeton. The opportunity to buy Mobius at Templeton in the closed-end arena, a couple of his funds like the Templeton Dragon fund are selling at double-digit discounts, and I think that would be a very attractive investment over the next decade. <p>
Sue Herera: All right, Liz what's on your wish list?<p>
Elizabeth Bramwell: Okay, well I think I would have something in the drug area. And, I think looking out on a ten-year basis, which is an interesting framework, I think I would choose Roche, which is a Swiss drug company which owns Genentech, so we could go into the biotech area. I think one of the global franchise consumer companies. . .I guess I'd go along with Coca-Cola, though it's at 82 or so at this point in time, but on a ten-year basis I think all the little wobbles kind of wash out and a high-priced stock can continue to be a high-priced stock and clip along and in the low penetration in the multiple parts of the world. And then I think in the industrial area, I would pick a company that really supplies numerous industries, and I think I'd probably go along with something like Illinois Tool Works [NYSE: ITW], which is the largest fastener company.<p>
Sue Herera: Now Jimmy, all your money is out of the country, so you won't be buying any stock, right? <p>
Jim Rogers: No, I will give you three, I will play the game. I would buy the CRB Index, I would buy the Goldman-Sachs Index and I would buy any stock in Venezuela. Any stock in Iran would be better but it's illegal for Americans to buy Iran now, so, if you're foreign, you can buy any stock in Iran; failing that, any stock in Venezuela.<p>
Sue Herera: All right, let's move down here. CRB Index, Goldman-Sachs Index and any stock in Venezuela. Fair enough. All right, here we go.<p>
Question: My question is for Jimmy Rogers. I happen to agree with you that we're in a cyclical market for commodities, because I don't think you could have an emerging country that needs to build roads and houses, etc., etc., it needs basic materials. But I want you to tell me where I'm wrong because I disagree with you about wage pressures, because I know you're an inflationary person at this point. You think commodities and wages are going to drive up inflation, and I understand the commodity, but we're going through a historical period, as Jim Dines said, with a shift of labor. Unless we get population control under control, we're going to have too many people for the amount of positions that we can support. And I think that's what's going to happen, is that the emerging markets, wages are going to go up, but the developing markets, wages are going to go down, so that on balance you're going to have not a lot of wage pressure. Where am I wrong?<p>
Jim Rogers: Traditionally, the way that inflation has worked is you've had the prices of things go up and then the spouse goes down to the supermarket and comes home and says, Spouse, you've got to get more money because the price of eggs has gone up, or the price of bacon or whatever. The wage pressures come after the pressure of things, of paper, whatever it happens to be, that's the way it's always worked in the past. Your argument is that there is all this labor out there. Well, let me explain to you. <p>
They've all seen Dallas on TV now, they all want to live like we do. They all want to buy a pair of tennis shoes. They want to buy it. If you think they're just going to sit out there and work for a dollar a day, so that we can sit here and not have inflation, let me introduce you to the real world. Because all those people who are now coming into the world economy, are going to compete with us to buy, as well as to sell things, and they want to have a better life, too. Just to give you a couple of examples, as you may know the world inventories of everything are at the lowest levels in recorded history, oils, zinc, lead, grains, everything, we're going to have bad crops before long, I don't know when or where, we're going to have some dislocation before long. <p>
It is the official policy of the Chinese government, right now, one of their next immediate goals, and that's for everybody in China to have two more eggs a week. Well, you say, big deal, we can go across the street and buy two more eggs no problem with that at all. Now this is not some pipe dream that the Chinese have, they want to do it now, 'cause they want to benefit from all this new prosperity they have. If they get two more eggs per week in China, that will consume the entire grain crop of Australia, and Australia is one of the five largest grain producing countries in the world, their entire crop, not the extra crop, the entire crop. So you have enormous demand pressures coming, you have enormous supply problems in the world. Everybody is going to be trying to buy when there is a very narrow window and very narrow inventories. That will lead all the way to wage pressures.<p>
Question: This is for John Dessauer. There is a negative article written in Forbes on Vietnam, I think it was March 25th of this year (if I may say, it wasn't too negative), in discussing how the government is stifling foreign investment through their demand of joint ventureship, the understanding being that it's important for Communist government to embrace the foreign investment coming in, in order for the society to proliferate as you were saying. Can you comment on that?<p>
John Dessauer: It's a problem not just in Vietnam, but everywhere you've had Communism before. The basic problem is that everything is owned by the state, right? All companies, all land, all farms, all private property belonged to the state. And so now the problem is, how do you get rid of the state ownership, it's now a problem peculiar to Vietnam. By the way, we've seen all the privatizations in France, haven't we, too? And privatizations in the UK and elsewhere, Europe went through this period where the government acquired everything and then you have to get it back in the private sector. And there is a debate, Vietnam is probably ten years behind China in evolving the official political approach to how to make the transition from the state owning the factory to private enterprise. But, I can tell you from visiting with government officials last fall there, that I'm quite impressed with their official long term plan. <p>
Now let me say something, when I go to China in a few weeks time, I'm going with a  Chinese gentleman who grew up during the cultural revolution, a very intelligent Chinese gentleman. He said to me on the phone from Shanghai the other day, he said, "When you go to Shanghai, we want to go and talk to the economic officials, right?" I said, "Right." He said, "But not to the top people here," and I said, "Why not talk to the top?" And he said, "Because in Asia, the top people, they never know anything, you've got to go and talk to the people who are getting it done." Here too. So when you talk to the people who are getting it done in China or Vietnam, you see a very intelligent plan. <p>
There's a lot talk about when will Vietnam have a stock market, and the information I got is, that they are going to follow the Taiwan model, that as they privatize the good businesses now owned by the government, the shares are going to go to the people of Vietnam and literally the stock exchange in Vietnam will be for the Vietnamese, and only later will the stock exchange open up to outside investors. So I think what you read in the press is often true as far as it goes, it just doesn't go far enough, and I wouldn't get too hung up on the problems that these countries in Asia are facing in their transition from Communism to an open market. <p>
Question: I've seen some reports that the next big craze in computers is going to be 3-D computer games. And, with this it will drive the memory requirements of the computer way up. Do any of you have any comment on this and the current sell-off of computer memory stock? <p>
Sue Herera: It sounds like you, Michael. <p>
Michael Murphy: Yes, at least let me start on that one. Well, that's certainly true, 3-D is an expensive graphics application that has lived on sort-of $20,000 workstations for the last five years, and like everything in technology, it now gets squeezed down and pushed onto an add-on board, onto PC's and then probably five years from now, Intel will add it into their chip, and it will be part of the microprocessor. So it is one of the big drivers, like video teleconferencing, which happens to use a lot of the same software and hardware. <p>
We just recently, in fact in the last issue, recommended Diamond Multimedia as a way to play. It's an add-on board company. It is just one, though, of several new applications, including voice recognition and videoconferencing that are going to continue to drive this whole electronics, computing/communications thing for the next five or ten years. The reason that you keep getting new things driving it, is because the cost of doing the computing comes down so fast, that stuff you can literally do only today on a super-computer, you know within the next ten years you'll be able to do on a home computer sitting on top of your TV set. It's just inevitable that you'll get there from here. <p>
I don't see any reason for this to slow down and what a lot of the panel has said, and maybe the last thing we ought to leave you with is, it is managements that really ultimately make the difference, because the whole world is changing. A lot of things are changing fast, and the products that people make today, are not the products they're going to be making ten years from now. The places they do business aren't the places they are going to do business, maybe even the industries they're in, won't exactly be the industries they're in. But, if you can find those really good managements and associate your capital with them at reasonable prices, that's the way to cope with the rate of change for the next ten years. <p>
Sue Herera: I wish we had more time, so we'll just have to do it again next year. I want to thank all the panelists, you guys were terrific, it's been such a pleasure. I'd like to thank you all for coming. I hope that the rest of your seminar experience has been as good as it has been so far, it's been terrific for me, and I think all the panelists have enjoyed it as well. Thanks for a great time, we had a wonderful time with you, and I hope the rest of your afternoon is terrific.

					<font size=4>
						On Monday, March 25, 1996, Worth Financial Editor Elizabeth Macdonald joined Worth OnLine for "Conference Call: It's Tax Time." The hour-long live event focused on tax reform and the IRS. Following is a transcript from this event.<p>
WorthRoom: Tonight we have Elizabeth Macdonald, Worth's Financial Editor on taxes.<p>
WorthEdit1: We are pleased to have Liz with us here tonight. She  comes to us fresh from testifying before the House Ways  and Means Committee.<p>
TJF SRQ: Is she up for realty-related tax questions?<p>
WorthEdit1: Liz is here to talk about tax reform and the IRS.<p>
TJF SRQ: Teaching an elephant to tap dance, eh?<p>
Macdonald: You ain't kidding, TJF. Here's a little anecdote about me.  I've been writing about the IRS for the last 9 years. The  IRS got so angry with me at one point, its national  headquarters sent a memo out to all of its offices across  the country which said, "If Elizabeth Macdonald calls,  don't speak to her." I tried to use that memo to get a raise, but of course,  that didn't work.<p>
TJF SRQ: Well Liz, it's nice to have friends in high places.<p>
Jess14000: What annoys you most about the tax system?<p>
Macdonald: THE most annoying thing is this: When taxpayers call
  the IRS to get answers to their questions, and I'm  referring to its 800 help line, if the IRS gives taxpayers  erroneous answers, taxpayers get slammed with a  penalty, but they can't get those fines lifted unless the  IRS sent that information in writing. Now, I was on  CSpan last Wednesday talking to callers about this, and  lo and behold, the editor of Money Magazine, Frank Lalli  was on with me, and he said, "Well, we got advice from  the IRS in writing." Well, I said, you're Money Magazine,  of course they're going to write back to you. Fat chance  regular taxpayers can even GET THROUGH-7 out of ten  times, the lines are busy. Anyway, the point is, taxpayers  are all too often stuck dealing with a truly abysmal  system.<p>
TJF SRQ: What annoys me most is the thought that tax breaks only  benefit "the rich." I happened to get a call from the IRS many years ago over my caller I.D. system.  I now call right in to their local office on that "secret" line.<p>
Macdonald: Woo woo, what's that secret line all about? Can you give it to me?<p>
TJF SRQ: Caller I.D. solves lots of problems! How successful will tax reform be without spending  reform?<p>
Macdonald: Awesome question, TJF. Here's the deal. The federal  income tax costs individuals $501.2 billion, and that's  just from individuals. For corporations, it costs about $150 billion. The government collects the rest from  excise taxes and the like. So, it collects about $1.3  trillion or so each year. But, it's spending about $250  billion or so more than what it collects. So what you've  got is a usurious system and a government that sticks a  crowbar in our wallets, but won't get off public feedbag.  Remember the government replaced the billions in the  Social Security trust fund with IOUs. So you're right, spending reform is a must, but it can go hand in hand  with tax reform, too.<p>
TJF SRQ: Given the choice, I would opt out of social security and  invest on my own. Your thoughts?<p>
JAKE585: I may be a little bit cynical, but I don't think any thing of significance will happen on taxes.<p>
Macdonald: Well the question is whether fiddling around with S.S.  privatization would give all of us an easy street  retirement. Currently, a privatization task force  populated by the likes of Robert Ball, former Social  Security Administration chairman, is split between  privatization and keeping the status quo. Currently, the  system pays $336 billion a year to some 43 million  beneficiaries, and the system is due to slide into the red  beginning in 2013, and completely by 2020.<p>
 Five of the panels 13 members are privatizers. They  would slash workers 6.2 percent S.S. tax to 1.2 percent  and require that they invest the remaining 5 percent in  Personal Savings accounts, which you'd set up at a bank,  brokerage or mutual fund. You could then invest in any  asset, (including junk bonds) and after age 62 begin  drawing down. The thing is, we've been paying this tax all  along, right? And the government always bailed out  if you make a bad call in your own PSA. Will the  government then bail you out, which is the ethical thing  to do? No word yet on what they're deciding about this.  But I'll tell you, these personal investment plans have  been around since the dawn of the 80s, and that's always been a major sticking point.<p>
STheis8654: Elizabeth, can you guess for me the date and possible  amount of any capital gains tax relief?<p>
Macdonald: Well, STheis 8654, you won't see any capital gains relief  until after the election. The last version offered by  Congressional republicans would have sent about $27  billion back, but don't hold me to that number, over five  years or so. Anyway, the interesting thing about the way  the Republicans wrote this capital gains tax cut is this:  They set it up as a 50 percent deduction, for an effective 19.8 percent rate (half the top effective 39.6 percent  bracket). So, what that means is, and this one's a doozy,  is that it's an above the line item--taxpayers would  factor that deduction in when calculating their adjusted  gross income. So, if this deduction then	effectively  lowers AGI, what does that mean for taxpayers? You got  it--a lower threshold to hurdle for medical expenses (currently you can only deduct medical expenses that  exceed 7.5 percent of your AGI) and for other write-offs.  Mum's the word on this one, let's not let Congress know  about this break, okay?<p>
WorthRoom: Liz, what do you think of the portion of the debate on the  flat tax involving the home mortgage interest  deduction? Some say it will not matter, others say that  it will have damaging effects on the real estate market.<p>
Macdonald: Well, ignore those who tell you it won't matter. It  sure as heck will, by as much as a 15 percent drop in  property values. Now, you probably saw the DRI-McGraw Hill report on it. But what's really interesting too, about  the flat tax debate is that banks won't have to pay taxes  on the interest income it, or they, rather, receive, so  many believe rates will drop, too, thereby making it  easier for first time home buyers. I think the market can  survive this fall off, especially given the boom in home  purchases if rates do fall. I know it's a hot and  controversial debate though, one that has many  established economists stumped. But even so, the  difference in tax exempt and taxable bonds, many  economists believe, is a premium taxpayers are  willing to pay. So, the thinking is, rates could fall to tax-exempt level, which is about 6 percent or so. I'll be watching this one, and write me if you have any more  thoughts about it.<p>
SSGuest: What are some of stupid things taxpayers do that  taxpayers do to clue the IRS in on the fact that they're  cheating?<p>
Shooter925: Elizabeth:  Any tax reform currently on the table for  single parents, i.e. child care deductions, college tuition,  etc.?<p>
WorthEdit1: First we'll take the tax cheat question, then we'll go on  to the single parent one.<p>
Macdonald: YAY! A question about the IRS, my favorite subject.
 Stupid tax tricks abound, say the IRS auditors I  interviewed for our April story. You remember when  Ralph Kramden lapsed into his trademark hummuna  hummuna when the IRS called him in for not signing his return? Well, the IRS loves to catch taxpayers  twitching or biting their nails, as that's a dead giveaway  something is wrong with a return. But here are the others  boneheaded things they love to nail taxpayers for:  Sympathy plays are quite common. Many taxpayers think  crying will wipe out their bills. Wrong. One auditor told  me she gives taxpayers a tissue and tell them yeah,  right, get on with it. Another is trying to be friends with  the auditor, by, say, talking to them on a first-name  basis. Auditors hate that, as I would too, if someone got  chummy with me too fast. But here's the best one I heard:  Many taxpayers try to alter the canceled checks they use  to justify write-offs by putting in a number ahead of the  others appearing in the check amount box and on the  check amount line. For example, instead of a $75 check,  it miraculously becomes $575. Get it? Guess what? Every  time a bank cancels out a check, it prints the correct amount it was cashed for below the signature line in the  bottom right hand corner. Whooooops!<p>
WorthEdit1: Now we have a question from Shooter925, who asks if  there are any tax reform breaks for single parents such  as child care deductions or breaks for college tuition?<p>
Macdonald: The Contract on the American Family, WHOOPS with the American Family has a $500 family tax credit in it, but  that's currently stalled in Congress. Clinton just offered  up a tax credit for families who earn $75,000 or below,  but it starts out as $300 in 1996 and increases to $500  by 1999. He also proposed a $5,000 deduction for  education and training beginning in 1996, and increasing  to $10,000 by 1999, thereby turning $41 billion back to  voters. And that's the operative word here-- As you'll  remember, Clinton is one of the biggest flim-flammers ever to hit the Capitol. And besides, why give parents a  tax break that their children will have to inherit later on  any way? Just like Clinton's vaunted middle class tax  cut, which is WHY WE ELECTED HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE, I  don't put much stock in all this talk of transparent tax  cuts. Boy, it gets me so mad even thinking about it. I probably won't get a good night's sleep now, so let's drop  this one, okay?<p>
WorthEdit1: JugOPunch has a question about tuition reimbursement. Should he file for an extension hoping Congress extends  exemption, or report it as another income on line 21?<p>
Macdonald: JugOPunch, so far, Congress has not attached a rider
 to any legislation that would extend the $5,250  education reimbursement. And that's truly upsetting to me. But let me say this about filing extensions. I had  heard for the last 5 years that the IRS won't audit  returns that are filed with an extension, meaning, those  returns filed after April 15th. I could never get  verification for this, but I'm happy to say I finally did.  Some former IRS workers now say that any returns filed  after mid-June likely won't be audited, because the IRS  will have already scored those that came in on time and  sent along those returns to one of its 63 district offices  for audit, (a district office houses the IRS audit team). I  had always thought that to be an old wives tale, but now  I'm more convinced it's true, and it makes perfect sense.  But keep reading the Wall Street Journal (we're a  monthly, not a daily, sorry) for more updates on the  education reimbursement, okay? I'll stay on it, too.  Thanks.<p>
JugOPunch: Thanks, I just would prefer not to inform the IRS about  the tuition until I absolutely must.<p>
WorthEdit1: We have about five more minutes. Any questions?<p>
RBinzIV: Any tax relief/credits on the horizon for children sent to private/parochial schools ?<p>
Macdonald: I heard testimony on the hill about the need for tax
 relief for parochial school tuition, but it went nowhere.  But I'll tell you this--this IRS is on the look out for  taxpayers who deduct this tuition as a charitable  write-off. That's just a sidebar comment from me, I  want to keep you posted about what's going on. Thanks  for the good question.<p>
RBinzIV: Thank you Elizabeth, Good night.<p>
WorthEdit1: We have one more question from Jess14000. Will tax  reform actually happen?<p>
Macdonald: Well, the whole tax reform discussion reminds me of a
 quote from George Bernard Shaw, "If you laid all the  economists in the world end to end, they'd never reach a  conclusion." So, that about says it all. Expect to see  Congress collapse the number of brackets, and move  toward some flat tax style measures. The current code is  hated by one and all, as "it makes more liars out of  Americans than golf has," to paraphrase Will Rogers. And  no, I don't brush my teeth with Bartlett's Book of  Quotations. But I do sincerely hope, hope, hope for  considerable reform, because we simply can't go on like this.<p>
WorthEdit1: I'd like to thank everyone for being here tonight. Great questions. In the words of... oh, never mind. But seriously. Thank you Liz Macdonald for being with us  tonight.<p>
SSGuest: Thanks, Liz.<p>
WorthRoom: Thanks Liz!!<p>
DAnliker: tks<p>
WorthEdit1: Thank you all for being here. We are planning on making  these chats--we call them "Conference Call" a regular  feature on Worth OnLine.<p>
Macdonald: And thank you all for a great conversation. Good night!

Today's hearings begin the first of three phases of the House Ways and Means Committee hearings on tax reform. The first phase focuses on the problems with the current code. The second hearing, on March 27, will look at the impact that changing the code would have on the overall economy. Starting in April and continuing through the fall, the committee will hold three to five hearings a month examining the impact of tax reform on various sectors of the economy. Last year, the Committee heard three days of preliminary hearings on proposals to replace the current Federal tax system.<p>
Presiding over these hearings is Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-Texas), who has stated that his goal is to see a new code signed into law "during the first year of the next president's term." Archer is a supporter of the consumption tax.<p>
The hearings are taking place in the main Committee hearing room in the Longworth House Office Building on Capitol Hill where invited witnesses will testify during two panel presentations. After the members of each panel present their testimony, the floor will open up for a question and answer period.<p>

<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>DIGGING UP ROOTS</font></b><p>
During a photo-op session with the press, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer displayed the original 16-page income tax bill that was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson in 1913. (The tax code was so controversial that President Wilson was exempted from paying the tax if he signed it.) "This small 19-inch baby is the original document that grew up to become today's monster," Archer said while reaching under the podium to hoist the current multi-volume forms and filing instructions.  <p>
The 1913 income tax law was aimed at the rich. Citizens who made less than $20,000 were exempt--$20,000 in today's terms is the equivalent of $100,000. <p>
Ironically, Archer pointed out, the original tax bill represents the very roots of the tax law that he plans to dig up and throw away.<p>

10:20 a.m.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>EVEN THE PROS ARE CONFUSED</font></b><p>
Before hearing from the first panel of witnesses, Archer explained that he intended today's tax hearings to be bi-partisan and in-depth. The witnesses were invited to talk about the complexities and problems with the current code to help the Committee consider "fairer, simpler, less intrusive proposals for tax reform," he said. <p>
Net week, leading economists will testify on how a change in the tax system can lead to a stronger economy.<p>
The first witness was Frank Lalli, Managing Editor of Money magazine. After Congress passed the sweeping tax reforms in 1986, Money gave an open-book exam to 50 vounteer tax preparers. The exam, given in January 1988, gave a financial profile of a hypothetical family. The volunteers were asked to prepare tax returns based on the information. The results, according to Lalli: The 50 pros computed 50 different amounts of tax that the same family owed. The tax bills varied by nearly 50%--from $7,200 to about $12,000.<p>
However, critics on the Hill and at the D.C. publication Tax Notes say that the Money test was inordinately difficult and does not represent the typical American taxpayer's return.<p>
Lalli also asked the committee to review the results of a January poll of taxpayers across the country that Money conducted. The majority (84%) agreed that the U.S. tax system needs a major overhaul. Fifty nine percent said the number-one goal should be fairness. "Despite the push for a flat tax, 64% of the taxpayers said the rich should pay more tax than others," Lalli said. The poll stated that 33% favored a flat tax,16% liked a national sales tax, and 19% wanted a plan to tax income minus savings. "And let me add this note: Most taxpayers (59%) said tax reform will not influence their votes in November."<p>
However, the Money poll findings were based 'on a small sample' of taxpayers, says a Money editor, and therefore may be of limited use and unrepresentative of the American public at large (Money would not say how many taxpayers were polled).<p>

Live from the House Ways and Means Committee tax reform hearings in Washington, D.C.:<p>
<p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>HIDDEN COSTS</font></b><p>
Compliance with the entire federal tax system will cost Americans almost $225 billion in 1996, according to today's second witness, Arthur P. Hall, Ph.D., senior economist for the Tax Foundation. The rules and regulations for the Federal income tax alone account for approximately $157 billion of this cost, according to Tax Foundation figures.<p>
"One way to comprehend the magnitude of this is to imagine wantonly destroying every vehicle produced by the Ford Motor Company and more than one-third of the vehicles produced by the Chrysler Corporation," Hall said. <p>
"The cost of complying with a tax system is directly related to the complexity of the system," he said.  "The Flat Tax and the USA Tax System immediately eliminate complexities and, therefore, their attendant compliance costs." Hall strongly advocated dumping the income tax in favor of a simpler version of either of these taxes. <p>
However, says Worth's Financial Editor Elizabeth Macdonald, advocates of reform "still need to honestly deliver the facts about these proposals." For one, says Macdonald, the flat tax proposed by Rep. Dick Armey (R-TX) would not abolish all deductions, as currently touted. For example, one deduction not only survives, but increases--the business entertainment deduction, which would increase from 50 percent to 100 percent, according to officials in Armey's office. <p>
Furthermore, the large standard deductions in Armey's flat tax, and the two proposed by former presidential candidates Steve Forbes and Phil Gramm would effectively knock a large swath of taxpayers out of the tax system. For example, Forbes's exemption for a family of four would be roughly $36,000. "What that means," says Macdonald, "is that these families would get to vote for and receive government services, but would not have to pay a nickel in taxes."<p>

11:04 a.m.<p>
<p><a name="SUB5"><b><font size=+1>THE MAGIC NUMBER</font></b><p>
What is the maximum tax Americans are willing to pay? According to a Reader's Digest/Roper Center poll, Americans believe that the most a family of four should pay is 25 percent (including income, Social Security, sales, and property taxes). Under the current system, the average family of four with an income of $200,000 pays about 39 percent, according to The Tax Foundation.<p>
Would a single mom on welfare answer differently than the head of an affluent family of four? Actually, no. And the overwhelming unanimity of the 25-percent benchmark was what witness Rachel Wildavsky, senior staff editor of The Reader's Digest magazine, emphasized during her testimony in front of the House. <p>
"Male respondents to our poll thought that 25 percent should be the top for any family. So did female respondents. So did respondents earning $75,000 per year or more. So did respondents earning less than $30,000. So did blacks, whites, conservatives, liberals--I could go on," she said. "If you asked whether the ocean was wet you'd probably find this kind of unanimity."<p>
The magazine published the results of the October 1995 survey in February in an article entitled "How Fair Are Our Taxes?" <p>
The Reader's Digest poll also showed that most Americans believe that they are overtaxed. No surprises there. But they believe their neighbors--both poor and rich--are too. What's more, the survey refuted the supposed beef working- and middle-class Americans have with their affluent counterparts. "Our poll found no support whatsoever for the claim that affluent Americans are not paying 'their fair share,'" Wildavsky said.<p>
During the question-and-answer period, Representative Sam Gibbons (D-FL) said that the 25 percent figure was unrealistic: "That would take a revolution of the tax code because the needs of government are greater than 25 percent of the American citizen's income."<p>

"The government always promises not to misuse information," said this morning's final witness. Then David Burnham, author of "A Law onto Itself: The IRS and the Abuse ofPower," went on outline how the IRS has in fact become "the nation's single most powerful instrument of social control."<p>
"The use of the IRS and its information for improper political purposes has gone forward on the basis of direct orders from the most senior officials of the government, including several presidents," Burnham said.<p>
His list of abusers included John F. Kennedy, under whose leadership the IRS stripped tax exempt status from conservative groups that spoke out against his administration. Under Richard Nixon, Burnham said, the IRS formed the Special Service Staff, a secret IRS unit that for a short period of time audited political dissidents.<p>

In Part 1 of "Worth Goes to Washington" witnesses before the House Ways and Means Committee talked about the inefficiencies of the current tax code and the abuses of the IRS.  Worth has written extensively on the topic.<p>
In October 1995, Worth reported that the current income tax is riddled with $500 billion in loopholes permitting some millionaires to pay no income taxes whatsoever. "Cheats rip off the government by roughly $127 billion each year, while honest taxpayers spend more than $100 billion a year to figure out what they owe," wrote Elizabeth Macdonald in "Tax Reform Unplugged."<p>
How do these overwhelming numbers affect the individual taxpayer? The second panel of witnesses before the House Ways and Means Committee will offer testimony that will illustrate the extraordinary effect the current convoluted code has on ordinary taxpayers.<p>
The first witness is Worth's financial editor Elizabeth Macdonald. Stay tuned for excerpts from her testimony.<p>

The second panel of witnesses began with Worth financial editor Elizabeth Macdonald, a specialist in income tax issues. She appears frequently on CNN and CNBC, as well as on the CBS Evening News, the Today Show, and National Public Radio.<p>
She joined Worth in 1994 after nine years with Money magazine. She has won seven major business journalism awards, including the Gerald Loeb Award for her series on the Internal Revenue Service.<p>
Macdonald has written extensively about the problems with the current system of tax collection. Her most recent story, "Putting a Face on Fear" in the April issue of Worth, looks at the real live human beings behind the terrifying, all-powerful IRS. <p>
During her testimony before the House panel, Macdonald outlined her opinion as to the main problem at the IRS: a division that has driven a wedge between taxpayers and the government. "I firmly believe that this division is largely rooted in the IRS's intrusive, stone-cold, and intractable behavior," Macdonald said. "As a result, the American tax system is losing its sense of fairness and its moral suasion."<p>
Rather than endorsing a particular method of tax reform, Macdonald instead focused on the fact that no matter what system is implemented, one problem remains. "We'll still need a tax collector," Macdonald said. "I have decided to try to explain how the IRS's lack of concern is embedded in the rigid way it conducts its business of collecting taxes."<p>
Macdonald emphasized the bureaucratic overload prevalent in the managerial structure at the IRS. Anecdotally, Macdonald described the bureaucratic impediments that face IRS management. "This may be why top IRS officials seem driven to distraction on the agency's problems -- getting them to move on a project is the equivalent of squeezing 1,000 crickets into a jelly jar."<p>
Macdonald concluded with a suggestion to the lawmakers: "Make it a job requirement for the top IRS posts that an applicant have a management or even a military background, someone who knows what it's like to handle tens of thousands of people," she said, and reminded the panel that most IRS commissioners are tax lawyers. "They're probably perfectly good lawyers, but I truly do wonder about their managerial abilities."<p>

<p><a name="SUB9"><b><font size=+1>IRS AS PEEPING TOM</font></b><p>
Harvey Shulman, general counsel for the National Association of Computer Consultant Businesses, urged Congress to close the IRS's "peephole on America." <p>
"Unfortunately, our tax system delves too often into almost every aspect of the day-to-day transactions of America's businesses," said Shulman. Shulman has been a lawyer for mid-sized and small businesses, with gross revenues of between one million and one hundred million dollars, many of which are high-tech professional services.<p>
As Worth reported in a June 1995 story, "Privacy and the Self-Employed," the IRS believes that employers, eager to reduce administrative and benefit costs, intentionally mis-classify many employees as independent contractors. Independent contractors who pay their own payroll taxes often come under fire of the IRS because of their supposed propensity to cheat.<p>
Shulman was one of two lawyers for JasTech, a Cleveland-based computer-consulting firm that was slapped with a $287,000 assessment for failing to send in payroll taxes for 65 computer programmers in 1993. The programmers, who were originally classified as independent contractors, were reclassified by the IRS as JasTech employees. The reclassification, according to the Worth story, was based on 60 returns filed by the workers.<p>
Shulman and attorney Craig Etter filed a Freedom of Information Act suit in federal district court to get the workers' returns using a loophole in the privacy law. By January 1995, the Justice Department had released confidential IRS material from 48 returns to the attorneys.<p>
In his testimony, Shulman concluded: "In the debate over tax reform, the 'right to privacy' must receive the highest priority. We can no longer embrace a tax system that depends upon government sponsored financial voyeurism into the lives of America's individuals and businesses."<p>
The basic problem, says Worth's financial editor Elizabeth MacDonald, is that "the rules governing employee classification are the most subjective and arbitrary in the code. The IRS relies on a loose conglomeration of case law, workers' compensation law and employer tort liability rules as well as the agency's rules. It's an administrative nightmare."<p>

<p><a name="SUB10"><b><font size=+1>ONE FAMILY'S IRS NIGHTMARE</font></b><p>
Ann Cook is an ordinary taxpayer whose family was literally swept away in an extraordinary IRS nightmare. Worth wrote about Cook and her husband Frank in a March 1995 Worth story, "Breakdown at the IRS" by Elizabeth Macdonald, who testified earlier. <p>
Her story, as reported in Worth, is as follows: The Cook's were harassed for ten years by the IRS. It seems that the agency didn't register the family's move from the West to the East Coast, even though they notified the IRS in writing that they were moving to Hartford, Ct. from Seattle. That year, the IRS audited the couple's 1982, 1983, and 1984 returns and sent them a bill in Seattle for $6,300. The Cooks never received it and the IRS interpreted their silence as tax delinquency.<p>
Not until 1989, despite repeated phone calls and letters to the Hartford office, did the couple receive written notice of the audits the IRS conducted. Ironically, Frank Cook claims he had complete receipts for the deductions the agency disallowed back in 1985. Ultimately, the IRS seized $35,000 in salary and savings. The Cook family, including three children, was reduced to living for an entire year on $150 per week.<p>
"Our anger is directed not at the fact of being taxed," she testified, "but rather the process which allows such travesties to occur. We suffered the indignity of being put in a position of impovershment, literally overnight."<p>
Today, more than 10 years later, the Cooks the IRS continues to have a $25,000 lien against them.<p>
When questioned by Chairman Archer about what kind of tax she believed would be best she replied: "I don't think it matters what kind of tax you have--flat, consumption, income. It is the agency that is collectiong the taxes--the IRS--that is the real problem."<p>

<p><a name="SUB11"><b><font size=+1>Q&A WITH CONGRESSMAN CHRISTENSEN</font></b><p> 
As the tax reform hearings before the House Ways and Means Committee wrapped up, Worth OnLine conducted an exclusive interview with Congressman Jon Christensen (R-Neb). One of the big issues raised during today's testimony was the IRS's out-of-date methods of distinguishing  between employees and independent contractors.<p>
Congressman Christensen has sponsored a bill, HR1972, that would simplify the 20-point test the agency has laid out to determine who is an employee and who is an independent contractor. <p>
The bill he proposes would pare the current 20-part test down to three points. <p>
They are: 
1. Who does the employee take orders from--how independent are they from the entity?<p>
2. Where has the investment for the business and equipment come from?<p>
3. Does a contract exist between the two parties?<p>
Q: Why do you want to abolish the 20-point test?<p>
A: For example, one of these tests is, how much time do you spend atthe work site? The answer determines whether you are an employee of the company. The question is outdated. Given the telecommunications revolution, more people are working at home. <p>
Q: What is the status of the bill right now? <p>
A: We have held a few hearings already. We are holding the major hearing in early May with House Ways and Means. We urge all America Online and Worth OnLine readers to contact their congressmen and make sure they are a co-sponsor of HR1972. This is a truly bi-partisan bill.<p>
Q: Who is effected by this bill? <p>
A: It is an issue that is near and dear to people's hearts. Computer people, florists, home programmers. Silicon Valley applauds the movement. I am constantly getting suportive E-mails from workers there. <p>
Q: Who is opposed to this bill? <p>
Opposition is labor unions: They would much rather have the employee status. <p>
Even though helping small business is an important part of the Clinton administration's agenda, it will be hard to get it through because the core constituents from labor unions oppose the bill.<p>

In Worth OnLine's final dispatch of the day, Worth's financial editor Elizabeth Macdonald sums up the first day of tax reform hearings in front of the  House Ways and Means Committee.<p>
<p><a name="SUB12"><b><font size=+1>THE LONG AND TORTUROUS ROAD</font></b><p>
At the end of the hearings, it was clear to all who attended that Congress has embarked on a long and torturous road to fulfilling Archer's dreams of torpedoing the present system. <p>
It clearly showed as well the cast of characters who will be charged with the task of reforming the system, as well as the influences on Congress's decisionmaking. From the cranky, anti-government David Burnham, author of a book about the IRS, "A Law Unto Itself," who refused to answer the panel's questions about the efficacy of a flat tax, citing journalistic objectivity; to the sincere efforts of Reader's Digest's testimony about what the American public wants in a tax system, Congress got an earful.<p>
In the final analysis, the best example of the frustrating obstacles Congress faces in reforming the system came from one of its own members, Rep. Charles Rangel, (D-NY). Near the end of the hearing, Rep. Rangel asked the panel what annoys taxpayers the most about the present system. When the Reader's Digest representative answered "high rates," Rangel hollered, "But that's never going to change." Stay tuned. --Elizabeth Macdonald<p>

					<font size=4>
						On Friday, March 1, Worth Magazine OnLine cybercasted Peter Lynch live from Detroit. In a speech delivered to automotive executives, Lynch spoke about his views on the economy, investing strategies, and the stock market in general. <p>
Peter Lynch is probably the best known stock picker of our time and certainly among the most successful. He was portfolio manager of Fidelity Investments' Magellan fund for 13 years, starting out in 1977 with $20 million in assets and winding up his tenure in 1990 with more than one million shareholders and assets in excess of $14 billion. During that period, Lynch delivered an average annual return of just over 29 percent. <p>
Lynch has served as executive vice president and director of Fidelity Management & Research Company and managing director of FMR Corporation. He has also written three best selling books on investing, "One Up on Wall Street," "Beating the Street," and his latest, "Learn to Earn: a beginner's guide to the basics of investing and business" (Simon and Schuster). <p>
Since 1992, Lynch has written exclusively for Worth magazine. A complete archive of his work is available only on Worth OnLine. <p>
During his speech in Detroit, Lynch offered advice and insight helpful to people both within and outside of the automotive realm:<p>
ON AUTOMAKERS:
Chrysler was the biggest position in the Magellan Fund for four years, and [it] went up tenfold and made for four easy years, I'll tell you that. I always have a sweet spot when I see a minivan going down the road.<p>
ON STOCKS:
Know what you own. You can't believe how many people buy stocks and have no idea what they own. This is the kind of stock people like to invest in: a relatively simple company -- they make a one megabyte S RAM, C mos bipolar risk floating point data IRO, 16 bit dual port memory, wet (SOEPL), four megaflop pale silicone emitter, a high band -- six gigahertz, double mentalization communication protocol and I sink nus, four wave, lead memory, token ring...If you own a piece of junk like that, you will never make money. Never. A silicon emitter? You will have no idea, but people buy stuff like this all the time. It just amazes me. These are people who are careful when they buy a toaster or something, and they'll hear about one of these things on the way to work and put $10,000 into it before sunset. And I bought companies like Dunkin' Donuts that I can understand. You have a recession and you don't have to worry. You don't have to worry about Korean imports or that somebody invented a new doughnut.<p>
If you come away from this with one thing, know what you own. You ought to be able to explain to a 7th grader in three minutes or less why you own this stock. What's the story? Not 'the sucker is going up' ... That is not the reason you own the stock. I tried that. That didn't work, either.<p>
PREDICTING THE MARKET:<p>
It is futile to predict the economy, predict the interest rates, predict the stock market ... Most people in the room were around in 1980, 1981. Did anybody tell you that we were going to have a 20 percent prime rate ... 12 percent unemployment, 14 percent inflation? I didn't get that phone call. I always said if you spend 13 minutes a year on economics you haev wasted 11 minutes.<p>
If you can predict interest rates correctly three times in a row on $10,000 you could have a billion dollars. There are not that many billionaires around. No one can predict interest rates.<p>
Now, I want to be very fair. I'm talking about forecasting the future. If I own a lot of auto stocks, I want to know what's happening with used car prices. If I own hotel stock, I want to know what's happening with inventories. This is stuff you can figure out. I want to know what's happening with inventories.<p>
'We're going to have a recession,' those people tell you that. 'That is totally wasted.' It is like predicting the weather three months in advance. Not in Arizona, just in New England or the Midwest. It doesn't work.<p>
You can't believe how much time people spend on predicting the stock market, the economy, interest rates. If you can predict interest rates correctly three times in a row on $10,000 you could have a billion dollars. There are not that many billionaires around. No one can predict interest rates. <p>
INVESTING:
You have plenty of time. People are so amazingly impatient to buy something. You could have bought Wal-Mart ten years after it went public. Very conservative person, you say? You could have made 30 times your money ... Microsoft, you could have made 25 times your money ... You have plenty of time to do the stuff. You don't have to do it in one minute.<p>
Check the facts rather than all the stuff about what is happening with the stock, has it gone up or down. You shouldn't care. You just say, what's the story? ... Eventually they always come back.<p>
People have great information. Imagine all the people who knew when Smith-Kline introduced a product called Tagamet ...  One year after it was on the market, all the people whose wives, husbands, mothers, fathers were cured of ulcers by Tagamet could have bought Smith-Kline and made 15 times their money .. But all the people in the pharmacies are buying oil drilling stocks. <p>
FAULTY MINDSETS:
Now I would like to get out dangerous things people say about stocks. Here's a good one: It's gone down this much already, it can't go much lower. I remember when Polaroid went from 140 to 110 and people said, 'If Polaroid goes below 100 back up the truck and buy it up.' They don't know anything about Polaroid but they said it's a good stock, all this technology, if it gets under 100, buy it. It went from 140 to 95 -- I mean, how much lower can it go? So you bought it. Within 12 months, the stock was 16. This is a company with no debt, it was overpriced at 100. They just introduced the camera no one wanted that didn't work and it was expensive, and other than that they were doing well. But they bought it just because it went from 140 to 90. <p>
I told people to buy Kaiser Industries and I said, 'The stock has gone from 29 to 16 -- how much lower can it go?' We then bought the largest block ever, I think, in the history of the American Stock Exchange -- 15 million shares at 14-3/4. At 10 I called my mother and said, 'Mom, the stock has gone from 29 to 10 -- how much lower can it go?' It went to 9,8,7,6,5,4 ... it happened fast so I kept my job. But I knew the story and I said there is something wrong. <p>
I was early on this at 14-3/4. At 4, the company is 25 million shares and the whole value of the company is a hundred million dollars, they own all of Kaiser Broadcasting, they owned Jeep at that point. Kaiser had no debt. Now, it's very hard to go bankrupt. Without any debt that would really be a challenge. So I knew. So we hung onto it. If you understand the story, when it goes down, it doesn't bother you. It bothers you a little bit, but at least you understand what you own and then you can buy more of it.<p>
Even a worse one to it: If it's gone up this high, how can it go any higher? This I think will surprise you. In 1951, Philip Morris sold for 12 cents. In 1975 it was a big stock at that point, 50 fold at that point. Now ten years later, the stock is up to 60 cents. This is adjusted for splits. And people said, here is a company, the industry is going less than one percent a year, I made five times my money, it's gone from 12 cents to 60 cents, I'll sell. I mean, how much higher can it go? The stock went up another 150 fold. This really hurts if you do the math and put $10,000 in a stock and all you can lose is $10,000. But if you miss the guys that go up 100 fold, the math is very bad.<p>
In the late '70s, I found out that in California there were one quarter as many McDonald's as there were Bank of America branches. You know, they were wrong. The company went overseas, they did breakfast and they opened three McDonald's a day. People 20 years ago said there were too many and the stock couldn't go any higher. It's only gone up a hundred fold since then. Check the facts rather than all the stuff about what is happening with the stock, has it gone up or down. You shouldn't care. <p>
LYNCH'S STOCK PICKS:
I can't really comment on individual stocks. If I said something, I might change my mind a few months later. I really would rather you learn something about it -- if you know something about memory chips or logic chips, and you see all of a sudden there's a shortage of memory chips, you have an edge. If you don't know anything about memory chips you shouldn't be buying the technology.<p>
LYNCH ON THE U.S. ECONOMY:
I think the key thing in America is the fact that the country is getting better, you know, we reduced our deficit. Our debt is a percentage of the GNP. Our deficit is a percentage of the GNP. Everything is getting better in this country, on all the fronts except for taxes. I mean, it would be easy -- I think we ought to set the capital gains the way it is in Japan. Zero. That would be a nice one. That's not flat, that's just zero. <p>
You know, we've had 2,000 companies come public the last three years in the United States. That is two a business day. Raised over a hundred billion dollars. That's an incredible thing for our country. Hire more employees, more efficient equipment, paid off bank debt, buy more plants, add services. That's an amazing positive. We've had 2,000 companies come public. Only 3,000 companies on the New York Stock Exchange, gives you an idea. I don't think 2,000 companies have come public in Europe since Charlemagne. And Europe has double-digit unemployment right now -- they're where the United States was in 1982 and 1983. Just starting this exercise. We've been into for 15 years. <p>
I think taxes are way too high. But the most important thing is, it's all screwed up. If you put a wing on your house and borrow money to put a wing on your house, the interest is tax deductible. $30,000 in a bank account, the interest in taxable then. What the hell kind of incentive is that? Savings equals investment. What we save in America goes into investment. What they save in China goes into investment. In Taiwan they waive 20 percent of what they earn, invest 20 percent into the economy. Singapore might be 30 percent. We could have saved a lot more, and we're telling people not to do it. It's not good for our children or our grandchildren.

						<font size=4><b><i>INVESTING IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE DECADE</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						On February 1, Worth assembled a panel of market experts to discuss investing in the second half of the decade. The seminar took place during the 18th Annual Investment Masters Symposium, January 31 to February 2 in Orlando, Fla., sponsored by Investment Seminars Incorporated and Worth magazine. Worth columnist and contributing editor Walter Mead served as moderator of the hour-long panel. Market experts Ralph Acampora, Frank Cappiello, Michael Murphy, William Nasgovitz, and Clark Winter served on the panel. A transcript from their discussion follows. <p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>WALTER MEAD: contributing editor, Worth magazine</font></b><p><br> 
-----------------<br>
My name is Walter Russell Mead, and I'd like to welcome you to the coveted after-lunch position on the daily platform. We will try and keep you awake. I think we're going to have good luck with that because we've really got a remarkable panel. We've got a lot of the strength of Wall Street Week with us. Some of the leading analysts in the country are here. Our theme is investing in the second half of the decade. I've asked our panelists to start off with a fairly short five-to-10-minute overview of what they think are some of the issues you should be focusing on.<p>
Just to briefly introduce our panelists, we have Ralph Acampora. He is one of the leading technical investors and analysts in the country today. He co-founded the Market Technicians Association in 1970; he's past president of that group. He founded and was then chairman of the International Federation of Technical Analysts, which has 4,000 members around the world. I think we're very lucky to have Ralph with us. <p>
We've also got Frank Cappiello, an expert on the national economy and a recognized authority on financial investors. He's the author of four books, including Finding the Next Super Stock, something I think just about everyone in this room is interested in. <p>
We have Michael Murphy, who many of you heard late this morning give a really brilliant presentation on high tech/bio tech stocks. And we'll get a chance to maybe get more in-depth on questions people had for him. <p>
We have William Nasgovitz from Heartland Funds, president of Heartland Advisors and chairman of the Investment Policy Committee. He began his career in the securities industry at Dean Witter in 1968; joined the Milwaukee Company, a regional brokerage firm, as president in 1978; and founded Heartland Advisors in 1982. He characterizes his style as bargain hunting, not trend following. We've got someone who's really seen the market for a long time, and unlike a lot of the people who are maybe intoxicated by the short-term view of the market, here's somebody who really brings real depth and analysis to it. <p>
Finally, we have Clark Winter, vice chairman of Global Asset Management, the industry leader in multimanager investment fund management. For 18 years he's worked at JP Morgan, for 6 years living in Madrid as vice president representative for the Iberian peninsula. Returning to New York he was managing director responsible for investment management clients in Latin America, Canada, and Europe. He'll be trying to give us more of a global perspective on things in the next five years. Without further ado, I'd like to turn this over to Ralph.<p>

------------------<br>
I don't think anyone can talk about the second half of the decade unless you talk about the first half of the decade. We just completed, as you know, 1995. I was making some little notes to myself on what happened when this decade started. Saddam Hussein made a left--instead of a right--with his tanks and the market tanked. <p>
If you remember, it was July/August of 1990, a horrible period in time. No one knew exactly what was happening. Were we going to war? The market drops at least 20, 22, 23 percent -- at least the averages did. Made a low in October 1990. That was the bottom of the market. Just keep that date in mind, because for a technical analyst, four-year periods are very, very important. So we made a major bottom in the market in October of 1990. <p>
Going into 1991, everybody was very, very nervous and bearish. We were going to war. I, fortunately, was very bullish then. I said to everyone then, "you have to be bullish because it's in the TV Guide." Someone said, "What do you mean, it's in the TV Guide?" I said, "Well, open the TV Guide, it says turn your television on to CNN either Tuesday or Wednesday night, January 12th or the 13th, and you will see Winds of War live."  Ladies and gentlemen, when something is as obvious as it was, that we were going to war and that it was publicized in the TV Guide, you had to be bullish. <p>
But none of us were bullish, because it was terrible. But what they failed to understand, was that for some crazy reason, the market likes wars. We had a spectacular run in the first three months of 1991. The market went up 500 points in three months. You and I have never seen that in our lifetime as investors. Except for this last run we just had in 1995. So we started the decade, and it was very, very exciting -- but there was lots of fear. Fear, and a bottom. Fear and a bottom. That combination makes for a secular move. <p>
In fact, in 1994 we got another decline. This was a preemptive hike in interest rates, if you remember. Alan Greenspan was worried about a resurgence of inflation in this country, raised the rates, and the market went down very, very dramatically. We made a low in October/November 1994, ladies and gentlemen. Keep that date in mind. Remember the first date I told you to remember was the bottom of 1990. Four years later, the market makes another major bottom in October/November 1994. For a technical analyst, four year periods are very, very impressive. They give you major buying opportunities. We were very, very optimistic in the market in 1994, that was one of the reasons, because the market was washed out. We had seen a major decline in 1994. <p>
Nineteen ninety five, the end of the first part of our decade, was the most exciting market you and I probably have ever witnessed. But you know what, if you look back in history, and again a technician looks at history, it was the third year of President Clinton's term in office. If you go back in history, historically or hysterically (laughter), the third year of the President's term in office is the strongest of the four years. And it happened again--1995 was a very strong year. And it was fitting into the four year cycle lows, and the Presidential cycle has worked perfectly for us. <p>
Now that we start the second half of the decade, I find it awesome -- very, very exciting. Number one, 1996 is a Presidential election year. Again, if you go back in history, you'll see that the market usually works its way higher in this last year. Obviously, the president wants to get back in office. Obviously, everybody will do the right things to make it look good. For this reason, I suspect that we will have a rising market in 1996. <p>
But that's really history. Let's talk about what's really happening in the market. Last year, that four year bottom in 1994, leading to that major move in 1995. The most impressive thing about it was the quality of the leadership.  It's blue chips. The Dow Jones Industrial average is a multinational indicator. Those companies in there are enjoying the benefits of economies around the world improving,. I think that's just going to continue to improve, and those stocks will lead. <p>
I think what you can expect in 1996 is a resumption of that leadership complimented by other stocks coming to the floor as more and more people get enthusiastic about the second half of the decade. Confidence comes in and they will buy other stocks, other than blue chip. And if you look at secondaries, especially mid-cap stocks, go through your universe of names and you know what you'll come out with? Utilities. I'm extremely, extremely bullish on utilities. So I love the blue chips, complimented with the utilities. Utilities are very impressive and of course they're intrasensitive. You take that notion of intrasensitive stocks doing well, and you have to be bullish on the bond market. <p>
Now we have a market that's looking at low interest rates and low inflation. The way I look at history and the way I look at the market in the second half of this decade, I think the second half of this decade is going to mirror the first half of the decade in the early sixties. Then we had low inflation and low interest rates lead by blue chips, followed up by secondaries. There's absolutely no speculation in this market. <p>
I suspect that you and I will see excessive public speculation at the end of this decade. Somewhere around 1999, and going into the year 2000 it will be euphoric. I'm not predicting 10,000 as other people are; my latest target is 7,000 by 1998. I'll take one bull market at a time. I think we have enough room here to get us up another 2,000 points in the next year and a half, two years. <p>
Remember my four year cycle business? Theoretically, there should be a negative market in 1998. We'll make another four year low somewhere around October/November 1998. That sets the stage for a very exciting 1999, year 2000, going into the change of the millennium. I think the stock market will be close to 10,000. That's what we see for the second half of the decade.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>FRANK CAPPIELLO: Chairman, Cappiello-Rushmore Mutual Funds</font></b><p><br>
--------------------<br>
I knew Ralph was bullish...that's a raging bull! While I was introduced as an author, and I have written a couple of books, I'm really a money manager. My partners and I manage $1.4 billion in assets, including the four Cappiello-Rushmore mutual funds; one of which is gold and the other is utilities, which are the two stock groups right now that seem to be running. <p>
Let me start looking down towards the millennium by giving you a bit of perspective. A lot of people talk about an overvalued market. But again, if you look back into the sixties, from 1966 to 1982, the stock market literally went nowhere. 1966 to 1982 in real inflation adjusted terms, the stock market really fell 72 percent. So when you look at that perspective, what we're doing now after a transition in the latter part of the eighties, is really playing catch up. <p>
Second, we are bullish on the market. I've got to admit I'm not as bullish as Ralph. I'm a chicken-bull, approaching the market warily, but we are basically fully invested. I think this is going to be a very tricky market this year, one in which you know you just can't go into sectors, you have to go into what I'm going to call, in a minute, themes. <p>
Third, what makes me bullish to some extent, and, like Ralph, a raging bull in some areas. Well, first, the budget deficit is really declining. Many people talk about balancing the budget, but we've gone a long way towards reducing the amount of red ink that we're flowing out of Washington. The deficit in 1993 was $255 billion. 1994, $203 billion. 1996, this fiscal year we're now in, it will probably be $150 billion. So, without even cutting spending, which we're starting to do, we're reducing the deficit and that's very positive in terms of confidence and in terms of rising multiples.  <p>
Second, speaking of multiples, we have low inflation and low interest rates. And we have an economy that's still moving up, but very slowly. So you still have rising earnings; in many sectors, very good earnings. Combine that with low interest rates and low inflation, and you get a higher multiple.  The estimates that I've seen on the Dow range from $400 a share in terms of earnings for 1996 to $410. If you just apply a 15 multiple on the Dow, at the lower end of the range, you're at 6,000. If you apply a 20 multiple, which Ralph and I have both seen, and historically is justifiable in a period of low inflation and low interest rates -- we had something like that in the sixties -- you apply 20 to $400, you get 8,000. That's this year. Now, I'm not saying we're going to get to 8,000 this year, but I'm saying we're going to move much higher, and probably move into the 6,000 range easily. <p>
But speaking of 1960s, and Ralph has alluded correctly to that period looking very much like this period, I will submit that the one danger we see, the one thing that could knock this stock market off, is nothing financial. They're not going to be any surprises in interest rates, no surprises in inflation. But if you went back into history and saw 1962, in the midst of falling rates, in the midst of falling inflation, in the midst of good earnings: We had a market drop of 26 percent. A mini-bear market. And what caused that was not financial, but political. President Kennedy decided to take on businessmen, and he took on the steel companies. Wall Street suddenly lost confidence. <p>
So if we get this oft-heralded correction, it will probably be out of nowhere -- it'll be political, and not economic. And that's something that none of us can guess at. But you ought to keep your eye open for the changing venues and the changing tones of the political scene. I said a moment ago, we think you should invest not in industry groups but across industry groups in terms of themes.  Here are a couple of themes for a challenge. <p>
First, we think health care efficiency is of increasing importance. Not necessarily drug stocks, but companies that compile information, and that information becomes very precious to hospitals and HMOs in becoming more efficient. One of our top stocks here is Shared Medical. Information systems is an $8.5 billion business. The more information you have, the more efficient and effective you can be in supplying health care. We also incidentally, think that companies like United Health and Foundation Health have a part in this health care efficiency.<p>
A second area is power. I share Ralph's enthusiasm for electric utilities, because most of our utility income fund is in the electrics. What we're seeing there are falling rates, which help electric utilities, and that's this year. And two years out, since utilities have been a bummer and there hasn't been much investing in utility facilities, we see a growing shortage of electrical power. This is a concept that's also been pioneered by Jimmy Rogers. I think he's right. So, a couple of years from now, you can get an added bonus that will see rates going up rather than down. In the meantime, you get 7 to 8 percent on very attractive stocks. <p>
Another area we like is called the global power area that relates to oil companies. One of the striking things that we see out there is that China, which was once the sixth largest oil exporter, is now becoming an oil importer. Indonesia, also an oil exporter, by the year 2000 will be importing oil. This means that oil will finally get its leg up. Maybe not this year, but in coming years, particularly in 1997 and 1998. Oil companies are good investments anyway, with very attractive yields. So that's another area to look at.<p>
Finally, break ups. The break up classic, of course, is AT&T. We've seen Dunn & Bradstreet. We would recommend you take a look at companies like Baxter Electronic Data Systems, which is General Motors Class E Stock [NYSE: GME] and General Motors Class H Stock [NYSE: GMH], which is the General Motors Hughes Electronics subsidiary. These companies are in the process of breaking up, starting their own life, and therein will lie some profitability.<p>
Finally, contrary bets. One of the things I like to do with parts of our funds and parts of the money that we manage is to bet against Wall Street. We're making bets on retailers, we're making bets on gold, and we're making bets on pollution control. In retailers, we're really out on the edge. We think that Kmart is a very risky stock, but has at this point a high risk/reward ratio. They've just announced a convertible diventure financing, which should do wonders in helping them make progress towards working out. We like Federated, which is a department store that's becoming very aggressive. There are other themes, but that gives you an idea on how to rethink the successful in the next few months. Thank you.<p>
<p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>MICHAEL MURPHY: Editor, California Technology Stock Letter</font></b><p><br>
-----------------------------------------------<br>
Well, I'm not nearly as bullish on the Dow as either of those two, but I also don't care as much, because I don't think the stocks that we follow are dependent on the Dow. <p>
But I would just pick up on one thing that Frank said: I believe he's right about oil, for sure. Especially with the changes that have just happened in Saudi Arabia. Essentially, the man who is now running the country is the guy who ran the 1973 oil embargo against us. I would worry that everybody's bullishness is going to be upset by a political risk. Not a domestic political risk, but a political risk related to the price of oil. For those of us running money through the last one, it gets out pretty widely. It's amazing how many industries get hurt when that happens. <p>
In that environment, still, I think the second half of this decade has got to belong to technology. We're in a once in a lifetime shift where technology has gone from being an industrial/military product to becoming a consumer product. And it's happening all around the world. It's not just computers, it drags along all the communications, both voice and data communications. <p>
There's simply no way to run a Third World country and not put in the most advanced communications systems. These countries are not going to go out and lay a bunch of copper cables. It's too expensive. They're putting in wireless systems. You can put in a wireless telephone system today, with a central switch, and use voice mail, and you can get your whole citizenry a telephone voice mailbox for a dollar a month. Now, they don't have a phone sitting in their little cottage, but that doesn't matter. They can walk down to the local wireless pay phone and make a phone call; they can get a job; they can buy stuff; they can sell stuff; they can be tuned in. <p>
Of course, we're also seeing what's happening with satellite receivers. There are people in China who specialize in going out to the backyard, scooping a hole in the dirt and lining it with tinfoil, because you can pick up the satellite signal from Star TV that way. This is spreading all around. <p>
I wanted to focus on two areas that I think are really, really cheap right now. One is the PC and semi-conductor stocks which have come down very hard, because we're in a PC inventory liquidation right now. I think this was foreseeable. Microsoft Windows should have sold 30 million copies by the end of last year; it only sold about 19 million. People geared up for the bigger numbers. So we're going through this inventory liquidation. But it's going to be over in a couple of months. Most of the Wall Street guys are not going to be able to buy these stocks until they're sure it's over, the March earnings get reported, we're into the June quarter, and they see the pick up. <p>
Some extremely good companies have been knocked down. I would mention two software companies which are Autodesk, Inc. [Nasdaq: ACAD] and Adobe Systems, Inc [Nasdaq: ADBE]. Adobe is down another two bucks today after dropping three and a half yesterday, and it has just fallen back into our buy range. Three semiconductor companies: Cirrus Logic [Nasdaq: CRUS], Intel [Nasdaq: INTL], Integrated Device Technology [Nasdaq: IDTI]. All five of these companies have high rates of growth in the twenty percent plus area; high pre-tax profit margins, again in the twenty percent plus area. They all tend to spend about ten to twelve percent of sales on R and D, and actually IDT spends a little more than that. They're going to keep building their franchises. Wall Street is giving them to you at very, very low prices. <p>
Those are the ones I would focus on, the ones we call the great growth load companies. There are some others you can buy, certainly Sequent Computer Systems [Nasdaq: SQNT], Sonic Solutions [Nasdaq: SNIC], some of the newer companies like Plasma & Materials Technologies, Inc [Nasdaq: PMAT]. Those kinds of stocks can be bought, but they're either not as well known, or they're not quite as profitable. When they're giving you the gift of these great companies, I think that's what you do with your money on the electronic side. <p>
The other side I really want to pound the table on is bio technology. It's a rare opportunity -- I can never really remember it happening -- that individuals get a chance to buy in at a venture stage. Of course, these stocks got way overheated back in 1991, and a lot of people got hurt. But they went in a three year bear market, they've made three years of progress in developing their drugs, and the valuations are still pretty low. They did bottom last year, they are off their bottoms, but a lot of people would argue that's good -- because you don't want to catch falling knives. <p>
There are a number of companies here you can buy, but let me just give you two quick lists. The first list is the companies that have a fundamental, basic technology that can spin off a number of drugs because they're operating inside the cell, right down at the DNA level. Those are Human Genome Sciences, Inc. [Nasdaq: HGSI], and Sequana Therapeutics, Inc. [Nasdaq: SQNA]. Those two are sequencing the human gene to find out what's in there. Ligand Pharmaceuticals [Nasdaq: LGND] has about 29 different drugs in development, and is operating inside the cell; and Isis (ISIP) which is an anti-sense company which actually goes in and stops the DNA from producing certain proteins; for example the proteins that cause asthma or arthritis.<p>
Beside those companies, I think you can look at the companies that are a little bit riskier because they're primarily one drug or one molecule with a narrow range of applications. But still, if they succeed... Remember, most of these have now gotten to the point where they are through the phase two trials. We know it works and they're into phase three to see what exactly the dose should be. Most of them have investments from the big drug companies, most of them have very high quality scientific advisory boards. In other words, their technology has been looked at by a lot of people and blessed by a lot of people, so you're not getting conned. Not that it's necessarily going to work, but at least it's honest stuff. <p>
Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [Nasdaq: AMLN], in diabetes, is very close. Athena Neurosciences, Inc. [Nasdaq: ATHN] is in Alzheimer's; CoCensys, Inc. [Nasdaq: COCN] is a company that is working essentially on a replacement for Valium that goes right into the receptor that causes anxiety and locks it, without causing any of the side effects like drowsiness and that kind of thing. COR Therapeutics, Inc. [Nasdaq: CORR] is a good example of a good company that's down from roughly high twenties, low thirties, to ten. They'll be applying for approval for their drug probably within the next sixty days. It's a heart attack drug called Integrelin to stop blood clots and thrombosis. Corvas International, Inc. [Nasdaq: CVAS], another company working in the area of stroke and cardiovascular drugs. Cytel Corp. [Nasdaq: CYTL], which is an inflammation company. It's got about eight drugs in development, but they're all based fundamentally on one technology. <p>
ProCyte Corp. [Nasdaq: PRCY] is a little three dollar stock that everybody has written off. It has some very interesting wound healing products. When their drug failed, because their lead drug did fail in clinical trials, they were smart: They went out and acquired a bunch of  chemically based drugs which they're going to start selling in June. Builds up a sales force, throws off some cash and then they can continue to develop their new drugs as they come along.<p>
I think the most important decision you're going to make coming out of this conference is an asset allocation decision: how much you want in cash versus how much you want in the market, and of the part you've got in the market, how much you want in the old economy, and how much you want in technology. Those are the big decisions, and that's what's really going to dominate your investment returns in the next five years. I'd put as much of it technology as you can stand. <p>
<p><a name="SUB5"><b><font size=+1>WILLIAM NASGOVITZ: President and Portfolio Manager, Heartland Funds</font></b><p><br>
-------------------<br>
A quick background: We manage about $2 billion, primarily focused on the small-cap sector of the U.S. stock markets, small- and micro-cap. We are value investors, which means we use Graham and Dodd type valuation methods to select individual stocks. We are not market timers; but we do have a new small-cap contrarian fund, which has the ability to both go long on these small stocks, which we think are undervalued, and sell short on some of those which are overvalued. Our focus then is small stocks, and I thought I'd just talk a little bit about that market. <p>
Today the U.S. stock market totals about $7.5 trillion. Huge market. 15,000 public companies. The top thousand, or perhaps two or three thousand, are followed by Wall Street -- either New York or regional brokerage firms. But the balance, 12,000 companies, are under followed or not followed at all. That's the market we've chosen to focus on. We think it presents tremendous opportunity. <p>
Certainly in the past, small stocks have out-performed any other asset class in the U.S. outside of venture capital, and we expect they will out-perform in the years ahead. We're in the small micro-sector of the stock market. To us, small is less than $100 million in market capitalization. Both of our funds, the value fund and the small-cap contrarian fund, have $50 million median market caps, so that's real small. Half of our stocks are under $50 million. We have no downside limit in terms of market values that we look at. So I think this sector is ripe for opportunity. <p>
If you look back into the eighties, the last period of out-performance in this sector ended with the technology blowout of June 1983, and small stocks under performed from 1983 to 1990. A seven year drought of under performance from this sector. They then came back to favor in 1991, 1992, 1993. Tremendous gains, if you look at the Russell 2000. I guess that's a good proxy for small; there really is no proxy for micro. But both that sector and small did extremely well for those three years. Since February of 1994, small stocks have under performed the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. <p>
So we've been in about a two year period of under performance. And I suspect that's going to change as the year unwinds. But it is somewhat disturbing, having small stocks under-perform. For example, this month, the month of January, I believe the Dow is up five percent. And the Russell 2000 Index is down one percent. Seasonally, this is the strongest month of the year for small stocks. So I'm worried about that divergence. I don't think it's healthy for the market, when you see the Dow up 76 points, or up a percent and a half, and small stocks just languishing. I think near term, we might be overbought, both in stocks and bonds. Everybody knows that interest rates are going down and stocks are going up. We're due for a correction on the short end. <p>
Looking out further, for the rest of this decade, I think small stocks will out-perform because this is the fastest growing sector of the economy. This is where the entrepreneurial talent of the capital market resides. We have a history of out performance from this sector. Small stocks, if you look at the Ibitzen numbers, do about 20 percent better than their larger brethren. And also it's just the basic law of numbers. You can double $100 million quicker than you could double perhaps a billion dollars. There's also a correlation of small with the dollar. It's quite striking, in fact. As the dollar strengthens, small stocks out-perform. So I think in the years ahead we will see a stronger dollar, for a variety of reasons, that's my belief. And with that, we should see a resurgence in small company stocks. <p>
So I think it's going to be a very profitable sector within the overall market. In fact, I'd be very cautious about larger stocks. For example, the S&P 500, over the past 10 years, has compounded at sixteen percent per year, well above it's historic trend line. We have not had a serious correction. Even 1987,  if you look at the entire year, we were not down that much. We have not had a serious correction in 10, 15 years. It's been a 13 year bull market. Stocks have not corrected more than 12 percent at any time in the last five years. Now usually, one out of three years are down in the stock market, I believe. So I think we're due for perhaps substandard results from the S&P 500 going forward, because of their strong historical performance over the last ten to fifteen years. <p>
But within that, there are plenty of bargains within our sector because they are not widely followed, they are not owned by institutions, they have no Wall Street coverage. You can find companies that you can buy as an investor for very reasonable prices in relations to their earnings, book values, cash flows and things like that. Thank you.<p>

--------------------<br>
First of all, I want to say I agree with Ralph. We're going to see 7,000. What I don't know is when. But we're clearly going to see it. But what I want to emphasize is if that's true in the United States, it has tremendous implications in the rest of the world. The rest of the world is watching the U.S., probably with more admiration that at any time during the post-war era. There was a time when we were seen as the deficit spender, there was a time that we were seen without leadership, and wandering. But right now, politics aside, the economy is very strong. The world leaders understand that in the rest of the world. World leaders whether they be in politics, economics, finance, or most importantly, the investment business. <p>
But let me pause for a minute and introduce myself and tell you what I do. I'm responsible for a company that manages portfolios for individual investors in the U.S. and overseas. We pick managers, and put them together in portfolios in a various series of funds. We run about $8 billion, most of that for non-residents of the Unites States. We find managers in mutual funds and hedge funds, and segregated accounts and put them together. I've never seen such an explosion of investment talent as I'm seeing now in the rest of the world. <p>
But I want to share with you something. I've never been to a money show, and this has been a real eye opener for me. There are 8,000 people here, roughly, and we have the first-class section, I was told, right here in this room today. You people are making decisions about investing your own money. You've come here, you're taking control. Each of you is contributing in a remarkable way to the strength of the economy. Nobody's paying you to do this. That's a lot of free work. <p>
But I want to ask a question. You don't have to answer this if you don't want to, but I'd like to know how many of you are not going to deduct the cost of this seminar on your tax return? There's motivation in this room ladies and gentlemen. The rest of the world doesn't have money shows. In the rest of the world, investors have three choices: they can either put their money in a bank, under the mattress, or, if they're affluent, they take it to Zurich. The rest of the world does not have indigenous securities markets so that people make choices. <p>
Almost all the mutual fund talent in the world resides in the United States. It doesn't mean there aren't people in the rest of the world who select equities to mutual funds. I use the word talent on purpose. Those are people who just put things together on behalf of captive money. All of that is going to change. One of the things that's going to change it is the economic decision-making power. In the rest of the world, investment decisions were made for decades exclusively on the basis of political considerations. In the United States, politics matters. As you say, it could be the cause of the great surprise. But on balance, one guy or the other, the market keeps rolling along, because we have two people agreeing on deficit reduction. <p>
I'll give you a few things I think each of you should think about, now and particularly overseas; one of which is brand names. I suggest there's going to be a barbelling in the value of brand names. There are brand names that will enjoy ever-increasing strength globally -- Coca Cola is the best example. But there are many other brand names that are not going to survive this process, because you've seen the unwinding of brand pricing power in drugs, generics, health care, computers, airlines and I suggest also mutual funds. The day of somebody giving all of their money to one mutual fund family and letting it stay in there forever is over. Can I ask a question just for my own education? How many of you have all of your money in one mutual fund family? That's not many. But a few years ago, it was difficult to shift between one mutual fund family and another. Schwab has created an enormous solution to this problem, Fidelity has responded with the same solution of their own. Watch that brand name superiority in the rest of the world in many other industries. <p>
Second, when you go abroad and consider investing abroad, I would look for mutual funds right now that have very good stock picking capabilities. The skills set that these gentlemen talk about: the analytics, were irrelevant abroad: great foreign stock pickers were macro players. They understood the politics, they worked down. I think the next opportunity now will be for foreign stock funds who apply this same diligent analytics to their markets that were previously irrelevant. Repeat, that skills set was irrelevant overseas in the past. <p>
I think also, we've been given a bottom-up opportunity here in foreign markets, similar to J&J and Tylenol, as somebody mentioned yesterday, or the Union Carbide in India. We have some really great names in the rest of the world, which despite their recent rebound, have been priced way down, as all the funds of flow have come to the United States. <p>
Second, I'll go out on a limb. I am not excited about U.S. fixed-income opportunities right now, and I would encourage caution about foreign fixed-income if you see the chance of a rebounding dollar. I think the global bond markets which last year returned 17, 18, 19 percent from most managers will not afford the same opportunity next year. <p>
Finally, if you want to watch one thing, I said it yesterday and repeat it: I think the one thing to watch in terms of global equity valuations in the rest of the world is the mandated funding of pension reform in other countries. It's incredibly important. In the rest of the world, there are obligations to pay pensions but there's no money to pay them. The leaders know that. It's not really widely reported in the press -- there are exceptions of course, Chile, etc. But as these governments address that fact and fund their pensions, you're going to see an enormous in-flow of money into the market. It's money that's going to go in there but for autonomous management and be invested for the longer term. So the behavior pattern that we've witnessed here in the last two decades is going to begin to apply in the rest of the world. <p>
A final comment on globalization: it's a well-worn word in many people's minds. You hear about it. You read about it, But I suggest that, in terms of implementation, globalization is somewhere between genesis and birth -- that it hasn't been born yet. <p>
<p><a name="SUB7"><b><font size=+1>Q&A</font></b><p><br><p>
WALTER MEAD:
-----------------<br>
Well I'll think you'll agree with me that we've really had a very exciting set of presentations. Anybody have any questions for any of our panelists? You can direct your questions either to a particular panelist, or I'll refer it to the group. <p>
QUESTION: What is the impact domestically and globally of the new telecommunications bill? <p>
MICHAEL MURPHY:
-----------------<br>
I'll start. I'm sure others have their opinions. A lot of the bill is Congress trying to catch up with reality frankly, and trying to keep their hands on something that's going to be incredibly difficult to regulate. And parts of it are just silly. Basically, the thrust of the bill is to open up the telecommunications market and create more competition. The underlying reason that's happening is the spectrum or the available ways to get information to people is broadening out a lot. Both in the terms of allocating new spectrum, as they just did with these personal communications services where they actually auction it off, but also for each individual available area of the spectrum, the new technology could jam a lot more information down it. <p>
What you could put one voice down 15 years ago today you could put almost a thousand voices down in exactly that same spectrum. The telephone lines that go into your house, those ordinary telephone lines, today can carry three TV signals right into your house with no degradation of quality. The technology has gotten way far ahead of this sort of bureaucratic regulation that it had on it, and it was hurting things; it was starting to hold people back. <p>
The thrust of the bill, although obviously the people who had established interest resisted, and went along kicking and screaming, the thrust of the bill was to move more towards opening it up to the new technologies, opening it up to competition. We are really going to have the 500 channels, everybody's going to have the 500 channels, and then somebody's going to provide all of the content for that. We all really are all going to end up five years from now walking around with a relatively small pager-like device that keeps you plugged into your computer, to the Internet, to your voice mail. All that stuff is actually going to happen. This bill is basically an enabling bill to start letting that happen. We're going to need another telecommunications bill in three years, because the technology is still ahead of the regulators. <p>
QUESTION: What's going to happen to capital gains tax, and when is it going to happen?<p>
FRANK CAPPIELLO:
-------------------<br>
There ain't going to be none.<p>
WALTER MEAD:
---------------
By when?<p>
FRANK CAPPIELLO:
------
I wouldn't overemphasize capital gains. I think short-term, capital gains would be negative for the market. Long-term, it'd be great. But most of the people that are going to benefit are not the stock holders, but farmers, who have enormous capital gains in their farmland, and want to transit this over in some ways to protect themselves. Politically, it's welfare for the rich. If we do get a bill, it's going to be very diluted.  I don't think the market needs it anyways. Hold it for next year. <p>
RALPH ACAMPORA: 
--------------------------<br>
I would like to respond to the first question that was asked about telecommunications. I'm not an expert on the industry, but I look at the companies in that industry. I look at the telephone companies, when I look at the paging companies, they're very, very exciting. We heard before that we should be participants in that type of investment in the second part of the decade. I couldn't agree more, whether it's Ma Bell, or PacificTel, whether it's Paging Network or Telecommunications, Inc. Buy them. They look great.<p>
CLARK WINTER:
-------------------------<br>
I'd like to add a word of caution. The other day it was announced there's $55 billion of privatizations trying to occur this year in Europe. The majority of that is European telecoms. I would urge a word of caution because you want to avoid the purchase of hard assets. It's a bit like buying old computer manufacturers. I think the opportunity is going to be in those who control the flow, have their control of the tickets, and are able to use what they call cash flow in the financial industries -- the use of the machine. So be very careful, I think, when you're looking at foreign telco operations as to whether you're buying the old machines or the access to the new people who are going to use them. <p>
(Gap in cassette tape used for transcription)<p>
FRANK CAPPIELLO:
------------------------<br>
There are going to be a lot of losers in this game, and it's going to be very, very difficult to win. Maybe with a Motorola, that's across the board, or an Erickson, but maybe with the GM-Hughes, with the pizza-size dish satellite. But they're going to be a lot of casualties, because there's going to be a lot of price cutting, a lot of competition. The winner in this game is the guy that builds the product pipeline. The guy that provides entertainment for the 500 channels. And you're sitting in the domain of one of the big winners: Walt Disney. People that have big film libraries...there's going to be a voracious appetite for entertainment. The people that can supply it are the people that are really going to win the game consistently every year. Unfortunately, all those stocks are high-priced. But no one said anything good was going to be cheap, at any time.<p>
Just a further point on communications. There are some cheap hard asset companies that are pretty dull. They're private telephone companies, independent telephone companies which have been spun off or developed by entrepreneurs. They're selling two, three, four times cash flow. They will be beneficiaries of this new bill because they'll receive payments from people like AT&T when you make your local call, if anybody ever uses those machines. But we think they will. <p>
(Someone asks if he would mention a few of these companies.)<p>
I'd rather not, because we're buying a few. (Laughter)<p>
WALTER MEAD: 
--------------------<br>
Would anybody else care to mention some of those companies? (Laughter) <p>
(A question is asked regarding Jeff Vinick and his endorsement of a stock he was allegedly selling at the same time.)<p>
MICHAEL MURPHY:
--------------------<br>
I am sure that no one here would ever do such a thing. (Laughter). I am shocked, shocked to hear that this is going on. (Laughter). I think the reality of it is that it's been going on forever, and when you read somebody in Wall Street Journal's "Heard on the Street" talking about that this is their number one favorite stock of all time, you know they probably own an awful lot of it already. <p>
Actually, I honestly think what happened with Jeff was that between the time they wrote that and sent it to the printer, and the time he started looking at what was going on, the world did change. We turned negative on that whole PC/semiconductor group last June, and we were really the lonely voice in the wilderness until about October. But Microsoft introduced Windows '95 on August 24th, and it was only about three or four weeks later that people started waking up and thinking, "wait a minute, there's something wrong here." And you did see quite a change of sentiment. And he was in an exposed position with Micron as well as a number of other stocks. <p>
So, my answer to it is that if they do that in a stock, take advantage of it. In other words, know the company, and let them beat it down, and you take advantage of it as a buying opportunity. If they do it in something you own that's a good stock, ride it through. Because as individuals, there's not much you can do. And, frankly, he probably did the right thing selling Micron. He has to protect his shareholders first. <p>
FRANK CAPPIELLO:
----------------------<br>
Can I make a comment on Jeff Vinick? Last year, in Boston, someone asked me, because we had a lot of high tech stocks going into 1995, what's the greatest thing you fear? And I said Jeff Vinick. Because, then we knew what he had, and we were just worried he would drop the shoe. And it took him about eight months to drop the shoe. But I think Michael will attest to the fact that once he dropped the shoe, we all knew the shoe was being dropped. But it was just like a torrent of stock coming out because everyone is trying to beat him out of the box. <p>
But nothing changes in the mutual fund industry. A guy is going to talk up his stock: He owns it. He's not going to tell you about a stock he doesn't own, and push it up. So you've got to be wary of people that are enthusiastic about their stocks. You got to remember they're in the stock, and the stock will probably go higher but it could go lower. Be very careful about all these recommendations here. <p>
WILLIAM NASGOVITZ:
------------------------------<br>
One additional comment about the power of funds or the institutionalization of the market. We try to turn it into our friends. We want to sell to institutions. Therefore, we're looking to buy companies that have low institutional ownership. We think that's a risk. It might be a great company, great product, great management. But if it's 99 percent held by institutions, which some of these companies are, who's left to buy? When they're selling at thirty, forty, fifty times earnings. If they miss a quarter, or if Microsoft doesn't get the sales...I mean the stocks -- Micron Technologies -- plummeted 66 percent in a matter of weeks or months. Part of our evaluation process is to determine who are the owners of these shares. We feel that most institutions are renters, and temporary holders. They are speculators. Not of course this panel, (laughter) but all the other 7,000 mutual fund managers out there. <p>
WALTER MEAD:
-----------------------<br>
Anything else from the panel before we go on? You've really managed to touch a couple of strong nerves on the panel this morning. <p>
QUESTION: In view of the fact that for two years running index funds have out-performed most money managers, how would Frank and others like to defend their marketing practices and say where they're going?<p>
FRANK CAPPIELLO: 
------------------<br>
Well, generally speaking on a quarter by quarter basis, our four funds, with the exception or the gold fund, because gold is in the doldrums, have matched or equalled the indexes. We've beaten the utility index two years in a row. Our growth fund has beaten the index and our merging growth fund has beaten the index up until the last quarter. But a quarter is a quarter. So I can speak with a certain amount of objectivity regarding not being one of the guys who hasn't matched the index. <p>
I'd say that you've got to give a money manager at least two years. Meaning he may not beat the index this year, but as it's been commented on, this is a hell of a year -- the last year was a hell of a year -- for the S&P and the Dow. But there've been years when the S&P hasn't done well. And all you have to do is go back to the early part of the eighties and a couple of years in the eighties. So recently it's been hard to beat. But I also share a sort of apprehension that everyone is talking about indexing--money is pouring into indexes. And remember that the index is a market only because it is a market that has been hard to beat recently. But it hasn't always been hard to beat. If everyone pours into the index, the index could get into trouble, and then the money managers could beat it. Be very careful of going into indexes. <p>
Now my recommendation for indexes would be to go into indexes on areas that are hard to control. Like there's an emerging market index, there are a lot of overseas indexes. And I think if you want to participate overseas in an emerging market, indexes probably make some sense. But domestically, if you've got a good manager who's beaten the index a year or two, but he didn't beat it this year, I'd stay with him another year. I don't think you ought to jump around. Remember, if you jump around, you pay taxes, you have less money to invest in the index. <p>
WALTER MEAD:
----------------
Clark, would you like to comment on the idea that global funds are where the index is a good idea?<p>
CLARK WINTER:
----------------
First of all, when we run a portfolio for people with a wide range of funds in it, we often buy index funds. It's a fine way to access certain strategy. I see no inherent problem with buying index funds from time to time. <p>
Second, internationally, though, I think it's a real danger. Some of you may know that the rest of the world's market capitalization is primarily Japan, anywhere from 60 to 40 percent. So when you index a non-U.S. portfolio, you're making a market on Japan, and just leaving it there. Simply stated, you're abandoning the most important decision an international manager can make. Which is how much he should and should not have in Japan. So I can categorically think that index funds for non-U.S. investing is the wrong thing for U.S. citizens. <p>
There's another anomoly which I will not try to answer but simply open. If in fact for U.S. taxpayers the smartest thing to do is buy an index fund, and I think there've been many studies that show that from a tax point of view, that's right. We are setting up for an incredible situation. If in fact the smartest thing to do with your money over time is to do nothing with it, then I think that's sort of the intellectual equivalent of financial arterial sclerosis -- you're just letting it build. So you're going to create a situation where those funds are immobile, and there's going to be tremendous valuation discrepancies. I agree with Frank's point: you're going to see small cap and mid cap get very, very interesting prices. <p>
QUESTION: How do international fund managers work around the different qualities of statistics in many countries around the world? <p>
CLARK WINTER: 
----------------
I think the simple answer is the good ones (and I talked earlier about foreign fund managers who do the analytics, not the macro) simply avoid those situations where they can't get their hands around the numbers full stop. Which is one of the key reasons you've seen so little money go into Eastern Europe. We don't doubt it's cheap, we don't doubt there's opportunity there, we just can't get our hands around the number. You are paying us to make prudent and wise decisions, and if we can't make them, the smartest thing we can do is not put money in that area. So there are whole regions, nations, continents that receive virtually no money. <p>
One thing I have observed, if you will, was in Washington recently when visiting the SEC. I asked one of the commissioners, "Where are you getting the most intelligent questions?" This is not to say the most frequent request for a favor, but where are they getting the deepest level of intelligent questions. And they said, "Unilaterally, it's coming from Asia." Because the Asian regulators, and the people charged with creating a regulatory environment in certain Asian markets (and I do not include China) are trying to figure out what they have to do to make investors, or professional investors comfortable with that environment. So they're learning about disclosure, they're learning about consistency, they're learning about auditing. <p>
I think that when the money shifts from the U.S. overseas, which it will at some point, those countries with the safest and soundest regulatory environments will get money, and the others absolutely won't. So I think your point is absolutely valid. I think if you ask Arthur Andersen where their largest source of new business is coming from, sort of like Coca-Cola, it's coming from overseas. The rest of the world capital allocators, or those who wish to issue securites, are finding out that there's no other faucet than Wall Street. If they don't play by Wall Street rules, they simply won't get the money.<p>
(Regarding interest rates)<p>
CLARK WINTER:
---------------
I think the drop of interest rates in Europe will have a profound effect. I think it's nearer than people realize. I think there aren't as many interest rate sensitive stocks in Europe as you might find in the United States, so you're going to see some activity in the bonds. But as I said earlier, beware, because you may see a rebounding dollar simultaneously. But I think there will be a profound lowering of interest rates. <p>
A very interesting area, I think, to look at if you want to make money on that score, is a whole series of companies particularly in Central Europe which were not able to access the credit markets before. Germany, a case in point. If you wanted to raise money as a private German company over the years you usually had to sell some of your share capital to the bank that lent you money. So if you didn't sell them some of your share capital, they didn't lend you money. <p>
Well, guess where Goldman Sachs' largest new business office is in the world right now. Germany. There are a lot of mid cap German companies that are fed up with the German banking system. They have fine financial statements, they have not endebted themselves over the last few years and they're going to go right up and out to the public capital markets probably ahead of and better pricing than the big giant ones that are such big household names. So I think there's some great opportunities in the falling fixed income over there. <p>
QUESTION: What is going to be the impact on global capital markets of a low interest rate climate? <p>
CLARK WINTER:
----------------
I'll answer that in one word: bullish. So I think, yes.<p>
WILLIAM NASGOVITZ:
----------------
We've had an earnings explosion last year for corporate America. They were up by somewhere north of 20 percent. This year, I don't think corporate profits are going to be up much at all. I think it's going to be a tougher year for corporate America, and I think the surprises will be on the downside. I think maybe you saw some of them in the tech area, but I think we'll see more. Coupled with a stronger dollar, it could be quite surprising. Because many of these Fortune 500, S&P 500 large companies derive -- I think Coca-Cola gets 75 percent of its earnings -- abroad. So you have a strong dollar, the wind is not at their back. All of the sudden, they've got a wind right at their face. <p>
CLARK WINTER:
------------------<br>
Russell 2000 corporate earnings, they were up, I haven't seen numbers, but I suspect they were in line perhaps not as much, there's been a lot of restructuring in large companies. And that perhaps might account for that tremendous surge in S&P 500 profitability. <p>
RALPH ACAMPORA:
-----------------<br>
I'd like to make one observation. Everybody talks about a strong dollar, that it's going to be very, very bad for multinational companies in the United States. I just completed a preliminary study with my staff, granted I only went back 10 years. I took every S&P industry average -- there are about a hundred of them, I'm talking about airlines, aerospace, computers, whatever -- and I compared them with the U.S. dollar. You would think that some of these industries with a strong dollar would be down. I didn't find that correlation. I found that went the dollar went down, these groups actually flattened out. When the dollar went up, these flattened out, and went up. So all of this talk about a strong dollar crippling the U.S. market, the blue chips, the S&P and the Dow, I think it's hogwash. <p>
Number one and number two, as the dollar goes up, think about it. The foreign investors are going to come here. This Dow is up 17 or 1800 points. There isn't a pound sterling in our market, there isn't a D-marc. There are no foreign investors here. And when the foreigners finally wake up, that they have to come back to the States because they're going to make money on the currency conversion, and then if they buy stocks, they'll make money in our blue chip market. What are they going to buy? Big blue chip stocks. So I think the strength in the dollar is not going to have a material effect on our stock market. And if anything, a strong dollar should help small and mid cap names.<p>
CLARK WINTER:
-------------------<br>
Definitely. I mean, that is a fact. As the dollar strengthens, small stocks out-perform. They have in the last 10 years, and we they will in the next five. <p>
RALPH ACAMPORA:
-------------------<br>
If you remember my presentation yesterday, the first part of the secular bull market which we are in, is lead by blue chips. The second part of that bull market, secular bull market are his (points to Bill Nasgovitz, in small caps) stocks. They haven't even come yet. So by the time they get there, the Dow is going to be well over 6,000, and we'll pass the baton to small and mid cap names and then the speculative stocks will take us over 7,000.<p>
WALTER MEAD:
--------------------<br>
So is or isn't foreign money coming into the U.S. market? (Laughter). Let's settle this once and for all. (Laughter).<p>
CLARK WINTER: 
-----------------<br>
I wish I had my laptop. But I can show you. If you look at the hockey stick turn of the U.S. equity market, it occurred in November of 1994, a couple weeks after the election. And I would suggest that it is Americans evidencing the fact that not necessarily they like the Presidential election, they like the fact that either way there's going to be action on the budget. So we've had a move up. If you look at that same chart, expressed in marcs, the hockey stick turns up in February. If you look at that same chart, expressed in yen, it starts in April. The return in yen of the Standard & Poor's from April through last week, make sure I explain that clearly: Measured in yen, the return of the U.S. stock market is 55 percent. That's the dollar and the yen. So I suggest that shows ample evidence that it took them a little while, but they see it. And the money from overseas is coming aggressively into the U.S. market right now. But it's not a fraction of what will come after the news gets dissipated. (Laughter).<p>
WILLIAM NASGOVITZ:
-------------
An additional point, in our bond market, the treasury bond market is certainly helped by this. It has to. If you can borrow in Tokyo at one half of a percent, and invest at four or five percent, it's certainly been a positive for that market as well.<p>
CLARK WINTER: 
--------------
Another indication then, do you remember the theory, when you were in school, they taught you that that there was something called the risk-free return? Remember that? U.S. Treasuries? That's the baseline and it was always flat. You measured all of your other investment alternatives off of that? Well, guess what. That doesn't work if you measure treasuries in any other currency. U.S. Treasuries measured in marcs or yen are down between 60, 40 percent over the last ten years. In 1994 alone, U.S. government bonds, depreciated more than 25 percent measured in yen. So a Japanese who held a U.S. bond lost 25 percent. Now that is inverted right now. <p>
So I suggest what has also happened out there is that the rest of the world's investors who understand this, no longer believe that the U.S. Treasury is the risk-free return. As one of them said, it's like that little cartoon where the guy goes off a cliff and is still running -- (laughter) -- we've seen it, but he still hasn't seen it. It's still the safest instrument in the world, and talk about the fall is very important, and it's still the largest instrument, and it's still the best place to put large amounts of liquidity. But it no longer is viewed in the rest of the world as a risk-free return. That's a thought only a few Americans still share.<p>
WALTER MEAD:
---------------------<br>
Well, I think we've settled that one, and as far as I can tell from the panel, the Dow is going to be somewhere between zero and 10,000 by the end of the decade (laughter). But I'm glad at least we know that foreign money will be in on it, whatever it is. (laughter).<p>
QUESTION: What is the outlook for banks and chemical companies. <p>
RALPH ACAMPORA:
--------------------<br>
I'm boring it. They're very bullish. Both of them. Buy them. <p>
WILLIAM NASGOVITZ: 
----------------------<br>
Regional banks and thrifts in your own backyard I think make a lot of sense. They've been a great place to put money over the past ten years, and that trend will probably continues as the industry consolidates. Companies that you do business with, perhaps, on a private business, or on a personal basis, perhaps deserve some attention in terms buying their stock. <p>
FRANK CAPPIELLO:
----------------------<br>
I would say regional banks are still good to invest in, because we're going to probably end up with 5,000 banks in the United States down from 11,000 in another five years. And all of those consolidations are going to make money for the company that's being acquired. So with a little diligent search, you can get in the path of some of that acquisition. So I think regional banks are fine. I would worry a little bit about the metropolitan banks. They're doing well now, I just don't see that kind of visibility. <p>
WALTER MEAD:
--------------------<br>
Now people are being rather silent about the chemical companies. Is there a reason for that? <p>
FRANK CAPPIELLO:
-------------------<br>
Too many pollution problems, environmental problems.<p>
RALPH ACAMPORA:
------------------<br>
I think the chemicals will do well because the cyclicals are coming back in their favor. The cyclicals started the turn up about two weeks ago. You had papers, aluminums, steel stocks went crazy yesterday I was told. Now it's just a matter of time for the chemicals...Union Carbide, DuPont, Monsante would be my three favorites. <p>
FRANK CAPPIELLO:
----------------
Well, Ralph likes everything I think! (Laughter).<p>
RALPH ACAMPORA:
---------------------<br>
Buy anything with a symbol, Frank. (Laughter).<p>
WALTER MEAD:
----------------------<br>
I have to say, I'm with Ralph, that if I could, I would buy every share of every stock on the New York Exchange. <p>
(Panelists are asked to give their predictions as to the highs and lows of the stock market).<p>
They hate this! (Laughter)<p>
RALPH ACAMPORA:
---------------------<br>
I'll start first. It's very interesting. Last year when I made my commentary about the market going to 7,000 in three years, I was in the minority. I found out this year, much to my chagrin, I'm in the pack, concensus opinion. This is officially what I put on Wall Street Week: the high would be 6,000, the low would be 4,900. The Dow would close 5,950. But you know what? Most of the people I talk to or I listen to are here, bascially saying somewhat the same thing. Most people are saying that 1996 won't be as strong as 1995. You know what? You want to be a contrarian against the concensus, including myself? You need to take one of two stands. Either the market crashes here, or we'll all wrong, and the market is indeed like 1995. And I'm very close to changing my opinion officially, and saying I think the market in 1996 will be as strong as 1995, and the target is 6,600 and not 6,000.<p>
WALTER MEAD:
----------------------<br>
Whoa! Okay, I hear 6,600, do I hear 6,700? (Laughter). I got a 6,700...<p>
WILLIAM NASGOVITZ:
-----------------------<br>
I'll be somewhat cautious. 5,700 cautious as the high. We've seen the low this year, and we'll close below where we are today, let's say 5,200.<p>
CLARK WINTER:
-------------------<br>
I think we're going to see a high of 6,400. I think if we fall it will fall to 5,100, and we'll finish about ten percent higher than where we are now. <p>
MICHAEL MURPHY:
---------------------<br>
Well, I'd have to agree that basically the fourth year of a presidential cycle nothing much happens. I think the high is more like 5,700, and the low 4,800. So, pretty contained. Then we close about where we are right now. I would worry along with, I think Frank's worry, that 1997 is the bad year. <p>
FRANK CAPPIELLO:
--------------------<br>
I'm going to be a little higher than I was on Wall Street, because associating with Ralph is catching I guess. (Laughter) But I'd say 6,100, and I think the low will be 4,600 to 4,700. Because I think the second half, while it will be good, I think we may get a bad election. And I'm not going to tell you what a bad election would be! I think we'll close probably around 5,100, and people realize it's not as bad as they think. But I do think the thing to worry about is 1997, not '96.<p>
CLARK WINTER: 
---------------------<br>
Speaking of the election, I want to ask a question. If Ralph ran for office based on what he said, (laughter) how many of you would vote for him?<p>
WALTER MEAD: 
---------------------<br>
Let me see what the audience thinks. How many people here would agree with Ralph's revised forecast of 6,600 on the Dow this year? No one really. We have two panelists holding up for 5,700. Somewhat stronger. 6,100? Now that brings them out. Anybody think it's going to be higher than any of the panelists said? That Ralph is just a pueling pessimist? Okay. We've got one! Is there anybody who thinks they're just sky optimistic? No. Okay. Well that's a pretty bullish crowd.<p>
So is the gambling craze going to have an effect on the economy beyond what it's done already?<p>
MICHAEL MURPHY:
-----------------<br>
Well if you think it's bad so far, you can get on the Internet and gamble in the cyber casino, which is run out of one of the Caribbean islands with credits anywhere in the country.<p>
Gambling is actually a benefit for technology companies. There are a number of companies in that area, like video lottery terminals, that are fairly attractive. What I think gambling basically takes money away from, unfortunately, is small charities. It appears to be, if you look at those two lines, gambling up, money to small charities is down. I think it's unstoppable at this point, though, because of the government's need for revenue without calling it taxes. <p>
Well, it may be coming some out of consumer, the real hit seems to have been the small charity, so far. That's where the real pain is being felt.

						On January 22, 1997, Jack Robinson joined Worth OnLine for a live "Conference Call." Robinson is President of Winslow Management Company and serves as subadvisor to the Green Century Balanced Fund, a unique type of mutual fund invested solely in environmentally-responsible companies. For calendar 1996, the Fund returned 25.02 percent to its investors, and was ranked No. 2 out of 277 unscreened U.S. balanced funds by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. In addition, the fund was ranked No. 1 for 1996 out of the 45 socially-responsible mutual funds. The following transcript is edited for clarity. The opinions expressed are those of Jack Robinson, and do not necessarily reflect the views of Worth OnLine, Worth magazine, or Capital Publishing. <p>
WorthEdit3:     Good evening, and welcome to Worth OnLine's CONFERENCE CALL series. Tonight, we're joined by Jack Robinson, President of Winslow Management Company. Winslow serves as subadvisor to the Green Century Balanced Fund, a unique type of mutual fund invested solely in environmentally responsible companies. Welcome, Mr. Robinson (he's using screenname JRobin3133). I'd like to begin by asking you to describe the criteria you use to determine which stocks to purchase for the Green Century Balanced Fund.<p>
JRobin3133:     We use 4 criteria:  environmental screen, technical, quantitative, & fundamental research.<p>
GRI CRS1:     When will Hewlett take off?<p>
JRobin3133:     GRI:  Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HWP) is environmentally responsible but selling at a multiple in excess of its grow rate.<p>
MAMANOGUE:     Would you buy a tobacco stock?<p>
JRobin3133:     MAM:  No, we would not buy a tobacco stock, they are the next asbestos candidates.<p>
MAMANOGUE:     Agreed. Thank you.<p>
JRobin3133:     MAM:  Also, tobacco creates toxic runoff problems.<p>
Almintas:     Mr. Robinson, why did you decide to concentrate on environmentally responsible companies?<p>
JRobin3133:     AL:  Green companies have 3 financial advantages:  stronger balance sheets, lower costs, and high revenue opportunities.<p>
MAMANOGUE:     What about a chicken company -- also toxic runoff?<p>
JRobin3133:     MAM:  yes, chicken companies are a problem but not free range chickens.<p>
Almintas:     JR, what reason do you see for that?<p>
JRobin3133:     AL:  environmental companies have lower contingent liability and enviro costs average 6 percent. So, you reduce costs, minimize liabilities, and develop green products for a growing market.<p>
NVME345:     Is the green fund a socially-responsible fund or just a name?<p>
JRobin3133:     NV:  It is a green fund. Green companies also tend to be socially responsible.<p>
NVME345:     JRobin do you have any opinion on Computer Associates (NYSE: CA), Nautica (NASD: NAUT), and Abercrombie and Fitch (NYSE: ANF)?<p>
JRobin3133:     NV:   CA having troubles.<p>
WorthEdit3:     Some say socially-responsible funds shun big returns by shunning big companies. What's your opinion of "big business" as green companies?<p>
JRobin3133:     Worth:  Socially-responsible (SR) and environmentally responsible (ER) companies come in all shapes and sizes, from IBM (NYSE: IBM) to Wild Oats (NASD: OATS).<p>
Almintas:     JR, does socially responsible approach help in fund sales?<p>
JRobin3133:     Al:  It can help in sales. 9 percent of all managed money is socially responsible in one way or another.  That is one in every ten dollars under management is pro-active.<p>
Almintas:     JR, are green companies currently so attractive due to a certain favoritism from government side? Partially?<p>
JRobin3133:     AL:  We look for companies driven by economics not regulation.<p>
Almintas:     Yes, but the government has impact upon economics.<p>
JRobin3133:     AL:  Impact, yes, but frequently negative.  You can't depend on them .<p>
Tex61:     JR, what is in store for the international funds over the next few years?<p>
JRobin3133:     Tex:  international green fund outlook is very positive.<p>
Almintas:     JR, do you invest internationally?<p>
JRobin3133:     AL:  yes, we do using ADRs. As well, the market for environmental goods and services is international. It is especially big in Germany.<p>
WorthEdit3:     What are some of the companies that lead the Green Century Balanced Fund to a 25.02% return in '96?<p>
JRobin3133:     Worth: Leading companies include PEV = Philip Environmental (NYSE: PEV), Thermo Electron Corp. (NYSE: TMO), Memtec (NASD: MMTCY), Checkpoint Sys. (NYSE: CKP).<p>
Almintas:     What companies are the biggest investments here and abroad?<p>
JRobin3133:     AL:  global environmental companies include TMO, MMTCY, Xerox (NYSE: XRX), PEV.<p>
Tom575:     Any comments on the stock markets condition now?<p>
JRobin3133:     TOM: We are fully invested.  It is unhealthy not to be.  Most all signals remain go.<p>
Tom575:     I just went to 100 percent cash for now. I think we are going to have a pull back soon in the stock market<p>
JRobin3133:     Tom, anything is possible but there are always good values.<p>
Almintas:     Do you think that environmental laws will become more demanding in the future?<p>
JRobin3133:     AL: Absolutely.  The worse it gets, the greater the regs. We like companies that go beyond compliance and are finding competitive advantages from environmental management.<p>
SANDBOB:     Can you define socially responsible, please?<p>
JRobin3133:     BOB:  SR includes multiple factors such as defense, tobacco, military, community, diversity, and of course, the environment.  Our focus is the environment because you can measure it in dollars and cents.  It is tied to the bottom line.<p>
Almintas:     JR, I must confess that earlier I used to look at SR funds as a sales maneuver because the SR companies often would emerge under governmental initiative, i.e. not fully open to free market, and SR funds tend to be not such good performers.<p>
JRobin3133:     AL: That is part of the problem with "SR" companies.  You need to dig under the PR veil. Historically, SR managers have been tree hugger driven rather than financially driven.<p>
Almintas:     Sorry, what's "tree hugger"? I am not an American.<p>
JRobin3133:     AL:  Someone extreme in their thinking rather than financially savvy.<p>
SANDBOB:     Largest holding, JR?<p>
JRobin3133:     SAND:  Our largest holding is NOKIA (NYSE: NOK.A), telecommuting at its best equals energy savings.<p>
NAPPER214:     I'm becoming interested in the area and topic of a cashless society. One stock in mind Cybercash (NASD: CYCH). Any additional comments?<p>
Almintas:     NAPPER, there are cashless people, but not societies.<p>
Almintas:     What's the fund's turnover?<p>
JRobin3133:     AL:  last year 60 percent.  The more volatility, the greater the turnover.<p>
JHugick:     Just rolling over a 403B, How long should I dollar cost average into the market? (Age 35)<p>
JRobin3133:     JHug:  At least another 20 years.<p>
EstVill:     JR, Are there any Websites you can recommend that cover SR equities?<p>
JRobin3133:     Vil:  Look up www.greenmoney.com<p>
WorthEdit3:     Your criteria includes an environmental screen. What do you look for specifically?<p>
JRobin3133:     Worth:  We look at toxic emission release, water conservation, energy, recycling. Also look at re-engineering of environmental management systems. Sustainable investing, we call it. We seek sustainable solutions to environmental problems.  For instance, we would not invest in a solid waste company because trash=cash.  We look for a solution rather.<p>
KCLTEG:     What is the best thing to invest in?<p>
JRobin3133:     KCL:  Water.  There is only so much of it and the demand goes up everyday.<p>
Tina 57:     How does one invest in water?<p>
JRobin3133:     Tina:  Memtec and Ionics (NYSE: ION) have the best technologies in water.<p>
Tina 57:     Do you invest in Bandag?<p>
JRobin3133:     Tina:  We like Bandag (NYSE: BDG) from an environmental point of view.  Recycling tires makes sense. Problem with Bandag is slowing growth rate.<p>
WorthEdit3:     What are some large companies you *won't* invest in, based on their environmental practices?<p>
JRobin3133:     Worth:  Companies we avoid:  Exxon (NYSE: XON), of course, GE (NYSE: GE), Raytheon (NYSE: RTN), Alcoa. They all have environmental liability, risks and problems. Steel companies, heavy metals are problems areas.  We avoid defense. Another area we like are organic and natural foods.  The industry is growing at 18 percent compared to mainstream supermarkets at 3 percent.<p>
WorthEdit3:     What are some names in that area?<p>
JRobin3133:     The two public companies that promote sustainable agriculture are WFMI and OATS.<p>
Tina 57:     Which do you prefer--WFMI or OATS?<p>
JRobin3133:     Tina:  Today OATS.  It went public at 25 and is now at 14.  Good value and big growth.<p>
KSaplin:     I am so confused in investment the fund market is crazed.... What should I do? How much and where would you invest to get a million in 20 years?<p>
JRobin3133:     KSAP:  Go green, of course.<p>
KSaplin:     What about ConAgra?? Will ConAg sell its beef division and would that make it more or less green??<p>
JRobin3133:     KSAP:  ConAgra (NYSE: CAG).  The problem here is big agriculture, monoculture, chemically dependent food. As well CAG sells well in excess of its growth rate. Watch out.<p>
FRobe10065:     What do you think about JTS?<p>
JRobin3133:     Frobe:  JTS (ASE: JTS) -- It certainly did well today.<p>
Milliams:     I am interested in funds that invest in companies that don't use animal testing.<p>
JRobin3133:     Mill:  We like that but it is difficult to screen for since the FDA requires it in cases.<p>
BMcclin775:     How long do we hold on to Puck?<p>
JRobin3133:     BM:  A triple in 2 months certainly sounds good to us.   Get your bait back!<p>
KSaplin:     What about IBP???<p>
JRobin3133:     KSAP:  BEEF -- IBP (NYSE: IBP) uses growth hormones, methane air emissions, and is energy inefficient.<p>
WorthEdit3:     On a larger scale, what impact do you think green funds can have on companies that aren't using good environmental policies?<p>
JRobin3133:     Worth:  We invest in a category called "best in class" & environmental turnarounds.  Every company can be environmentally responsible if it wants to be.<p>
Milliams:     It seems to me that as long as there are too few green funds, they would have little effect on the overall "green" policy of larger companies.<p>
JRobin3133:     Mill:  Ultimately every good analyst will use a green screen.<p>
Milliams:     That just seems overly optimistic to me. I certainly would long for such analysis.<p>
JRobin3133:     Mill:  We are optimistic by nature but not overly so in this case.<p>
Van thor:     Hello, Jack. Do you have any thoughts about WHFI- Wholesome & Hearty Foods (NASD: WHFI)?<p>
JRobin3133:     Van:  Great product, but only one of them.  No growth.  Look at Worthington Foods (NASD: WFDS).<p>
Tina 57:     Didn't Calvert start the divestiture movement out of South Africa?<p>
JRobin3133:     Tina:  Calvert was a forerunner.  An effective way to bring about change. Environment is next.<p>
Van thor:     Thanks. How can I get a prospectus for your fund?<p>
JRobin3133:     Van:  Web site address :  www.greenmoney.com/winslow. E-mail us from there.<p>
Van thor:     Thanks, I'll send for a prospectus. Do you have any specific sectors in which you concentrate ?<p>
JRobin3133:     Van:  Yes,  water, recycling, technology, telecommunications, alternative energy and sustainable agriculture. One last thought:  Galileo Corp. (NASD: GAEO).<p>
Shapisaac:     Is there any type of general or generic cataloging of green or otherwise socially responsible companies?<p>
JRobin3133:     Shap:  General cataloging....no. That's our opportunity.<p>
WorthEdit3:     Thank you, Mr. Robinson, for taking time to join us for this evening's edition of Conference Call. And thanks to our audience for joining us this evening, as well! <p>
JRobin3133:     Thank you everyone for your good questions.  Go green!!<p>
WorthEdit3:     Tune in tomorrow for Conference Call: Technology '97 at 8 p.m. EST. Thanks again everyone! Good night!

						On Wednesday, January 16, Peter Crane, author of "Mutual Fund Investing on the Internet," joined Worth OnLine for a LIVE "Conference Call." During the chat, Crane discussed online mutual fund trading and information. The opinions expressed within are Peter Crane's, and do not necessarily represent those of Worth OnLine, Worth magazine, or Capital Publishing. <p>
WorthEdit1:     Welcome to Worth OnLine! Our guest is Peter Crane, author of "Mutual Fund Investing on the Internet." His screen name is ... PeteCrane, oddly enough. Let's start by talking about some of your favorite online resources. When doing fund research, do you go to one comprehensive site, or lots of smaller ones that specialize in certain types of data. (And don't hesitate to drop names!)<p>
PeteCrane:     I prefer the giants. The little ones may not be there when you check back! http://networth.galt.com is good<p>
WorthEdit1:     What does Networth offer?<p>
PeteCrane:     Fund profiles, NAVs, finance articles, and more. They're integrated with Quicken's financial network www.qfn.com which has insurance, banking, and other info and companies. It's still not a must-see (few on the Web are), but it'll be one to watch.<p>
WorthEdit1:     Okay. What's your second stop on the 'Net?<p>
PeteCrane:     www.fidelity.com and www.vanguard.com have tons of stuff as well. The articles/info brochures alone would take someone a year to read (already up). News is one of the best things to start with when looking for finance on the Web. wsj.com (Wall Street Journal) and www.nytimes.com have great business news. www.bloomberg.com is one for fund junkies and www.cnnfn.com is excellent as well. I must add www.worth.com is great too:-) I haven't fully explored the AOL Worth area, but I will.<p>
WorthEdit1:     Do any of these sites have "cookies"--ie. customized information for each user--yet?<p>
PeteCrane:     Some do, but I wouldn't worry about them (the cookies I mean).<p>
WorthEdit1:     It's easy to get inundated with information. Any suggestions for those drowning in information online?<p>
PeteCrane:     Keep it fast. Go online for specific tasks and info. Check a few URLs, surf a few more, then go read! (for now).<p>
WorthEdit1:     Let's talk a little about message boards before we get back to some good sites.<p>
PeteCrane:     Newsgroups and chats are downright dangerous for taking advice. Always triple check your investment suggestions. There are two big newsgroups misc.invest.funds and misc.invest.mutual-funds, which have some interesting stuff.<p>
WorthEdit1:     Don't you think news ever breaks on a message board before it's out to the general public?<p>
PeteCrane:     I hope not, because that could be insider trading.<p>
WorthEdit1:     Gotcha.<p>
PeteCrane:     But investors should stay far away from rumor nyway.<p>
SSilver400:     Could you discuss the very popular mutual fund service on Compuserve?<p>
PeteCrane:     A lot of fund groups have areas on Compuserve. I avoid it though. I hate the numbers! (e-mail addresses)<p>
SSilver400:     The WSJ did a big article a few months ago about the very popular mutual fund service on Compuserve.<p>
PeteCrane:     I cover Compuserve in my book, but it's about 2 pages (AOL is 10!)<p>
Wayne Gal:     Will all the political hyperbole and rhetoric around the Congress have an impact on the economic situation due to the infighting, and affect the market?<p>
PeteCrane:     I think the balanced budget process, if it happens, will be big and great for investors of all kinds (I think a lot's already priced in though)<p>
Charter4U:     Interested in three fund companies, Putnam, MFS, AIM, any opinions?<p>
PeteCrane:     I like Putnam and AIM.<p>
JMFELAK:     Any opinion on the Biltmore Funds??<p>
PeteCrane:     JM- I'm not familiar. (That's a bad sign though - I don't like small funds, the expenses are usually high.)<p>
JMFELAK:     I'm invested percentage-wise highly in emerging markets.  A good strategy?<p>
PeteCrane:     I'd suggest 20 percent max, even for Mr. Vegas. I'd prefer a diversified international with SOME emerging markets.<p>
WorthEdit1:     AIMoos posted a good question on our message boards: He wants to know how long to hold onto a former high-flying fund that has trailed for a few years. It's the old... "When should I get out?" question...<p>
PeteCrane:     If the fund has done what it said it would (like value, etc.), keep it, else move. I think selling after an area underperforms for a few years is often the worst thing.<p>
SSilver400:     What net sources do you like to help make overall asset allocation decisions?<p>
PeteCrane:     SS- That's the hardest part, and the thing investors should spend 90 percent of their time on. I'm a buy-and-hold forever kind of guy:-) Some sites have allocation tools, but the good ones won't be built until late '97.  I think the old adage: 100 - your age is the best one (stock percentage). If you're 40, put 60% in stocks, etc. Everyone should have bonds, too, contrary to some. Buying and holding has tremendous tax advantages, which few investments can overcome. "Mutual Fund Investing on the Internet" has three chapters on funds and allocation:-)<p>
SSilver400:     Re: no asset allocation sites until late '97-What's causing the delay?<p>
PeteCrane:     No one wants to give the info away (and that's what it takes out there ->)<p>
BILLBO36:     Any thoughts about McDonald's?<p>
PeteCrane:     BI- I prefer funds (except for speculators) but I do like those blue-chips. They can even add diversity to a portfolio of funds.<p>
CKal689:     Name some blue chips you are fond of..<p>
PeteCrane:     CK- I prefer blue-chip funds, like Fidelity Blue Chip Growth or Vanguard US Growth. Any big growth fund will do though. But what the heck, Hewlett Packard, Motorola, and RD Shell!<p>
SSilver400:     Is your book available in bookstores, ...Uncle Pete?<p>
PeteCrane:     Yes, lots of Waldenbooks, Lauriats doing a promo, and of course, www.amazon.com. I can be found during the week at http://www.indexfund.com, the book's site.<p>
WorthEdit1:     Do you prefer any one of the search engines over the others?<p>
PeteCrane:     I've begun to dislike ALL of the search engines; it's a wild goose chase! http://www.hotbot.com (Wired's) and http://www.excite.com are decent though, and Alta Vista.<p>
Wayne Gal:     Everyone should be using ALTAVISTA, it's the BEST.<p>
PeteCrane:     Alta Vista does have tons of stuff. I can't wait until they improve the algorithms, though.<p>
Mondino:     How do you think a stock like SHARPER IMAGE is going to do.  It's listed as $3.20<p>
PeteCrane:     Buy for the long haul -- will the company be around in 20 years.<p>
CKal689:     I'm retiring pretty soon and the choices are overwhelming; any suggestions?<p>
PeteCrane:     Stay balanced, Fido Asset Manager Income or Vanguard Wellesley Income, maybe. But dollar cost average in: move 1/4 first then the rest over 5 years.<p>
CKal689:     Seeing my CFP next week and I'll fly a few things by him. I'll let you know what they are! Or rather what he suggests.<p>
PeteCrane:     Give him hell CK:-)<p>
WorthEdit1:     The Fools like those Index funds. What about you?<p>
PeteCrane:     I'm an index fanatic. I say index everything: stocks (international and domestic), bonds, REITs, cash even!<p>
WorthEdit1:     Your favorites?<p>
PeteCrane:     Vanguard Balanced Index is my favorite all-in-one fund, but Total Stock Market is next. I bet even Fidelity will add to their index lineup in '97 (they have Market Index now, an S&P 500 fund).<p>
WorthEdit1:     Okay, so I've got to ask... There are so many funds underperforming the S & P, why not expend the energy to research individual stocks as long as you're online ferreting about?<p>
PeteCrane:     Because the stockpickers are trailing the index too! Research investment strategies (and life strategies) not investments themselves. As the man said, allocation! Most stockpickers and fund managers will do okay, but they'll have spent a lot of time to hit the mean (someone's got to do it!).<p>
Wayne Gal:     How much of the index is subject to the technology stocks?  Does this distort the index?<p>
PeteCrane:     Way- It's around 10 percent, but they rebalance it occasionally! (Standard & Poor's or whomever's index it is)<p>
SSilver400:     Many investors pay advisors 1-2 percent to run no-load portfolios.  Do you see this moving to net?<p>
PeteCrane:     SS- The whole industry's growing so rapidly, that they'll do well despite the fees. But the cost'll probably be lowered into the 0.5-1.0 percent range (we hope).<p>
WorthEdit1:     So, Peter, do you touch on software at all in your book?<p>
PeteCrane:     Some of the browser and overall PC stuff, yes. I cover the Netscape 3 vs. Explorer 3 battle. I usually use Netscape 3 and Netcome, but do AOL just for the chats!<p>
WorthEdit1:     Soon AOL chats will go across the 'Net, too.<p>
PeteCrane:     Excellent, really?<p>
WorthEdit1:     Yup--saw a demo of the new software. Readers will even get to pick their seats!<p>
Wayne Gal:     What do you look for in the emerging markets funds? What about the emerging technologies?<p>
PeteCrane:     They're two different beasts, emerging markets are international (small countries); and the emerging technologies applications that will impact finance such as BANKING. Emerging technology (or growth) are small US companies. Be careful. A sexy story is always dangerous<p>
SSilver400:     Why can't someone charge .5-1.0 percent for it?<p>
PeteCrane:     SS- I'm hoping to do index allocations for .3 someday!<p>
Wayne Gal:     Grand Casino's  What do you think about the stock in the Stratosphere on the strip in Vegas?<p>
PeteCrane:     I don't like most stocks that've gone up; I'm a value person. Casino stocks especially make me nervous. I wouldn't buy 'em for that fact alone! (the fact they're casinos -- implying gambling) You know their accountants get tempted:-)<p>
WorthEdit1:     What about theme funds--ie. The Internet Fund, The Couch Potato Fund? Too gimmicky?<p>
PeteCrane:     The Internet fund I despise, yes way too gimmicky. Those outfits I wouldn't trust as far as I could throw my 386 (old, of course) :-)<p>
WorthEdit1:     Wow... You feel strongly about this.<p>
PeteCrane:     Those Internet Fund guys didn't even have a website when they issued a release. I savage them in the book (the Kentucky guys). Internet funds are more dangerous than individual stocks. I advise avoiding both (unless it's a tiny portion of a well-diversified portfolio).<p>
WorthEdit1:     Why can't a fund investing in companies that catch trends do well?<p>
PeteCrane:     It can, but trends move like the wind.<p>
WorthEdit1:     So we should all stay with slow, boring funds? ; )<p>
PeteCrane:     For the most part, yes.<p>
WorthEdit1:     What's the riskiest fund you would recommend?<p>
PeteCrane:     Vanguard Index Emerging Markets (I have 25 percent in my IRA) -- at least it's diversified! An aggressive growth, like Fido New Millennium, is okay too for up to 1/4 (max).<p>
AKohli8657:     Can anyone recommend any stocks?<p>
PeteCrane:     AOL<p>
Wayne Gal:     Multi-level marketing seems to be a growth area in this country.  Why haven't we seen some funds investing?<p>
PeteCrane:     That's even before "gambling" on my 'sectors to avoid' list. <p>
Wayne Gal:     Good answer, and I agree!<p>
PeteCrane:     (Though as an index convert, technically I advise investing EVERYWHERE).<p>
RandyM105:     Will Latin America Funds remain strong this year?<p>
PeteCrane:     I think capitalist fever is here to stay, I love 'em, but keep it tiny (10 percent max of portfolio).<p>
KAPAR4:     Starting out - new to investing....would like to go aggressive ...any suggestions in mutual funds?<p>
PeteCrane:     Start with a balanced fund, and move in slowly! Buy Lotto to take your aggressions out. Investing should be most patient!<p>
LLD II:     Your opinion of Fidelity EquitII fund?<p>
PeteCrane:     LLD- It's excellent. Blue-chip, conservative, even some bonds. It's not the time to go aggressive. The market's averaged almost 15 percent in the '90's! If you must buy stocks, at least keep it diversified and conservative.<p>
REBERRY1:     Even though EquitII just changed managers?<p>
PeteCrane:     REB- Yes, the manager matters about as much as two lines of the prospectus. Sector and allocation (and the fact that you're invested) are all.<p>
KAPAR4:     Isn't 15 percent good??  Would it be best to buy current top yielding stocks?<p>
PeteCrane:     KAP- It's a little too good, if you know what I mean.<p>
KAPAR4:     Would now even be a good time to buy in or maybe we should wait till it comes down a tad.<p>
PeteCrane:     KA- It's always a good time to buy, but a little at a time! (Every month is a good time to buy)<p>
LLD II:     We have three utilities - AEP, DOM R, UNELEC - sell or keep?<p>
PeteCrane:     LL- Keep, forever.<p>
LLD II:     RSell and then dollar-cost average in a mutual fund?<p>
PeteCrane:     LLD- I'd diversify gradually.<p>
KAPAR4:     Where to start? <p>
PeteCrane:     Start with a balanced (stock AND bond) fund.<p>
KAPAR4:     Is one investment house better than the other?  T.Rowe or Fidelity?<p>
PeteCrane:     It depends. I like Fidelity better, but T. Rowe is excellent (both are great). (Vanguard is my only other favorite, and USAA).<p>
KAPAR4:     What's the major difference, pro or con?<p>
PeteCrane:     Fidelity is selection, T. Rowe is strong in straightforward and international funds.<p>
KAPAR4:     Got numbers for your picks?<p>
PeteCrane:     Which picks?:-)<p>
KAPAR4:     Vanguard and USAA.<p>
PeteCrane:     See your local newspaper!<p>
KAPAR4:     Wall Street Journal?<p>
PeteCrane:     Section C.<p>
KAPAR4:     thank you:-)<p>
PeteCrane:     (Friday's edition has the 3- and 5-year #'s)<p>
KAPAR4:     How do you like Dunkin Donut stock with the onslaught of bagel intro?<p>
PeteCrane:     Go for it! ;-)<p>
KAPAR4:     Really??????<p>
PeteCrane:     0...<p>
KAPAR4:     What's that mean...?<p>
PeteCrane:     I'd limit any stock to 1-2 percent of overall holdings, but your guess is as good as anyone's. Bagels are spreading like mad ... they even have stores in Holiston, Ma. now.<p>
WorthEdit1:     Thank you for joining Worth OnLine and Peter Crane  for this evening's chat.<p>
PeteCrane:     Thanks and goodnight all! (Excellent)<p>
WorthEdit1:     The Worth staff extends its appreciation to Mr. Crane for being our guest.

						On Wednesday, January 8, the Worth Advocate, Ken Kurson, joined Worth OnLine for a live CONFERENCE CALL. Kurson is also the editor of Green magazine, a personal finance magazine for people in their twenties. The following is an edited transcript of the evening's chat. The opinions expressed are those of Ken Kurson, and do not necessarily represent the views of Worth OnLine, Worth magazine, or Capital Publishing.<p>
WorthOnLne:     Welcome to "Conference Call," Worth OnLine's live chat show series. Check our site (Keyword: Worth) for a calendar of upcoming events. Our guest tonight is Ken Kurson, who answers readers questions in the Advocate column in Worth magazine. Kurson is also the editor of Green magazine, a personal finance magazine for people in their twenties who never thought they'd actually need a personal finance magazine. He is using screenname "WAdvocate."<p>
Wadvocate:     You are all my children. Speak!<p>
Wadvocate:     Contest: Who can tell me what kind of car the original Allserve vehicle "MacRobbie" was? Winner gets a free subscription to Green.<p>
WorthEdit1:     I believe that this is Ken's way of soliciting questions from the audience.<p>
Golfer903:     Mutual fund hedges for 1997?<p>
Wadvocate:     Who likes Utah minus 5-1/2 tonight against Milwaukee?<p>
Wadvocate:     Good question Golfer. I like Microcaps. Here's why: Traditionally, microcaps are on a 6-8 year bull cycle that trails the bigger caps. After bigs put up two consecutive great years, there's almost no value left in the whole S&P 500. So where does that leave the average investor, who doesn't want to leave a hot market, but can't afford the bigger plays? Answer: microcaps. But it'll be a selective market, especially after so many IPO disappointments.<p>
Golfer903:     Any ones in particular you recommend?<p>
Wadvocate:     Well, I don't wanna get stuck recommending a particular microcap stock.<p>
Golfer903:     Get stuck.<p>
Wadvocate:     OK, OK. One stock I've been following is Specialty Teleconstructors (SCTR). But it's already had a hell of a run (3-14) and I won't say how much more room's left.<p>
Wadvocate:     Firefly, there's a great song by American Music Club called Firefly. <p>
FireFly255:     What is a good home base business to get into?<p>
Wadvocate:     Well, beware of the millions of spams you get on E-mail. Most only enrich the company spamming. Basically, and I hate to resort to clichs, if it sounds too good to be true...<p>
JBLMcBride:     If you also could recommend any specific mutual funds on the subject!<p>
Wadvocate:     I think the Wasatch MidCap is going to come roaring back to life this year.<p>
Mpact2000:     Is there any way to defer a gain from stock to '97 if it was sold in 96?<p>
Wadvocate:     Mpact: No. If you sold in '96, you gotta pay in '96.<p>
Mpact2000:     Trade date is law?<p>
Wadvocate:     Well, you'll get a list of all short- and long-term gains from your broker... I don't think they send it to the IRS, but I certainly wouldn't want that safe hanging over my head.<p>
Golfer903:     How high will the Dow go in '97?<p>
Wadvocate:     Dow '97: 6950. I should add, I think it'll be higher than 6950 mid year, but will close the year around there.<p>
Golfer903:     What mix you recommend for some who just retired?<p>
Wadvocate:     Just retired -- what age, risk tolerance?<p>
Golfer903:     62, medium risk.<p>
Wadvocate:     Well, I'd certainly have to know lots more about your situation, before dishing serious advice, but a thumbnail sketch might look something like 35 percent in a Blue Chip fund, another 10-15 percent in some high-yielding stocks, another 35-40 percent in govvies and the rest in laddered CDs.<p>
Tuku2400:     What's your interest rate forecast?<p>
Wadvocate:     Interest rate: I predict two small increases, totalling .5 percent, in Spring and Fall.<p>
DFMAN:     Any thoughts on high tech...would now be the time to lock in profits?<p>
Wadvocate:     Well, depends what you mean by high tech. If you mean what I call "Blue Chip" high tech (Intel, Motorola, IBM), I see more room and more resiliency to a market downturn. But anyone who's an also-ran in market share's gonna get hammered by the next Nasdaq dip.<p>
JBLMcBride:     Is there a particularly good international fund you would recommend?... Or is a global fund better?<p>
Wadvocate:     My fave international fund is Founders Worldwide Growth. As for international vs. global, I don't think there's so much difference. Basically, so many companies are so diverse geographically, that interests bleed across borders.<p>
PapasPeach:     Married couple -- 30's, self-employed, children's college being taken care of as we speak, on only debt mortgage -- now where do we start???<p>
Wadvocate:     College paid for? Count your blessings! Well, if your house is financed at an acceptable rate, I'd use any extra to finance your retirement, first through tax-deferred options (IRA or Keough)<p>
BRICK069:     What is a world equity fund?<p>
Wadvocate:     World Equity fund means a stock mutual fund that can invest all over the world, including US.<p>
User351575:     How do you feel about the merger between 20th Century and Benham?<p>
Wadvocate:     20th and Benham -- Well, the industry is consolidating as marketing costs and economies of scale make it a survival of the biggest environment.<p>
RMiddagh:     What is your opinion on the future direction of gold?<p>
Wadvocate:     Gold: A decent hedge considering I expect interest rates to go up. But still an underperformer over the long haul.<p>
BD723:     Do you think Raytheon should be bought or held?<p>
Wadvocate:     Raytheon's made some good moves lately, but defense in general's gonna be tough as its biggest customer (um, us!) cuts back.<p>
Pagesix:     Pathetically-performing Far East mutual funds ... hang in or bail out?<p>
Wadvocate:     Far East: Well, I wouldn't invest today, but I might feel differently if I already had. Sorry!<p>
RIMJITA:     How does an annuity differ from a stock or mutual fund and what are its pros & cons?<p>
Wadvocate:     Annuity is an insurance product, attractive only for its guaranteed payout. Mutual funds and stocks are notable for their fluctuations.<p>
Mpact2000:     What do you think about Hilton's new bedfellow Bally?<p>
Wadvocate:     Hilton and Bally: Good idea for a merger but gambling sector going to hit some walls -- where else to go?<p>
PDin2:     Hi! What would you do? Wife leaving company in April, '97. Should she make changes to her 401k account now...or wait till 4/97 to roll-over her mutual funds to an IRA then?<p>
Wadvocate:     It doesn't really matter when she changes her 401K plan.<p>
NITEX7:     What about NIKE?<p>
Wadvocate:     Nike: Great stock. Getting into skates, other clothes. What a juggernaut.<p>
AABordy:     Is ValuJet too risky to consider right now or is their recovery worth a shot?<p>
Wadvocate:     As for ValuJet, I just talked to a former pilot there (laid off after the crash) and he says it's a great company. But as a stock, I think it and SunJet and all the rest are in trouble, from a stock point of view. The other airlines have successfully raised prices and can be so cutthroat on price competition where routes are in competition that it's so hard to be an independent. Yes, Southwest and others can pull it off, but I'm wondering whether even USAir and TWA will survive, let alone Valujet.<p>
RIMJITA:     Does a guaranteed payout on an annuity necessarily mean lower risk with lower return?<p>
Wadvocate:     Annuities almost always mean lower returns than you'd get investing in the same stocks that the annuity holds. That's why they can guarantee the payout.<p>
Pagesix:     If your broker asks for discretionary authority (and has made money for others) would you?<p>
Wadvocate:     I would not give discretionary authority to any broker. But that's me -- some people feel very comfortable with that.<p>
BlimeyFish:     Commodities trading worth it? <p>
Wadvocate:     Commodities can be very "worth it" -- if you've got the time and liquidity to ride out what will inevitably be very big bumps.<p>
JRobin3133:     How do you know if a broker is honest?<p>
Wadvocate:     Honest? Well, a lot relies on the same instincts you'd use to hire any professional -- doctor, lawyer. Check his record through NASD. Get rec's from friends.<p>
Mpact2000:     How about cable TV, modems, and telephony stocks, any favors ?<p>
Wadvocate:     Cable: I like TCI now. Now that Malone's rolled up his sleeves, I don't think many people can touch him. And satellite has started to slow...<p>
Pagesix:     Your opinion of NASDAQ and the bid/asks system that seems to make the NYSE look honest?<p>
Wadvocate:     Well, Nasdaq has worked hard to clean up the discrepancies between the bid/ask and they've gone in the right direction. But there are still more companies on that exchange than on the others that take advantage of its low capital requirements to do stuff that hurts investors.<p>
DTodd61986:     As a participant in an employer profit sharing can you also contribute to an IRA?<p>
Wadvocate:     401k contributors can (and should!) contribute to IRAs. But their IRA contributions won't be tax-deductible (though returns will still be tax-deferred)<p>
CAD92:     If IOMEGA projected sales to be $1 billion why is the stock going DOWN ?<p>
Wadvocate:     Iomega: Cause it was WAY overvalued. Sales are not the only issue; profits matter too. Iomega makes a great product (I own a Zip drive). But it's still a non-diversified line and a way overpriced stock.<p>
SHCOREY:     What does it look like for the GAP?  thanks<p>
Wadvocate:     Gap seems impervious to the retail-sector blahs, but it's a rough sector nonetheless.<p>
TWOCOASTRS:     General question:  should I choose a loaded mutual fund vs. non-loaded?<p>
Wadvocate:     Loaded vs. non-loaded: I say, choose the fund you like best on a total return basis. If it has a load, pay it, if not, double plus good.<p>
Carl7430:     What is the best and easiest to use tax software?<p>
Wadvocate:     Tax software: I'm a MacInTax fan, but that's cuz I'm a diehard Mac user.<p>
SLIMMER:     I wanted to know how far in advanced a person should be thinking about rolling over a 401K<p>
Wadvocate:     By "rolling over" I assume you mean changing companies. Right, slimmer?<p>
SLIMMER:     I'm not sure.  I won't be 59 1/2 for 5 years, but I don't know anything about what I should do when that time comes.<p>
Wadvocate:     Well, you need to start researching, and a financial pro might be a good idea.<p>
SLIMMER:     Is it too soon? I mean, I have 5 years<p>
Wadvocate:     Definitely not too soon, Slim. Make sure to check with NAPFA for credentials on any financial planner, and stick to fee-only guys, rather than those who earn commissions by pushing particular products.<p>
PDin2:     Similar problem as Slimmer, only I have 3 months! Markets up..should I move money to fixed income account now anticipating needing to roll-over or hold on till April? Do I have to pull 401k money out of company account, or can I leave it in the account after leave company<p>
Wadvocate:     If you're 59, PDin2, you should definitely have at least a portion of your dough in fixed income investments<p>
TheMacs:     I need info on research material on technical trading in the market.<p>
Wadvocate:     Technical analysis is hard as hell to pull off, but Jim Dines is a pretty good timer. He puts out a newsletter from California.<p>
Sidney121:     What do you do about a student loan that, quite simply, you just can't pay right now?<p>
Wadvocate:     Sidney, ask for a deferment. Almost always granted. It'll be easier if you contact them before they have to hunt you down.<p>
JammKid:     Fave sectors for '97?<p>
Wadvocate:     Fave sector: Energy.<p>
Badelman12:     Extra 100/month. Should I put toward mortgage or invest in market. <p>
Wadvocate:     I'd invest the extra hunge in the market. Unless your home's financed above 9% or so...<p>
Pagesix:     What percentage of your personal equity holdings in AOL? <g><p>
Wadvocate:     My personal equity holdings, Page 6? Zip! What am I, the Motley Fools?<p>
OGonzalez:     Should I include in my portfolio index funds?<p>
Wadvocate:     Gonzalez, index funds are becoming very popular, as they should after a couple great years in a row. But they'll ride out a dip harder than a lot of non-index funds.<p>
SSQR33:     What's the best kind of investments for starters?<p>
Wadvocate:     For starters, I recommend a growth stock mutual fund -- something like Dodge & Cox Stock.<p>
SSQR33:     But what about stocks so my money can grow with a high interest rate?<p>
Wadvocate:     You don't earn "interest" on stocks SSQ, but you do hopefully get capital gains.<p>
Snaved5:     What about US bonds?<p>
Wadvocate:     Young folks shouldn't overdo it on bonds -- too high an opportunity cost.<p>
PeterDeos:     How do you feel about the natural gas stocks, i.e. CNG, ENE, NFG, etc.?<p>
Wadvocate:     I'm not as crazy about Natural Gas as I am electricity. Watch for dividend cuts closely.<p>
BLACKXBIRD:     Hello again, Ken.  Will publicity kill the "Dogs of the Dow" strategy & similar, you think?<p>
Wadvocate:     No, it won't kill Dogs. Those companies are all in the DJIA and are way too big to be affected by the small money being added because of publicity.<p>
OGonzalez:     What you think about Fidelity Blue Chip stock for '97?<p>
Wadvocate:     I like but don't love Fid Blue Chip. I bought some for my mom and have been pleased but not delirious.<p>
Mpact2000:     What affect do you think Dereg will have on energy producing giants?<p>
Wadvocate:     Dereg's gonna mean lots of juicy buyouts for even crappy co's (Lilco, for ex).<p>
LisaAJM97:     What do you think is the best way to pay off high debts?<p>
Wadvocate:     Pay off high debts: Best way is to pay highest rate debt first.<p>

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:AlexNC@cris.com">Herbert Alexander</a> on February 08, 1997 at 15:19:11:<p>
Shouldn't there be an investment paradigm or strategy that addresses the retirement needs of a new generation of investors, the Tweeners?  Today's market is driven by the retirement savings plans of the Baby Boom generation.  Boomers, who are now advancing in years and income, have a tremendous appetite for stocks (and bonds) as they build reserves for the looming winter of retirement years.  This heavy demand by a huge cohort of the population has created the persistent bullish trend of the market.<br>The 'Tweeners, that cohort of the population born between the Boomers and their Generation X progeny, will likely face an entirely different market as the comparatively affluent Boomers begin to convert savings to income for retirement expenses.<br>'Tweeners face the challenge of being in a trough of the population-wave in the US.  With adequate information, they should be able to employ this unique position in a successful retirement-savings and investment strategy.<br>Please offer your comments on this issue. <p><br>

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:sunish@udel.edu">Sunish Amin</a> on February 04, 1997 at 22:26:30:<p>
Dear Mr.Lynch,<p>	I am a 19 year old who has been <br>investing in stocks ever since I was in <br>9th grade.  For the past four years, I <br>have managed my parents 401k, IRA, and <br>Savings Account.  The return on my <br>investment in stocks has outpaced the <br>gains produced by the S&P500, DJIA, and <br>NASDAQ INDICIES.<br>	I had made up my mind, since 9th <br>grade, that I want to be a Mutual Fund <br>Manager.  I think about stocks day and <br>night.  In my free time I research as <br>many stocks as possible.  I am aware of <br>the fact that a portifolio manager has a <br>60-70 hour work week and that a M.B.A <br>degree is a must. I know I have the <br>hunger and dedication to do the job and <br>to do the job well, but I would like <br>some of your guidance.<br>	Do you think that attending a top <br>business school is a must? <br>	I noticed that you received your <br>B.S. Degree from Boston College and then <br>you went on to attain your M.B.A from U <br>of Penn.<br>	I am a freshmen at the University of <br>Delaware and I would appreciate it if <br>you could offer me some guidance as to <br>what course of action I should take?<br>	I am very thakful that you have <br>taken your time to read this letter and <br>to offer my gratitude, I give you this <br>stock tip as a small favor.<br>1.	CULP INC.(NYSE:CFI,$16.5)- The <br>company is in a very boring business, it <br>makes mattress tickings.  It is regarded <br>as a cyclical company, but in fact the <br>company is taking the cycliality out of <br>its business by expanding overseas. The <br>evidence of this can be found in its <br>international sales, which are up about <br>35% this year.  Its earnings are growing <br>at 20% and it trades at a PE of about 14 <br>times 96 earnings.	Furthermore, the <br>company just issued 1.6 million shares <br>to reduce its long term debt and to <br>expand production capacity.  The newly <br>issued shares may dilute earnings <br>somewhat in the short term, but the <br>company is positioning to be a big <br>winner in the future.<br>

Peter, thanks for taking this post. I'm<br>an employee of IBM and I consistantly<br>buy IBM stock through our company stock<br>purchase plan. I set aside 10% of my<br>salary and buy our stock at a 15%<br>discount. My question is how do you view<br>IBM today? We rode out the tough times,<br>and I see our company as lean and<br>competitive. I retire in 14 years.<br>Should I continue buying and hold for<br>the duration? I currently have 200+<br>shares and am diversified with my other<br>assets.

Ted,<p>Thanks for writing. Peter Lynch does not <br>monitor these boards on a regular basis, <br>and won't be responding to all of the <br>questions posted here. So if you're <br>looking to these boards for interaction, <br>your best bet will be to post your <br>thoughts *about* Lynch's columns. <p>However, questions are forwarded to <br>Peter Lynch frequently. In an upcoming <br>column in Worth, he'll be answering <br>questions posted on the message boards. <p>Thanks for writing,<br>Amanda Meffert<br>Worth OnLine<br>

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:kgolaw@aol.com">Carol Grant</a> on February 01, 1997 at 18:05:31:<p>
Neither the Internet nor the library seems to have good information comparing variable annuities.  I am familiar with the Morningstar statistical comparisons but they don't give me a feel for the fund manager's style and I would like more sources of information than one.  Are there other rating services which address variable annuities?<p>How to select a good small cap fund for long-term investing?  Morningstar divides the funds into "value", "growth" and "blend".  Since limiting one's funds is a good idea, which of these 3 categories should I target ?  I've looked at the Barr Rosenberg prospectus but the expenses seem high.

Mr. Lynch,  It's an honor sir.  I wanted <br>to know how you felt about Worth's asset <br>allocation model and the list of their <br>favorite mutual funds in the large and <br>small cap growth, large and small cap <br>value, international and special <br>situation funds.  I am thinking about <br>simplifying my portfolio and following a <br>very similar plan.  Right now I'm all <br>over the place and my plan has lost its <br>coherence.  I am able to invest about <br>1200 a month and wondered what you could <br>tell a guy who doesn't have the time to <br>track and research individul stocks.  Of <br>the mutuals I now own, I am 90% into <br>stocks and the remainder in cash.  <br>Thanks!

I have a very important question for Peter Lynch, but I don't want to waste anyone's time (including mine), if questions posted here are not read or answered by The Man himself.  The web page headline reads "ASK Peter Lynch", but the small print says "post comments ABOUT Peter Lynch".  Which is it?<p>Thank you,<p>Ted Cavallin

Dear Mr. Lynch,<br>	I totally loved your books, and I<br>really admire you for your innovative<br>and  independent mind.<p>	Here is my question.<br>If you stay fully invested at all times,<br>then where do you get the money to pick<br>bargains right after crashes or on the<br>bottom of a bear market? Wouldn't your<br>whole portfolio be down at a time like<br>this and you would have to sell at a<br>loss to buy a better stock?<p>Thank you very much.<br>Victor Izmaylov<br>Economics student at Rutgers College

Dear Mr. Lynch:<p>I am looking for career advice regarding <br>how one enters the mutual fund industry <br>as an industry/company researcher or <br>analyst. Having just graduated from the <br>University of Massachusetts' MBA <br>program, I found this area to be very <br>interesting. Any advice or resources you <br>could provide would be greatly <br>appreciated.<p>Sincerely,<p><br>Peter D. Guschov<br>

Dear Peter Lynch:<p>I read your "On up on Wall Street" and <br>was totally taken by it.<p>It was very insightfull and entertaining <br>as well (with your comic interludes).<p>I think it is a must read for anybody <br>with stocks.  It also helps people who <br>own businesses (Kind-of-like a "How to <br>keep your business from dying?")<p>Thanks for a great book.<p>By-the-way my birthday falls on Jan <br>19th, (but in 1968)-and I too never <br>learnt swimming!!!!!<p>Chris<br>(Philadelphia, PA)<br>

Do you agree that much of the current run-up in the averages is the result of baby-boomers saving for retirement, i.e., essentially a matter of the demand for stocks outstripping the supply, with the resulting run-up then fueling the demand even further?<p>If so, do you think that the current high real long-term U.S. interest rates are in part a result of "distorted" asset allocations by U.S. savers who are chasing the high returns of the stock market.  (The strength of the dollar suggests that the rest of the world thinks our bonds are a bargain.) <p>If so, when will this worm turn, and how violent will the correction be?  I foresee the day when the boomers realize that they do not have enough time to recoup the losses implicit in a correction and all run for bonds at once, creating in the process the very bear they are fleeing.  And I foresee it before the day they start liquidating their holdings to support them in their old age, i.e., sooner, rather than later. <p>What do you think?

When examining the price/earnings ratio <br>of a company as a measure of value, what <br>is the most relevant standard to measure <br>against: the overall market P/E, the <br>company's specific industry P/E, or the <br>projected earnings growth rate of the <br>company itself? Any help you can offer <br>would be appreciated.

Dear Mr Lynch - You once mentioned that <br>one should look into one's own backyard. <br>That advice has stuck and I have <br>recently purchased stock in Desert <br>Community Bank in Victorville, Ca. I <br>have an account with the bank and know <br>of several local businessmen who have <br>gone from Bof A to them; I am impressed <br>with their level of service; their <br>growth is slow but steady,and every new <br>branch produces a profit. Their <br>financial report also looks good.<br>Question: I am concerned that a company <br>this small might be illiquid, and that <br>the recent increase in its price (6%) <br>could be speculation more than anything <br>based on sound fundamentals.<br>Any advice Please?<br>many thanks

Dear Peter Lynch, <p>Exploris is a non-profit museum about global education opening in Raleigh, NC in early 1999. Our imperative is to help prepare young people for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. Planners are currently developing five different exhibit areas with topics ranging from cultural geography to an in-depth feature on the life of Anne Frank.  We plan to have a stock exchange component in TradeWorks, the Exploris global economics exhibit.  I am currently trying to find a young investor to highlight and collecting quotes from people such as yourself about the importance of investing young.  Any suggestions you'd like to make about what you'd want to do, see, and hear in an exhibit about the stock exchange are most welcome. <p>Thank you for considering us.  We hope to hear from you soon.<p>Sincerely, <p>Corinne Glover/ Exhibit Developer

OSSI is back down to 24 from around <br>40 where I bought it. Outback still is <br>growing, and the new Italian concept <br>looks very promising. Why did the stock <br>plummet recently? I see no good reasons <br>for it. PE ratio is reasonable, the <br>company is still growing and the last <br>quarter earnings were up 25%. Any <br>insight into the problem?<br>

Dear Mr. Lynch,<br>Thanks for the excellent book "Beating <br>the Street".  I look forward to using <br>your advice on using the relationship <br>between earnings and stock price to <br>determine if a stock is a good buy (or <br>sell), but am having trouble finding the <br> "Chart Book" you referred to that has <br>price and earnings data similar to the <br>charts in your book.  If you could tell <br>me who publishes such a book, it would <br>be very much appreciated.<p>Ron Alfson

Could you point out your most <br>important criteria that would lead you <br>to examine a closed end fund vs. a <br>open-ended fund for an investment?  You <br>do not hear much from the popular press <br>about closed-end funds, although many <br>are trading at substantial discounts.<p>Thanks

Hi, I read your story on Fanni Mae in <br>Beating the Street.  Up here in Canada, <br>I found a resemblance with a company <br>named Newcourt Credit Group which is not <br>repackaging mortgages, but repackaging <br>Capital Equipment Leases.  They borrow <br>money from Insurance companies and such, <br>pay the retailer cash for the customer <br>wanting new equipment, while retaining <br>the customers lease.  Newcourt continues <br>to appreciate strongly, year over year. <br> Have you heard of them and what do you <br>think about this comapny as another <br>Fannie Mae type story.

Dear Mr.Lynch,<p>How much should the percentage of shares <br>held by institutions affect an <br>individual's investor who is looking at <br>a particular stock. For example, Cisco <br>systems is a great company with an <br>excellent growth potential but 79% of <br>the shares are being held by large <br>institutions who can sell at the drop of <br>a hat before an individual investor like <br>me can find out the bad news.<br>Thank you!<p>G.Singh

   What is your recomendation on this <br>stock? The subscriber base is increasing <br>and company debt is decreasing but the <br>stock won't move it's seem to be stuck <br>in a trading range. What will it take to <br>get this stock moving up? and is it a <br>good buy around the 10.50 price range?

Mr. Lynch,<br>I know you have always been a fan of banks, but I see banks as slowly dying because of technology.  AT&T univerals cards, Fidelity and Schwab web trading and investing are all cutting into the banks markets.  With smart cards coming into view (www.mondexusa.com, www.verifone.com) do you see any decent stock plays?  I've been buying verifone to capitalize on this shift.  This is a long term investment, but I think they are well positioned to profit from any move to smartcards and away from magnetic stripe cards.  Do you agree with this analysis?  Thank you.

I have read One Up on Wall Street and <br>Beating the Street and I agree that long <br>term a portfolio fully invested in <br>equities will outperform all others.  My <br>concern is this:  I have a lump sum to <br>invest now and do not expect to add <br>significant sums to that at a later <br>date.  With the S&P at an historically <br>high ratio, I am nervous about investing <br>all at once.  Would you recommend dollar <br>cost averaging and if so, over what <br>period of time?

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:snoll@ix.netcom.com">Steve Noll</a> on January 19, 1997 at 07:11:58:<p>
I have established an asset allocation <br>scheme within my 401K plan.  I have<br>a percentage desginated to domestic<br>stocks, Europe stocks, Pacific region<br>stocks, etc.  Since the Pacifc region<br>has not been doing well, it is <br>constantly lagging it's designated<br>percentage.  <p>My question is what rebalancing technique will most enhance my<br>returns.  Currently, all my future<br>contributions are being placed in the<br>Pacific region stocks (since it <br>significantly lags my desired asset<br>allocation).  However, this results in <br>no additional money being invested<br>in the regions doing well.  Will my<br>returns be improved by using my<br>asset allocation percentages to<br>dictate additional contributions<br>(i.e., contribute to all markets <br>throughout the year regardless of their<br>performance) and then simply<br>rebalance my entire portfolio once a <br>year?  Thanks.

The Dow rushes on. Time Warner waits and <br>watches. Am I missing something? How do <br>these guys deal with their debt <br>problems? Will they wait until interest <br>rates start to rise to get nervous, and <br>me too, or start to do some things now. <br>If you lag behind the rising Dow, what <br>to do? Stay ever so patiently, or pick a <br>stock where the management cares about <br>the shareholder? Kevin O'Leary

Hi, Peter, You are so famous that I <br>started my stock trade with your book as <br>my most frequently resorted reference. <br>But I have   a question to you now: I am <br>holding about 1000 shares or S3 at 16-<br>18. Everything seems good for S3 and <br>every analyst is recommending it, but <br>its price is not moving at all in such a <br>bull market, how come? <br>

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:edelph@mail.win.org">Eric R. Delph</a> on January 17, 1997 at 15:47:30:<p>
Some companies have 2 classes of stock. <br>One class usually has greater voting<br>power than the other.  The greater<br>voting class is usually closly held.  A<br>stock that I am considering investing<br>in, Dairy Queen, has such an<br>arangement.  I understand that this is<br>to thwart a hostile take over, but it<br>seems that I am not 'owning' the<br>company, just a limited partner. <br>Usually I would buy this company at its<br>current price with their fundamentals,<br>but this puts a new wrinkle in it.  Is a<br>stock that can only elect 25% of the<br>board of directors really worth<br>something?

Is it worthy according <br>to you to buy house there for an <br>expatriate, considering the local law <br>and especially the local policy.

Hello,<br>This year I thought I would try to<br>invest through DRIPs. First stock to<br>invest in was Motorola. Havd to buy <br>first share through Broker. Called <br>Broker and they said it would not be<br>to my advantage to do Drips. They said<br>it would take at least 10 years to earn<br>any money from divendends. I qoute<br>"You will only earn 0.48 a year from<br>Motorola per share and Motorola would<br>have to go over 100.00 a share for me<br>to make any money. <br>Now they want me to invest in AIM mutual<br>funds. I have become discouraged and may<br>not invest at all in anything.<br>The stock MOT was 68.00 and the <br>commission to buy one share was 29.00<br>so I would be paying 97.00 for 1 share<p>What should I do to start investing and <br>to make some money?

Dear Mr.Lynch,After years of telling myself "Should I, or shouldn't", I have finally decided to jump in the stock market abyss; only problem is--I have no idea what is a good sound investment versus what is a suicidal investment.  Granted, I understand, and am fully aware that there are risk in everything one does including doing nothing, nonetheless I would like any information you have to offer regarding the numerous mutual funds, companies, etc. etc.  I am looking to make "some" money, but mostly am planning for my inevitable retirement.  I currently participate in the Federal Government's thrift saving plans, but realize that this pension plan may not be enough for my twilight years.Any information you can provide is will be greatly appreciate it.Thank you for your time.julie laurel

Dear Peter,<p>For a year now our company has been able to add two new mutual funds to our 401(k) plan but we can't get our board of directors to approve any funds. Hopefully by the end of January they will vote to add the two new funds (this is about the fifth time they're going to vote on it). <br>We currently have six choices through Fidelity, they are:<br>Asset Manager<br>Contrafund<br>Growth and Income<br>Investment Grade Bond<br>Magellan and<br>Managed Income Portfolio<br>Could you give us your opinion on what types of funds to add to better diversify our 401(k).<p>Thank you,<br>Art Paine

Dear Mr. Lynch,<p>I am considering buying stock in <br>Blimpie's and I would like your opinion. <p>Blimpie's has plans to add 600 stores in <br>1997. Since they currently have about <br>1600 stores, this an approximate growth <br>rate of 30%. They want to have 5000 <br>stores by the year 2000. I think one <br>reason why the stock has dropped to $10 <br>per share is that their earning per <br>share declined for the past two <br>quarters. However the current P/E ratio <br>is around 22 which should make this <br>stock a fair buy.<p>Any comments is most appreciative. <p><br>Sincerely,<p>Bob Johnson

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:jwinkl@fbw.baynet.de">Joachim Winklmeier</a> on January 12, 1997 at 15:24:52:<p>
Dear Mr Lynch,<br>thank you for writing your three books. <br>I have learned a lot of it.<br>I would like to ask you about your <br>favorites in the restaurants, retailers <br>and S&L`s expecially your opinion on:<br>- STAR, OSSI, BOST, PZZA<br>- PCTY, GADZ, BBBY, DLTR, DLIA, HLYW<br>- FFFC, HFFB, GPT, THRD.<br>Maybe these are already too many <br>questions but I would still like to ask <br>you about your opinion on a Philippine <br>company: Jollibee Foods. This is a fast <br>food chain. I`ve seen it on my vacation <br>in the Philippines. Their outlets were <br>filled with much more people than <br>McDonalds or local competitors. And <br>there was advertisment that they will <br>open more stores. Ownership was limited <br>to Filipinos in summer 1995 but this was <br>subject to change. In a local newspaper <br>I learned that their number of stores <br>and earnings were growing since start of <br>the company around 15 years ago, but <br>they have some problems abroad in Asia <br>where they serve Filipio <br>foreign-workers. I bought some shares <br>for my wife and the qoutation more than <br>doubled since 1995. Now I read on the <br>Internet-page of the Bank of the <br>Philippine Islands that the earnings <br>grow only half as fast than the <br>revenues. You have more informations <br>and/or and opinion on Jollibee?<br>I don`t know whether my questions become <br>elected for answer and in that case I <br>would need an email answer, because I <br>don`t have the printed edition of Worth.<br>At the end I want to tell you that such <br>a service does not exist in Germany!<br>It would be a pleasure for me to receive <br>an answer!<p>Sincerly<br>Joachim Winklmeier

I bought duramed pharmaceuticals at 15 <br>over a year ago. I recently sold it at 7 <br>to take some capital losses before Dec <br>31.  Should I buy it back next month if <br>it stays below 10?  Where do you think <br>this stock will go if they get FDA <br>approval for their "new drug"? Thanks.

What impact do you think the Media etc.. has on individual investments like  stocks, bonds mutual funds and others. It seems that like IPO's after the excitement is over the price comes back to reality.

Would You comment on a company without <br>history except 3 Q earnings (getting <br>better every  altough not spectacular ) <br>plunges from intro of $15 to 11$ and <br>then gradually goes down,like a B 24  <br>losing two engines in sight of the <br>English Coast,  to barely $6.<br>Their fundamentals are good ,the future <br>looks bright.The company is Xeikon, <br>leader in electronic press systems.The <br>market looks good too.<br> <br>

I have substantial capital gain <br>liability in several stocks. If I give <br>up to $10,000 worth of stock to my son <br>to fund his college tuition will he be <br>required to pay capital gains tax? As a <br>follow up question, can I give him more <br>and only pay the gift tax?

I can see and understand your <br>reasons.<p>I had 28 stocks.

Since Intergraph(INGR) has been losing major revenues for at least 2 years(thats as far back as I read quarterly earnings reports), are PUTS still a good deal.  And if so, since the earnings are negative how do I buy stock based on the EPS that is negative ?

Mr. Lynch,<p>I have a small but expanding portfolio of diversified growth stocks.  I am intersted in adding some warrants to my portfolio for greater leverage.  Do you recommend small investors to invest in warrants?  If so, where can I find information about warrants that are currently traded?

Dear Mr. Lynch<p>   I am 18 years old and <br>studying to be a broker. My <br>mother just gave me $1,000 <br>to invest in the market, <br>just so I can get the <br>practice and learn a thing <br>or two. I'm a little <br>worried because I have no <br>idea what stocks to pick, <br>how many I should buy, and <br>how long i should hold on <br>to them. If you can help me <br>out in any way, I'll be <br>very grateful. Thank you <br>for time.<p>           Sincerely,<br>           Leon Querubin<br>

Dear Mr.Lynch,<p>I currently have about 13k invested in<br>four Fidelity growth funds(vaule,eq2,<br>large cap,growth).I have had these funds<br>for almost two years. I have about 2k<br>more to invest.I am twenty six years <br>old.I have always been nervous about <br>individual stock picking. I feel more <br>comfortable with mutual funds.<br>What should I do?<br>Move my funds around, be more <br>diversified with them. What should I do <br>with the 2k I have to invest?<p>                     Thank you,<br>                     <br>                      Mike S.

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:lavalleec@bv.com">Christian Lavallee</a> on December 24, 1996 at 12:01:54:<p>
Happy holidays. I have attempted to <br>contact mutual banks in my home state of <br>PA from the list provided in the 10/95 <br>Worth artcle, pages 90 and 91. Some of <br>these institutions are resisting my <br>requests for information to open a <br>savings account. They state that they <br>only serve their local community, or <br>don't do banking by mail. Is this <br>kosher? Whether I have $50 or $5000, am <br>home bound, or live 350 miles away (its <br>a large state) shouldn't matter. I feel <br>singled out for no valid reason. I know <br>the credit unions are having problems, <br>but why should the mutual banks refuse <br>my business? If there's a post or a FAQ <br>I can refer to that would be fine. Thank <br>you for your attention. Christian

I stumble across Au Bon Pain while <br>reading Worth Magazine. After reading <br>your comments, I went to yellow pages at <br>Detroit as well as Indianappolis to <br>fined the Cafe. Need to know more about <br>what markets the company is in. <br>Comments?<p>As for Arterial Vascular Engineering, I <br>do know the stock has been beaten down <br>lately. Internet news for the stock <br>indicated lower earnings due to <br>aquisition related expenses. (Operating <br>expense seems to be intact). Ofcourse I <br>will try to get explanation from other <br>sources including company <br>itself. AVEI is one of the listed stock <br>in graham report on Worth internet. <p>I am trying to assess both of the <br>company for my portfolio and your <br>comments might prove very valuable.<p>

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:jgordon@bellsouth.net">Jay Gordon</a> on December 20, 1996 at 12:45:36:<p>
Peter Lynch,<p>I would like your thoughts regarding <br>adding REITs to one's portfolio.  I'm <br>seriously considering a few such as BRE <br>and Merry Land.  However, I'm not sure <br>if residential or commercial exposure <br>would provide better results.  Also, if <br>the S&P underwent a 15% correction <br>during 1997, how would that translate to <br>REITs?  Thanks in advance for your <br>comments.

Hi Peter,<p>Just wanted to say many thanks for<br>taking the time out of your busy<br>schedule to give an interview to the<br>Wall Street Journal TV show.<p>They were extremely nice and very<br>professional during their day of taping<br>here at St. Agnes.<p>Unfortunately, the show will air on Ch. 2<br>at 5AM on Sunday, Dec. 15, so besides<br>myself, I don't know exactly how many people<br>will get to see it.<p>But...the WALL STREET JOURNAL newspaper<br>article will be out on DECEMBER 12.<p>Again, thanks a lot.  You always seem to<br>be there for us.  Please be assured that<br>the kids and I really appreciate it.<p>Joan<br>

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:JohnTeutsch@seanet.com">John Teutsch</a> on November 27, 1996 at 16:28:50:<p>
I have heard a couple of times now a reference that Peter Lynch made about his years managing Fidelity Magellan. He is reported to have made the comment (somewhere, to someone) (paraphrasing) that "72% of the people who invested in Magellan during the time he was portfolio manager actually lost money" while this may not be surprising, since thousands may have jumped in and jumped out in a short period of time, realizing it wasn't an alternative for their checking account, I would still be interested  if anyone knows where this quote or musing may have appeared in print. Thank you.

  Your article on oil made me think of a piece I had seen on television. There is a man in Reno, NV who claims to have a surfactin that will stretch petroleum products by up to 50%. He calls it "A-21". He is Rudy Gunnerman but I have not been able to find out anything more about him. They claimed that a public bus has been using this mix for over one year.<br>  How would one find out more about this man and his company. After all, channel surfing is a lot like walking in the mall the way you use to do it.<br>  Anyone who has a lead, not just Mr. Lynch, would be appreciated.<br>

<br>I loved Mr Lynch's article (Self Service).<br>I think the timing of this is excellent.<br>But lets not stay in the oil and gas market to long.<br>The inventions that are on the way out in the next<br>year or two are going to shake this world something violent.<br>Yes I know you have heard it all before, well this time you better<br>believe. These new invention such as linear or magnet motors<br>will easily put the oil and gas industry out of business.<p>PAY ATTENTION!

Recently, I read an LA Times article<br>concerning a return to the gold<br>standard.  It pointed out that<br>GOP Vice Presidential Nominee Jack Kemp<br>historically supported a return to<br>Gold linked dollar.  Supposing that<br>such a system were to be reinstated,<br>how might Wall Street react?  Could this<br>be, as its proponents claim, the<br>beginning of prosperity or a tremendous<br>encumberance?  Thank you.<p>Austin Kim

People often say that a stock is <br>overvalued if the PE/EPS Growth <br>Ratio is greater than 1.0, and <br>attribute this guideline for value to <br>Peter Lynch.  If you could please pass <br>this request on to him - I would like to <br>understand why this provides a good <br>guideline to a stock's value.  I can see <br>that the PE ratio measures cost per <br>dollar of EPS.  I understand EPS Growth <br>rate, but I do not understand the <br>significance of the relationship of PE <br>ratio to the growth rate.

I teach investments at <br>Fort Hays State <br>University in Hays, <br>Kansas.  Last semester in <br>the second level course, <br>Investment Theories and <br>Strategies, we studied <br>theories the first half <br>and strategies of famous <br>money managers the second <br>half.  Each student was <br>assigned a different <br>manager.  They were to <br>complete a written and <br>oral report on that <br>manager.  I referred to <br>these reports as the MMR <br>(The Man, the Method, the <br>Results).  I began the <br>oral reports by <br>presenting Benjamin <br>Graham, Philip Fisher, <br>and Warren Buffett.  The <br>managers the students <br>presented were:  Paul <br>Cabot, Philip Carret, <br>Mario Gabelli, Peter <br>Lynch, George Michaelis, <br>John Neff, T. Rowe Price, <br>Julian Robertson, Jim <br>Rogers, William Ruane, <br>George Soros, Michael <br>Steinhardt, John <br>Templeton, John Maynard <br>Keynes, and Robert <br>Wilson.  What do you <br>think of this approach, <br>since I do not believe <br>that many professors are <br>doing this?  Do you have <br>any suggestions for other <br>managers (or analysts) to <br>study?  Thank you.<br>

Dear Mr. Lynch:<p>About four years ago a newsletter I <br>subscribed to (now defunct) advised that<br>you recommended a little known stock<br>by the name of Nature's Sunshine. I did<br>my homework and I liked it too.<p>It turned out pretty well too. Earlier<br>this year it had gotten as far as a five<br>"bagger". Recently, the stock has fallen<br>to about the 22 range, from an <br>earlier high of 30. Last Friday the<br>Chairman resigned and it dropped another<br>couple of points.<p>Do you follow this stock any longer and<br>if so what is your current view?<p>Many thanks,<br>M.Susan<p><br>

I have read your book " one up on wall <br>street" and I have not seen you use <br>technical analysis (TA) at all.  My <br>question is: how useful is technical <br>analysis, what are the ratios/factors to <br>look for? how much TA does one need to <br>do before buying a stock, based on its <br>fundamentals.  Are they any good TA <br>tools available in the market.<p>thx<br>dominic<br>

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:danaloha@aol.com">Daniel Berman</a> on September 11, 1996 at 15:01:29:<p>
Dear Mr. Lynch,<br>			I have great respect for <br>you, because beyond being a <br>star stock-picker, you seem <br>to place a high value on your <br>family and on work for <br>charity.<br>    Other stars, like Michael <br>Price, also talk about their <br>concerns with families. Yet, <br>I hit a brick wall even <br>getting a direct response <br>from fund managers like Price <br>or Tweedy, Browne, re the <br>subject of ethics, and <br>specifically Nestle. To my <br>mind, individuals who would <br>find the actions of companies <br>like Nestle abhorrent and <br>unthinkable, can't be <br>bothered to take a moral <br>stance against a company <br>which does what they would <br>never themselves do.<br>    I can understand an <br>argument for tobacco, namely, <br>come on, anyone who smokes <br>has to know the risks. But <br>Nestle was boycotted <br>worldwide by church <br>organizations for their <br>infant formula sales <br>practices. They dressed up <br>their sales agents in third <br>world countries to look like <br>health professionals, and had <br>them push free samples of <br>infant formula on mothers as <br>being healthier than mother's <br>milk. They give enough free <br>samples to last until the <br>mother's milk dries up. These <br>impoverished families then <br>try diluting the unaffordable <br>Nestle formula with water in <br>order to make there be <br>enough. The United Nations <br>estimates one and a half <br>million third world babies <br>die each year as a result of <br>this infant formula <br>merchandising.<br>    Nestle finally agreed to <br>stop the practice. And they <br>did, until the international <br>boycott group disbanded. Then <br>they started again. I noted <br>in the review of Nestle's <br>CEO's book that he says a <br>corporation's only duty is <br>profit and this supercedes <br>any responsibility to the <br>environment or to the world.<br>     I know it's unstylish in <br>the hip, modern world of <br>investing to be impassioned <br>about morals, nonetheless I <br>passionately implore you to <br>explore and discuss both <br>Nestle and other ethical <br>issues in your column.If you <br>do, I would be delighted to <br>locate documentation re the <br>anti-Nestle case.<br>  Thank you for considering <br>my point of view.<p>Respectfully yours,<br>   Daniel Berman<br>

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:bhutchin@mail.state.wi.us">Brian Hutchinson</a> on September 11, 1996 at 11:51:37:<p>
Dear Peter:<p>Thanks for all your insights printed in <br>Worth. To me, your column alone <br>justifies the subscription price. <br>Especially valuable is the article Mind <br>Your Ps and Es. I have three <br>questions con-cerning this piece:<p>1. The Madison, Wisconsin, Public <br>Library and the University of Wisconsin <br>business library do not carry the P and <br>E charts published by the Securities <br>Research Corporation. How can I get in <br>touch with SRC to see if there is source <br>of the charts in my area?<p>2. What data source does SRC use for the <br>P and E figures? In trying to construct <br>my own charts, I took P and E figures <br>from Valueline. Their E figures match <br>SCRs, but the P figures dont. On my <br>Coca Cola chart, for example, the P is <br>always much higher than the E, even in <br>1985.<p>3. How are the P and E scales <br>determined? On SCRs charts, 1 dollar on <br>the E axis equals 15 dollars on the P <br>axis. Why dont they use a 1 dollar to 1 <br>dollar scale?<p>Any light you can shed on these <br>questions I will greatly appreciate.<p>Brian<br>

Mr. Lynch<p>I am a relatively young (32) data <br>processing manager. My wife and I choose <br>for her to be the 'domestic engineer'. <br>In addition to the 10% I put into 401k <br>Mutual Funds I am a firm believer in <br>DRIPS. I currently have two, a bank and <br>a large pharmaceutical company. I buy <br>10% of my gross take home pay each month <br>for each company. I am planning on this <br>being my children's (ages- 1yr and 2yr) <br>education fund(s). We will be sending <br>our children to parochial schools. Is <br>this plan too short-sighted? Have I <br>introduced too much risk in settling on <br>two companies to participate in their <br>DRIP programs? Any advice you can give <br>would be greatly appreciated. (My wifes <br>brother is a broker!!!)  ---SMF

I read your prediction about "the next <br>oil boom, 95-2." and find that the <br>current situation among furniture <br>companies has the some similarity to the <br>oil companies back then. They pay down <br>debt, buy back stocks and insiders are <br>also buying. The fundamental for these <br>companies is also good. So do you think <br>that we will experience a furniture <br>boom?<p>thanks<p>baiyang

I would like to ask a question in reponse to Worth Online's invitation to ask you <br>questions for future issues:<p>You (and also Warren Buffett), insist that a before you invest in a stock, you <br>must understand the business.  Can you define "understanding" a business?<p>For instance, do you mean understanding how capital is allocated and made,<br>or do you mean understanding the manufacture of the product, or how the<br>service is supplied? What aspects of a business do you need to understand<br>to "understand the business"?<p>In other words, in one of your books, you state that you did not invest in Home<br>Depot because you do not understand tools and housework.  But Home Depot<br>is just a retialing industry; you understand retail, no?  Do I need to know how to<br>manufacture sneakers to invest in a budding retail superstore named "Sneaker<br>Stadium"?<p>I work as a computer programmer.  Do I "understand" the software industry? <br>Or is there more that I need to know?  I am curious about all the aspects of a<br>business that an individual needs to understand to invest in that business.<p>Thank you.

With the recent run-up in <br>stockvalues for companies like <br>Boatman's and Red Roof Inns, I <br>was wondering if there were an <br>resources out there that might <br>point towards takeovers like <br>these and provide the average <br>investor and opportunity to <br>catch the appreciation wave.<br>

Peter Lynch is the main reason I get <br>Worth. With the power of internet,I did <br>not plan to subscribe to any magazines. <br>His column and the style of your <br>magazine will keep me as a subscriber <br>for now. <p>The book Learn to Earn should be <br>REQUIRED reading for every man, woman, <br>and child in the country.<p>Our son started college this year and <br>this book helped him better understand <br>the world of business. He liked the book <br>a lot and this is from someone not into <br>reading a lot of books at the present.<p>Please keep writing.

Dear Mr. Lynch:<p>    I am a great admirer of yours and <br>have read all your books. I am an <br>investor in Brazil, and would like to <br>know your opinion about our market. We <br>faced a sharp decline after the last <br>presidential elections in 1994, and the <br>market seems to be recovering now. The <br>big state-owned companies (mainly those <br>involved in telecommunications) are the <br>blue chips, but there are many fine <br>other ones selling at giveaway prices. <br>How do you feel about stocks in Brazil?<p>                    Yours,<p>                 Michael Roy Smith<br>        <p>Michael Roy Smith<br>Rua Prof. Jose H.M. Teixeira, 290/242<br>Vila Suzana  CEP 05630-130 Sao Paulo - <br>SP  - Brazil

Dear Peter,<p>I've read all your books and articles. My question is in your book, you said that for a constant growth stock, you'd like to see the pe less than the growth rate. Is there a theoritical basis for this. Would you please kindly refer me to any books or articles if this is too deep to be talked about here.<p>Thanks<p>-chenyu

I have read almost all of your <br>investment books, but I haven't come <br>across a chapter or topic specifically <br>devoted to quantitative valuation. <p>How do you avoid buying an excellent <br>stock at a very unprofitable price? Do <br>you use valuation methods that merely <br>compares one fundamental to another, <br>e.g. P/E ratio, EPS growth rate, or do <br>you employ a more absolute method that <br>allows you to derive the specific value <br>of a company, like the discounted cash- <br>flow technique? <p>Kindly tell us what valuation method do <br>you use to pick bargain growth stocks.<p>Thank you.<br>

   I have read all of your books, but<br>must say that I hope this one wil be part of a series.<br>   The style was very easy to read. No subject was drug out and the boy and girl examples were (especially with the cars) pure deja vu.<br>   Please let us know when your next book is coming and what it is about.<br>   Even my daughter reads them, althought she is a better investor then I am, because she gets it from me!<p>

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:jackm@southwind.com">Jack Markowitz</a> on July 31, 1996 at 01:15:58:<p>
In one of your articles you referred to <br>JNJ as the best growth stock of all <br>time. That comment stuck with me, and I <br>am the proud owner of 200 shares (it <br>just split). I have done real well and <br>consider it a real "base" for my <br>portfolio. Do you still think it will <br>continue to be a dynamic growth stock in <br>the next ten years??<br> I have missed not seeing your articles <br>for the last couple of months.<p>Thanks,<br>Jack
