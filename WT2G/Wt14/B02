<H2>TEN THOUSAND COMMANDMENTS<BR>
A Policymaker's Snapshot<BR> of the Federal Regulatory State<BR>
(1996 Edition)</H2>

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>

</CENTER>


<P>While we know rather precisely how much the federal government collects
from us in taxes, the extent of regulatory compliance costs imposed on the
public is quite a different matter.  While a third party estimate pegs costs at $677 billion -- more than the GNP of Canada -- there is no official tracking of regulatory costs.

	
<P>Congress is free to enact legislation it considers beneficial with little regard for the regulatory burdens that will result.  Agencies that impose
implementing regulations are unaccountable to the voting public, creating a
disconnect between lawmaking power and responsibility, fostering "regulation without representation" as a deliberate public policy.  Instead, reforms should ensure that regulatory costs are officially acknowledged, and that Congress is directly accountable for those costs at the ballot box.

<P>Though official estimates do not yet exist, here are a few facts about the regulatory state described in the 1996 edition of "Ten Thousand Commandments": 
<UL><P>
<LI>	Regulation costs more than $1/2 trillion annually.
<P><LI>	Regulatory costs are triple the deficit, and one-third the level of
federal outlays.
<P><LI>	Regulatory costs consume 19 percent of a household’s after-tax budget.
<P><LI>	The Federal Register exceeds 67,000 pages annually.
<P><LI>	Budgets and staffing of federal agencies enforcing regulations are at
record levels.
<P><LI>	There are more than 4,500 new rules in the pipeline.
<P><LI>	Regulators expect to impose new rules costing at least $11.6 billion annually this year.
<P><LI>	Regulatory costs for small firms are nearly double the costs for large firms.
<P><LI>	New rules affecting small business increased seven percent under President Clinton.
<P><LI>	EPA provided benefit estimates for only 30 percent of its planned major rules.
<P><LI>	OMB in 1994 reviewed 135 "economically significant" rules, a 32% increase over 1993.
</UL>
<P>The goal of this report is to make future editions unnecessary by
encouraging Congress to track its own regulatory escapades.  In the short
term, Congress could require that publicly available data, such as that
accumulated in this report, should be consolidated and presented annually as a chapter in the fiscal budget.  Though imprecise, such data will make the extent of the regulatory burden more explicit for policymakers and scholars.

<P>For example, five-year historical tables summarizing total major and minor rules issued by agencies, along with numbers and costs (where available) of those rules would be especially valuable. 

	
<P>Another part of the solution is to make regulatory costs as transparent as taxes through a limited form of regulatory budget, such as one requiring
Congress to estimate, and set a ceiling for, the costs of new mandates at
the time they are passed.  The Office of Management and Budget could certify
that the budget is not exceeded as rules are implemented. 

<P>Finally, Congress, not unaccountable agencies, must bear direct
responsibility for every dollar of regulatory costs imposed on the public.
Ideally, Congress should be required to vote its approval of every major
agency regulation before these are binding on the public, thus ending
"regulation without representation."  Topping these reforms off with a
Regulatory Reduction Commission to reduce the existing $677 billion
regulatory burden would finally create a genuinely accountable regulatory
system.

<H1>Uncle Sam's Commandments</H1>
by Clyde Wayne Crews Jr., August 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>While government activity is generally, and rightly, associated with taxing and spending, there is another way Congress carries out its objectives: by
imposing health, safety, and economic policy regulations.  Taxing and
regulating, in fact, can serve as substitutes:  The government can tax us,
or it can impose mandates on individuals and lower-level governments.  For
example, the government can raise taxes to pay for worker retraining
programs -- or it can mandate that firms provide retraining at private expense.

<P>Unlike taxes, regulations  --  now costing an estimated $677 billion per year  --  are entirely off-budget.  In fact, one of today's under-appreciated
administrative risks is that we will succeed in balancing our fiscal budget, but fail to control the regulatory state.  That failure could lead to the massive increase of off-budget regulatory burdens as an alternative to deficit finance.  The only way to control this dichotomy at the ballot box is to require Congress to vote (in an expedited manner) on major agency
regulations before they are binding on the public.  Until that's done,
off-budget burdens will proliferate.

<P>Even now, though no explicit regulatory cost budget exists, Congress can
begin officially documenting the extent of the yearly regulatory burden that it and agencies impose on the public and publish summaries of such
information in the fiscal budget or the Economic Report of the President.
Currently, third-party researchers do provide estimates that place the
regulatory burden in perspective.  Even if managing a formal regulatory cost budget turns out to be an intractable problem, Congress can cement the case for permanent and aggressive regulatory management merely by doing a better job presenting the information that now exists but is not easily accessible.  

<P>CEI's new study, Ten Thousand Commandments: A Policymaker's Snapshot of the Federal Regulatory State hopes to contribute to such "user-friendliness" by documenting regulatory trends over the past few years.  Presented below are just a couple of the report's elements  --  based on things we know about the scope of the regulatory state from scattered sources  --  that Congress should
consider including in an official yearly report on the regulatory state.
Surely such disclosure ought to be non-controversial.  The number of Federal Register pages  --  today's most widely used metric  --  is a poor gauge of the
extent of the regulatory state, but often is the only one readily available.
  
<P>Regulatory costs rival on-budget government spending:  As the accompanying chart shows, controlling the deficit may be simple compared to wrestling down the regulatory state.  Regulatory costs are now well above
three-quarters of a trillion dollars, dwarfing the $144 billion deficit by
comparison.  Regulatory costs will remain at least one-third the level of
total budgeted government spending for the remainder of the decade.  The
lesson?  Total government interference in the economy must be recognized to
extend far beyond mere federal outlays to embrace regulatory costs as well.
We must officially acknowledge that the federal government now directs over
one-third of the nation's output, not less than one-quarter, as a focus on
outlays would imply.

<P>Regulatory costs absorb about 19 percent of the family's after-tax budget: Firms pass on much of their regulatory costs to consumers, meaning
regulation behaves like a hidden tax.  Regulatory costs take the form of
higher prices for consumer products, grocery, utility, health and housing
bills, and increases in state and local taxes.  

<P>The $677 billion regulatory burden for 1996 breaks down to about $6,830 per household.  Such costs are embedded within the costs of items in the family
budget.  According to the Tax Foundation, the average two-earner couple
brought in $35,541 in 1995 after-tax income.  Regulatory costs make up over
19% of this amount.  In fact, apart from housing costs ($8,324 annually),
regulatory costs are the largest "item" in the family budget, exceeding each of the following: medical, food, transportation, recreation, and clothing costs.
  
<P>Over 4,500 new regulations in the pipeline will impose at least $11.6
billion in new regulatory costs:  The Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations
is a twice-yearly compilation of proposed and final regulatory and
deregulatory actions by about 60 federal departments, agencies, and
commissions, on which action is expected during the coming 12 months.
According to the latest release, 4,570 rules are now at various stages of
completion.  Most are extremely minor rules, having to do with agency
housekeeping or ensuring that certain federal programs run smoothly.  
But many of these rules are costly.  Agencies are required by executive
order to prepare cost-benefit analyses for those rules that are
"economically significant," which means formally that they will cost at
least $100 million per year.  In the April 1996 Agenda, 116 rules are
designated economically significant, meaning new regulatory costs of at
least $11.6 billion will be imposed by these rules.  That figure is a
minimum cost; many rules will surely cost well above $100 million.

<P>Despite the size of the regulatory state, and the certainty of regulatory costs, benefits are far from clear, and are calculated with far less precision.  But if Congress were to consolidate even rudimentary yearly regulatory information, we would stand a better chance of forcing Congress vote on regulations the same way it's required to vote to spend our taxes.

<H2>Unfunded Mandates</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Congress should scale-back existing unfunded mandates and refrain from
enacting more in the future.  Imposing unfunded mandates is a fundamentally
unfair and undemocratic means of enacting environmental policy that
short-circuits accountability and hamstrings the ability to set rational
environmental priorities.<p>
	Congress creates unfunded mandates when it passes laws requiring state and/or
local governments to meet particular goals or enact particular regulatory
programs and then fails to allocate resources to assist in the implementation
of these programs.  Environmental laws are responsible for a substantial
portion of unfunded mandates.  <p>
	Unfunded mandates proliferated dramatically over the past decade.  Prior to
1988, there were only 40 unfunded federal mandates, environmental and
otherwise.  Between 1988 and 1991, that number nearly tripled.  Nearly 12
percent of municipal revenues must now go to meeting  unfunded mandates imposed
by Congress.  In 1995, Congress passed a law to require explicit Congressional
authorization of any new unfunded mandate greater than $50 million.  Efforts to
scale-back existing unfunded mandates have been unsuccessful.  <p>
	Environmental mandates are among the most expensive.  There are unfunded
mandates in the <A HREF="/ebb/cleanair.html">Clean Air Act</A>, <A HREF="/ebb/cleanh2o.html">Clean Water Act</A>, <A HREF="/ebb/sdwa.html">Safe Drinking Water Act</A>, and
many other major environmental laws. County governments expect to spend over
$16.1 billion on environmental mandates between 1994 and 1998. The expense of
unfunded mandates is having a significant impact on many communities.  For
instance:<p>
<UL>
<LI>	Columbus, Ohio, will need to spend $1 billion to comply with only those
environmental mandates imposed as of January 1991.  This will cost Columbus
households an estimated  $856 annually by the year 2000.<p>
<LI>	Hastings, Nebraska, population 22,867, has estimated its mandate compliance
costs at $74.6 million, or $1,865 per household.<p>
<LI>	Lewiston, Maine, is looking at mandate costs of over $80 million.  For a city
population of only 40,000, this amounts to over $2,000 per person.<p>
</UL>
	<P>Unfunded mandates are undemocratic and they destroy accountability.  They
enable politicians to enact policies without voting for the taxes or offsetting
spending cuts to pay for them.  Members of Congress have used unfunded mandates
to demonstrate their support for popular public goals while disguising the
costs of their programs.  Unfunded mandates often mean that higher local
priorities must be pushed aside to meet Washington, D.C.&#146;s dictates.<p>
	Unfunded mandates should come to an end.  A simple &#147;no money, no
mandate&#148; policy would do the trick.  Federal lawmakers must recognize that
not every environmental concern requires a federal program or initiative.
State and local governments are just as concerned with the health and
well-being of their residents, and are more than capable addressing local
environmental concerns.  In many instances, Congress could best foster more
rational environmental policy-making by simply getting out of the way.  The
states were intended to be &#147;laboratories of democracy,&#148; developing
innovative and experimental approaches to vexing public policy concerns.
Imposing unfunded mandates prevents states from playing that vital role, and
can even inhibit the development of forward-looking and effective environmental
policies.<p>
<i>Q:  Why shouldn&#146;t the federal government impose stringent environmental
standards on states and localities?</i><p>
<p>
A:  This question assumes that state and local governments are unable to
determine environmental priorities for their own communities.  State officials
are no less concerned about clean water problems or clean air problems than are
federal officials.  If anything, state and local governments are closer to the
environmental concerns of local communities and better able to develop the
proper remedies.  It is one thing for the federal government to provide
guidance to local communities on environmental matters.  It is another thing
for the federal government to require particular programs, and leave state and
local taxpayers footing the bill.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:   Won&#146;t a &#147;no money, no mandate&#148; policy prevent the
government from providing the environmental protection that Americans
want?</i><p>
<p>
A:  A &#147;no money, no mandate&#148; policy will restore accountability to
environmental policy.  Protecting the environment is important, but so are
health care, education, crime prevention, and the whole range of concerns that
state and local governments are forced to address.  State and local governments
need the flexibility to be able to respond to the needs of their constituents.
Piling on environmental requirements without providing the resources to meet
those requirements destroys that flexibility.  Environmental protection is
necessary, but it always has costs.  Controlling unfunded mandates ensures that
when environmental policies are enacted, it is clear how they will be paid
for.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Didn&#146;t Congress enact a law to control unfunded mandates in the
104<sup>th</sup> Congress?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  The new unfunded mandates law only requires Congress to explicitly
authorize any <i>new</i> unfunded mandate of $50 million or more with a
separate procedural vote.  This law is intended to prevent unfunded mandates
from being hidden in larger bills before Congress.  This law in no way prevents
Congress from enacting new unfunded mandates, it merely requires a separate
vote.  Moreover, this law does nothing to eliminate or reduce those unfunded
mandates that are already in place.  The Executive Order signed by President
Bill Clinton in 1993 is similarly ineffectual.

<P>
<BR>Environmental activists are increasing the heat on policy makers worldwide
to do something about global warming before it is too late.  They charge
that human activity is already warming the planet  --  yet the climate is not
cooperating.  Thus far, 1996 has been a cool year.  Much of the East coast
experienced record snowfalls this winter, and May was the sixth consecutive
month of temperatures below seasonal norms, according to global satellite
measurements.
<P>     Only several months ago the British Meteorological Office reported that
1995 was the hottest year on record, edging out 1990 by a bare 0.07 degrees
F.  Environmental activists proclaimed the announcement as further evidence
that human-induced global warming had arrived.
<P>     Yet all was not right with the data.  The designation of 1995 as the
"warmest year on record" was based on incomplete measurements.  As readings
for only the first 11 months of the year were available, the British
scientists estimated December temperatures.  The excluded data revealed a
record, end-of-year nose dive throughout the Northern Hemisphere.  The
complete data set for 1995 gathered from satellite readings revealed a
thoroughly average year  --  only the eighth warmest since the satellites began
taking climate measurements.
<P>     Most global warming predictions are based on general circulation models
(GCMs), immensely complex computer simulations.  Environmentalists tend to
put a lot of faith in the predictive capacity of the computers. Others
suggest that the model projections are hooey.  Dr. Richard Lindzen at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology compares model output to predictions
from a ouija board, and with some cause.  According to the models, the earth
should be significantly warmer than it is.
<P>     Climate computer programmers have had a difficult time including all of the
myriad variables that affect the climate, such as clouds and precipitation.
One problem of existing models, for instance, is that they are unable to
replicate weather fronts.  Recent scientific evidence suggests that models
do not sufficiently account for the impact of the sun either.  Several
recent studies have suggested a possible correlation between temperature
trends and solar cycles.  As Science magazine reported, "the sun could have
been responsible for as much as half of the warming of the past century. If
so, the role of greenhouse gases... would dwindle  --  as would estimates of
how much they will warm climate in the future as they continue to build up."
<P>     As the computer models have become more accurate, their predictions have
become less severe.  For instance, the latest models have sought to
incorporate the potential cooling effect of industrial emissions.  The
result is the lowest projected temperature change generated by a computer
model to date.  The model upon which the most recent UN Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change report is based predicts a warming of 0.8 to 3.5
degrees C by the year 2100.  This is significantly less warming than has
been predicted in the past.  Indeed, the lower-bound warming estimate is
approximately half that predicted just four years ago.
<P>     It is certainly possible that human activity will contribute to a warming
of the planet.  Yet this fact, in an of itself, is no cause for alarm. How
warming would occur is immensely important.  Scorching summers, produced by
an increase in daytime highs, would have far different effects on human and
other life than a wintertime warming that occurs mostly at night.  Where the
warming is concentrated is also a real concern, as is what effect warming
has upon precipitation.  Whether environmentalists choose to accept it or
not, there are many indications that a warmer world would be far more benign
than previously imagined.  Some research even suggests that a moderately
warmer climate would be a far better one for humanity. 
<P>     The real question facing the world's people is not "is warming real?" but
"what, if anything, should be done about it?"  Future events will always be
indeterminate, and given the magnitude of human activity, this means there
will be uncertainty about the impacts of civilization. Natural disasters
will strike randomly whether modern industrial society warms the earth or
not.  Even the most sophisticated computers will be forever unable to
forecast future events with anything approaching certitude.   What then is
the proper policy response to uncertainty?
  <P>   By all estimates, only incredibly severe reductions in global carbon
dioxide emissions  --  on the order of 60 percent or more  --  will alter the
computer forecasts.  The resulting economic dislocations would be
tremendous, potentially outweighing the negative impacts of even the most
apocalyptic warming scenario.  Global warming may pose uncertain risks, but
the risks of global warming policies is clear.
<P>     The arguments for dramatic greenhouse gas reductions are all variants of
the precautionary principle, essentially that it is better to be safe than
be sorry.  If only it were that simple.  It is true that economic growth and
technological advance pose environmental risks. But stagnation is hardly a
safer course. In the words of the late Aaron Wildavsky: "the results of
doing too much can be as disastrous as doing too little."

for altering a scientific report.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) made headlines with its claim that "the balance of evidence
suggests a discernible human influence on global climate."  Now there is
evidence suggesting that this assessment was driven by politics, and not
science.
<P>     The IPCC's 1995 report, the final version of which was published in June,
is supposed to represent the consensus of world scientific experts regarding
the highly controversial issue of global warming.  The panel's work is
relied upon by Global Climate Convention negotiators who are considering
possible curbs on the use of fossil fuels, such as energy taxes. The IPCC's
reputation for objectivity rests upon its commitment to balanced scientific
opinion arrived at through the process of peer review.  
<P>     Potential misconduct at the IPCC was recently uncovered by the Global
Climate Coalition, an association of oil, coal, and utility companies.  In a
memorandum to Congress and the White House, the business coalition alerted
U.S. officials that the IPCC's final published report had been altered
before final publication.  Substantial portions of Chapter 8, which
discusses the impact of human activities on the earth's climate, had been
re-written by one of its authors after contributing scientists had already
given their approval.  Cautionary references to scientific uncertainty were
removed or modified, changes not approved by the reviewers.  [Excerpts are
printed nearby.]  Writing in the Wall Street Journal, former president of
the National Academy of Sciences Frederick Seitz called the last-minute
editing a "disturbing corruption of the peer review process" which could
"deceive policymakers and the public into believing that the scientific
evidence shows human activities are causing global warming."
<P>     Seitz's remarks set off tremors throughout the scientific community.
Several articles about the controversy appeared in the New York Times and
Energy Daily, as well as the prestigious journals Science and Nature.   The
IPCC's Sir John Houghton labeled the charges "appalling," and maintained
that the re-write "improved the science."  Lead author Ben Santer, an
atmospheric scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab, denied
wrongdoing and claimed that IPCC rules allow modifications "to improve the
report's scientific clarity."  However, the deletions were more than minor
clarifications.  Key portions accepted by contributing scientists were later
removed or altered without their knowledge.  The changes functioned to
suppress doubts and to downplay uncertainties about forecasting a human
influence on climate.  For example, Santer told Science that in a discussion
of when scientists will be able attribute climate change to human causes, he
removed the phrase "we do not know" because it overstated doubts that human
activity can be blamed. 
   <P>  The IPCC's explanations bolster the impression that the revisions were
politically motivated.  Santer cites a November State Department memo to the
IPCC advising "that chapter authors modify the text in an appropriate
manner."  According to an editorial in Nature, IPCC officials said that
revisions to the text were needed "to ensure that it conformed to a
'policymakers' summary of the full report," a document whose language is
voted on by government delegates.  Thus the process is heavily influenced by
government officials, including non-scientists. 
<P>     The IPCC had a rather different response to earlier efforts to modify its
report.   During peer review, Britain's Global Commons Institute (GCI) took
issue with a finding in Chapter 6 that the costs of reducing greenhouse gas
emissions may exceed the predicted economic damage from global warming.
Demanding that the damage be calculated in a way which showed that richer
countries owe "compensation" to the Third World, GCI orchestrated an effort
by delegates from Cuba and the Alliance of Small Island States to rewrite
the report, replacing all damage estimates with warnings about "the loss of
unique cultures."  In response, senior IPCC official James Bruce insisted
that the proper time to make revisions under IPCC rules was during two prior
rounds of peer review: "At this stage [the October 1995 Montreal working
group], the authors can make a few editorial changes for clarity of reading,
but not changes to the meaning or substance of the report" (Emphasis added). 
 <P>    Perhaps IPCC officials should consult one another regarding their
contrasting interpretations of IPCC procedures.  Both environmentalist
groups, like GCI and Greenpeace, and industry groups like the Global Climate
Coalition, are having great difficulty understanding how the IPCC conducts
itself with regard to peer review.  What is clear, however, is that the UN
panel is so thoroughly politicized that its integrity and objectivity cannot
be taken for granted.

<H2>Global Climate Change</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>There is no compelling reason for the United States to take drastic actions to
reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other &#147;greenhouse gases.&#148;
There is little evidence that human activity is having more than a marginal
impact on the Earth&#146;s climate and even less that moderate climate shifts
will be disastrous for either human civilization or the environment.<p>
	There is widespread disagreement within the scientific community on both the
nature of global climate change, and the impact it would have on the human
environment.  Recent polls by the Gallup organization and the environmentalist
group Greenpeace demonstrate that there is no scientific consensus to support
the proposition that human activity will produce an apocalyptic warming of the
Earth&#146;s atmosphere.  The primary basis for predictions of human-induced
global warming is a series of complex computer models that have difficulty
predicting present conditions, let alone future possibilities.  As these models
are refined and become more accurate, the direness of their predictions
recedes.  Recent research has also attributed a significant portion of this
century&#146;s warming to solar cycles, rather than human acitvity.<p>
	Moreover, the earth&#146;s climate is in constant flux, and human-induced
changes cannot be presumed necessarily bad.  A warming that occurs
predominately at higher latitudes and at night, as some suggest is the most
probable scenario, would hardly make for an environmental disaster.  Indeed,
some scientists even suggest that it might be, on net, beneficial.  Growing
seasons would be lengthened, and most people would experience a more benign
climate.  Furthermore, there is substantial evidence that increased levels of
atmospheric carbon dioxide would spur terrific advances in plant growth and
agricultural productivity.  In addition, warming is unlikely to produce more
severe storms as some have predicted.  In other words, the likeliest global
climate change is the creation of a milder, greener, more prosperous world.<p>
	Global climate science is fraught with uncertainty.  There is no clear
evidence that human activity will drive temperatures significantly upward, and
none that human-induced changes will have, on balance, a negative impact.  As
the late Roger Revelle, vice President Al Gore&#146;s mentor on global climate
change, wrote shortly before his death, &#147;<i>the scientific evidence for
greenhouse warming is too uncertain to justify drastic action at this
time</i>&#148; (emphasis in original).  Only severe reductions in energy use
could conceivably reduce the warming predicted by computer models.<p>
	Enacting wide-scale policies to forcibly reduce emissions of carbon dioxide
(CO2) and other greenhouse gases would impose tremendous costs on the American
people.  Policies to increase the price of energy would have a regressive
impact and stifle economic productivity.  Emission reduction mandates will cost
tens of billions of dollars and produce no certain benefits.  Looking carefully
at the issue, it seems that the risks of global warming are outweighed by the
risks of global warming policy.<p>
	The United States should not embark on a series of costly and ill-conceived
policies seeking to avert an unlikely catastrophe.  Prudence requires that the
U.S. enact only those policies to address global climate change which are
valuable in their own right &#151; such as eliminating subsidies that promote
the excessive use of fossil fuels and encouraging increased efficiency in
energy production through the introduction of competition in the electric
utility industry.  Steps beyond these simply cannot be justified given current
knowledge of potential climate change.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  The Earth&#146;s average temperature has risen in the past 100 years as
emissions of greenhouse gases have increased.  Isn&#146;t this evidence of
global warming?</i><p>
<p>
A:  The Earth has gotten warmer in this century.  But most of the warming
occurred in the first half of this century, prior to World War II.  This was
before the dramatic increase in greenhouse gases occurred.  The increase in
greenhouse gases has occurred primarily in the past few decades.  Moreover,
solar cycles have been implicated in this century&#146;s temperature trends.
Thus, most of the warming in the past 100 years is more likely the result of
natural climate fluctuations than of human activity.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Whether the Earth will warm and how warm it will get are still a matter
of speculation, but a human-induced global warming is a real possibility.
Should not we take precautionary measures, just in case?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Precautionary measures are sometimes a prudent course of action.  Yet, the
simple fact is that coerced reductions in energy use will not come without
costs, both in terms of economic growth and in terms of social dislocation.  As
Dr. Richard Stroup of Montana State University points out, &#147;If
&#145;insurance&#146; against a particular risk, such as the threat of global
warming, is bought at the cost of reduced economic growth, then a decline in
the automatic insurance represented by wealth, and the social resilience it
provides, is one of the costs borne by future generations.&#148;  In other
words, inexpensive precautionary measures &#151; such as those that can be
justified in their own right &#151; may make sense.  Expensive precautionary
measures, on the other hand, may cause more harm than they prevent.<p>
	People do not emit greenhouse gas emissions out of caprice.  These emissions
are the byproducts of a wide range of activities that benefit everybody, from
the production of goods and services, the transportation of food and medicines,
and the generation of wealth throughout society.  Dramatically reducing
greenhouse gas emissions would mean giving all of this up for uncertain
benefits.  That is not a prudent policy.

<H2>Chapter 3: Global Warming: Messy Models, Decent Data, and Pointless Policy</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>

<P>
The earth&#146;s atmosphere has actually cooled by 0.13 degrees Celsius since
1979 according to highly accurate satellite-based atmospheric temperature
measurements.  By contrast, computer climate models predicted that the globe
should have warmed by an easily detectable 0.4 C over the last fifteen years.<p>
<p>
The scientific evidence argues against the existence of a greenhouse crisis,
against the notion that realistic policies could achieve any meaningful
climatic impact, and against the claim that we must act now if we are to reduce
the greenhouse threat.<p>
<p>
Current computer climate models are incapable of coupling the oceans and
atmosphere; misrepresent the role of sea ice, snow caps, localized storms, and
biological systems; and fail to account accurately for the effects of clouds.<p>
<p>
Temperature records reveal that predictive models are off by a factor of two
when applied retroactively in projecting the change in global temperature for
this century.<p>
<p>
The amount of warming from 1881 to 1993 is 0.54 C. Nearly 70 percent of the
warming of the entire time period - 0.37 C -occurred in the first half of the
record - before the period of the greatest buildup of greenhouse gases.<p>
<p>
Accuracy in land-based measurements of global temperatures is frustrated by the
death of stations, frequent station relocations, and changes in how oceangoing
ships make measurements.<p>
<p>
Although all of the greenhouse computer models predict that the greatest
warming will occur in the Arctic region of the Northern Hemisphere, temperature
records indicate that the Arctic has actually cooled by 0.88 C over the past
fifty years.<p>
<p>
Corrective environmental policies would have a minuscule impact on the climate.
According to its own projections, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change&#146;s own plan would spare the earth only a few hundredths of a degree
of warming by middle of the next century. <p>

<H2>THE HIGH COST OF COOL<BR>
The Economic Impact of the CFC Phaseout</H2>

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are an important class of compounds.  They have an
impact on the life of nearly every American.   Yet, as a result of
environmental fears, their production will soon be eliminated - by the year
1996.  In making this decision, little consideration was given to the costs of
eliminating such a widely used class of compounds over a relatively short
period of time.<p>
<p>
	This study examines the probable economic cost of the CFC phaseout on the
refrigeration and air conditioning sector in the United States.  The estimated
cost of the CFC phaseout is $44.5 to $99.4 billion over the next decade.  This
estimate breaks down as follows (figures in billions):<p>

<UL>

	<LI>   Vehicle air conditioners           &#151; $28.0 - $42.0<p>
	<LI>    Energy consumption               &#151; $     0 - $32.1<p>
  	<LI> Domestic refrigeration             &#151; $  4.0 - $ 8.0<p>
	<LI>   Commercial refrigeration         &#151; $  3.0 - $ 5.4<p>
	<LI>   Chillers                                    &#151; $  4.4 - $ 5.0<p>
	<LI>   HCFCs &amp; HCFC Equipment    &#151; $  5.1 - $ 6.9<p>

</UL>
Compliance with the law will impose large up-front costs on businesses and
individuals.  Much equipment will need to be replaced or modified
(retrofitted).<p>
<p>
	After decades of fine-tuning and extensive field experience, air conditioning
and refrigeration equipment using CFCs has become very reliable.  In contrast,
most CFC replacements are new, and manufacturers are still near the bottom of
the learning curve in making the massive technological changes necessary.<p>
<p>
	Because of the accelerated phase-out, which provides a limited time frame in
which to end dependence on CFCs, non-CFC systems are being rushed into use,
despite many unsolved problems.  In effect, a multi-billion dollar field test
of experimental equipment is being conducted at consumer expense.  The
frequency of break downs, and the costs of repairs can be expected to increase
for many applications.  <p>
<p>
	The CFC phaseout may well be the single most expensive environmental measure
taken to date.  During the policy debate, the costs were underemphasized to the
point that they never became an important factor.  The impact on consumers was
scarcely considered.  It may be too late to reverse course on the CFC phaseout,
but it can serve as a lesson for the future.

<H2>Ozone Depletion</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Scientific evidence suggests that certain manmade chemicals may deplete the
stratospheric ozone layer.  Due to these concerns, the United States banned the
production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).  This phaseout will be tremendously
expensive, costing as much as $100 billion by the year 2004 in the United
States alone.  Under international agreements and U.S. law, several other
putative ozone-depleting chemicals are scheduled to be banned in the future.
Increasing the cost of the existing phaseout is not justified.<p>
	Scientists believe that CFCs find their way into the upper atmosphere and
cause a thinning of the Earth&#146;s ozone layer.  This layer acts as a shield
that filters ultraviolet light from the sun.  While ozone depletion is a
legitimate environmental concern, scientific evidence suggests that it is not
the environmental catastrophe that was once feared.  The worst-case scenario
for ozone depletion projected only a modest increase in solar radiation in
North America.  Because solar radiation increases as one moves closer to the
equator, the projected increase would be no more than moving 100 miles South
&#151; such as from Washington D.C. to Richmond, VA.  Many of the harms that
environmentalists claimed ozone depletion would cause, including skin cancer
and cataract epidemics, crop damage and increased incidence of animal
blindness, have been disproven or qualified.<p>
	As of January 1, 1996, it is illegal to produce CFCs (also known as Freon).
CFCs are used in many existing air-conditioning and refrigeration systems
nationwide, as well as in other specialty products.  The abrupt phaseout has
added several billion dollars annually to the costs of keeping this equipment
operational and imposed undo hardship on car owners nationwide.  In fact, the
extremely rapid nature of the CFC phaseout in the United States needlessly
elevated the costs of eliminating CFCs.  As a result, a black market in
illegally produced CFCs has blossomed in the past few years, particularly
because not all countries are eliminating the use of CFCs as quickly as is the
U.S.<p>
	In parts of the Third World, the phaseout of CFCs may be particularly severe.
The reduced availability of refrigeration for food and medical supplies is a
far greater health concern than ozone depletion in many countries.  Yet such
concerns received minimal consideration when the phaseout was enacted.<p>
	Due to the international phaseout of CFCs, any valid environmental concerns
about ozone depletion have been adequately addressed. However, additional, yet
unnecessary, measures have been implemented or proposed by environmental groups
and government officials.  <p>
	Methyl bromide, an important crop fumigant, is scheduled to be phased out by
the year 2001, despite weak evidence linking it to ozone depletion. The cost to
farmers of eliminating methyl bromide is estimated to be as much as $1.5
billion dollars per year.  Florida and California will be especially hard hit.
<p>
	Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), a class of refrigerants used in home
air-conditioning and as a substitute for CFCs in some applications, are also
under attack.   Federal law currently allows production of HCFCs at least until
2010.  However, some wish to accelerate this deadline.<p>
	The costs of such additional measures would outweigh any purported
environmental benefits. There is no reason for additional national or
international measures to address concerns about ozone depletion at this
time.<p>
<i>Q:  If CFCs, methyl bromide, and other compounds are also being phased out
under an international treaty,  why is the U.S. in a different position than
other countries?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  There is an international treaty, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that
Deplete the Ozone Layer, that requires the phaseout of CFC production in the
U.S. and other developed countries by January 1, 1996.  However, developing
nations have been given a ten year extension beyond this deadline, and many
developed countries are not in full compliance.  In addition, the Environmental
Protection Agency has imposed regulations on the handling of CFCs that have no
international counterparts.  <p>
	The situation with methyl bromide is similar.  American production is
scheduled to cease in 2001, while other developed nations can continue
producing methyl bromide until 2010.  Methyl bromide will not be phased out in
developing countries.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Isn&#146;t the phaseout of ozone depleting compounds necessary to avert
an environmental crisis?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  Although there is scientific evidence that CFCs and other compounds affect
the ozone layer, the problem is far from a crisis.  Actual ground-level
ultraviolet radiation measurements do not show a long-term increase.  Moreover,
virtually everything the public has been told about the terrifying consequences
of ozone depletion (skin cancer epidemics, animals being struck blind by the
sun, collapse of the ocean food chain, and so forth) has been overstated, if
not completely false.  Ozone depletion, while a legitimate concern, is not an
environmental crisis.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Aren&#146;t there substitutes for the banned chemicals that make the
phaseout nearly cost free?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  Although there are CFC substitutes, they cost considerably more and in some
cases do not work as well.  In addition, many people are stuck with equipment
specifically designed to use CFCs, such as the owners of air-conditioned cars
and trucks built before 1994, and small businessmen such as restaurant and
convenience store owners.  For these people, the costs of operating and
repairing their equipment has increased substantially.  Overall, the phaseout
will almost certainly cost tens of billions of dollars, and could reach $100
billion.

<H1>REINVENTING SUPERFUND<BR>
The Clinton Reform Proposal<BR> and an Alternative
</H1>
by Kent Jeffreys

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<BR>


<P>Superfund has been universally criticized as an expensive, largely ineffective
environmental cleanup program.  Even if it worked as intended, it would provide
insignificant benefits to human health and the environment.  As currently
administered, it is fair to say that the program causes more fiscal harm than
environmental good. <p>
<p>
The original Superfund was to be a five year $1.6 billion program intent on
cleaning up at least 400 sites.  Cleanup at Superfund sites has proceeded at a
snail-like pace and the cost of cleanup is enormous.<p>
<UL>
<LI> Fewer than 20% of Superfund sites have been cleaned to date.<p>
<LI> Fewer than 20 sites were cleaned during the first seven years of the
program.<p>
<LI>As of March 1994, construction and cleanup had yet to begin at almost half of the now 1,232 sites.<p>
<LI>
The average cost of a Superfund cleanup now exceeds $25 million per site. <p>
</UL>

To justify the high cost, Superfund was touted as a &#147;polluter pays&#148;
policy.  However, under Superfund, polluter and non-polluter alike
<b>overpay</b>.  Past or present owners or operators of a site, the producers
of potentially hazardous chemicals, and even the transporters of the waste are
potentially responsible under Superfund.  Superfund liability is retroactive,
and liability does not necessarily end if a site is removed from the Superfund
National Priority List.<p>
<p>
Although the administration addresses several of these concerns, it fails to
deal successfully with the force that is driving Superfund cleanup costs:  the
absurd risk assumptions.  By assuming that extremely unlikely&#151;sometimes
physically impossible&#151;events will occur in the future, EPA is able to
create the impression of risk where no actual harm will occur. <p>
<p>
EPA will generally take cleanup action if the estimated risk of developing
cancer from exposure to the site&#146;s contaminants is greater than one in
10,000.  Viewed in the light of the normal rate of total cancer incidence for
American&#151;approximately one in four&#151;expending tremendous resources to
reduce cancer risks by less than one-hundredth of one percent seems absurd.<p>
<p>
Many community leaders would prefer to divert resources away from Superfund
activities toward more pressing priorities&#151;programs that will prevent
real, as opposed to hypothetical, premature deaths.  As presently written,
Superfund does not permit communities to make the choice.<p>
<p>
The administration&#146;s proposal utilizes an administrative back door to
approach the &#147;environmental justice&#148; issue.  After more than a decade
of trying, EPA has failed to establish any reasonable correlation between
Superfund site pollution and specific diseases in surrounding communities.  The
fact is that if the federal gevernment truly desired to help people in poorer
communities, it would abandon the pretense and stop wasting money on the
cleanup projects.  There is ample evidence that most poor communities have far
more pressing public health concerns than Superfund remediation.<p>
<p>
Superfund imposes federal control on what are essentially state and local
problems.  Instead of making further attempts to salvage a failed federal
program, Superfund should be turned over to the states as much as possible.
Remodeling Superfund as a revolving state loan fund would be a dramatic
improvement over the status quo.  This would place authority for cleanup
decisions closer to the communities directly impacted by the outcomes, and
would sunset the existing Superfund tax structure.<p>
<p>
Under a revolving loan program, the monies must be paid back to the federal
government over time.  This would result in:<p>
<UL>
<LI>  stronger incentives to avoid waste and inefficiency,<p>
<LI>  development of more accurate user fees and charges,<p>
<LI>  selection of less costly cleanup alternatives,<p>
<LI>  greater flexibility in the system,<p>
<LI>  more community control in establishing local environmental priorities.<p>
</UL>
Superfund is creating health risks where none existed before.  Cleanup of a
site often creates a risk of construction accidents or exposures to unearthed
materials that are larger than preexisting risks from the sites under
remediation.  Moreover the unnecessary stress inflicted on nearby residents can
actually be significant.  <p>
<p>
A greater, hidden cost of Superfund is that it is economic dead weight.
Lowering the income of individuals can be harmful to their health.  Superfund
is almost certainly an example of a government program that &#147;kills&#148;
more people than it &#147;saves.&#148; Superfund activities create widespread
anxiety about potential health risks and divert attention away from far more
real threats to human health and the environment.<p>
<p>
Superfund is driven by fear.  By granting local communities more autonomy and
responsibility over Superfund sites, better results will be produced.  It is
time to reinvent Superfund. <p>

<H2>Superfund</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>The federal Superfund program to cleanup hazardous waste sites is an utter
failure.  &#147;It is hard to think of a government program with a wider gulf
between ambitions and results,&#148; according to the <i>New York Times</i>.
The existing program should either be radically reformed or repealed.<p>
	Created by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act of 1980, Superfund has cleaned up less than 20 percent of the
more than 1,200 hazardous waste sites in the program.  Those sites that are
cleaned, are cleaned at an average cost of over $25 million per site, with a
large percentage of these costs going to pay lawyers and file paperwork.
Originally touted as a &#147;polluter pays&#148; policy, under Superfund,
polluter and non-polluter alike overpay.<p>
	One of the greatest problems with Superfund is that millions of dollars are
spent on cleanups which produce no environmental or public health benefits.
Current Superfund risk assessments greatly overstate potential risks to human
health.  Less stringent cleanup standards could achieve the same real-world
risk reduction at lower cost.  At some sites, containment of wastes is
preferable to attempting a costly cleanup.  Moreover, many communities with
Superfund sites would benefit more from the diversion of resources away from
Superfund toward more pressing and directly beneficial expenditures.<p>
	Another problem is the liability standards that Superfund has created.  Under
Superfund, liability for the costs of cleanup is strict, retroactive, and
joint-and-several.  This means that even those who had a tangential
relationship to a Superfund site can be held completely liable for the costs of
cleanup.  For example, private waste hauling firms and previous owners of
materials that end up at a Superfund site have been held liable for
multi-million dollar cleanup bills at Superfund sites.  This liability scheme
has created a blight of abandoned industrial sites, many of which are located
in poor communities that desperately need economic development.<p>
	Tinkering with Superfund and reallocating costs at the margins will not rescue
this failed program.  At a bare minimum, real Superfund reform must include the
following elements:<p>
<UL>
<LI>	The elimination of retroactive liability for those activities that have not
directly harmed people or their property, and the elimination of all liability
for parties not <i>directly</i> responsible for the creation or maintenance of
sites;<p>
<LI>	The elimination of all Superfund taxes, including those on chemicals,
petroleum products and corporations;<p>
<LI>	Greater local control over the cleanup process, including the determination
of cleanup standards and greater local responsibility for the allocation of
cleanup resources;<p>
<LI>	The ability of communities and site owners to opt out of the Superfund
process.<p>
<LI>	The privatization of orphan and federally-owned Superfund sites.<p>
</UL>
	One possibility for Superfund reform is the creation of a revolving state loan
fund to assist local communities with the costs of cleaning up abandoned sites
and the phasing out of federal involvement in non-federal waste site cleanup.
This would increase local authority over and responsibility for the clean up of
waste sites and encourage a more rational determination of clean up priorities.
In the long run, the federal role in Superfund should be eliminated
altogether.<p>
<i>Q:  Should there be a uniform, national cleanup standard for all Superfund
sites? Or should the required level of cleanup be flexible?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Each site is unique, and that is not accounted for in the current Superfund
program.  Instead, the federal government has imposed a one-size fits nobody
approach.  A site that is going to house a school or family homes has different
requirements than a site where industrial development, such as a factory or
waste processing plant, will occur.  This should be a factor in the
determination of cleanup standards.<p>
	This question &#151; &#147;How clean is clean?&#148; &#151; is one of the
central issues in Superfund reform. Equally important should be the question of
who makes that determination: Landowners and affected communities or the
federal government.  Fairness and accountability suggest that landowners and
local communities, which have more at stake, should control this decisionmaking
process. <p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Q:  Sites that are placed on the Superfund cleanup list are contaminated
with hazardous wastes. Don&#146;t health concerns justify mandating that all
Superfund sites be cleaned to the highest possible standards.</i><p>
<p>
A:  Although Superfund sites typically contain wastes that are defined as
hazardous, most public health experts do not believe that Superfund sites pose
a significant health risk, particularly when such sites are fenced off or
isolated.  At sites where health risks are present, it is often possible to
mitigate the risks at far less expense.  For example, it is often possible to
contain contaminated portions of a site for far less money than would be
required to make the soil clean enough to eat.  The last ten percent of cleanup
is often as expensive as the first ninety percent; yet the last stages of
cleanup add minimal risk protection.  Superfund regulations should not be based
on the assumption that cleanup to pristine standards is the proper policy for
every site.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Does the Clinton Administration Superfund proposal adequately address
the needs of local communities?</i><p>
<p>
A:  The Clinton proposal devotes considerable space to the inclusion of local
communities in the Superfund decisionmaking process.  However, the Clinton
proposal stops far short of what is necessary.  Rather than simply including
community representatives in the federal decisionmaking process, the process
itself should be decentralized as much as possible.  This would truly give
local communities the authority and responsibility that they need to adequately
address Superfund concerns.

<H1>THE ANTI-REDLINING AGENDA:<BR>
An Assault on Risk-Based Insurance
</H1>
by Catherine England


<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>The House of Representatives is considering two competing bills aimed at
addressing recent charges of insurance industry redlining (the refusal to sell
insurance in certain communities).  The primary sponsors of the two pieces of
legislation, Rep. Cardiss Collins (D-IL) and Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-MA), have
both fashioned data collection programs.  Rep. Kennedy&#146;s Insurance
Consumer Protection Act, compared to Rep. Collins&#146; Anti-Redlining in
Insurance Disclosure Act (HR 1188), is a much more ambitious and costly effort,
in terms of the number of cities sampled, the questions asked, and the time
period involved.<p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, the millions of dollars that policyholders and taxpayers would
lay out under either proposal would not buy much.  The fundamental facts
surrounding urban insurance markets are less in dispute than the interpretation
of those facts.  Insurance industry spokesmen acknowledge that urban residents
often pay higher premiums for auto and homeowners' insurance than suburban
because of higher expected claims costs.  The Association of Community
Organizations for Reform Now and Consumers Union respond that the availability
of auto or homeowners' insurance is often key to the further development of
poorer neighborhoods.  Community groups maintain that higher expected claims
costs should not be allowed to price some consumers out of the insurance
market.<p>
<p>
	The consumer groups that support the pending legislation are clearly
interested in more than just a data collection program.  Their long-term agenda
includes regulatory changes that would:<p>
<UL>
<LI>  restrict the ability of insurers to use territorial rating; and<p>
<LI>  establish minimum acceptable policy terms.  <p>
</UL>
Some community activists have also urged regulators to base allowable rates of
return for insurers on their sales to targeted neighborhoods.  Others would
establish community reinvestment guidelines that would force insurance
companies to invest in neighborhoods from which they gather premiums.<p>
<p>
	In the long run, such regulatory initiatives would be counterproductive,
reducing both the availability and the affordability of insurance.  Insurance
consumers in all markets would be better served by policies designed to
encourage entry and increase competition in the insurance industry.<p>

A Primer

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
	Most adults are familiar with what insurance companies do.  In our personal
lives and at work, we benefit from a wide variety of insurance
products--auto insurance, property insurance, life insurance, and health
insurance, to name a few.  But few consumers of insurance products understand
how insurance companies provide financial protection against accidents and
illnesses.  This lack of information can lead to frustration and
misunderstandings if premiums increase or claims are refused.<p>
	<p>
	This primer is intended to remove some of the mystery from insurance markets
and insurance company operations.  It describes the role insurance companies
play in the economy.  It also provides basic information about the insurance
industry's size and the fundamentals of industry operations.  Finally, the
primer reviews insurance company regulation.<p>
<p>
	The value of insurance to policyholders is determined by the probability of an
insured-against event occurring and the expected financial loss associated from
the event.  If an insurer attempts to charge policyholders premiums far in
excess of their expected losses, individuals will refuse to purchase the
insurance because the coverage provided is not worth the cost.  When
individuals can choose not to purchase insurance, insurance companies will be
forced to base premiums on expected claims costs.  As a result, private
insurance companies in a competitive market typically do not "spread"
risk in the sense of charging lower risk policyholders premiums that help cover
the claims costs of higher risk insurance customers.  Expected claims costs
account for both the general level of insurance premiums and the differences in
insurance premiums charged to different groups of policyholders.<p>
<p>
	The insurance industry is regulated by the states.  There is no federal
regulation of insurance.  Each state is largely responsible for monitoring the
solvency of insurance companies headquartered there.  Guaranty funds, which
protect claimants in the event of an insurance company's failure, are also
operated by the states.  Regulation of insurance contracts is typically
undertaken by the state in which the policyholder resides.  Contract regulation
addresses the premiums charged and/or the terms of the contract.  Insurance
policies sold to individuals generally attract more regulatory attention than
do commercial policies.<p>
<p>
	The state-based insurance regulatory system has been criticized (especially by
federal lawmakers) because of differences that exist among the states in terms
of the resources devoted to insurance regulation and the stringency with which
various rules are applied.  It is worth noting, however, that the insurance
industry survived the economically tumultuous 1980s in better shape than did
the federally regulated savings and loan or banking industries.<p>
<p>
	Important questions remain about state insurance regulation, however.  For
example, how far should regulators go in identifying appropriate investments
for insurance companies?  State-imposed limits on the premiums that insurance
companies can charge also cause serious problems for some insurance companies.
Rate regulation has, in some cases, led to reduced availability of insurance,
making it difficult for consumers to find coverage they want to purchase.<p>
<p>
	The largest insurance companies in the country have substantial financial
assets at their disposal.  This creates the temptation to view insurers as
&#147;deep pockets,&#148; capable of addressing society's financial ills.
It is important to remember that the largest insurance companies also have
substantial potential liabilities.  Insurance companies required today to pay
unexpected claims because of legal or regulatory interpretations of contractual
terms that are overly generous to policyholders  may not have the resources
needed tomorrow to meet claims arising from other policyholders.<p>
<p>
	Furthermore, insurance companies are not charitable organizations.  They are
in business to make a profit.  When regulatory policies prevent insurers from
earning profits on a line (or lines) of insurance, the supply of the
unprofitable line of insurance will be reduced.  Insurance companies must
answer to their stockholders just as companies do in any other industry.  If
insurance company owners can earn more money in another industry, they will
take their capital elsewhere.<p>
<p>
	The development of private insurance markets benefits society generally.
Businesses and individuals with insurance need not set aside funds for
unforeseen contingencies.  They can invest in other activities.  The
claims-based premiums charged by insurance companies also provide important
information about the risk associated with different activities and how
specific risks can be reduced.<p>
<p>
	Risk-based pricing also allows premiums to respond to the behavior of
individuals.  People who take care to make fewer claims should not be required
to pay the same premiums as individuals who make more frequent claims on the
system.  It is not surprising that compensation systems without risk-sensitive
pricing generally see claims costs rise as claims increase in number and
average size.<p>
<p>
	Private insurance plays a role in the economic body similar to the nervous
system in the human body.  Just as a person's nervous system warns of
danger through sensing pain and discomfort, a well-functioning insurance market
sends signals to economic actors about riskier and less risky activities.
Regulatory policies that interfere with the "insurance" process
interfere with the "pain" signals insurers would normally send.  When
insurance premiums do not reflect differences in risk, society may not realize
it is being "burned" until considerable damage has been done.<p>

<H1>Insurance for Beginners</H1>
by Catherine England

<BR>
</CENTER>

<P>When we buy insurance, we buy increased peace of mind.  If insured-against
events occur, they will not be as much of a financial burden.  With insurance,
we exchange the chance of a large, unexpected payment, whose timing we cannot
control, for a series of smaller, known payments over the life of the insurance
contract.  Finally, buying insurance buys us private risk analysis.  The
insurance company must determine how many 30-year-old houses will catch fire
this year and what steps can be taken to reduce that probability.<p>
	Insurance companies share this information with consumers through differences
in premiums.  We can learn something about what actions or changes reduce risk
by finding out what earns a discount or leads to lower insurance premiums.<p>
	Insurance allows us to protect our wealth more efficiently, and wealthier
societies typically demand more insurance.  Funds can be invested in other
activities rather than being set aside for unforeseeable contingencies.
Insurance thus allows both insured individuals and society to operate with
longer time horizons.<p>
	To realize these broader benefits of insurance, private insurance markets must
exhibit three fundamental elements.  First, premiums must be risk-based.
Second, insurance markets should remain competitive.  Third, insurance
companies must be allowed to earn (but they should not be promised) profits.<p>
	True insurance does not &#147;spread&#148; risk.  Insurance is more accurately
described as a contract that transfers from the policyholder to the insurance
company part of the risk of financial losses associated with insured-against
events.  To better manage their exposure, insurance companies tend to pool the
risks they accept.  But the pools created by private insurance companies are
pools of similar risks.  Most important, premiums paid by an individual
policyholder reflect the probability that he or she will make a claim, not the
probability that someone somewhere will make a claim.<p>
	In insurance markets, consumers&#146; interests are best protected by
competition.  Competition (and potential competition) forces insurance
companies to remain efficient, to control administrative and claims costs.
Competition forces insurance companies to base premiums on expected future
losses.  It prevents them from passing along past losses to new policyholders.
Competition leads insurance companies to pay claims promptly and serve
policyholders well.  Finally, competition encourages innovation and leads
insurers to attempt to extend insurance markets into currently underserved
areas.  In a competitive market, insurers only grow and thrive to the extent
they meet customers&#146; needs.<p>
	As a rule, governments best foster a competitive environment by staying out of
the way.  Government-imposed rules and regulations are far more likely to
inhibit competition than to promote it.  Regulation of rates, artificial caps
on profits, unnecessarily high entry restrictions, and limits on the variations
in contracts may serve some purpose, but they also discourage vigorous
competition.  <p>
	Possible profits provide insurance company owners and managers with an
incentive to provide insurance services to consumers and to find better ways to
serve them.  When insurance companies&#146; profits are artificially restricted
by government fiat, consumers have no way to reward insurers that do a better
than average job, and insurers have no incentive to develop new insurance
products that meet the needs of underserved market segments.  Consumer
satisfaction with the insurance industry generally declines when governments
impose limits on insurance companies&#146; profits.<p>
	The ability of insurance companies to earn profits also directly affects the
supply of insurance available.  The amount of insurance that an insurer can
have in force at any given time (its &#147;capacity&#148;) is determined by the
insurer&#146;s financial capital  (its owners&#146; share of the assets of the
firm).  To add more capacity and to increase the number of new policies it can
write, an insurance company must increase its paid-in capital and surplus.  <p>
	In the absence of active government participation, insurance companies cannot
force individuals to do anything.  Neither a single insurance company nor the
insurance industry can require people to buy insurance products.  In a private
market, consumers purchase insurance only when the protection they receive is
worth the price they pay.  Only the government can insist that individuals buy
insurance products they do not believe are worth the price.  Insurance
companies cannot prevent people from taking risks.  Insurance companies can
only provide incentives for safer behavior through their pricing policies.<p>
	Insurance cannot undo many of the harms caused by insured-against events.
Insurance often cannot make individuals 100 percent whole.  What insurance
provides is some financial compensation, agreed to in advance, to help reduce
the burden of fires, accidents, floods, and other insured-against injuries.<p>
	In the long run, private insurers can only compensate policyholders to the
limits of the insurance contracts in force.    Private insurance cannot survive
as an after-the-fact compensation scheme.  Insurers cannot pay out (for long)
more than they take in.  Insurance is a business, not a charity, and if it is
treated like the latter, capacity will evaporate.<p>
	Private insurance is generally not available for events that are either
extremely unlikely to occur or for events that are extremely likely to occur.
In the first case, there is no demand for insurance.  In the second case, the
premiums are so high that potential insurance consumers are better off saving
their money and insuring themselves.  There are losses that are too small to
insure, and there are losses so large that private insurance cannot provide
coverage, except perhaps for a part of the loss.  Although there are limits to
the coverage private insurers provide, the trend has been (and remains) to find
ways to offer more coverage, ways to expand the limits of what is insurable.<P>

<H1>The Political Economy of MSAs</H1>
<A HREF="/tom4.html">Tom Miller</A>, August 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR><A HREF="/update/0796-tm.html">As noted in the last issue</A> of UpDate, the tax-advantaged medical savings accounts (MSAs) proposed in this year's round of congressional health care legislation would have a mixed impact at best on health care spending levels.  However, until recently, they have provided a valuable political
service.            

<P>MSA proposals threatened misguided efforts to impose insurance
"reforms" like community rating, guaranteed issue, and portability.  (At
press time, a last-minute congressional deal appears to have surrendered
that tactical card as well).  As long as some form of broad-based
MSA/catastrophic insurance option remains available, efforts to ignore
individual health risk differences in the service of "fairness" will run
aground.  Better risks will resist imposition of involuntary cross-subsidies.  
    
<P> MSA plans also remain at cross purposes to more expansive mandated health
insurance benefits, because the latter complicate the availability of
high-deductible coverage.  Not surprisingly, the proponents of incremental
insurance reform at the federal level this year have resisted tenaciously
any further legislative expansion of MSA options.  
     
<P>Although MSA proposals at least temporarily derailed the incremental
insurance reform express train that roared down the greased tracks of
Congress earlier this year, it did not appear to be due to clever
legislative strategy.  Indeed, many MSA advocates have either minimized the
dangers of such incremental measures or suggested shallow and mistaken
shortcuts around them.  
      
<P>The first response essentially assumed that as long as tax-advantaged
MSAs are instituted, any additional health-insurance-related nonsense
attached to the rest of the health care system would matter little.  It
overlooked how difficult it would be to outrun inherent policy
contradictions premised on surrender of fundamental market principles.     
     
<P>The second response hid from the "adverse selection" bogeyman by retreating
to the illusory cover of employer paternalism.  Rather than leave
individuals free to find the best price quotes and contractual
configurations for the risk-based, market cost of their insurance coverage,
even some of the foremost proponents of "Patient Power" preferred to rely on omniscient employers to control risk selection by unilaterally limiting
health insurance choices and restoring cross-subsidies within
employer-formed groups.  When an estimated 83 percent of companies offer
their employees only one health insurance policy, and part of the higher
cost of non-employer-paid insurance options is due to tax policy preferences
and regulatory limits on more widespread voluntary risk pooling, however,
that should be termed a problem, not a solution. 
     
<P>The best market-based ways to minimize artificially induced risk selection
are to eliminate the public policy constraints on risk classification and
risk-based pricing that creates it, and to restore tax neutrality for the
financing of all health insurance purchases.  Vigorous deregulation of
health insurance and greater encouragement of voluntary health risk pooling,
both within and outside the workplace, would facilitate more creative
long-term protections for consumers seeking to minimize exposure to health
risk redefinition in insurance markets.  The adverse selection "problem"
must be challenged directly and addressed convincingly by market-based
alternatives.  It poses even greater political and economic obstacles for
future efforts to reform Medicare via defined contribution/individual choice
alternatives.  
     
<P>Thus, despite initial success in gaining a beachhead of political support,
MSA-based proposals require further refinement before they can offer the
prospect of true market-oriented health care reform.  In order to provide
appropriate cost-conscious incentives and restore the economizing trade-off
between a dollar of health care spending and a dollar used for other
purposes, funds deposited in MSAs should be treated on a post-tax basis,
with only their interest/investment earnings ("inside buildup") considered
tax exempt.  No withdrawal penalties should then be imposed, regardless of
how such funds were spent or how long they were saved (a minimum balance
requirement, however, might be desirable).  Accumulated funds in MSAs
should be available for payment of all forms of health insur-ance premiums,
not just restricted to payments for COBRA premiums, or for interim coverage
while receiving unemployment compensation, as provided under the current
House legislation.  

<P>     The proposal of Mark Pauly and John Goodman to facilitate voluntary
substitution of a flat tax credit in place of the graduated-rate tax
exclusion for employer-paid group health insurance coverage offers another
thoughtful first step in unraveling current tax distortions of health care
spending.  Perhaps the greatest potential for market-based health care
reform remains in enactment of broad-based tax reform that focuses on a
single tax rate and elimination of double taxation of saving. 
     
<P>Many problems of health care policy remain outside the limited therapeutic
powers of MSAs.  They will have to be addressed through such policy options
as legal reform of health insurance contract enforcement, encouragement of
voluntary purchasing pools, targeted income-based subsidies, preemption or
repeal of state mandated benefit laws, disclosure-based reform of managed
care abuses, and broader deregulation of health care markets.  Moreover,
many of the factors that determine one's personal health are outside the
control of either health insurance coverage levels or more intensive
application of discretionary medical care.  
     
<P>The latest compromise regarding tax-advantaged MSAs would not only restrict
their initial application to the self-employed and small employer groups
with fewer than 50 workers, but set a maximum cap of 750,000 participants in a four-year "experiment."  Given the current insurance coverage problems and health care policy distortions in these markets, wider availability of MSAs
for such insurance purchasers should offer significant savings opportunities
and improved health benefits.  Unfortunately, the congressional compromise
not only places too many artificial barriers to an honest market test of MSA
alternatives, but it facilitates adoption of accompanying health care
legislation that is unwise and harmful.  Republican "dealmakers" succeeded
in adding self-inflicted injury to insult.
    
<P> More widespread enactment of tax advantages for MSA plans would be a mixed
bag.  It would help preserve more autonomy and personal control for
individual consumers and frustrate the centralizing imperatives of health
care socialists.  However, such MSA options would be more likely to increase
overall health care spending than reduce it.  That well may be the long-term
preference of most Americans in the final analysis, but it would be better
to make that choice consciously, rather than slide into it while trying to
have our cake without paying for it.  
     
<P>Meanwhile, the wiser course would be to avoid imposing rules that obstruct
voluntary experimentation with any alternative insurance arrangements that,
at least, have the virtue of not being invented in Washington.

<H1>MSA's -- Panacea or Placebo?</H1>
<A HREF="/tom4.html">Tom Miller</A>, July 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>The policy debate over whether to extend tax benefits to Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) has tended to polarize into two camps.  MSA advocates
gravitate toward sales hype and Panglossian promises while opponents hurl
back knee-jerk claims that widespread adoption of MSAs will create windfall
gains, revenue losses, and fractured insurance risk pools.  
<P>The respective hopes and fears of MSA partisans and critics have collided
during last year's attempt to restructure the Medicare program and, more
recently, in the midst of the current effort to adopt incremental "reforms"
of health insurance markets.  Efforts to reach a conference agreement
between House and Senate health bills adopted this spring have remained
fundamentally stalemated for several months over the MSA issue.  
A recent analysis of MSAs by RAND researchers provides new scholarly light
amidst the partisan heat on Capitol Hill.  It suggests that MSAs offer
neither a surefire cure nor a dangerous curse for the complex problems of
health insurance markets.  The strengths and weaknesses of MSA proposals
depend upon the details of their design. 
<P>RAND concludes that MSAs would have little impact on the health care costs
of Americans with employer-provided insurance ("the MSA approach is not
likely to produce the reduction in health care use that its advocates
foresee"), but it knocks down most concerns about adverse selection.
Depending on the size of the stop-loss limit on out-of-pocket spending
provided under a catastrophic insurance policy, RAND finds that "MSAs would
be attractive to both sick and healthy people" and, if health plan choice is
taken into account, enactment of federal MSA legislation would change total
health spending by between -2 percent and +1 percent.  
<P>     The RAND analysis is particularly noteworthy and credible because the
primary scholarly foundation and impetus for MSA proposals come from the
oft-quoted RAND Health Insurance Experiment, which examined the effects of
various cost-sharing provisions on health insurance expenditures from 1975
to 1982.  Although MSA advocates have frequently cited the RAND experiment
as evidence that the combination of MSAs and high-deductible, catastrophic
insurance plans will reduce total health care spending, they invariably
neglect to adjust for the fact that the out-of-pocket, cost-sharing
component of health risk under the RAND experiment received no tax
advantages, but MSA funds do in current proposed legislation.
Depending on the manner in which cash contributions to MSAs are treated as
tax-exempt, such tax advantages may stimulate greater health care spending
to varying degrees.  MSAs whose annual cash contribution amounts to a
substantial portion of the deductible under the accompanying insurance plan
will, in effect, reduce the "after-tax" coinsurance rate on both uncovered
health care services and other out-of-pocket (below the deductible) spending
on health care.  That will generate more spending on those items.  (The
subsidy could vary from 15 percent to as much as 50 percent, depending on a
taxpayer's marginal tax rate bracket and whether the MSAs are funded by
employers or employees.)    
<P> Moreover, as noted in a 1995 American Academy of Actuaries study of MSAs,
accumulation of cash balances in an individual's MSA can counteract the
health care utilization reduction resulting from high copayments under an
accompanying catastrophic insurance plan.  The greater the amount
contributed to the MSA, the lower the "real" stop-loss cap (or deductible)
on annual out-of-pocket spending.  The RAND analysts observe that, after
exceeding their annual cap, insured families face no cost sharing for the
rest of the year and therefore will consume more health care services.  
The Actuaries' study further frames the cost containment issue for MSAs in
terms of whether the insured party views his MSA balance as simply another
form of insurance (leading to higher health care utilization) or as personal
savings (reducing utilization).  The RAND analysis similarly asks whether
the funds in MSAs are valued as equal to fully fungible money.  Although
their primary finding assumes 100-percent fungibility, they note that if
people value MSA funds at only 75 percent of money that is fully liquid,
total health spending increases by 2 percent.     
<P>Under most legislative vehicles for tax-advantaged MSAs, proposed federal
tax treatment will encourage more, rather than less, health spending on the
margin.  Partly for myopic budget-scoring reasons, withdrawals from MSA
accounts for non-health-care spending generally are subject to both income
and payroll taxes (previously deferred), as well as a 10-percent penalty
before the age of 59 1/2.   As a result, spending an additional dollar out
of MSA money on health care items would go further than spending that dollar
for other purposes.
<P>Thus, the core features of current MSA proposals partly work at
cross-purposes to their purported goal of health care cost containment.
Further dilution of the spending-dampening effect of the high- deductible
insurance plans paired with MSAs can come from problems in benefits
coordination for families with additional health coverage through another
employer (e.g., dual-earner couples can transfer out-of-pocket risk to one
employer while gaining increased MSA fund accumulations from the other).  It
also remains an open question as to whether an employer, in response to a
tax-advantaged MSA option, will contribute a higher percentage of overall
employee compensation to the health care benefits package (to leverage the
tax benefits for out-of-pocket health spending) or keep most of its savings
on health insurance premiums for the company and pay the rest in either
higher taxable wages or MSA deposits (see, e.g., the initial year of the
"bonus" incentive plan by Forbes magazine).  
<P> Indeed, one could make the case that political advocacy of tax-advantaged
MSAs has increasingly shifted toward emphasizing their potential to enhance
and augment health care benefits, rather than reduce overall spending
levels.  Antipathy to the constraints (real and perceived) of managed care
by both patients and physicians has provided an emotionally appealing
message and powerful mobilizing force for MSA proponents.  MSAs promise the
preservation, if not the expansion, of less-restrictive and hassle-free
insurance coverage of fee-for-service-style medicine.  Of course, as
Brookings Institution health analyst Joe White notes, if health benefits are
higher under MSA-style insurance plans, the claim of accompanying savings on
overall health care costs seems contradictory.  
<P>Although MSA proponents draw upon growing consumer disenchantment with the
excesses of managed care for popular support, the many large- and
medium-sized employers that have reduced their health benefits expenses
through various degrees of utilization controls, integrated care, selective
contracting, gatekeeper incentives, and case management remain more
ambivalent at best.  (Indeed, even the primary proponent of MSAs, the
National Center for Policy Analysis, has integrated selective contracting
and network incentive elements of managed care into the MSA-based health
plan for its own employees, in order to influence their choice of physicians.)  
<P> In a 1994 review of the potential of MSAs, health policy analyst Gail
Jensen found that health care expenses between the "catastrophic" insurance
plan and the HMO alternative plan in the RAND experiment were statistically
indistinguishable, and she concluded that MSAs "are about equally effective
as HMOs at containing costs."  However, the RAND analysts recently noted
that many current HMOs are more assertive about rationing care than was
assumed in their original experiment, and therefore shifts from less-costly
HMOs to MSAs would result in less cost savings than their model predicts
above.  Of course, the qualitative preference of many consumers for greater
choice of their physicians and control regarding their treatment plans could
well override marginal quantitative differences in health care costs. 
What, then, is one to make of claims by MSA advocates that thousands of
employers have already reduced their overall health benefits costs by 10 to
30 percent, through adopting combinations of high-deductible catastrophic
insurance coverage and generously funded MSAs for their employees?  First,
congratulate them for overcoming the burdens of the limited bargaining
clout, undiversified risk profiles, and scarce benefits administration
resources that are prevalent in small-group markets and tend to result in
overpriced and overinsured health care coverage. 
<P>Second, note that these MSA success stories occurred without any new federal
tax advantages.  Because the MSAs were funded on a post-tax basis, the
employers' successes in controlling health benefit costs essentially prove
that high-deductible insurance is less expensive and reduces overall health
spending more than low-deductible insurance coverage does.  No surprise
there.  Employees in such "MSA/Catastrophic Insurance" plans actually had a
portion of their total compensation shifted from health insurance premium
payments to additional "wages" (MSA contributions) that were subject to
income taxes.  
<P>Third, RAND analysts also note that the company experiments with MSAs had no
control groups, that firms and employees currently using non-tax-advantaged
MSAs are a select group, and that many other firms in recent years have had
similar success in curtailing health premium increases through other non-MSA
means.
<P>Fourth, many illustrative comparisons between out-of-pocket exposure in
lower deductible/comprehensive insurance plans and
high-deductible/catastrophic insurance plans both overstate the effect of
additional coinsurance and understate the effect of stop-loss limits under
the former.  Unlike Medicare fee-for-service coverage, the maximum
out-of-pocket exposure under most private, low-deductible, comprehensive
insurance is not much greater than that promised under MSA/catastrophic
insurance combination plans.
<P>Fifth, most professional actuarial opinion remains skeptical about claims
that premium savings from high-deductible insurance policies are large
enough to provide enough funds in the accompanying MSA to cover most of the
out-of-pocket risk under the higher deductible for the general population.
The standard actuarial assumption remains that a one-percent  increase in
out-of-pocket health spending results in approximately a 0.2 percent
reduction in total medical spending.  If that relationship holds in most
health insurance markets, then the dollar reduction in health benefit
payments and total expenditures (by switching from a comprehensive insurance
plan to a high-deductible plan) must remain much less than the increase in
deductible levels.  For example, the American Academy of Actuaries estimated
that, for an increase in the deductible from $200 to $1,500 while an
employer held health benefit expenditures constant, the premiums for the
health plan would decline to a level ranging from $468 to $552 (with that
balance deposited in an MSA).
<P>Although the cost containment case for MSAs is cloudy, charges that their
widespread adoption will aggravate risk segmentation and worsen insurance
coverage for the sick in the below-age-65 market are overstated.  RAND
analysts effectively point out that MSA plans can benefit both the healthy
and the very sick (the latter because of relatively low stop-loss caps,
greater choice of physicians and treatment plans, and MSA fund balances
available for first-dollar coverage).  Benefits for individuals with high
medical expenses will be further enhanced if MSA legislation allows them the
option of funding their tax-advantaged MSAs themselves (rather than relying
on employer contributions).
<P>Distributional analysis of "winners and losers" under MSA-style coverage
overlooks the real benefits of expanding choice and competition in health
insurance markets.  The skewed distribution of health care claims in any
given year means that, under a broad-based, comprehensive, low-deductible
insurance plan, most insureds are net "losers" on a cash payout basis in any
single year.  The flip side of reducing the scope of third-party insurance
coverage for early-dollar claims and in effect "refunding" the
cash-equivalent of foregone insurance benefits to insured individuals is a
partial elimination of the previous insurance cross-subsidies from the
healthy to the sick.  Because most insured individuals in any given year
will incur modest, if any, health care charges, they will "win" under a MSA
plan that returns cash to them.  
<P>However, the point of true insurance is to provide protection against
unanticipated risks that an individual cannot finance on his own.  The
broader trend of reduced cross-subsidization of health insurance policies by
employers reflects both the increased price competitiveness of commercial
insurance markets and employers' desires to make their own workers more
aware of the costs of their insurance.  
    <P>  In summary, tax-advantaged MSAs may have a mixed impact at best on
health care spending levels, but adverse selection concerns are exaggerated
for the          employer-provided group insurance market.  <A HREF="/update/0896-tm.html">In the next
issue</A> of UpDate, we will examine the political benefits of MSA proposals, as
well as how to provide a market-based overhaul of health care reform proposals.

<H1>Portability -- A Trojan Pony</H1>
by <A HREF="/staff/miller.html">Tom Miller</A>, February 1996
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Even as they fought the Clinton health care plan, many Republicans signed
on to warm and fuzzy incremental insurance reform bills to show they were
in favor of "something."  In late January, President Clinton raised
the ante.  He challenged Congress to pass one of those measures, the
Kassebaum-Kennedy "Health Insurance Reform Act" (S. 1028).  If
congressional Republicans bite, Clinton will yell "Gotcha" and
America will once again be on the road to Clintoncare.<p>
	The proposed Senate legislation aims at making it easier for people to renew
or acquire health insurance coverage regardless of their health status,
particularly when they change or lose their jobs.  S. 1028 applies new
portability rules to all employment-based health plans and prohibits these
plans from limiting or denying coverage for more than 12 months for most
"preexisting" medical conditions.<p>
	Kassebaum-Kennedy also prohibits insurers and other health coverage issuers
from denying, based on health status, whole group coverage to employers with
two or more employees, and prevents employment-based health benefits plans from
excluding any employee from coverage through requirements based on
health-related factors.  In addition, the legislation generally provides
"guaranteed renewability" of health plan coverage to employer groups
and individuals, at the option of the insured, and guarantees
"group-to-individual portability" for individuals who leave group
insurance plans and lack access to other group insurance coverage.<p>
	Although the bill's goals seem compassionate and caring, S. 1028
misdiagnoses the problem.  Its remedial efforts will achieve little measurable
progress in expanding total levels of health insurance coverage and may
actually do some harm.  More dangerously, the bill would restore momentum for
surrendering the principles of individual choice, personal responsibility, and
risk-based pricing in favor of government-controlled health care markets.<p>
	The purpose of preexisting condition limits and exclusions in health insurance
policies is frequently misunderstood.  By providing partial coverage of persons
with preexisting conditions, the contractual clauses actually expand the
insurance market.  They offer some protection to persons who would be wholly
uninsurable unless some limits and conditions were attached to their coverage.
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill's permissible time period for preexisting
condition limits effectively eliminates their application to medical conditions
that will either not require immediate treatment or can be treated initially by
out-of-pocket payments until new insurance coverage is obtained.  New
restrictions on preexisting condition exclusions will also undercut the
incentive to prevent and avoid dangerous conditions in the first place.<p>
	If insurers are prevented explicitly from adjusting their premiums and
restricting their coverage to reflect the fact that different people have
different risks, they will resort to more indirect and less efficient means to
match the value of health insurance to the amount for which people will
voluntarily pay.  Insurers may devote more resources to pinpointing particular
high-risk individuals, industries, and small employer groups.  They then may
discourage such high-risk customers from seeking their coverage.  Techniques
will include more creative use of "objective" variables as health
status surrogates, selective marketing, geographic targeting, service-based
cues to customers, and so on.  <p>
	Employers also will respond to politically directed changes in the composition
of their risk pools.  On the margin, they may reduce or limit the number of
their employees; use more independent contractors; invest in more labor-saving
alternatives; relocate operations away from higher risk areas; or cut back the
scope of their group insurance coverage.<p>
	All of the above countermeasures will be set in motion by the political
impulse to "solve" a vastly overstated and mischaracterized problem.
Insurance coverage denials for medical reasons account for only a small portion
of uninsured individuals under age 65.  The much ballyhooed problem of
"job lock" is hard to prove and is not a significant impediment to
labor mobility.  The presence of more uninsured people does not lead to more
successful cost shifting and higher health care prices.  Nor do firms that do
not provide insurance succeed in shifting labor costs to other insured
businesses.  <p>
	Advocates of S. 1028 overlook the real factors that reduce the availability
and raise the cost of private health insurance coverage.  They include the
effect of poor health on earnings and labor supply, the rate of labor force
turnover in the small group market, the relative elasticity of small employer
demand for group health insurance, the higher-than-average risks of people who
switch health insurance policies, the effects of state mandated benefits, and
the inflationary effect of increased levels of insurance coverage.<p>
	Incremental insurance reforms such as guaranteed renewability, guaranteed
issue, and portability share several basic characteristics.  They restrict the
choices of most currently insured people and raise the cost of their insurance
policies, in exchange for subsidizing insurance coverage for a smaller group of
people with greater risks and higher likely health care costs.  The proposed
reforms force healthy people to subsidize sick people, regardless of income,
and undermine incentives to take personal responsibility for one's future
health care needs.<p>
	In a market where the purchase of health insurance is voluntary, raising the
cost of insurance will raise the number of uninsured people.  Estimates vary as
to the magnitude of this effect, depending upon how extensive the cost-raising
regulations are and who is affected by them.  A mid-range estimate of the
elasticity of demand for health insurance is probably -0.6.  That means that a
10 percent increase in the price of insurance may increase the number of
uninsured by about 6 percent.<p>
	Efforts to spread the cost of cross subsidies for a targeted population across
a wider base of insurance buyers is the public choice formula for politically
driven cost shifting (i.e., concentrated benefits, diffuse costs).  However, in
the group health insurance market segment where coverage levels are the most
disappointing -- small groups of 50 or fewer employers -- current
purchasers are very cost sensitive.  For them, relatively small changes in the
cost of health insurance create significant cutbacks in coverage.  The large
majority of the working uninsured, who pass up coverage not because of poor
health status but because it costs too much, place a low value on health
insurance relative to other forms of compensation.  <p>
	A voluntary insurance market can afford only a limited degree of premium cross
subsidies before the number of low-risk groups and individuals dropping
coverage exceeds the total of high-risk groups and individuals gaining access
to underpriced insurance.  At that point, one reaches a political no-man's
land in which the next logical step down the tunnel of cost shifting appears to
be mandatory universal coverage.  If the healthy are going to subsidize the
sick, it becomes imperative to round up as many overpaying conscripts as
possible.  <p>
	Therefore, S. 1028's guaranteed issue, renewability, and portability will
inevitably lead to tighter health insurance regulation on the federal level.
Renewal or issuance of insurance policies cannot be guaranteed without
involving the government in setting rating band limits on insurance policy
prices.  After all, in what sense can the availability  of an insurance policy
be considered guaranteed if it becomes too expensive for some policyholders to
buy or renew?  <p>
	Guaranteed issue, renewability, and portability also will increase pressure
for a policy of mandatory, standardized health benefits.  Variations and
changes in an insurer's package of health benefits can complicate those
mandated guarantees, because quality variation in health plans can be an
indirect means to exclude higher cost customers.  Addressing comparability
measures and integration rules for the varied quality and medical practice
style of health plans that mobile workers choose also will be difficult.  <p>
	Thus, despite its purportedly modest goals, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill's
efforts to remove health status considerations from the pricing and scope of
private insurance coverage leads down a one-way street where the ultimate
destination is the same one that Americans rejected in 1994: mandatory purchase
of standardized coverage, where the only cost constraints are imposed through
price controls and bureaucratic rationing.  <p>
	Advocates of Kassebaum-Kennedy deny the bill will raise insurance premiums
very much, if at all.  However, if providing guarantees of continued insurance
coverage is so inexpensive, why don't more people voluntarily buy such
protection on their own?  On the other hand, if individuals do find that the
cost of those insurance guarantees is more than they can (or are willing to)
pay, it's time to reexamine the cost estimates and search for different
answers to continuity of coverage issues.<p>
	S. 1028 takes a large step toward mandating that insurance companies offer
only multi-year policies at a fixed premium.  It assumes that voluntary market
arrangements have failed to meet the demands of consumers to provide products
that protect them from the consequences of health risk redefinition on an
annual basis.  Actually, the lack of more effective protection for individuals
against the risks of changing health status reflects the barriers of tax policy
and state restrictions on voluntary health plan purchasing coalitions, plus
variations in job status, income level, and risk preference.<p>
	Individuals who receive group health insurance through their employer enjoy
favorable tax treatment of employer-paid premiums.  If they work for a large
company, they also are likely to gain several additional advantages
(community-rated premiums, purchasing clout, lower administrative and
regulatory costs per worker.<p>
	On the other hand, employer-paid insurance policies are likely to provide few,
if any, continuing benefits for workers once they change or lose their jobs.
Employers sponsoring insurance plans are also less likely than their individual
employees to resist insurance policy exclusions for potentially costly
preexisting conditions.  <p>
	Theoretically, individuals who prefer other health insurance options and want
long-term protection against changes in their health status can purchase the
appropriate insurance policies on their own.  However, tax benefits are very
limited for individual health care buyers, and such policies cost more for
insurers to underwrite, market, and administer.  Given those costs, many
consumers are simply not willing to pay for multiperiod insurance contracts on
their own.  <p>
	Moreover, consumers may not want to be locked into one insurer for a long
period of time when health plan choices have significant, ongoing service
consequences (e.g., claims administration, provider networks, contract
interpretation).  Some consumers also need the contractual flexibility to
change insurers in the event that they later obtain a job offering better,
employer-paid insurance coverage.  Finally, many consumers are unwilling to
risk redistributing their income (when younger and healthier) through premium
subsidies to others in a voluntary pool, when they can instead be "picked
off" as good risks by other insurers and pay lower premiums.  <p>
	Kassebaum-Kennedy can round up support from consumers who do not want to pay
an actuarially fair price for health insurance, but prefer to have healthy
people subsidize their higher costs.  What can market-based alternatives offer
to other individuals who would try to pay their own way if less expensive
alternatives were available?<p>
	A short list of structural remedies would include (1) tax neutrality for all
health insurance purchases; (2) preservation of risk-based pricing; (3)
targeted income-based subsidies for the poor and those with medically
uninsurable risks; (4) legal reform that restores private insurers' rights
to enforce voluntary contracts regarding medical care choices and innovative
economizing options; (5) preemption or repeal of state mandated benefit laws;
and (6) encouragement of voluntary purchasing pools offering multiperiod,
experience-rated contracts.  (Kassebaum-Kennedy attempts to do the latter, but
undercuts the effort with rate restrictions.)<p>
	The most powerful solutions, of course, come down to fundamentals.  Ensuring
vigorous competition, unfettered consumer choice, and voluntary arrangements in
the insurance marketplace; empowering individuals to balance the risks,
rewards, and responsibilities of health care decisionmaking; and adopting
growth-oriented economic policies will do much more to expand insurance
coverage than incremental reform legislation that temporarily makes politicians
feel better but undermines its own official goals.<BR>

<H2>Environmental Foreign Aid</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Since the end of the Cold War, environmental protection has become a prominent
justification for foreign aid programs.  The Clinton administration&#146;s 1997
budget proposed to spend $3.75 billion to promote &#147;sustainable
development&#148; worldwide.  Such foreign aid giveaways squander taxpayer
dollars and empower bureaucrats whose environmental record is abysmal.  These
budget items should be eliminated.<p>
	<a href="/ebb/global.html">Sustainable development</A> is a broad term that encompasses a wide-ranging social
agenda not supported by most American taxpayers.  In addition to global
environmental restrictions, it encompasses international efforts, through the
United Nations and other organizations, to promote population control,
environmental trade restrictions and the creation of multinational regulatory
bodies.<p>
	A substantial portion of foreign aid is channeled through the World Bank, an
institution which has simultaneously impeded economic growth and degraded
environmental quality in the Third World for fifty years.  The Bank&#146;s
massive construction projects have subsidized rainforest destruction and forced
migration, and even contributed to the outbreak of disease.  Bank projects
routinely face intense opposition from local communities and environmental
advocates.  In 1995, for example, this type of opposition forced the Bank to
abandon the giant $1 billion Arun dam project in Nepal.  <p>
	The World Bank has responded to environmental criticism by increasing its
&#147;environmental&#148; lending for global climate and biodiversity policies
through its Global Environmental Facility (GEF).  Yet the GEF, already plagued
by management failures, focuses only on potential global problems in the
distant future.  Meanwhile, real environmental hazards are made worse by the
World Bank&#146;s insistence on statist economic policies and wealth-destroying
regulatory controls.<p>
	The World Bank is not the only recipient of &#147;environmental&#148; funds
that do little for the environment.  Similarly wasteful projects are funded
through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the
Inter-American Development Bank, the United Nations, and the North American
Development Bank, which was established by NAFTA.<p>
	The earmarking of aid funds for environmental protection only underscores the
unfortunate fact that fifty years of massive wealth transfers have failed to
alleviate world poverty. The legacy of foreign aid has been Third World
dependency and indebtedness.  Foreign aid will also fail to deliver its
promised environmental benefits. Instead of inventing new reasons to send money
abroad, Congress should end the giveaway of foreign aid.<p>
<i>Q:  Isn&#146;t it cheaper to give aid to foreign governments now, to prevent
environmental problems from developing into full-blown crises?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Protecting the environment has been a poor rationale for foreign aid for
many years already.  Foreign aid to Somalia, for example, did not prevent
famine and civil strife from overwhelming that country, which eventually led to
U.S. military intervention.  The history of foreign aid shows that it is more
likely to cause environmental degradation than to prevent it.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Isn&#146;t World Bank aid necessary to create new markets for U.S.
exports?  </i><p>
<p>
A:  The World Bank has tried to nurture export markets for many years, without
success.  In Mexico, for example, twelve years of World Bank lending and advice
failed avert to the 1994-5 peso devaluation and financial collapse.  Instead of
generating consumer demand for U.S.-made products, the World Bank generated an
overwhelming debt burden for Mexico&#146;s people.  The job of selecting
appropriate export markets should be left to private businesses, not to
government agencies. Moreover, if the purpose of the World Bank&#146;s
environmental funds is to promote environmental protection, why are we
concerned about the benefits for business?<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Don&#146;t we have to pay for cleaning up Mexico&#146;s pollution in
order to make NAFTA a success?</i><p>
<p>
A:  U.S. taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize environmental cleanup in a
foreign country.   Environmental foreign aid violates the &#147;polluter
pays&#148; principle of sound environmental management.  The Mexican government
should do a better job of protecting private property rights, so that
environmental harms to individuals can be properly redressed.  Because
wealth-creation is a pre-requisite for environmental improvement, U.S. policy
toward Mexico should be trade, not aid.  NAFTA&#146;s environmental bank is a
waste of taxpayer dollars and should be scrapped.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  As the sole remaining superpower, should not America promote sustainable
environmental policies worldwide?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  The U.S. should remain actively involved in the world.  However, foreign
aid has not been successful in promoting freer markets or economic progress in
recipient nations.  It has only propped up corrupt government bureaucracies,
promoted statist economic policies, and accelerated environmental degradation.
Worst of all, foreign aid distorts markets by subsidizing domestic exporters
and picking winners and losers in international trade.

<H2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>World trade has been significantly liberalized during the last four decades;
average tariffs have fallen from 40 percent in the 1950s to less than 5 percent
today.  The lowering of selected tariffs has not meant an end to protectionism,
however.  Increased competition brought on by growing trade has put pressure on
governments to find new ways to protect domestic production in the absence of
tariffs.  A new rationale for protectionism is emerging which argues for the
restriction of trade as a means of preserving and protecting the environment.
The &#147;greening&#148; of protectionism and the merging of environmental
standards into international trade agreements could fundamentally change the
world trading system.<p>
<p>
     Environmentalist objections to trade and proposals for the
&#147;greening&#148; of trade require greater political management and
regulation of the private sector; thus, they are fundamentally an assault on
free trade principles.  Fearing lower environmental standards in the Third
World, environmentalists call for new trade barriers to combat what they see as
&#147;eco-dumping.&#148;  To business interests fearful of competition,
however, such trade barriers are just a disguised form of protectionism.  Green
trade measures, championed as a means to harmonize environmental standards, are
pumping new life into the old politics of protectionism, industrial policy, and
over-regulation.  The environmentalist critique of trade is rapidly becoming
conventional wisdom.<p>
<p>
     Green protectionism is premised upon the idea of &#147;market failure&#148;
and a theory of ecological central planning called &#147;sustainable
development.&#148;  However, environmental quality is only sustainable in the
context of free market institutions and free trade.  Markets have significant
environmental benefits, including:<p>

<UL>
<LI>market forces promote increased efficiency in energy and materials use;<p>

<LI>economic growth creates the wealth and technological resources necessary
to produce environmental improvement;<p>

<LI>pollution problems decline in severity as per capita income rises.<p>
<p>

</UL>
<p>
     A disturbing feature of green protectionism is eco-imperialism, in which
developed countries impose unattainable and unaffordable environmental
standards on the Third World, at the expense of economic development and the
poor.  Moreover, green trade measures intrude on the sovereignty of Third World
peoples, depriving them of the use of natural resources such as fisheries,
rainforests, and energy supplies.<p>
<p>
     The June 1992 Earth Summit produced a blueprint for environmental planning and
international policy coordination, which calls for &#147;sustainable
development through trade liberalization.&#148;  An emerging body of
international law for global environmental protection is beginning to have
profound impacts on trade and international economic affairs.  International
environmental agreements and treaties may be harbingers of sweeping new global
trade and environment policies.  Many environmental agreements conflict with
multilateral trade rules, and pressure is mounting to incorporate international
environmental policies into government-negotiated trade rules.  Among the most
important environmental treaties which employ trade measures are:<p>

<UL>
<LI>The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer;<p>

<LI>The Basel Convention on the Control of  Transboundary Movements of  Hazardous            Wastes and Their Disposal; and<p>

<LI>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of  Wild Fauna
and       Flora.<p>
</UL>

<p>
     Green protectionism gained a foothold with the environmental side agreement to
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a regional trade bloc.  Carol
Browner, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, calls the
NAFTA between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, &#147;the &#145;greenest&#146;
trade agreement ever negotiated.&#148;<p>
<p>
     The green trade agenda is now focused on the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT), the system of world trade rules.  GATT was designed in 1948 to
expand trade by reducing tariffs and other trade barriers.  Historically,
GATT&#146;s free trade orientation has prevented it from incorporating
environmental standards or other social policy objectives unrelated to trade.
GATT&#146;s bureaucratic growth remains stunted due to the fact that its
provisions are extremely difficult to amend.  Lacking an international
organization, a binding charter, or enforcement provisions, the GATT is
relatively powerless and non-binding.  The proposed World Trade Organization
(WTO), negotiated by the Clinton administration, would be an international
organization with greater legal authority to enforce world trade rules through
binding dispute settlement procedures.  WTO provisions are more easily revised
and interpreted, and modifications to world trade rules could be negotiated
through a WTO Committee on Trade and the Environment.<p>
<p>
     If successful, the greening of trade would institute a new generation of
environmental regulatory controls, trade sanctions, and regulatory
harmonization.  Bureaucratic centralization is incompatible with the objective
of free trade.  Further government intervention in the global market can only
result in the establishment of protected cartels and suppression of competitive
enterprise.<p>

<H1>How's NAFTA Now?
</H1>

by <A HREF="/staff/sheehan.html">James M. Sheehan</a>

</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<p>
	It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that NAFTA has been a disappointment
for those who hoped the treaty would promote free enterprise and economic
liberty.  Despite all the promises, the treaty has failed to deliver a freer
market, liberalized trade, and reduced government interference in the private
economy.  Instead, NAFTA&#146;s first two years have been characterized by
hallmarks of excessive government: bailout guarantees, foreign aid giveaways,
and environmental controls.<p>
	To the mercantilists in Washington, D.C., lower tariffs are dangerous unless
accompanied by government intervention into private currency markets.  A NAFTA
side agreement created a $6 billion Federal Reserve bailout fund for the peso.
In the world of finance, a bailout guarantee results in &#147;moral
hazard,&#148; i.e., it encourages excessive risk-taking.  The NAFTA safety net
coaxed Americans into buying billions of dollars worth of high-risk Mexican
debt, while ensuring that Mexican leaders would not be held accountable if they
failed to make payments.  Mexico&#146;s spendthrift policies finally caused the
peso to crash, and when the dust settled, the bailout had grown to $50 billion.
Though NAFTA concealed Mexico&#146;s true financial condition, heightened
investment losses, and decimated U.S. exporters, White House flacks
remorselessly proclaim NAFTA&#146;s innocence.  If you believe them, you
probably think Mrs. Clinton just got lucky in the futures market.<p>
	CEI&#146;s 1993 monograph, <i>The Free Trade Case Against NAFTA</i>, warned
that the trade bloc would create several perverse incentives for governments to
devalue their currencies as a way to promote domestic industries.  Former CEI
policy analyst Matthew Hoffman deserves credit for noting that NAFTA&#146;s
Rules of Origin &#147;require invasive enforcement procedures . . . further
politicize trade, and destabilize international currency markets.&#148;  Over
the past year, the peso devaluation has given a boost to Mexican exports and
has generated a small trade surplus with the U.S.<p>
	NAFTA&#146;s hostility to the free market extends to its environmental
provisions, which imply that impoverished Mexico&#146;s lower environmental
standards are an unfair trading practice.  &#147;Fair&#148; trade can only be
guaranteed through raising Mexico&#146;s enforcement of EPA-style regulations
and standards.  To comply with NAFTA&#146;s upward harmonization provisions,
Mexico&#146;s laws are being patterned after U.S. laws in the areas of
transportation, forestry, fisheries, soil, and water standards.<p>
	The NAFTA environmental commission launched an investigation of a polluted
Mexican reservoir, where large numbers of migratory birds died from exposure to
raw sewage.  Environmentalist demands for increased public works spending to
protect the pretty birds are now bolstered by the findings of an international
investigation.  How quickly we bird-loving suburbanites forget that the Mexican
economy is in 1930s-style depression, that unemployment is nearly 40 percent,
and that most consumer debt is in default.  With Mexico City bankrupt, it is
likely that money for big government projects will have to be borrowed from
Uncle Sam, perhaps through NAFTA&#146;s North American Development Bank
recently funded by Congress.<p>
	As the average Mexican peasant witnessed his life&#146;s savings being wiped
out in the financial meltdown, NAFTA officials flew to the posh Caribbean
resort in Cancun to discuss how to enhance his quality of life.  Draft reports
of the Land Transportation Standards Subcommittee have been translated from
Spanish to English to French and back again.  Mexico&#146;s &#147;Emergency
Response Guidebook&#148; has been reviewed to ensure that it complies with
&#147;U.N. Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods.&#148;  The
NAFTA-crats appear to have settled on the all-important official definition of
a &#147;NAFTA truck.&#148;  A sigh of relief was heard throughout Chiapas.<p>
	NAFTA&#146;s commissions are working for peace of mind in this country as
well.  Through a continental environment workplan, the three governments are
developing plans to eradicate lead, cadmium, mercury, PCBs and other organic
chemicals and metals from the North American economy.  This is the agenda of
the U.N. Basel Convention, written into the NAFTA text, which forbids free
trade in materials declared &#147;hazardous&#148; by environmental bureaucrats.
Basel is the RCRA of international trade.  A jumble of NAFTA, Mexican, and
American border bureaucrats are preparing a &#147;five-year plan&#148; to
address water quality, air quality, and hazardous waste issues.  Don&#146;t
hold your breath expecting this plan to embody the principles of free market
environmentalism.<p>
	At an October conference in Oaxaca, Mexico, the NAFTA commission unveiled
joint harmonization initiatives on pollution prevention, energy efficiency,
climate change, and habitat protection.  NAFTA authorities intend to take a
complete inventory of all emissions in North America.  If you believe the
regulators mean no harm to private industry, you probably think Richard
Gephardt would make a good U.S. Trade Representative<p>
	Sadly, the public victory for the principle of free trade has resulted in
greater centralization of government power in North America.  Regulation,
bureaucracy and government intervention have distinguished the first two years
of NAFTA.  Free traders should think twice before endorsing another such

<H1>WHO NEEDS AN EXIMBANK?</H1>
by William H. Lash III

<BR>

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Despite being the world&#146;s leading exporter, the U.S. spends over 3
billion tax dollars annually on export promotion activities.  The most
egregious member of federal government&#146;s confederacy of dunces is easily
the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Eximbank.<p>
<p>
	With a nearly $900 million budget, the Eximbank provides several means of
export finance:<p>
<UL>

<LI><i>	subsidized loans</i> to foreign purchasers of U.S. products;<p>

<LI><i>	loan guarantees</i> to support loans made by private sector banks to
foreign purchasers of U.S. products;<p>

<LI><i>	loans and guarantees of working capital</i> for U.S. producers seeking to
enter export markets;<p>

<LI><i>	subsidized project finance</i>, loans or guarantees by banks to finance
foreign infrastructure projects in developing countries.<p>
</UL>

Despite these programs, the vast majority of U.S. exporters owe none of their
success to Eximbank finance.  Small businesses typically shun Eximbank programs
due to the delays in processing the indeterminable red tape. <p>
<p>
	Some industries do benefit from the Eximbank's programs, most notably the
aviation industry.   In fact, the Eximbank's critics often refer to it as
&#147;Boeing&#146;s Bank.&#148;  The Eximbank is corporate welfare with a fancy
name.  If foreign government purchasers of U.S.-made aircraft are creditworthy,
private sector banks ought to finance the transactions.  A country with
two-thirds of the world&#146;s market share cannot be suffering from market
failure.  <p>
<p>
	The Eximbank is a component of the Clinton administration&#146;s National
Export Strategy (NES), an aggressive foray into industrial policy and central
planning.  It empowers the federal government to target and develop:<p>
<UL>

<LI><i>Big Emerging Markets</i> &#151; Mexico, Argentina, Poland, Brazil,
China, Indonesia, India, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey;<p>

<LI><i>Big Emerging Sectors</i> &#151; aerospace, telecommunications,
information technologies, environmental technology, medical equipment and
infrastructure industries.<p>

</UL>
	Under a new &#147;green&#148; agenda, special consideration must be given to
ecologically-friendly exports &#151; demonstrating that the Eximbank is driven
by political pressures and not sound lending practices. <p>
<p>
	In the final analysis, Eximbank financing does not determine success in the
global marketplace.  Created in 1934 to facilitate trade with the Soviet Union,
the Eximbank is a government agency masquerading as a market-based financial
institution.  Sixty years later, the Eximbank should follow the lead of its
first customers, and go out of business.<p>

<H2>Trade and Environment</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>The U.S. has entered into several international treaties that aim to regulate
or restrict international trade under the guise of environmental protection.
More are on the horizon.  These treaties represent a threat to the global
trading system, and will do little to safeguard the environment.  U.S. imports
and exports are facing a growing array of political controls in the global
economy because of these international treaties:<p>
<UL>
<LI> The <b>Basel Convention </b>establishes burdensome international regulations
and standards for the production, transport, and disposal of
&#147;hazardous&#148; materials. Basel&#146;s wide-ranging definitions
encompass the byproducts of nearly all agricultural and industrial processes.
Trade in &#147;hazardous&#148; products for disposal and recycling purposes is
forbidden between industrialized OECD nations and developing countries
(non-OECD), as well as between signatories and non-signatories.  The U.S. has
signed but not yet ratified the treaty.<p>

<LI>	The <b>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</b> (CITES),
regulates commerce in wildlife and wildlife products, prohibiting trade in
certain categories of endangered and threatened species.  The treaty bans trade
with non-parties, and enables governments to impose trade barriers based on
environmental considerations outside their domestic jurisdiction.  Most
notably, international trade in elephant ivory has been banned under CITES.
The U.S. has imposed trade sanctions on Taiwan to express displeasure over its
failure to prevent trade in endangered wildlife products.<p>

</UL>	
<P>Environmental trade barriers are one of the biggest threats to freer world
trade. The aforementioned environmental treaties were first incorporated into
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The regional trade bloc also
set up a Commission on Environmental Cooperation (CEC) to conduct environmental
investigations, to adjudicate disputes, and to promote environmental
enforcement.  Similarly, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade
Organization (WTO), the international body which enforces global trade rules,
is considering ways to incorporate environmental treaties and trade barriers
through its Committee on Trade and the Environment.  This would be a mistake.<p>
	The &#147;greening&#148; of trade policies is an ominous development in
international affairs. Environmental trade barriers are simply a proxy for
tariffs, allowing governments to protect domestic industries from foreign
competition under the guise of phony environmental concerns. &#147;Green&#148;
protectionism is no less harmful than its economic variant.  The U.S. should
not be a party to international treaties which legitimize environmental trade
barriers.<p>
<i>Q:  Should the U.S. insist that its trading partners adopt equivalent
environmental standards?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  Diverse countries have diverse environmental priorities.  Developing
countries, in particular, do not have sufficient resources to spend on
environmental controls, particularly the costly EPA-style regulations used in
the U.S.  It would be unfair to impose First World standards on Third World
countries.  We should not promote harmonization of international environmental
policies through NAFTA or the GATT/WTO.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Should the U.S. use trade sanctions to impose its environmental
standards on foreign countries.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A: The U.S. has never been elected the world&#146;s environmental policeman.
Trade sanctions and other measures attempt to make enactment of U.S.
government-approved regulations a pre-condition for the right to trade with
American businesses.  The U.S. has tried to compel its trading partners to
enforce U.S.-style environmental policies with regard to resources solely in
their jurisdiction, as when we attempted to force Mexico to adopt our
&#147;dolphin-safe&#148; standard for catching tuna.  Trade embargoes and
restrictions based on &#147;process and production methods&#148; allow the
government to use vague and arbitrary criteria in closing markets from
competition. Environmental sanctions disrupt trade, burden U.S. importers and
exporters unfairly, and damage U.S. international competitiveness.  Trade bans
routinely fail to achieve their goals.  The CITES ban on trade in elephant
ivory, for example, merely destroyed market incentives to conserve elephants.
Closed mark! ets prevent economic growth, wealth creation, and higher incomes,
which are essential for enabling people in the developing world to afford a
cleaner environment.  Perpetuation of Third World poverty is neither an
effective nor ethical means of controlling pollution.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Are international controls needed for trade in hazardous materials and
wastes?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  The Basel Convention is an enemy of business, but no friend of the
environment.  The treaty&#146;s often vague definition of
&#147;hazardous,&#148; heavily influenced by Greenpeace, restricts trade in all
kinds of waste, scrap and recyclable materials.  Any products containing even
trace amounts of metals (e.g. lead, copper, gold) and their related compounds
are adversely affected.  The treaty arbitrarily bans trade for recycling
purposes between OECD and non-OECD countries, meaning that useful materials
which might be recovered abroad must instead be disposed of at home.  Congress
should not ratify this ill-considered treaty by implementing its provisions
into U.S. law.

<H2>TRASHING FREE TRADE<BR>
The Basel Convention's Impact<BR> 
on International Commerce</H2>

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>

</CENTER>


<P>With the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, free trade should be on the rise.  The WTO has been heralded as the mechanism for
a new era in global trade liberalization.   However, new non-tariff trade
barriers are gaining increased acceptance around the world in the form of
multilateral environmental treaties with trade enforcement measures.  The
most significant, the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary
Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, seeks to impose
environmental regulations and outright trade bans.  This treaty is a direct
challenge to the notion of a free and open global market.

	<P>Signed in 1989, the Basel Convention creates a global regulatory regime to control trade in hazardous wastes.  It also obligates governments to manage waste transportation and disposal.  It has three primary objectives:
<OL>
 <P><LI> 	Reduce transboundary movements of hazardous wastes to a minimum; 

<P><LI> 	Ensure that hazardous wastes should be treated and disposed of as close
as possible to their source of generation; 

<P><LI> 	Minimize hazardous waste generation at source. 
</OL>

<P>	International negotiators first designed  a "soft" law framework of general commitments, with "hard" law instruments to be negotiated and approved later through Conferences of the Parties (COP).  The first COP decided to prohibit
exports of hazardous wastes from industrialized nations for final disposal
in developing countries.  The second COP decided to ban, by 1998, all
exports of hazardous materials for recycling purposes from members of  the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to non-OECD
countries. The third COP moved to amend the Convention to make the ban on
waste exports formally binding.

	<P>The power to declare a material hazardous can have enormous implications
for the world economy.  The criteria are so broad that trade in the
by-products of nearly all agricultural and industrial processes is
potentially affected.  A ban on exports of many recycling materials from
rich to poor nations would needlessly terminate a  $50 billion trading
relationship which is a vital industrial source of secondary raw materials
and energy for developing countries such as South Korea, Indonesia, China,
Malaysia, Thailand, and India.

	<P>International trade itself is not a cause of environmental degradation.
Illegal dumping of waste is most often a problem in countries where there is little private property, and unresponsive or corrupt government
bureaucracies. Global hazardous waste regulation does nothing to change such root causes of environmental degradation. International trade controls cut
off developing countries from international markets for important materials
supplies, reducing economic opportunities.  Yet economic growth is essential for the creation of wealth, which provides the resources necessary for
environmental protection.

	<P>The relationship between the Basel Convention and international trade rules
is controversial and has not yet been settled.  While the North American
Free Trade Agreement incorporates Basel trade restrictions, the WTO does
not.  Environmental groups and some industrialized nations want to allow
multilateral environmental agreements to override basic WTO obligations.
The Committee on Trade and the Environment (CTE), convened by the WTO to
consider the relationship between multilateral fair trade rules and
environmental restrictions, will present its findings to the December 1996
Ministerial Conference in Singapore.

	<P>Many developing countries sense that the intent of proposals at the CTE is to erode their comparative advantages in international trade.  Members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), in particular, have
lashed out at industrialized nations for stacking the WTO summit agenda with
non-tariff issues.  Developing countries are coming to the realization that
the environmental demands of the industrialized nations are new forms of
protectionism designed to close markets.  As a result, there may be little
progress on this issue at the Singapore summit.

	<P>The U.S. should refrain from further active participation in the Basel
Convention.  Though efforts to "green" the WTO are not going far, neither
does the WTO appear anxious to strike down a Convention whose core
principles are antithetical to the philosophy of free trade and
nondiscrimination.  The U.S. should reject even the possibility of global
trade regulation and an export ban.  What Greenpeace and like-minded NGOs
envision is a regime of global environmental standards for trade.  This
entails a blending of two incompatible concepts, free trade and government
controls.  Countries which desire competitive international trade,
particularly developing countries, must stand firm against the green trade
restrictions embodied in the Basel Convention.

In a spasm of inaccuracy, a textbook writer once enthused that antitrust law is the "Magna Carta of free enterprise."  A more accurate label for
antitrust is "enemy of entrepreneurship."  Antitrust is too often the
playground for hyperactive and economically illiterate bureaucrats.
Consider the recent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) accusation that some of
Toys R Us' business practices keep toy prices too high.  The main practice
under attack is Toys R Us’ request that toy makers stop selling popular toys through discounters such as warehouse clubs.  Toys R Us will not distribute
some toys of manufacturers who refuse Toys R Us' request.  The FTC alleges
that because Toys R Us is the nation's largest toy retailer -- with about 25
percent of the retail toy market -- toy makers have no real option but to
agree to Toys R Us' request.  With discounters out of the picture, the FTC
concludes, Toys R Us keeps toy prices monopolistically high.
The FTC’s reasoning is childishly inept.  In fact, Toys R Us' behavior is
highly competitive and benefits consumers.

<P>Toys R Us has no monopoly power.  Retailing is among the most competitive of industries. Toys R Us daily confronts competition from other toy retailers such as Kay-Bee Toys, from general retailers such as Wal-Mart, and from
catalog sellers.  If Toys R Us would ever be so foolish to try to behave as
a monopolist, it would rapidly find toy makers and consumers switching from
Toys R Us to other retailers.

<P>Toys R Us is the nation's largest toy retailer not because it is a
monopolist, but because it efficiently provides consumers and toy makers
with valuable services.  Indeed, it is Toys R Us' provision of these
services that has gotten it into trouble with the FTC.

<P>Toys R Us regularly makes two heavy investments that help toy makers and
consumers.  The first investment is advertising.  Advertising informs
consumers of product availabilities and prices.  As consumer demands for
specific toys increase in response to this advertising, toy makers benefit
from greater sales.

<P>The second investment is in inventory.  Toys R Us stocks a full line of toys
year round.  Consumers know that they can walk into any of its 900 stores
worldwide and probably find just the toys they want.  But stocking a full
inventory line is costly given that many toys never sell as well as hoped.
Still, carrying a full line of toys helps Toys R Us over the long run
because consumers value the convenience of having a reliable full-line
retailer nearby.  Also, toy makers prize the willingness of a retailer
standing ready year round to carry as-yet-unproven new toys.  Toys R Us
advertises and carries an extensive inventory only because it expects to
recoup in the price of successful toys the costs it incurs promoting toys
that flop.

<P>Toys R Us' rivals, however, steal these investments.  Although not as
obvious as purse snatching, such theft is no less real.

<P>During the holiday season, toy discounters begin stocking those toys -- and only those toys -- that are proven hits with consumers.  But these
discounters do little product promotion.  Consumers learn about toys through Toys R Us advertising and by inspecting the toys in Toys R Us stores.  Many
consumers then buy the toys from discounters who can charge low prices only
because they steal Toys R Us' promotional investments.

<P>To protect its investments, Toys R Us requests that toy makers not
distribute their most popular toys through discounters.  Toy makers agree to stop such distribution because these manufacturers know that if they refuse
Toys R Us' request, Toys R Us will cut its advertising efforts and stop
carrying a full inventory.  And Toys R Us will do so not because it is a
savage monopolist -- it is no such thing -- but because it cannot afford to
pay for product promotions that benefit its competitors.

<P>If Toys R Us’ actions raised prices without at the same time providing
valuable services to consumers, not only would consumers suffer -- toy makers would also be harmed.  After all, monopoly prices charged at the retail level result in fewer goods sold at retail.  Monopoly retailers thus buy
fewer goods from manufacturers.  Toy makers would resist any monopolizing
demands issued by Toys R Us.  If Toys R Us stubbornly refused to change its
demands, toy makers would see to it that any number of the nation's other
retailers would displace Toys R Us as the leading toy retailer.  But toy
makers cooperate with Toys R Us -- indicating that Toys R Us is not behaving
monopolistically.

<P>Outside of the FTC's New Deal era headquarters are two statues showing a
determined man restraining a wild-eyed, muscular horse.  The idea is that
unless bureaucrats bridle commerce, it will trample citizens underfoot.
Experience shows, however, that it is the bureaucrats who most need restraining.

<TITLE>CEI: Free Microsoft</TITLE>

<H1>Free Microsoft
</H1>
by Clyde Wayne Crews, Jr.
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<p>
	Big ol&#146; Microsoft evokes strong emotions these days.  But even hating
Microsoft does not justify calling upon government to restrain it, as many
competitors and others are urging the U.S. Justice Department to do.  Hobbling
Microsoft will also hobble computer users.  Indeed, more than anything, the
Microsoft saga helps demonstrate how the real function of antitrust law is not
to help consumers, but to benefit competitors.<p>
	Earlier this year, the federal government secured a consent decree regarding
Microsoft&#146;s licensing of its DOS and Windows operating systems.  Under the
agreement Microsoft will no longer earn royalties from manufacturers on a
per-processor basis for each computer shipped.  Competitors argued that the old
arrangement precluded shipment of alternative operating systems, such as
IBM&#146;s OS/2, because manufacturers had to pay Microsoft for each machine,
regardless of whether it featured Windows.  Yet the per-processor royalties
simply amounted to a volume discount to computer manufacturers that helped
computers proliferate.  Ending it will hurt consumers.<p>
	The Justice Department also pressured Microsoft to forego a merger with
Intuit, the maker of the popular financial software Quicken and, more recently,
caused the entire computer industry to hold its breath wondering whether
Microsoft would be prevented from offering Internet access services as part of
Windows 95.  While the offering was not halted, the Department has yet to
assure Microsoft that the ordeal is over.<p>
	Preventing Microsoft from offering online access service would have hurt
consumers even more.  Consider: tens of millions of people use Windows 3.1, but
only 4.7 million subscribe to existing Internet access services like America
Online and CompuServe, a surprisingly low number.  <p>
	By easing Internet access for those familiar with Windows, Microsoft may
introduce the Internet to millions.  That&#146;s an argument in favor of the
company&#146;s moving ahead.  In fact, while the phrase has become too much of
a cliche, Microsoft in particular is helping provide perhaps the largest
&#147;on-ramp to the information superhighway,&#148; precisely what many &#151;
including the administration now targeting the company &#151; have been calling
for.<p>
	Real monopolies, unlike Microsoft, are created and sustained by governmental
barriers to entry, like licensing and the barring of competitors.  Examples are
the Postal Service and the tight monopoly that lawyers hold over even routine
services such as wills, bankruptcies, and divorces.  Where there&#146;s
monopoly, there are no alternatives.<p>
	Yet rival operating systems include Apple&#146;s OS, IBM&#146;s OS/2, and
others.  Users may switch to these competitors anytime.  Big businesses
especially, who would have the most to gain by switching to a more efficient
operating system, could lead the way if the gains were actually there.<p>
	One notable effort to shake Microsoft&#146;s dominance is that of Apple, IBM,
and Motorola, who&#146;ve joined forces to create a common hardware platform to
support a processor called the PowerPC.  PowerPCs would compete with the
Pentium &#147;brain&#148; that underlies Windows.<p>

<p>
	Why should Microsoft worry?  Future PowerPC-based machines will run software
developed for many different operating systems &#151; meaning using Windows
will not preclude using its competitors.  If any competing offering is
superior, it&#146;ll be a simple matter to shift environments, on the same
computer.<p>
	This, not running to Washington, is the proper way to compete with Microsoft.
<p>
	There are still more competitive threats, even if the Justice Department
leaves Microsoft well enough alone.  Some argue that desktop operating systems
themselves will be overshadowed by network-based operating systems to be had at
the press of a few buttons.  Instead of relying upon machine-based operating
systems and applications software, Internet-based versions will spread.<p>
	Such innovations put Microsoft&#146;s purported dominance in a new, more
vulnerable, perspective.  Early choice of the Windows standard can&#146;t suck
users in if it is inefficient.  Should Windows remain the &#147;standard,&#148;
it will do so because customers like it, not because there aren&#146;t
alternatives.  In this light, antitrust action appears either naive on the part
of enforcers, or worse, a blatant attempt by competitors to capture Microsoft
customers.<p>
	Microsoft phobia is one symptom of a broader effort by trustbusters to target
what they consider to be inefficiencies in networks (such as telephone
networks).  Generally, a &#147;network&#148; is any system in which benefits
increase with membership.  According to the theory, the market fails if people
join an inferior network simply because others did earlier.  While the
theoretical questions are amusing, they have no real world significance as
competitive threats to Microsoft illustrate.  Inefficiencies create profit
opportunities.<p>
	Like all central planners, enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal
Trade Commission regard their ideas as superior to an evolving marketplace,
superior enough to warrant imposing by law.  Before others are harassed like
Microsoft, Congress should conduct hearings designed to reexamine antitrust,
with a critical eye toward the notion that it benefits consumers.<p>

<H2>How the Market Self-Polices Against Predatory Pricing</H2>
by Donald J. Boudreaux & Andrew N. Kleit

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>Courts today are more skeptical than in the past of predatory-pricing
allegations.  This skepticism grows largely from economic research showing
that predatory pricing is unlikely to result in a monopoly because rivals of predators have both incentive and ability to withstand the predatory
onslaught.  Moreover, customers and suppliers of predatory pricers also
often have incentive and ability to thwart predatory efforts.  However, the
incentives and strategies available to customers and suppliers have thus far
escaped systematic investigation.

<P>        While some of these 'private policing' strategies are lawful, one of
the perverse consequences of antitrust law is to make many of these
strategies unlawful.  Minimum resale price maintenance, maximum resale price
maintenance, and price discrimination are only some of the means that would
be open to suppliers to police against predation if such practices did not
run afoul of antitrust law.  Antitrust prohibitions thus increase the costs
to private firms of protecting themselves from monopoly.

<P>        Once the incentives customers and suppliers have to prevent monopoly
are more fully taken into account, predatory pricing is recognized as even
less likely than when only rivals' reactions to below-cost prices are
considered.  Appreciation of the role of customers and suppliers in the
competitive process makes clear the senselessness of several recent
antitrust suits  --  such as the federal government's <A HREF="/microsft.html">suit against Microsoft</A>,
and the suit filed by independent booksellers against book publishers.

<H1>Wal-Mart  --  Predator or Prey?</H1>
by <A HREF="#bio">Donald J. Boudreaux and Andrew N. Kleit</A>, June 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>In 1991, three retail pharmacies in Faulkner County, Arkansas, sued
Wal-Mart for selling pharmaceutical items at predatorily low prices.  The
plaintiffs claimed that Wal-Mart's below-cost pricing of some
pharmaceuticals threatened to create for Wal-Mart a monopoly in
pharmaceutical retailing in Faulkner County.  
     
<P>The plaintiffs' story is a familiar one to students of antitrust law: by
pricing below cost, a "predator" (in this case Wal-Mart) forces the prices
charged by its rivals down below costs.  The losses thereby inflicted on
rivals drive them into bankruptcy, leaving the predator as the market's sole supplier.  With rivals gone, the predator will raise prices to
monopolistically high levels.  To avoid this undesirable outcome in the
future, the law must command the predator to stop charging dangerously low
prices today.  Only through the diligent policing of courts and antitrust
agencies against such predatory tactics can consumers be saved from the
extortions of monopolists.
     
<P>Is this concern about "predatory pricing" warranted?  No.  Put simply,
"Predation doesn't pay." Even if a predator manages to run existing rivals
out of business, new entrants will emerge once the predator starts trying to recoup its price-war losses by charging monopoly prices.  This new
competition keeps the predator from recouping the losses it necessarily
incurred by pricing below cost during the predation period; hence, the
threat of new entry is generally sufficient to keep firms from predatorily
pricing in the first place.  Empirical and theoretical work confirm this
conclusion.  Moreover, even if rivals are unable to squelch
predatory-pricing schemes, suppliers or customers of predators will often
take effective steps to prevent predation from succeeding.
    
<P> But no predator is likely to get even this far.  In fact, predatory pricing
is an exceedingly poor way to run rivals out of business.  Not only does a
predatory-pricing firm incur large losses today as a result of below-cost
sales, but its losses are necessarily larger than those of its rivals.
Rivals, after all, can reduce the amounts they sell below cost while the
predator must  --  to hurt rivals by taking away their customers  --  expand
output during the price war.  Predatory pricing hurts the predator more than
the prey.  This indisputable fact led Robert Bork to advise that "the best
method of predation is to convince your rival that you are a likely victim
and lure him into a ruthless price-cutting attack."
   
<P>  The Wal-Mart example demonstrates how the market can self-police against
monopolization.  We begin this example by initially making the extreme
assumption that Wal-Mart has already monopolized retail pharmacy sales.
Consumers, obviously, would suffer.  But so, too, would pharmaceutical
suppliers.  Because monopolist Wal-Mart would raise retail prices to
monopoly levels, fewer pharmaceuticals would be sold at retail than would be
sold if retailing were competitive.  Consequently, wholesale demand for
pharmaceuticals would be lower than otherwise.  This reduced demand snatches
money directly out of the pockets of pharmaceutical suppliers.  Surely these
suppliers will not sit by idly as Wal-Mart's monopoly eats into their profits.
  
<P>   How might Wal-Mart's suppliers undermine Wal-Mart's monopoly?  Several
strategies are available.  Pharmaceutical suppliers can enter the retail
pharmacy trade and compete head to head with Wal-Mart, either by opening
their own new retail establishments, by purchasing existing retailers, or by
retailing pharmaceutical items directly to consumers through catalogues or
the internet.  Similarly, these suppliers can finance the entry of other
retail pharmacies into Wal-Mart's territory. Either way, in the face of new
entry, Wal-Mart would have no choice but to lower its retail prices to
competitive levels.
  
<P>   Some suppliers  --  those who enjoy some monopoly power (say, because of a
patent or because of well-developed brand-name recognition)  --  also can force
Wal-Mart to behave competitively by imposing sales quotas on Wal-Mart.  If a
supplier is the exclusive producer of a pharmaceutical item crucial to
Wal-Mart's retail pharmacy business  --  for instance, a patented drug that all
self-respecting, full-service pharmacies carry  --  this supplier may be able
to contractually insist that Wal-Mart sell some minimum number of units of
the item every month.  The supplier can set this minimum number at the
competitive level.  To sell this competitive quantity, Wal-Mart will have to
lower the price it charges for this item down to what the price would be if
Wal-Mart confronted competitors.  Failure of Wal-Mart to meet its sales
quota allows the supplier to stop supplying Wal-Mart.  If the supplier's
product is critical enough to Wal-Mart's retail success, and if this product
is unavailable from other suppliers, Wal-Mart has incentive to meet the sales.
 
<P>    To ask how suppliers might undermine an existing monopoly, however, is to
overlook the most important avenues open to suppliers to keep the retail
pharmacy market competitive.  Wal-Mart's suppliers have an interest in
stopping the monopoly before it materializes.
   
<P>  Suppose, for example, that the Merck pharmaceutical company suspects that
Wal-Mart's low retail prices will eventually generate a Wal-Mart monopoly in
the retail pharmacy market.  Merck can refuse to deal with Wal-Mart as long
as Wal-Mart charges prices that Merck feels are too low. Because Wal-Mart
does not yet have a monopoly, Merck suffers no significant loss of sales by
refusing to distribute through Wal-Mart: Merck will increase the amount of
pharmaceuticals it distributes through Wal-Mart's rival pharmacies.
Wal-Mart's rivals are helped  --  they now have more business  --  while Wal-Mart
suffers from the loss of Merck supplies.  Wal-Mart's ability to predatorily
price rivals out of business is curtailed.
  
<P>   Merck can avoid retail monopolization also by helping to finance the
efforts of Wal-Mart's rivals to survive a predatory-price war.  By lending
monies or guaranteeing bank loans to beleaguered retail pharmacies, Merck
diminishes Wal-Mart's prospects for successful monopolization.  As Robert
Bork points out, the prey "would merely have to show the predator his new
line of credit to dissuade the predator from attacking." A retail pharmacy
that shows Wal-Mart a contract pledging monies from Merck (or from some
other sound lender) will deflate Wal-Mart's enthusiasm for continuing a
predatory price war.  After all, if even one of Wal-Mart's rivals has the
financial wherewithal to successfully fight a predatory-price war with
Wal-Mart, Wal-Mart will never monopolize its market.
   
<P>  At the very least, if Wal-Mart were really a threat to monopolize
pharmaceutical retailing, Merck and other Wal-Mart suppliers have incentives
under existing antitrust laws to assist in legal actions against Wal-Mart.
Merck could support a predatory-pricing suit filed by another private party
or by the government by offering to testify about the monopolizing dangers
of Wal-Mart's pricing policy, and, perhaps, by giving evidence that prices
charged by Wal-Mart are below the wholesale prices Merck charges Wal-Mart.  
 <P>    But in the actual suit against Wal-Mart, the trial record contains no
indication that any pharmaceutical supplier uttered a word of complaint
against Wal-Mart's pricing practices.  No pharmaceutical supplier even
bothered to submit an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs' case against
Wal-Mart.  Dogs that should have barked, if Wal-Mart's actions presaged
monopoly, remained tellingly silent.  
  
<P>   Although it is impossible to say for certain why no supplier of Wal-Mart
assisted in the preparation and prosecution of the plaintiffs' case, the
silence of suppliers at least suggests that suppliers did not believe that
Wal-Mart's pricing practices threatened monopolization.
   
<P>  The general lesson is that markets themselves contain incentives and
opportunities for firms to police against monopolization. Indeed, such
opportunities would be greater were it not 
for existing antitrust laws.  Consumers can rely much more confidently upon
policing by market participants than upon policing by courts and
administrative agencies.  Firms have every incentive to accurately assess
the likely future consequences of actions taken by their buyers and suppliers.  
   
<P>  On the other hand, courts and enforcement bureaucracies have no such
incentives and no special skills that allow them to determine when price
cuts will and will not likely lead to monopolies.  Although rivals of
price-cutting firms have incentives to accurately assess the consequences of
price cuts, rivals also have every incentive to misrepresent those
consequences. Eliminating the ability of rivals to use antitrust law as a
means of stifling competition will force them to compete in ways that
promote consumer well-being: cutting prices, improving efficiency, and
enhancing product quality.
  
<P>   A final note, the Arkansas Supreme Court overturned a trial-court ruling in
which Wal-Mart was found to have priced predatorily. In reversing the trial
court, Arkansas's high court found that Wal-Mart's admittedly low
pharmaceutical prices were competitive rather than predatory.  Nevertheless,
Wal-Mart's victory was narrow: The high court ruled in Wal-Mart's favor by 4
to 3.

<H2>Chapter 5: The Causes and Prevention of Cancer</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>

<P>The idea that there is an epidemic of human cancer caused by synthetic
industrial chemicals is false.<p>
<p>
If lung cancer (which is primarily due to smoking) is excluded, cancer death
rates are decreasing in the United States for all other cancers combined.  In
addition, there is a steady rise in life expectancy in the developed
countries.<p>
<p>
Pollution appears to account for less than 1 percent of human cancer, yet
public concern and resource allocation for chemical pollution are very high, in
good part because of the use of animal cancer tests in cancer risk
assessment.<p>
<p>
About half of the chemicals tested, whether synthetic or natural, are
carcinogenic to rodents at the high doses tested in rodents.<p>
<p>
Linear extrapolation from near-toxic doses in rodents to low-level exposure in
humans has led to grossly exaggerated mortality forecasts.  Such extrapolations
cannot be verified by epidemiology.  Furthermore, relying on such
extrapolations for synthetic chemicals while ignoring the enormous natural
background leads to an imbalanced perception of hazard and allocation of
resources.<p>
<p>
Zero exposure to rodent carcinogens cannot be achieved.  Low levels of rodent
carcinogens of natural origin are ubiquitous in the environment. It is thus
impossible to obtain conditions totally free of exposure to rodent carcinogens
or to background radiation.<p>
<p>
Risks  compete with risks:  society must distinguish between significant and
trivial risks.  Regulating trivial risks or exposure to substances erroneously
inferred to cause cancer at low doses can harm health by diverting resources
from programs that could be effective in protecting the health of the public.<p>
<p>
Epidemiological evidence in humans is sufficient to identify several broad
categories of cancer causation for which the evidence is strong and plausible.
Since many of these are avoidable, it is possible to reduce incidence rates of
many types of cancer.<p>
<p>
Tobacco is the most important global cause of cancer and is preventable.
Smoking contributes to about one-third of U.S. cancer, about one-quarter of
U.S. heart disease, and about 400,000 premature deaths per year in the United
States.<p>
<p>
The quarter of the population with the lowest dietary intake of fruits and
vegetables compared to the quarter with the highest intake has roughly twice
the cancer rate for most types of cancer (lung, larynx, oral cavity, esophagus,
stomach, colon and rectum, bladder, pancreas, cervix, and ovary).<p>
<p>
Decreases in physical activity and increases in smoking, obesity, and
recreational sun exposure have contributed importantly to increases in some
cancers in the modern industrial world, whereas improvements in hygiene have
reduced other cancers related to infection.<p>
<p>
Chronic infections contribute to about one-third of the world&#146;s cancer.<p>

<H1>The Mismeasure of Man</H1>
by <a href="#bio">by Michelle Malkin & Michael Fumento</A>, April 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>The environmentalist assault on chlorine has taken a recent turn.  Organochlorines, we are now told, not only cause cancer, they are capable of altering human and animal sexuality as well.   For instance, environmentalists blame organochlorines such as dioxin for altering the sexual characteristics of fish.  Other compounds are blamed for (no joke) creating lesbian sea gulls, and shrinking alligators' penises.
<P>
	Perhaps the most potent weapon in the anti-chlorine activists' arsenal has been the charge of falling sperm counts.  The alarm over chemically-induced male infertility was prompted by a 1992 study from Copenhagen that claimed to show that sperm concentration per unit volume had fallen by over 40 per cent from 1940 to 1990.  A year later, one of the authors of the study, Niels Skakkebaek, penned a follow-up piece with Richard Sharpe of the British Medical Research Council Reproductive Biology Unit in Edinburgh, Scotland, in the journal <I>Lancet</I>.  The duo speculated that fetal exposure to synthetic estrogens may be the prime suspect in the sperm count crisis.
<P>
	Unsurprisingly, the <I>Lancet</I> article prompted a barrage of alarmist media reports. The BBC aired a documentary entitled "The Assault on the Male;" here in the U.S., Connie Chung devoted an installment of her now-defunct investigative show, "Eye to Eye," to the plight of infertile men under chemical siege. As scientists have noted, however, the original study -- a  meta-analysis  of 61 studies on falling sperm counts -- suffered from numerous statistical and methodological shortcomings. 
<P>
	First, the Danish researchers included studies irrespective of their sample size, many of which were so small that they would not normally be considered admissible evidence. In an editorial for the <I>British Medical Journal</I>, Stephen Farrow of Middlesex University's Health Research Center noted that one study was of seven men; 11 others were of fewer than 20 men; and another 29 were of fewer than 50 men. These were  given greater weight than they deserved,  Farrow wrote, through the misapplication of statistical tests. 
<P>
	After investigating the Skakkebaek data, a different team of researchers showed that nearly all of the alleged decreases could be explained by the changing definition of a normal sperm count over the past 50 years.  They concluded in a study also published by the <I>BMJ</I> that "The original evidence does not support the hypothesis that the sperm count declined significantly between 1940 and 1990."
<P>
	Furthermore, critics who reanalyzed the data have challenged the timing of the decline reported.  As reproductive specialists Anna Brake and Walter Krause of Philipps University in Marburg, Germany explained in a letter to the <I>BMJ</I>, 48 of the studies used in the meta-analysis were published since 1970 -- accounting for 88 percent of the men studied. These studies actually showed a slight <I>increase</I> in sperm counts. Krause and Brake concluded that "care should be taken when discussing a causal relation with environmental factors."
<P>
	The plea for caution fell upon deaf ears at Greenpeace headquarters.  Seizing on the Skakkebaek findings, the environmental group launched a new advertising campaign that publicized the alleged environmental threat to man’s virility.  "You’re not half the man your father was," the ads taunted.   
<P>
	The Skakkebaek findings have also been touted by the authors of <I>Our Stolen Future</I>, the self-described "sequel" to Rachel Carson's <I>Silent Spring</I>.  This book warns of "reports that human sperm counts have plummeted over the past half century, a blink of the eye in the history of the human species."  Researchers that are skeptical of the sperm count decline are compared to those who challenged the initial scientific findings linking chloro-flourocarbons to depletion of the ozone layer.
<P>
	Skepticim is warranted, Greenpeace and <I>Our Stolen Future</I> notwithstanding.  Responsible scientists have assailed environmentalists for exploiting the data.  As one set of outraged researchers argued, "there is no conclusive evidence" for blaming exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the environment for falling sperm counts or shrinking penises. The hypothesis "is based on evidence too limited to allow firm conclusions to be drawn.  It is premature to call for a ban on these or any other chemicals before more research is done.  They are misrepresenting this research.  They are taking something which is a clearly stated hypothetical link and calling it fact." The identity of these critics?  None other than Neils Skakkebaek and Richard Sharpe, whose research prompted the sperm scare in the first place.
<P>
	There is certainly evidence that some chemical compounds -- both natural and manmade -- are capable of impacting human and animal reproductive systems.  In theory, this could impact human fertility.  To date, however, the scientific evidence does not support such a claim.  The charge that synthetic compounds are sterilizing men, like so many of the charges leveled by environmental activists over the years, simply does not hold up to scrutiny.

</CENTER>

<P><BR>
For millions of years plants have been quietly producing chemicals.  Through
countless generations they have been perfecting a potpourri of chemicals, some
benign some deadly.  As the ability to detect, isolate, measure and test
chemicals found in nature has progressed a starling fact has emerged: hundreds
of plants appear to produce endocrine disrupters.<p>
<p>
	Many of the plants that produce phytoestrogens and other endocrine disrupters
are edible.  In laboratory test more than 43 plants and foods found in the
human diet have been shown to be estrogenically active.  Many phytoestrogen
containing plants are common elements of our diet.  Such grains as corn and
wheat form a significant part of the human diet.  Many legumes have also shown
a surprising capacity for phytoestrogen production. <p>
<p>
	Although much more work has been done on phytoestrogens, some work has been
done on plant chemicals which are known to effect the production of sperm.
Only a handful have been discovered in the human diet.  Of these the most
common is cottonseed oil.  Although cottonseed oil is rarely sold as a
vegetable oil, it is commonly used in manufactured snack foods.<p>
	<p>
	A great deal of attention has recently been given to the fact that synthetic
chemicals have exhibited estrogenic effects in laboratory studies.  The
chemicals most prominently cited are PCBs and DDT, both of which have been
banned in the United States.  Compared with phytoestrogens, the concern over
synthetic estrogens may be somewhat overstated.  The estrogenic effects from
the phytoestrogens in our diet are an estimated 40 million times greater than
those from synthetic chemicals.  To date, however, there is no concrete
evidence that either pose a risk to human health.<P>

<H2>Pesticides</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Since the publication of Rachel Carson&#146;s <i>Silent Spring</i>, the use of
pesticides has been deplored by environmentalists.  Exaggerated fears have
produced policies that unnecessarily limit the use of pesticides.  U.S.
pesticide laws need to be reformed, not to be made more stringent, but to
account more accurately for both the risks of pesticides as well as the risks
of doing without them.<p>
	The centerpiece of pesticide regulation is the so-called Delaney Clause.  It
is also the most controversial.  Enacted in 1958, the Delaney Clause prohibits
residues of <i>any</i> pesticide or food additive in processed food that may
have caused cancer in rodent lab tests.  As a result, the Delaney Clause bars
the use of pesticides for many food products in cases where there is no
identifiable risk to human health.  There is a wide consensus within the
scientific community that the Delaney Clause imposes an unreasonable standard.
This view is shared by Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency.  The central problem with the Delaney Clause is that its
standard has no relation to actual hazards to human health.  For this reason,
many scientists recommend replacing the Delaney Clause standard with a
negligible or &#147;de minimus&#148; risk standard.<p>
	Another problem with current pesticide regulation is the bias toward older,
less-effective, and potentially more dangerous pesticides.  New pesticides must
be submitted to an expensive registration process that can cost as much as $50
million and take eight to ten years.  This discourages companies from
developing newer, more efficient and safer pesticides to replace existing
pesticides that are already registered.  The current registration process
should be streamlined so that society can take advantage of these benefits.<p>
	It is important to remember that pesticides are used for a reason.  They
reduce the loss of agricultural products to weeds and insects and increase
agricultural productivity.  Because of pesticides, America has a far more
abundant food supply and lower prices for food products.  Eliminating the use
of chemical pesticides would dramatically reduce crop yields.  It is estimated
that corn production alone would decline by a third if synthetic pesticide use
were eliminated.  For most applications, there are simply not available
alternatives to the use of chemical pesticides in farming.  Thus, reducing
pesticide use could actually harm public health by reducing the availability of
fruits and vegetables.  The risks of an unbalanced diet are greater than the
risks of pesticide residues on food.<p>
	Pesticides are not only responsible for a more abundant food supply.
Pesticides can play an important role in environmental protection as well.  For
one, by increasing agricultural productivity, pesticides make it possible to
devote less land to farming, leaving more land for other uses.  In developing
countries this means less pressure to clear forests and destroy wildlife
habitat to create farmland.  Soil erosion is a serious environmental concern.
Innovations such as no-till farming, which relies upon the use of pesticides,
can greatly reduce the extent of soil erosion.  If the use of pesticides were
eliminated, so too would the environmental benefits of practices like no-till
farming.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Would reducing the use of pesticides lead to a safer food supply?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  No.  Scientists clearly believe that miniscule pesticide residues on food
pose no real health risk to human beings.  However, if reducing the use of
pesticides led to a decreased availability of many fruits and vegetables, it
could actually lead to a <i>less safe</i> food supply.  Scientists like Dr.
Bruce Ames of the University of California at Berkeley make it clear that
people are at greater risk from not eating fruits and vegetables as part of a
balanced diet than they are from eating foods with negligible pesticide
residues on them.  In 1996, the National Academy of Sciences confirmed this
conclusion.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Some groups say that children are at the greatest risk from pesticides
on fruits and vegetables.  What should be done about this?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A: No one wants to place America&#146;s children at risk.  That is precisely
why the federal government should not try to eliminate the use of pesticides.
Children&#146;s health is dependent on many things, not the least of which is a
healthy and balanced diet.  Forced reductions in the use of pesticides would
mean a reduction in agricultural productivity and higher food prices.  Some
products, such as commercial apples, could not be grown without the use of
pesticides.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Don&#146;t many pesticides cause cancer in lab animals?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  Yes, but so do all sorts of natural compounds.  Where scientists once
thought that testing chemicals on rats was a good way to determine whether
those chemicals could cause cancer in humans, scientists now recognize that rat
tests are flawed.  Feeding large doses of chemicals to rats until they die is
no way to identify risks to human beings.  If it were, we would all be at risk
of getting cancer from eating celery, peanut butter and mushrooms, as well as
drinking coffee.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  What is wrong with organic farming?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  Nothing is &#147;wrong&#148; with organic farming, just as nothing is
necessarily &#147;right&#148; with it either.  Consumers who prefer to purchase
organic foods should have the freedom to do so.  But those consumers who find
that organic products are more expensive or less appealing should also have the
option of purchasing non-organic foods.  The extent to which organic farming is
used should be determined by the marketplace, not be government policy.

<H1>Rachel Was Wrong</H1>
by <A HREF="/staff/tolman.html">Jonathan Tolman</A>, March 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>Rachel Carson's <i>Silent Spring</i> ushered in an era of national concern
over the potential effects of synthetic chemicals.  Published in 1962,
Carson's book suggested that the human use of synthetic chemicals amounted
to a "relentless war on life" and that modern society was
"losing the right to be called civilized." Americans experienced
widespread angst over the potential carcinogenic effects of chemicals over the
subsequent decades. As it turns out, Rachel Carson was wrong.<p>
	Last month, the National Research Council, the research arm of the National
Academy of Sciences, released a report on carcinogens in the human diet. Over
thirty years after <i>Silent Spring's</i> publication, a wealth of
scientific evidence suggests that many of the concerns Carson raised were
unfounded.<p>
	Plants have evolved numerous chemicals that serve as defensive agents against
predators. Some kill predators outright, others act as deterrents in some
fashion.  Many of these substances can be considered natural pesticides, and
are quite common.  These chemicals are likely present in our diet in amounts
exceeding the residues of synthetic pesticides.  <p>
	Nearly a decade ago Bruce Ames, of the University of California at Berkeley,
began to point out that many naturally occurring chemicals tested positive for
carcinogenicity in lab tests on rodents.  In fact, the percentage of
naturally-occurring chemicals identified as "carcinogenic" in rodent
bioassays does not differ significantly from that of synthetic chemicals. This
led Ames to the conclusion that insofar as there was a cancer risk in the human
diet, it was more likely the result of naturally-occurring chemicals than
synthetics.  There are after all, many more naturally occurring chemicals than
synthetic.  More importantly, Ames posited that the cancer threat posed by food
was likely small to nonexistent.  The NAS report confirmed the Ames thesis.<p>
	The NAS study concluded that based upon existing exposure data, the great
majority of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals in the diet appear to
be present at levels below which any significant adverse biological effect is
likely.  So low, in fact, that they are unlikely to pose any appreciable cancer
risk whatsoever.<p>
	The study also concluded that natural components of the diet may prove to be
of greater concern than synthetic components with respect to cancer risk.  Synthetic chemicals account for a
tiny fraction of the daily dietary intake of substances that have been labeled
carcinogens in lab tests.  Because of the greater abundance of
naturally-occurring substances in the diet, the total exposure to
naturally-occurring carcinogens far exceeds the exposure to synthetic
carcinogens.<p>
	Another finding of the NAS study was that the basic mechanisms involved in the
entire process of cancer -- from exposure of the organism to expression of
tumors -- are similar, if not identical for synthetic and naturally
occurring carcinogens.  The NAS study concluded that there was no notable
difference between synthetic and naturally occurring carcinogens.  The argument
made by many environmentalists that the human body has evolutionary defenses
against natural carcinogens, but not against synthetic ones, does not hold
water.<p>
	Despite the strong scientific consensus that underlies the NAS report, many 
environmentalists (who have made their careers opposing the trace levels of
pesticides on foods) still can't seem to believe it.  Al Meyerhoff, senior
attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council told the <i>New York
Times</i> that despite the report, synthetic chemicals "can still cause 
thousands of cancers in consumers, and they should be avoided whenever
possible."  Psychologists usually refer to this as denial.<p>
	The NAS study reviewed the issue of how many cancers might be caused by
carcinogens in the diet.  In citing one study the authors acknowledged that
"except for alcohol, the known dietary carcinogens could not account for
more than a few hundred cancer cases." This amounts to less than 0.01
percent -- one ten-thousandth -- of all cancers. What actually does
cause cancer, if not pesticide residues and other chemicals, is not earth
shattering news.  Smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and over eating were
listed as the biggest contributors to an increased cancer risk.<p>
	But just when you thought it was safe to go back into the supermarket,
environmentalists have created another environmental affliction.  Using cancer
as a scare tactic appears to be waning, so environmentalists have latched onto
a new cause celebr&eacute; -- endocrine disrupters.<p>
	The new theory is that certain synthetic chemicals, such as DDT, PCBs, various
organochlorines and other synthetic chemicals,  mimic estrogen or other
hormones and can interfere in human development and reproduction.  Among the
charges made is that these chemicals are responsible for a global decline in
human sperm counts -- even though there is no conclusive evidence that
sperm counts are declining.<p>
	This collective hypochondria is laid out in the new book by World Wildlife
Fund Senior Scientist Theo Colburn, environmental writer Diane Dumanowski, and
W. Alton Jones Foundation Director John Peterson Myers.  Their collective angst
is ominously entitled, <i>Our Stolen Future</i>.<p>
	Unfortunately for the proponents of synthetic endocrine disruption, mother
nature has already beaten them too it.  Just as they produce carcinogens, a
large number of plants routinely produce significant quantities of hormone
mimicking chemicals.  The human diet is simply filled with foods that contain
naturally-occurring endocrine disrupters from genestein in soybeans to
cafesterol in coffee. <p>
	Given the wealth of human exposure to these substances, if there were
widespread human effects, the world would have seen them by now.  The lack of
compelling data suggests that the kids are all right, and there is no cause for
alarm.  The issue of endocrine disruption clearly warrants further study, but
not the sort of hysteria routinely ginned up by environmental activists.<p>
	Let's just hope that it doesn't take science 30 years to do for
concerns about endocrine disrupters what it did for concerns about cancer.

<H1>RACHEL'S FOLLY<BR>
The End of Chlorine
</H1>
by Michelle Malkin and Michael Fumento

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>OVERVIEW</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>The environmentalists are right about one thing: Dirty water kills.
Millions are people are dying needlessly all over the world because of it.  But
are the main culprits man-made pollution and chlorinated chemicals?  Try
endemic poverty, bad plumbing and lack of access to basic water chlorination
techniques. Every year, nearly 1.5 billion people -- mostly children under
five -- suffer from preventable water-borne diseases such as cholera,
typhoid fever, amoebic dysentery, bacterial gastroenteritis, giardiasis,
schistosomiasis, and various viral diseases such as hepatitis A.  Yet now there
is a mounting campaign, led by environmental activists in wealthy
industrialized nations, to eliminate every last man-made chlorine molecule from
the face of the earth.  <p>

	Greenpeace, the international environmental advocacy group,  launched the
first salvo in 1991 with its call to phase out completely &#147;the use,
export, and import of all organochlorines, elemental chlorine, and chlorinated
oxidizing agents (e.g. chlorine dioxide and sodium
hypochlorite)."<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>  As Greenpeace's Joe Thornton
explains, "There are no uses of chlorine which we regard as
safe."<sup>2&nbsp;</sup> Yet chlorination -- considered one of the
greatest advances ever in public health and hygiene -- is almost
universally accepted as the method of choice for purifying water
supplies.<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>  In the United States alone, 98 percent of public
water systems are purified by chlorine or chlorine-based products. Alternative
chemical disinfectants such as ozone and other short-lived free radicals have
been used in water treatment, but none has demonstrated the safety and efficacy
of chlorination.<sup>4&nbsp;</sup><p>

	Chlorine is a ubiquitous element, one of the basic building blocks of all
matter in the universe.  In fact, scientists are only now beginning to discover
and identify the great number of natural organohalogens present in our world.
By one estimate, Mother Nature manufactures at least 1,500 chlorine-containing
chemicals.<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>  Volcanic activity, forest and grass fires, fungi,
algae, ferns and the decomposition of seaweed all release chlorinated organics
into the environment.<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>  Our own bodies produce hypochlorite to
fight infection and hydrochloric acid for proper digestion.<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>
And there is, of course, sodium chloride -- common table salt --
present naturally in mines, lakes and seawater, found in our blood, sweat and
tears, and essential to the diets of humans and animals.<p>

Clearly, a goal of total chlorine removal from the environment would be
unattainable. And the potential human toll resulting from its eradication is
manifest and staggering. Every major scientific investigation of chlorinated
water has concluded that the real and proven health risks from microbial
contamination of drinking water far exceed the uncertain and hypothetical risks
of cancer from chlorination and its byproducts.<i>  Why, then, are governmental
bodies around the world embracing Greenpeace's caprice -- absolute
zero tolerance for man-made chlorine -- when the hazards to humanity are so
explicitly large?</i><p>
Perhaps the answer can be traced back to the publication of Rachel
Carson's<i> Silent Spring </i>in 1962.  The book is a lyrical tract, the
bible of the environmental movement.  Carson was the first to bear witness
against chlorinated hydrocarbons and other "elixirs of death" created
by "the ingenious laboratory manipulation of molecules."  She
condemned these arrogant manipulations, prophesied a man-made cancer epidemic,
and popularized the zero-based approach to regulating synthetic chemicals.  A
daunting theme runs throughout <i>Silent Spring</I> -- that man's
ingenuity would be his own worst enemy.  And therein lies the essence of
Rachel's folly.  Carson and her intellectual heirs in the environmental
movement embrace a mistaken vision of technology.  It is an impaired vision
that considers only the risks of industrial chemical compounds, and not the
risks created by their absence.<p>
<p>
	As the late Aaron Wildavsky observed, there are few unalloyed good things in
the world.  Rarely does one find a substance that has benefits but not
costs.<sup>8&nbsp;</sup>  "Sunsetting" all uses of chlorine may
reduce the hypothetical risks associated with such compounds as dioxin, DDT and
PCBs.  At the same time, however, a blanket ban on chlorine would increase the
enormous risks of waterborne microbial infection here and in underdeveloped
countries that can now barely afford chlorine disinfectants (let alone costly
substitutes such as ozone or ultraviolet light treatment).  <p>
<p>
	Even more daunting, a chlorine phase-out would halt the production of most
plastics, pesticides and chlorine-containing drugs like chloroquine, a key
anti-malarial drug; halogenated tetracycline-based antibiotics like
chlortetracycline; and the family of halogenated antipsychotics such as
chlorpromazine.<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>  According to one industry-backed report,
almost 85 percent of the pharmaceuticals manufactured worldwide require
chlorine at some stage of production; 96 percent of crop-protection chemicals
are chlorine-dependent.<sup>10&nbsp;</sup>  From safe drinking water, clean
swimming pools and pest-free crops, to flame retardants and food packaging,
quality white paper and bright socks, Saran wrap, plastic bottles, garden
hoses, window frames and sturdy plumbing pipes, the end of chlorine would spell
the end of modern civilization itself.  <p>

<H2>Chapter 2: Saving the Planet with Pesticides: Increasing Food Supplies</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>

<P>Food is more abundant and cheaper today than at any other time before in
history.  Per capita grain supplies have increased 24 percent since 1950, while
food prices have plummeted by 57 percent since 1980.<p>
<p>
Food production has outpaced population growth since the 1960s.  The increase
in food production in poor countries has been more than double the population
growth rate in recent years.<p>
<p>
The global trouble spots for soil erosion and habitat destruction-the Amazon
rain forest, parts of Africa, and other scattered locations-are experiencing
problems because local agriculture has not taken advantage of high-yield
technologies and efficiencies.  In the case of the rain forest, problems have
been compounded by government subsidies for farming and logging.<p>
<p>
Global increases in average grain yields have lagged recently because affluent
countries are trying to limit their surpluses and because of chaotic conditions
in the former Soviet Union.  By contrast, grain yields in developing countries
rose 32 percent between 1980 and 1992.<p>
<p>
Farmers are not close to reaching the point of diminishing returns in crop
yields.  In fact, the general trend for most crops is sustained growth, often
at high and even accelerating rates of gain.<p>
<p>
Modern high-yield farming is responsible for preserving a great deal of the
world&#146;s biodiversity. If crop yields had remained at levels typical of the
1950s, farmers would have had to plow down an additional 10 million square
miles of wildlife habitat to raise enough food for the current world food
supply.<p>
<p>
For 10,000 years soil erosion has been a major threat to humanity&#146;s
sustainable existence.  Traditional low-yield farming is responsible for the
highest rates of soil erosion.  Two modern soil-saving techniques, conservation
tillage and no-till systems, cut erosion by 65 percent and 98 percent,
respectively.<p>
<p>
The UN&#146;s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that despite
progress, the number of people with inadequate diets increased in the past ten
years, from 540 million to 580 million.  Nonetheless, it should be relatively
easy to boost the vast majority over the threshold of hunger, since 90 percent
of those with inadequate diets are now within 10 percent of having enough
calories for good health.<p>
<p>
The risk to humans and wildlife from agrochemicals is far less than the risk of
losing wildlife to low yields and the  consequent plowing down of more habitat.<P>

<P>The objective, scientific evidence available today shows that the prophets of doom were wrong in virtually every prediction they made in the 1960s and 1970s when they forecast increasing natural resource scarcity and rising commodity prices.

<P>Every measurable trend of the past century suggests that humanity will soon be entering an age of increasing and unprecedented natural resources abundance.

<P>Technological improvements and advances in productivity have continually outpaced our consumption of natural resources and have led to the net creation of more resources available to future generations.

<P>Today, natural resources are about half as expensive relative to wages as they were in 1980, about three times less expensive than they were fifty years ago, and roughly eight times less costly than they were in 1900.

<P>In spite of Paul and Anne Ehrlich’s projection that mineral supplies would be largely depleted by 1985, proven reserves of virtually all important minerals have skyrocketed since 1950.

<P>The continuing discovery of new mines, technological innovations in mining techniques, and introductions of less expensive or superior substitutes for the use of some minerals have caused most minerals to become less scarce rather than more scarce over the past 100 years.

<P>Although Paul Ehrlich refers to the 1980s as a  catastrophic decade  in terms of consumption, the period witnessed tremendous increases in the supply of almost all raw materials.

<P>A well-publicized book, <I>The Energy Crisis</I>, projected in 1972 that the earth held thirty years left of gas reserves and twenty years left of oil reserves.  Since 1950, however, proven reserves for oil and gas have climbed by over 700 percent.

<P>The very concept of  finite natural resources  embraced by geologists is a flawed way of thinking about the earth and nature.   Natural resources  have value only when humanity invents a use for them.<P>

<H2>Chapter 6: Forests: Conflicting Signals</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>

<P>Though nearly 75 percent of the total industrial wood production comes
from Northern Hemisphere industrial countries, the temperate forestlands of
this region are expanding.<p>
<p>
The world&#146;s current industrial wood consumption requirements could be
produced on only 5 percent of the world&#146;s total current forestland.<p>
<p>
About one-third of the earth&#146;s terrestrial area remains wilderness.<p>
<p>
Tropical forests cover a land area that is almost exactly the size of South
America.<p>
<p>
Tropical and temperate forests together cover a land area the size of the
Western Hemisphere.<p>
<p>
The rate of conversion of the tropical forests increased from 0.6 percent in
1980 to about 0.8 percent in 1990.<p>
<p>
Fully two-thirds of the deforestation in the United States occurred in the
sixty years prior to 1910 and most of the other third before 1850.<p>
<p>
Although the United States has been the world&#146;s number one timber producer
since World War II, U.S. forests have experienced an increase in volume in the
past fifty years and have maintained roughly the same area over the past
seventy-five years.<p>
<p>
The total area of forest and other wooded land in Europe increased by 2 million
hectares annually between 1980 and 1990.<p>
<p>
The total forest area of the temperate region&#146;s industrialized countries
increased between 1980 and 1990.<p>
<p>
During 1993, an estimated 4 million trees were planted in the United States
each day.<p>
<p>
The forest biomass in the northern Rockies has increased by 30 percent or more
since the middle of the eighteenth century.<p>
<p>
In recent years, private forestlands have accounted for 85 percent of total
tree planting and seeding in the United States.<p>
<p>
The expansion of American forests has been made possible by improved
tree-growing technology, the advent of tree plantations, improved control over
wildfire, and the reversion of many agricultural lands, especially in the South
and East, to forest.<p>
<p>
Deforestation in the Americas was probably greater before the Columbian
encounter than it was for several centuries after.<p>
<p>
The recent proliferation of plantation forests in both the temperate and the
tropical world has helped to deflect harvesting pressure from natural
forests.<p>
<p>
Almost all of the timber harvested in the United States, Europe, and Nordic
countries comes from second-growth/plantation forests.<p>
<p>
Commercial logging is not a major cause of deforestation; expanding agriculture
is.  In temperate countries, which provide over three-fourths of the
world&#146;s industrial wood, reforestation is the rule, while in tropical
countries forestland conversion to agriculture remains common.<p>
<p>
The developed countries in the temperate regions appear to have largely
completed forestland conversion to agriculture and have achieved relative land
use stability.  By contrast, the developing countries in the tropics are still
in a land conversion mode.  This suggests that land conversion stability
correlates strongly with successful economic development.<p>

<H2>Principles for Economic Freedom<br>
and Environmental Quality</H2>
<H3>A Free Market Response<br> to the President's Council on Sustainable Development</H3>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>
<H4>VISION STATEMENT</H4>

<P><B>PCSD:</B> "Our vision is of a life-sustaining Earth.  We are committed to the achievement of a dignified, peaceful, and equitable existence.  A sustainable United States will have a growing economy that provides equitable opportunities for satisfying livelihoods and a safe, healthy, high quality of life for current and future generations.  Our nation will protect its environment, its natural resource base, and 
the functions and viability of natural systems on which all life depends."	

<P><B>Alternative:</B> "Our vision of a life-sustaining earth is one in which environmental resources are fully integrated into a free market system based on private property. Expansion of individual liberty and creative ecological privatization offer the greatest promise of effectively enhancing economic growth and environmental quality."

<P><HR><P>

<H4>President's Council on Sustainable Development vs. the Free Market</H4>

<B>PCSD "We Believe Statement"</B>:	followed by 	<B>FREE MARKET PRINCIPLES:</B>


<p><B>1.</B> To achieve our vision of sustainable development, some things must grow
-- jobs, productivity, wages, capital, and savings, profits, information, knowledge, and education -- and others -- pollution, waste, and poverty -- must not.	

<p><B>1.</B> To achieve our vision of growth and prosperity, economic freedom must be restored. Economic freedom reduces pollution, waste, and poverty, making it the only true form of sustainable development.
<P><BR>

<P><B>2.</B> Change is inevitable and necessary fore the sake of future generations
and for ourselves.  We can choose a course for change that will lead to the
mutually reinforcing goals of economic growth, environmental protection, and social equity.	

<P><B>2.</B> In the face of future change and uncertainty, we must choose a course of
action which promotes the mutually reinforcing goals of human liberty and
environmental quality.
<P><BR>

<P><B>3.</B>  Steady progress in reducing disparities in education, opportunity, and
environmental risk within society is essential to economic growth, environmental health and social justice.	

<P><B>3.</B> Private property and a free marketplace are essential to the health and
viability of natural systems and provide the best mechanisms for realizing human concern for environmental quality. 
<P><BR>

<P><B>4.</B> The United States made great progress in protecting the environment in
the last 25 years, and must continue to make progress in the next 25 years. We can achieve that goal because market incentives and the power of consumers can lead to significant improvements in environmental performance at low cost.	

<P><B>4.</B> The United States has made its greatest environmental strides when it has allowed the institutions of a free society to flourish. Restoring and
reinforcing such institutions is the surest way to achieve significant improvements in the future. 
<P><BR>

<P><B>5.</B> Economic growth based on technological innovation, improved efficiency, and expanding global markets is essential for progress toward greater prosperity, equity, and environmental quality.	


<P><B>5.</B> Economic growth based on technological innovation and economic
efficiency is essential for progress toward environmental quality.
<P><BR>

<P><B>6.</B> Environmental regulations have improved and must continue to improve the lives of all Americans.  Basic standards of performance that are clear, fair, and consistently enforced remain necessary to protect that progress. The current regulatory system should be improved to deliver required results at lower costs.  In addition, the system should provide enhanced flexibility in return for superior environmental performance.	


<P><B>6.</B> Environmental laws and command-and-control regulation have undermined environmental quality and violated the Constitutionally-guaranteed rights of many Americans. Environmental degradation has resulted from government attempts to manage markets and to control resource use through the political process.  The current regulatory system must be revised, taking into account the basic institutional arrangements necessary for environmental protection. 
<P><BR>

<P><B>7.</B> Environmental progress will depend on individual, institutional, and corporate responsibility, commitment and stewardship.	

<P><B>7.</B> Environmental progress depends on free market institutions and private stewardship.
<P><BR>


<P><B>8.</B> We need a new collaborative decision process that leads to better decisions; more rapid change; and more sensible use of human, natural and financial resources in achieving our goals.	

<P><B>8.</B> Decision-making should be decentralized through voluntary transactions among free individuals in the private marketplace, allowing individuals and communities to pursue diverse environmental values.
<P><BR>

<P><B>9.</B> The nation must strengthen its communities and enhance their role in decisions about environment, equity, natural resources and economic progress so that the individuals and institutions most immediately affected can join with others in the decision process.	

<P><B>9.</B> Individual property owners and local communities most immediately affected should make decisions about environmental management, unhampered by federal mandates.
<P><BR>

<P><B>10.</B> Economic growth, environmental protection, and social equity are linked.  We need to develop integrated policies to achieve these national goals.	

<P><B>10.</B> The free-enterprise system is the best means of promoting prosperity, environmental quality, and social equity.
<P><BR>

<P><B>11.</B> The United States should have policies and programs that contribute to stabilizing global human population; this objective is critical if we hope to have the resources needed to ensure a high quality of life for future generations.	

<P><B>11.</B> The United States should not attempt to stabilize human population through reproductive health, sterilization, or abortion policies.  Arbitrary limits on human resources threaten our survival.
<P><BR>

<P><B>12.</B> Even in the face of scientific uncertainty, society should take reasonable actions to avert risks where the potential harm to human health or the environment is thought to be serious or irreparable.	

<P><B>12.</B> Environmental protection is not advanced by the precautionary
limitation of scientific, economic or technological progress. The risks to the future of technological and economic stagnation must be weighed against the risks of technological and economic progress.
<P><BR>

<P><B>13.</B> Steady advances in science and technology are essential to help improve economic efficiency, protect and restore natural systems, and modify consumption patterns.	

<P><B>13.</B> Advances in economic efficiency and technological innovation, arising through competition and the perceptiveness of entrepreneurs, are environmentally beneficial. Ensuring a free marketplace is the surest way to encourage scientific and technological advancement.
<P><BR>

<P><B>14.</B> A growing economy and healthy environment are essential to national and global security.	

<P><B>14.</B> A growing economy is essential to national prosperity and environmental quality. 
<P><BR>

<P><B>15.</B> A knowledgeable public, the free flow of information, and opportunities for review and redress are critically important to open, equitable, and effective decision-making.	

<P><B>15.</B> The public has the greatest access to knowledge and information in a free market system characterized by economic freedom and decentralized decision-making.
<P><BR>

<P><B>16.</B> Citizens must have access to high quality and lifelong formal and non-formal education that enables them to understand the interdependence of economic prosperity, environmental quality, and social equity -- and prepares them to
take actions that support all three.	

<P><B>16.</B> Citizens must be allowed to utilize their own creative energies, without direction from centralized government education programs.

<H2>Marine Resources</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Valuable resources that are unowned are also uncared for; they fall prey to
the &#147;Tragedy of the Commons.&#148;  Property rights to marine resources
are the only way to reconcile competing commercial, recreational, and
environmental concerns, and prevent further degradation of the marine
environment.  Ownership in the oceans makes conservation an asset, not a
liability.<p>
	The recent collapse of the once-rich fisheries of the Georges Bank off the
coast of New England serves as a dramatic testimony to the failure of fishery
management in the United States. Traditional limits on seasons and gear ignore
the tragedy of the commons and encourage fishermen to vacuum the seas.
Regulatory approaches to improving fishing methods rarely consider the perverse
incentives they create, the costs they impose, the resentment they incur and
the creativity they stifle. <p>
	Without any form of ownership, it is unreasonable for any individual to
attempt to conserve or enhance resources because the benefits of doing so are
diluted throughout the fishery. Fishermen have no desire to destroy their own
source of livelihood, but as long as non-ownership encourages overfishing, fish
stocks will continue to decline.<p>
	One recent attempt to inject some form of ownership into fisheries management
is the Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ). ITQs have proven effective in other
countries and in the U.S., and can be an important first step acknowledging the
power of the market to protect the environment. On the other hand, ITQs are not
real property rights, and any limitation on ownership, such as
non-transferability, devalues rights and discourages conservation and
stewardship. Once created, they may also become similar to &#147;taxi cab
medallions,&#148; limiting competition and creating a vested special interest
in maintaining the status quo. <p>
	In the recent Congressional debate on fishery management the importance of
local control over management decisions was overlooked.  Efforts should be made
to devolve control over marine resources to as local a level as possible.  At
the very least, the regional management councils set up by the original 1976
Magnuson Act should decide the efficacy of proposed management plans. ITQs or
other ownership schemes will certainly not be perfect for every fishery, but
Congress should not eliminate them as an option.<p>
	While ownership may be difficult to conceptualize for fugitive resources, it
has a proven track record for conserving sedentary resources. From outright
fee-simple ownership of oyster beds in  Washington to proprietary ownership of
artificial reefs in Alabama, habitat has been protected and enhanced. One
well-documented study compared public oyster beds in Maryland to privately
leased oyster beds in Virginia before disease wreaked havoc all over the
Chesapeake. The study found that leased beds were better managed and far more
productive than their public, open access counterparts.<p>
	Under a system of clearly defined property rights, fishermen capture the
benefits of practicing conservation, using more efficient fishing methods and
protecting habitat. The self destructive incentives of the commons must be
alleviated before fishermen will seek creative and practical solutions to the
problems they face.<p>

<i>Q:  How can private property rights improve marine resource management when
they can&#146;t be enforced or monitored effectively? </i><p>
<p>
A:  Advanced technologies are often blamed for depleted fisheries, but these
same technologies offer tremendous opportunities for protecting and monitoring
marine resources. The oceans are similar to the American West in the early
1800s, when enclosing and monitoring land and cattle were unthinkable. But in
the West property rights were clearly allocated, and before long owners came up
with barbed wire and branding to effectively define and defend their property.
Technologies exist that could start &#147;fencing&#148; and
&#147;branding&#148; marine resources if only rights to them were clearly
defined.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Won&#146;t private property rights to marine resources destroy
traditional fishing communities?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Property rights do not preclude common property arrangements. Common
property rights regimes have successfully protected resources in traditional
communities like those of Maine lobster fishers for ages. Under some
circumstances common property is more suitable than private property, and
nothing would prevent these regimes from remaining or evolving.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  When property rights are initially allocated some people will always
feel cheated. Can an allocation ever be politically feasible?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Any group that does not think it will come out ahead will oppose any change
in the status quo, often smaller operations with less political clout. This was
the case in the recent ITQ debate in Congress and it led to a toothless
revision of the Magnuson Act. Efforts to allow property rights to develop will
face major hurdles until the allocation problem is addressed properly. Each
case is different, but care must be taken to include all of the stakeholders in
the allocation process.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Where is the justification for giving away a valuable public resource to
a select few?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Open access to valuable resources is an appealing concept but a proven
failure.  Access to all will leave a valuable resource for none. Under a system
of property rights everyone would still have an opportunity to fish, but the
destructive force of open access would be mitigated.

<H2>Chapter 1: Population, Food, and Income </H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>



<P>World population has more than tripled since 1900, rising from 1.6
billion to 5.3 billion today.<p>
<p>
Global life expectancy more than doubled this century from 30 to 64 years,
while global infant mortality fell from 170 infant deaths per 1,000 births in
1950 to just 60 in 1990.  Rapid population growth has occurred not because
human beings suddenly started breeding like rabbits but because they finally
stopped dropping like flies.<p>
<p>
Despite a tripling of the world&#146;s population in this century, global
health and productivity have exploded.  Today human beings eat better, produce
more, and consume more than ever before in the past.<p>
<p>
The current rate of annual worldwide population growth is down to 1.6 percent
and continues to fall from its 1960&#146;s peak of 2.0 percent.  The average
annual growth rate is 0.4 percent for developed countries and 1.9 percent for
developing regions.<p>
<p>
&#147;Overpopulation&#148; is a problem that has been misidentified and
misdefined.  The term has no scientific definition or clear meaning.  The
problems typically associated with overpopulation (hungry families, squalid and
overcrowded living conditions) are more properly understood as issues of
poverty.<p>
<p>
The total fertility rate for the world as a whole dropped by nearly two-fifths
between 1950/55 and 1990/95-from about 5 children per woman down to about 3.1
children per woman.  Average fertility in the more developed regions fell from
2.8 to 1.7 children per woman, well below biological replacement.  Meanwhile
total fertility rates in less developed regions fell by 40 percent, falling
from 6.2 to 3.5 children per woman.<p>
<p>
Global per capita calorie availability rose by nearly a third between the 1930s
and late 1980s, with per capita food supplies rising by 40 percent in Africa,
Asia, and Latin America.<p>
<p>
Worldwide per capita productivity has surged alongside the population boom.
Between 1950 and 1989, per capita output tripled in Western Europe, North
America and Australia, doubled in India and Pakistan, and increased eightfold
in South Korea and tenfold in Taiwan.  Even parts of Africa may have enjoyed a
near tripling of per capita output between 1913 and 1989.<p>
<p>
Although some blame dwindling natural resources for the reversals and
catastrophes that have recently befallen heavily populated low-income
countries, such episodes are directly traceable to the policies or practices of
presiding governments.<p>

<H2>Sustainable Development</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>&#147;Sustainable development&#148; is the <i>raison d&#146;&ecirc;tre</i> for
numerous environmental treaties and United Nations conventions.  It is the
environmental pretext for expanding the power of national and international
bureaucracies to control the economy.  This form of central economic planing is
seen as essential to prevent resource depletion, pollution, and the destruction
of biological diversity. Proponents of sustainable development are calling for
an international framework of restrictions on individual and economic freedoms
&#151; on trade, on economic and technological progress, on the use of energy,
on agriculture &#151; to ensure the survival of the planet.<p>
	Sustainable development is premised on the idea that the globalization of
technology and economic growth are inherently destructive to the environment.
However, the habitual predictions by environmental doomsayers of an end to the
world&#146;s abundant resources have never proven correct. The critics of
capitalism fail to account for the powerful forces of innovation which exist in
the marketplace.  In a free market, entrepreneurs compete to develop low-cost,
efficient solutions to the problems of resource scarcity, enabling people to do
more with less; Capitalism has produced more environment-friendly innovations
than any other economic system.  Though this dynamic was missing under
socialist economies, proposals for sustainable development would replicate
economic planning in the ecological sphere.<p>
The influential 1992 &#147;Earth Summit&#148; held in Rio de Janeiro put forth
sustainable development as the central organizing principle for global
environmental policy.  Since then, international bureaucrats, environmental
activists and federal government officials have developed a growing body of
international law, which includes such treaties and agreements as Agenda 21,
the Global Climate Convention, the Biodiversity Convention, and the Law of the
Sea Treaty.  These treaties call for the imposition of costly regulations and
increased government spending on wasteful foreign aid programs.  Wealth
transfers are funneled through the Agency for International Development, the
World Bank&#146;s Global Environmental Facility, and U.N. agencies. They are
the beginnings of a blueprint for central ecological planning.<p>
Global environmental initiatives enacted under the guise of sustainable
development also threaten the economic future of developing countries.
&#147;Eco-imperialism&#148; is a growing trend in which wealthier nations
impose global environmental standards.  Developing nations, home to most of the
world&#146;s poor, suffer the most from such restrictions on economic
opportunities, growth, and development.  These countries worry that their
efforts to rise out of poverty will be prohibited as &#147;environmentally
unsustainable&#148; by the industrial powers. <p>
Proponents of sustainable development fail to recognize the role of material
poverty in causing environmental degradation.  Affluent societies voluntarily
expend resources on environmental quality, without coercion from government,
but poverty-stricken populations can less easily afford environmental
amenities.  Those in poorer countries are particularly vulnerable to disease,
natural disasters, and nutritional deficiencies; more than 2 million die
annually worldwide due to inadequate sanitation alone.  Thus a global policy to
restrict economic development under the guise of sustainability will actually
harm people as well as the environment.<p>
The pursuit of &#147;sustainable development&#148; through the expansion of
regulatory authority and international bureaucracies will inevitably lead to
both economic and environmental failure.  True sustainable development can only
come through an embrace of market institutions.<p>
<i>Q:  What is wrong with &#147;sustainable development&#148;?</i><p>

A:  &#147;Sustainable development&#148; as pursued by the U.N. and the
environmental lobby has become a euphemism for <i>no</i> development.
International regulations, taxes, and other economic growth restrictions would
result in bigger government and a more restricted market.  History has shown,
however, that central planning caused severe environmental degradation in the
former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.  True &#147;sustainable&#148;
development can only come from a reliance upon the market institutions of
private property, voluntary exchange, and rule of law.<p>

<i>Q:  Won&#146;t the global environment deteriorate without international
cooperation?</i><p>

A:  Giving the U.N. more power and financial resources is no way to help the
environment.  Environmental quality is a local issue, not a global one.
Therefore, too much centralization would actually cause environmental harm.
Proposals for environmental taxes, charges, and user fees would give the U.N.
new sources of revenue, but would diminish political accountability for the use
of government funds as well as natural resources.  Instead of enacting one
environmental policy globally, nations should compete with each other with
diverse approaches.  The countries which effectively deregulate their economies
are more likely to promote economic development, acquire cleaner technologies,
and create the wealth necessary to afford environmental improvements.<p>

<i>Q:  Shouldn&#146;t the international community do everything possible to
reduce the potential for harm to the environment? </i><p>

A:  This is the so-called &#147;precautionary principle,&#148; which requires
governments to impose economic restrictions preemptively, before the existence
and validity of an environmental threat can be discerned scientifically.  Under
this standard, most new technologies could be barred as an environmental
precaution, without regard to sound science.  In addition, this standard
mandates hasty government actions without regard to the risks that such
&#147;remedies&#148; would create.  For example, Congress accelerated the
phaseout of chemical refrigerants under the Montreal Protocol, due to
unconfirmed fears about the effects of ozone thinning above North America,
without any consideration of the severe economic and social consequences that
would result from the action.

<BR>

Hopes were high for a July vote on legislation to enhance the 
protection of private property rights and require compensation for 
regulatory takings.  Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott’s staff assured 
land rights advocates that the "The Omnibus Property Rights Act" would 
come up for a vote before the August recess.

<P>In preparation for a floor debate the bill was modified to blunt 
opponents’ criticisms. Of note, the 33 percent devaluation trigger for 
takings compensation was raised to 50 percent.  Nonetheless, rumors 
began circulating about ebbing support.  Several Republicans, concerned 
about attacks from environmental activists, privately urged that the 
bill be put aside, despite recent polling data reconfirming that 
property rights is a political winner.  As Democratic pollster Celinda 
Lake commented to the <I>National Journal</I>, "If one ever lets the 
Republicans convince voters that either the Democrats or the 
environmental groups are anti-private property, then I think it could be 
a very dangerous issue.  I think its one of the most serious issues that 
environmentalists should worry about because it is such a core value to 
people."

<P>On July 29, Lott met with former Senator Malcolm Wallop, Henson Moore of 
the American Forest and Paper Association and other supporters of 
takings legislation to discuss whether the bill will be scheduled for a 
vote after the August recess, but the Senate Majority Leader was 
unwilling to make a commitment without a hard vote count ensuring that 
the bill will receive a minimum of 53 votes.  As a result it is 
questionable whether there will be a Senate vote on property rights in 
1996.

<P>While takings compensation sits in the wings, there is increasing 
concern that Heritage Areas legislation will be folded into a bill to 
create an independent trust to manage the Presidio in San Francisco.  
The former military post is to become part of the Golden Gate National 
Recreation Area and houses several environmental groups, including the 
Tides Foundation.

<P>The Presidio bill has become something of a Christmas tree of late.  
Having passed both the House and Senate have passed the measure which 
now sits in Conference, loaded for bear with dozens of land-related 
measures and park barrel projects, leaving House and Senate negotiators 
to sort out what should be included in the final bill.  Heritage areas 
are on the table, as is a proposal to create the 25,800 acre Opal Creek 
Wilderness and National Scenic Recreation area in Oregon.  

<P>The inclusion of grazing reform was also on the table, but now the House 
is expected to move on a watered-down bill independently because Rep. 
Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY) convinced House Speaker Newt Gingrich that 
grazing would prevent passage of the Presidio package.  A vote on 
compromise legislation negotiated by Boehlert had been scheduled just 
before the August recess.  Yet this bill was put off as Boehlert did not 
want to anger the Sierra Club before receiving their endorsement during 
the Republican convention in San Diego.  On August 13, the Sierra Club 
gave Boehlert the Edgar Wayburn Award because he "has saved the nation 
from environmental disaster."  A vote on grazing is now expected in 
mid-September. 

<P>A bill to purchase the Sterling Forest was also slated for inclusion in 
the Presidio package.  Federal acquisition of the forest land has been a 
high priority for the Speaker who initially proposed a deal whereby 
federal grasslands in Oklahoma would be sold to pay for the Sterling 
purchase.  Yet this land swap was nixed after environmentalists 
complained.  A bill authorizing the feds to purchase the land passed the 
House by voice vote on July 30, and the Senate has yet to act.  

<P>On the heritage areas front, the Dole campaign is said to have chimed 
in, urging that any heritage area proposal include provisions to protect 
private landowners, such as a clause to allow landowners to opt-out of 
any heritage area in their community.  While this does not address all 
of the property rights concerns raised by heritage areas, it is a step 
in the right direction and could mute preservationist support.
	 
<P>In other news, House Speaker Newt Gingrich supported efforts by 
California lawmakers to authorize construction of the Auburn Dam, to no 
avail.  The House Transportation Committee voted against the project 
35-28.  The Speaker’s move was viewed as an effort to reach out to Rep. 
Richard Pombo (R-CA) and other Western lawmakers upset about the 
Speaker’s unwillingness to support reform of the Endangered Species Act 
and other efforts to reduce federal land-use regulations.  Some observe 
that Speaker only seems willing to support Westerners when they ask for 
more government, not less.
	
<P>Finally, Republicans rushed an overhaul of federal pesticide 
regulations, including the infamous "Delaney Clause," to the President’s 
desk just before the August recess.  While the House Commerce Committee 
and some trade associations have heralded the measure as a deregulatory 
success, the new law is more likely to clamp down on pesticide use and 
raise prices for consumers.  This should come as no surprise, as the 
bill was endorsed by arch-Green Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA).

<H1>Opposing Legal Plunder</H1>
<H3>Message from the Executive Director</H3>
<A HREF="/marlo.html">Marlo Lewis</A>, July 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>Legal plunder is as old as government itself.  In fact, most governments in
most times and places are little more than glorified gangs of robbers.  To
blow the whistle on the kleptocracies of his day, the English philosopher
John Locke explained that "the injury and the crime [of theft] is equal,
whether committed by the wearer of a crown, or some petty villain."  The
only difference is in the fate of the perpetrators: "Great robbers punish
little ones, to keep them in their obedience, but the great ones are
rewarded with laurels and triumphs, because they are too big for the weak
hands of justice in this world."
<P>	Today’s kleptocrats are craftier than the kings and dukes of Locke’s time.
Whereas the princes of old stole in the name of their own prerogatives and
privileges, today’s political class steals in the name of "compassion" and
"social justice."  The result is the systematic fleecing of the unwary
taxpayer, the unorganized consumer, the isolated property owner, and the
small entrepreneur.  Organized thievery has become so pervasive that it is
no longer a case of government robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Thanks to "middle
class" entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and "free"
public education, government increasingly robs Peter to subsidize -- Peter!

<P>This ubiquitous self-subsidy system is what makes it so hard for reformers
to downsize the federal establishment.  
	 One of the more ingenious efforts to expose the horrid wastefulness and
injustice of legal plunder is the Cost of Government Day campaign,
spearheaded by Americans for Tax Reform.  Cost of Government Day (COGD) is
"the date of the calendar year, counting from January 1, on which the
average American has earned enough in gross income to pay off all his direct
and hidden taxes (total federal, state, and local government spending plus
the cost of regulation)."  COGD for 1996 is July 3.  That means Americans
work more than half the year just to pay the costs of government.
	<P>How did this happen in the Land of the Free, and what can be done about it?
	 <P>A chief source of the problem is the federal income tax.  It is sobering
to learn that the main sponsors of the 16th Amendment believed (or professed
to believe) that the income tax would be used only in war time and would
only apply to earnings above $100,000 a year (in today’s dollars).  The
Founding Fathers did not think the federal government could be trusted with
the power to tax personal income.  How right they were!
	<P>	The 16th Amendment created a vast wealth-transfer machine.  But the income
tax is a relatively obvious means of picking people’s pockets, and
kleptocrats found that taxpayers rebel if pushed beyond certain limits.  So
political plunderers have resorted to deficit spending -- a form of deferred
taxation -- to finance government expansion.  But this approach has political
limitations of its own, because annual deficits in the $200 billion range
smack of gross fiscal irresponsibility and evoke fears of insolvency and
collapse.  So kleptocrats increasingly prefer to achieve their aims through
political regulation of private enterprise.  Not only are regulatory costs
hidden from the general public, they are imposed by unelected -- hence
unaccountable -- bureaucrats.
	<P>Several reforms would help curb the politics of plunder.  Replacing the
current tax system with a low flat tax or a national sales tax, adopting a
balanced budget amendment, and ending regulation without representation
(requiring Congress to vote on and approve proposed regulations before they
can become law) are all sensible steps in the right direction.  However,
there is little hope of achieving these reforms as long as people believe
that "social needs" give politicians a license to steal. 
	<P>In the final analysis, restoring what Friedrich Hayek called the
"constitution of liberty" will require a sea-change in public opinion.  Only
when Americans recover the understanding that "the crime and the injury" of
theft is the same, whether perpetrated by public officials or petty crooks,
will we see a dramatic decline in the cost of government.

<H1>The Wages of Min</H1>
by <A HREF="/staff/lewis.html">Marlo Lewis</A>, May 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>
     Is the "Revolution" over?  Did it ever really begin? <p>

     What brings these questions to mind is not the revolutionaries'
failure to curtail Medicare, kill the Commerce Department, or reform risk
regulation.  Rather, my perplexity stems from the Republicans' preemptive
cringing and Me-Tooism over the minimum wage.<p>

Ever since Bill Clinton refused to be cowed by government shutdowns into
signing the GOP's budget proposals, Republicans have been in a
self-described "funk"  --  a Carter-like malaise.  This suggests
the revolutionaries never quite understood their mission.  They thought their
job was to govern, i.e., enact major reforms.  But when the other team controls
the White House, governing from Congress is possible only with veto-proof
majorities in both chambers -- assets the revolutionaries do not possess.
<p>

The revolutionaries' single-minded objective, therefore, should be to
complete the overthrow of the old order, using their ability to set the agenda and frame the issues to destroy the moral legitimacy of the statist quo.  Then
and only then will the revolution party be strong enough to govern.  Many more
tutorial hearings will be needed to expose the wastefulness, unfairness, and
destructiveness of the Welfare Regulatory State.<p>

Ceding the moral high ground to Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy in the minimum
wage debate is dangerous, because the minimum wage exemplifies just about every
collectivist fallacy ever invented.  The minimum wage is based on the insane premise that government can create wealth by legislative fiat.  It is based on
the dishonest premise that government can selectively help some people without
harming others.  It is based on the arrogant premise that central planners know
better than willing buyers and sellers in the marketplace what rates of
exchange are reasonable and fair.  <p>

All collectivist delusions are rooted in the denial of the teachings of
economics.  Marx could preach redemption through socialism only by denigrating economics as "bourgeois ideology."  Similarly, minimum wage advocates
deny that government-mandated increases in the price of labor reduce the demand
for labor.  This can be true only if economics is false.     <p>

Who profits from this disinformation campaign?  Union bosses, to be sure;
minimum wage laws protect unions from lower-priced competition.  But
there's more to it than that.  A people that cherishes minimum wage laws
will be too economically befuddled to see through more sophisticated assaults on their liberties.  They'll never be fully persuaded that welfare creates poverty, that taxes destroy jobs, or that mandated benefits damage health
care.<p>

The era of big government is not over.  Many Americans still believe government
can and should play Santa Claus.  This sentiment can be changed, but only if
the revolutionaries fight to change it.  <p>

Herewith a few suggestions:  Call the minimum wage proposals by their proper
names  --  the "Teenage Unemployment Act," the "Welfare
Expansion Act," the "Break the Bottom Rungs of the Economic Ladder
Act."   Ridicule is a mighty weapon; don't be afraid to use it.<p>

Hold hearings to unmask the true causes of wage stagnation (high taxes and
over-regulation) and unemployment (minimum wage laws and other
government-manufactured barriers to entry).  Bring forward inner-city small
business owners who can explain from their own experience how federal labor
policies harm the poorest of the poor.<p>

Champion a positive alternative like Senator John Ashcroft's proposal to
let workers deduct from their income taxes the employee share of Social
Security Taxes.  <p>

These steps won't guarantee victory, but losing the vote on minimum wage
wouldn't be the end of the world.  The immediate legislative contest is
less important than the larger battle for public opinion.  If the
revolutionaries lose their will to fight that battle, then the revolution is
surely dead.<BR>

<H1>Time for Another Contract</H1>
<A HREF="/staff/lewis.html">Marlo Lewis</A>, September 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>The 104th Congress was anything but "extremist."  Its leaders proposed to balance the budget -- but only after seven years.  They called for family tax relief -- but in amounts well below the Clinton tax hikes of 1993.  They advocated cost-benefit tests for new regulations -- demanding, in effect, that regulations do more good than harm. They sought to restore some, though not all, of the protections guaranteed to property owners by the 5th Amendment.  If anything, these proposals did not go far enough.
Yet so often was the accusation of extremism repeated that many Republicans
half believe it -- including some who once waxed enthusiastic about the
"Revolution."  They now regard the Contract with America as something to run from, not on.  Yet the Contract remains the GOP majority’s finest achievement.

<P>Self-government is impossible if politics is just a game of fool the voter.
Voters have a real choice over the direction of public policy only if
parties offer clear alternatives and have the internal discipline to follow
through on their promises.  Absent such clarity and discipline, politicians
will do what comes naturally -- collude and combine to advance their "class
interest" in expanding the federal estate.  Bill Clinton is the exemplar of
this approach:  Promise them anything, but give them bigger government.
The Contract with America was a bold attempt to replace the politics of
collusion and obfuscation with a politics of candor and accountability.  
<P>For
a while, there was speculation that the Contract might set a trend.  Any
party that did not similarly commit itself in writing to a specific
legislative agenda would seem shoddy by comparison, exposed as a collection
of hucksters and charlatans.

<P>Fearing this might happen, big-government liberals vilified the Contract
"on" America (as they called it), warning that its enactment would poison
the air and water, throw widows out on the street, and take bread from the
mouths of babes.  Yet few Americans trust in the assurances of used-car
salesmen, and they purchase warranties when they can afford to do so.  The
Contract with America gave the GOP a shot at becoming a party of integrity.
It said to the world:  "Here’s what we stand for, here’s what we’ll do if we
become the majority; if we fail to deliver on our promises, boot us out!"
Rather than toss this asset aside, the GOP would be well advised to revive it.

<P>Bob Dole’s economic growth package calls for a 15 percent across-the-board
income tax cut, a 50 percent capital gains tax cut, and a regulatory
reduction commission.  These ideas can help differentiate the two parties
and give voters a reason to retain GOP majorities in Congress -- but only if
the proposals are seen to be something other than manipulative campaign
oratory.  Yet Bob Dole says he hasn’t read the Republican platform and
doesn’t consider himself bound by it.  

<P>If Republicans are perceived to be as unprincipled as Democrats, voters will
prefer Democrats, who at least know how to bring home the bacon and emote
convincingly on television. Politicians love the arts of evasion, but a
party with the guts to make written promises and the character to keep them
will in the end earn the people’s respect and trust.  Whether the GOP has
the wits to make a Contract with America its standard practice and trademark
remains to be seen.

<H2>PROPERTY RIGHTS, REGULATORY TAKINGS,<BR>
 AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION</H2>
by <a href="/adler.html">Jonathan H. Adler</A>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
</CENTER>

<P> Under current environmental laws individual Americans have been prevented
from building homes, plowing fields, filling ditches, felling trees,
clearing brush, and repairing fences, all on private land. Many believe that such regulations infringe upon private property rights and violate the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution's admonition "...nor shall private
property be taken for public use without just compensation." When the
federal government condemns a piece of private land to create a
publicly-desired resource, such as a military base, road, or wildlife
preserve, it pays the land's owner for the value of the property. However
when the government regulates the use of the same private land to achieve
the same purpose, it rarely pays a dime. In this manner, private land is
taken for public use -- through a "regulatory taking" -- without just
compensation.
 
 <P>    The Supreme Court held in Armstrong v. United States that the
Constitutional prohibition on uncompensated takings "was designed to bar
government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in
all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole." Private
individuals should not be forced to bear the costs of providing public goods
desired by other people.  Owning property should entitle the owner to the
full use of that property, so long as the use of that property does not lead
to the harming of other people or their properties. Ensuring compensation
for regulatory takings will not only restore much-needed property
protections, it also serves as the first step toward the development of a
new generation of environmental protection. 

<P>     Federal environmental laws are not the sole source of so-called regulatory
takings by the federal government.  However they are the most prominent.
For two decades, federal land-use control has been the dominant means of
achieving many environmental objectives. Two federal laws, in particular,
have been the focus of the debate over compensation for regulatory takings:
the <A HREF="/ebb8.html">Endangered Species Act (ESA)</A> and Section 404 of the <A HREF="/ebb5.html">Clean Water Act
(CWA)</A>, the source of regulations limiting the development of wetlands. 

  <P>   Numerous legislative proposals have been introduced in response to the
growing demand for a greater protection of private property. Twenty-three
states have enacted property rights legislation of some kind. The two
primary property rights proposals under consideration in Congress are S. 605
and H. R. 925, both of which would require the payment of compensation to
landowners for regulatory takings.

 <P>    Groups opposing compensation for regulatory takings suggest that requiring
compensation for regulatory takings would impose an extreme financial burden
upon the federal government. Such claims are overstated.  Under most
proposals, compensation is paid directly out of those funds appropriated to
the agency responsible for the taking, and therefore would have no impact on the deficit.  Requiring federal agencies to pay compensation for regulatory
takings would also make agencies more aware of the financial risks of
over-relying on land-use regulation to achieve statutory goals. 

<P>     There is a fundamental distinction between government actions that
incidentally affect land values -- positively or negatively -- and those that affect property values because they are directed at particular properties.
Property values are not the fundamental issue in the property rights debate.
Compensation should be paid when the federal government acts so as to
deprive a property owner of a right to use and enjoy that property.  Yet
property rights, properly understood, do not include the right to injure or
harm the person or property of another.  This means that when the government
limits or prohibits the use of property in a manner that is likely to harm
another person or property -- what would be considered a nuisance under
common law --  no compensation is called for.  However, should the government
limit the use of property for some other purpose, such as the provision of
wildlife habitat or some other "public good," compensation should be paid. 

<P>     Because the government does not pay for the costs of regulatory takings, it
overuses coercive land-use regulations to achieve environmental goals, even
when other approaches are available. Reviews of incentive-based wetland
conservation programs have concluded that such programs are far more
cost-effective than land-use regulation.  Forcing agencies to pay for the
private property rights that they take through regulatory action will
encourage them to examine non-regulatory approaches to achieving their
statutory goals. Being forced to bear the costs of regulation can markedly
change agency behavior. 

<P>     It must also be recognized that efforts to regulate land use -- to "take"
private property without compensation -- are often bad for both landowners
and the environmental values that the government regulation is designed to
protect.  By making the ownership of wetlands or endangered species habitat
a liability, federal land-use regulation actually discourages stewardship by
private parties.

<P>     Private property should be viewed as the cornerstone of environmental
protection.  Whether the owner is seeking a profit on the property or not,
self-interest still provides a powerful incentive to preserve, if not
enhance, the value of the resource.  Not all property owners will follow the
incentives, but, in the aggregate, most property owners will.  The
institution of private property promotes stewardship and conservation.  In
fact, the private sector provides a wide array of environmental amenities,
typically in a more effective and responsive manner than the federal
government.   Moreover, if private property rights are respected by the
federal government, then those lands protected privately are not dependent
upon the vicissitudes of politics for their preservation.  

<P>     Property rights are important for both economic and environmental reasons,
and must be protected from both government regulation and private
malfeasance.  Compensating landowners when they are deprived of the
reasonable use of their land will not produce environmental catastrophe.
Far from it.  In many cases it will eliminate the negative environmental
incentives created by the heavy hand of existing government regulations.
Properly understood, property rights do not undermine sound environmental
conservation, they lie at its foundation.

<H2>Property Rights and &#145;Takings&#146;</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>The &#147;takings clause&#148; of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution
reads, &#147;nor shall private property be taken for public use without just
compensation.&#148;  Despite this clear admonition, federal environmental
regulations routinely &#147;take&#148; the property of American citizens
without compensation by denying them the reasonable use of their land.
Fairness demands that this practice be put to an end. Landowners should be
compensated for all regulatory takings of their land.<p>
	In the 1960 Supreme Court decision of <i>Armstrong v. U.S.</i>, the Supreme
Court wrote that the primary purpose of the Takings Clause is &#147;to bar
Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all
fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.&#148;  When a
landowner is forced to provide a portion of his or her land for public purposes
&#151; such as species habitat, wetlands, &#147;greenways,&#148; and the like
&#151; this principle should apply.<p>
	Environmental laws, such as the <A HREF="/ebb/esa.html">Endangered Species Act</A>, were passed by
Congress to benefit the public as a whole.  It is only fair that the burden of
these laws be paid for by the public as a whole, rather than by those
unfortunate landowners whose property happens to have characteristics that are
valued by the public at large.<p>
	Consider the following examples:<p>
<ul>
<li>	In Utah, Brandt Child planned to build a campground and golf course on his
property.  The project came to an abrupt halt when the Fish and Wildlife
Service declared that the land contained habitat for the endangered Kanab
Ambersnail.  The area was fenced off and Child was forbidden to work in the
area.  Child&#146;s land has been effectively taken by the federal government
because he can no longer use it.  He has estimated his losses at $2.5
million.<p>
<li>	Margaret Rector owns a 15-acre parcel of land in Texas, originally purchased
to fund her retirement.  The land was valued at over $830,000.  After it became
subject to federal regulation under the Endangered Species Act, the value
dropped to just over $30,000. <p>
<li>	In the case of <i>Dolan v. City of Tigard</i>, the Dolans learned that they
could only receive a permit to expand their plumbing supply store if they gave
the city of Tigard 10 percent of their land for use as a bike path and
&#147;greenway.&#148; The Supreme Court ruled in 1994 that this amounted to a
taking of private property without just compensation.<p>
</ul>	<p>Congress should reaffirm the Constitutional protections afforded to private
property rights.  In particular, Congress should:<p>
<ul>
<li>	Require federal regulatory agencies to compensate landowners for all
regulatory takings;<p>
<li>	Require that compensation be paid directly from the budget of the agency
responsible for the regulation that resulted in a &#147;taking&#148;;<p>
<li>	Instruct regulatory agencies to analyze their regulations to determine when
takings will occur; <p>
<li>	Reform the Tucker Act to remove obstacles that prevent victims of regulatory
takings from pursuing their claims in federal courts;<p>
<li>	Bar agencies from engaging in regulatory takings, even when landowners are
compensated, except in those cases where such actions are required to achieve
explicit statutory requirements.<p>
</ul>
Property rights are the foundation of a free society and a free market economy.
They must be protected.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Isn&#146;t the &#147;takings&#148; movement really about forcing the
taxpayer to pay polluters not to pollute?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  Not at all. All individuals should have the right to use their property as
they see fit, provided that they are not inflicting harm upon others.  This
means that there is no right to pollute the property of one&#146;s neighbor,
and that government actions that prevent identifiable harms do not require
compensation.  Compensation for &#147;takings&#148; is about compensating
landowners when the government tells them that they cannot make reasonable use
of their land, such as building a home, planting crops, or perhaps just
maintaining species habitat.  Yet these are all examples of actions that have
been prohibited by the government on private lands. These are the type of
instances that &#147;takings&#148; compensation proposals seek to address.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Will compensating landowners for &#147;takings&#148; bankrupt the
government?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  If regulatory agencies continue to conduct business as usual, it certainly
could cost the government a lot of money to compensate landowners.  However,
ensuring that landowners are compensated for regulatory actions that deprive
them of the reasonable use of their land will restore accountability to
regulatory actions by forcing agencies to consider the costs, economic and
otherwise, of their regulatory decisions.  The Congressional Budget Office has
determined that requiring compensation for regulatory takings would not affect
federal receipts or the federal deficit if compensation for regulatory takings
is paid from pre-appropriated agency funds.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Will forcing regulatory agencies to engage in &#147;takings&#148;
assessments bog them down in red tape and prevent them from fulfilling their
duties, such as protecting the environment?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  Adding this small requirement onto existing review, public notice and
comment procedures should not hinder any agency from achieving its mission.
The federal government is always required to file an environmental impact
statement when undertaking a new initiative.  All that &#147;takings&#148;
advocates ask, is that the federal government give the same deference to the
Constitutional rights of American citizens and assess how those rights may be
impacted by regulatory activities.  <p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Don&#146;t landowners receive government-conferred benefits
(&#147;givings&#148;) that increase property values and offset the costs of
regulatory takings?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  Those benefits that government provides to citizens through building roads
and bridges, providing police and fire protection, and the like, are paid for
through taxes and user fees.  Therefore, property owners have already paid for
so-called &#147;givings,&#148; and will pay even more, in the form of higher
property tax assessments, if government actions increase the value of their
property.  Such generic &#147;givings&#148; to the public as a whole do not
justify the selective imposition of stringent land-use controls on private
landowners.</td></tr></table>

<H1>Regulation vs. Conservation</H1>
by <A HREF="/staff/adler.html">Jonathan H. Adler</A>, May 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>
For the past two decades, federal land-use control has been the primary means of protecting endangered species and ecologically-sensitive lands.  Laws such
as the <A HREF="/ebb8.html">Endangered Species Act</A> and the <A HREF="/ebb5.html">Clean Water Act</A> have been used to erect a
Byzantine array of bureaucratic requirements that landowners must meet to make
productive use of designated lands.  As a result, all manner of activities have
been effectively barred on private land, including the construction of homes,
repairing of fences, planting of crops, and so on.   In extreme instances,
landowners have even been prevented from clearing firebreaks to protect their
homes or repairing levies that protect lands from flooding.<p>
Such federal regulation is extremely burdensome for private landowners,
particularly those who own small parcels.  A landowner who wakes up one morning
to find that her land has been declared a wetland by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers can face economic ruin as a result.  When the use of property is
encumbered by regulatory restrictions, its value falls.  This is unfair to the
majority of landowners who want to make use of their land in a nonharmful
manner.  <p>
Many current environmental regulations also violate the clear intent of the
Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which holds ". . . nor shall private
property be taken for public use without just compensation," the opinions
of various federal courts notwithstanding. In <i>Armstrong v. United States</i>
the Supreme Court held that the Constitutional prohibition on uncompensated
takings "was designed to bar government from forcing some people alone to
bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the
public as a whole."  Thus when the federal government condemns a piece of
private land to create a publicly-desired resource, such as a military base,
road, or wildlife preserve, it pays the land's owner for the value of the
property.  However when the government regulates the use of the same private
land for a similar purpose, it rarely pays a dime.<p>
Many environmental lobbying organizations maintain that extensive federal
land-use control is necessary to safeguard environmental values.  If
development near endangered species habitat or wetlands is not controlled by
federal regulation, they argue, America will face ecological ruin.  This is
simply nonsense.  Not only is federal land-use regulation not necessary for
environmental protection, in many cases it is counterproductive.<p>
By regulating those private lands deemed ecologically valuable, the government
effectively penalizes private landowners for engaging in the sound stewardship
of land.  Sam Hamilton, former Fish and Wildlife Service administrator for the
state of Texas explains this more fully: "The incentives are wrong here.
If I have a rare metal on my property, its value goes up. But if a rare bird
occupies the land, its value disappears."  <p>
This is what happened to Ben Cone, owner of 8,000 wooded acres in North
Carolina.  In the course of his selective logging operations, Cone carefully
managed his land so as to attract wildlife.  When the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service (FWS) found endangered red-cockaded woodpeckers on part of his land,
the agency placed it off limits to logging.  As a result, the value of
Cone's land dropped by over $1 million.  Cone not only stopped making his
land more hospitable to woodpeckers, he also filed suit against the federal
government, alleging a violation of his Fifth Amendment rights.<p>
Individuals have lost more than money due to environmental land-use controls.
Maryland conservationist Bill Ellen ran afoul of federal wetlands regulations
in the process of constructing two duck ponds and other wildlife habitat.  For
a technical violation of the law, which produced no documented environmental
damage whatsoever, Ellen was sentenced to six months in jail.<p>
This heavy-handed regulatory approach is no way to encourage conservation.
Consider what would happen if the government were to declare a policy of
"protecting" pretty houses by imposing a series of regulatory
restrictions upon families living in any homes that met the federal definition
of "pretty."  Under such a regime, no rational homeowner would
beautify his home, lest it fall prey to government regulation that could
restrict his freedom in or near his home.  Rather than preserve the stock of
pretty houses in America today, such a policy would likely prevent the
construction or restoration of pretty homes far into the future.  If such an
approach would not improve our neighborhoods, why would it safeguard
environmental quality?<p>

Some in Congress have proposed addressing this concern by forcing agencies to
compensate landowners who are denied the reasonable use of their land by
federal regulation.  Paying compensation would help eliminate the perverse
incentives that are produced by the existing laws.  In the Senate, Majority
Leader Robert Dole is the lead sponsor of the "Omnibus Property Rights
Act" which would require compensation when regulations reduce the value of
regulated properties by more than 33 percent.  The House passed a bill last
year, which only applies to a handful of federal laws and has a compensation
threshold of 20 percent.<p>

The Clinton Administration is unequivocally opposed to compensation proposals.
On December 13, 1995, President Bill Clinton declared his "intention to
veto" the Dole bill "or <i>any</i> similar compensation entitlement
legislation." Moreover, Associate Attorney General John R. Schmidt
expressed opposition to legislation that would merely codify existing Supreme
Court precedent into law, as this might prevent federal courts from giving
regulators even more latitude than they have today.<p>

Rather than support compensation for regulatory takings, the Clinton
Administration has issued a series of minor administrative reforms designed to
lessen the impact of endangered species regulations on small landowners and
those who are engaged in the creation of habitat.  In promulgating these
policies, the FWS acknowledged that imposing uncompensated land-use
restrictions "actually generates disincentives for private landowner
support for threatened species conservation." Yet the
administration's proposed revisions are riddled with loopholes and do
little for landowners.  The exemption for small, residential landowners only
applies to actions taken to protect "threatened" species, though most
federal regulations are aimed at protecting "endangered" species.
Moreover, this exemption only holds when it will not compromise the FWS'
conservation objectives. The other reforms have similar loopholes, and are
similarly inconsequential for landowners.<p>

That federal regulatory agencies are so averse to relinquishing their grip on
private land should come as no surprise.  Accustomed to seizing land through
bureaucratic edict at little to no cost, regulatory bureaucrats will
doubtlessly find paying compensation to be more than a little inconvenient.
Especially if compensation is paid directly from agency budgets, agencies will
no longer view land-use regulation as the environmental measure of first
resort.<p>
If compensation is required, agencies seeking to regulate private land use will
be forced to consider whether regulatory actions cause a taking, and, if so,
whether the benefits of the proposed regulatory action are worth the costs of
paying compensation.  Land-use regulation will only be pursued when the
benefits appear to justify the costs or when other options are impractical or
more costly.<p>

At present the federal government uses coercive land-use regulations to achieve
environmental objectives even when other, more cost-effective, options are
available.  For example, the federal government currently spends millions of
dollars each year administering the Section 404 program, which regulates the
development of wetlands by private citizens.  Small landowners are routinely
prevented from building or expanding homes or modifying landscapes due to the
presence of federally-designated wetlands.  The total cost to public and
private parties of protecting wetlands through Section 404 can reach $300,000
per wetland-acre.  However, non-regulatory, incentive-based programs conserve
wetlands at a fraction of the cost of regulatory edicts.<p>
The costs of conserving wetlands of the nation's three most prominent
incentive programs &#150; the Wetlands Reserve Program, Partners for Wildlife,
North American Wetlands Conservation Act, and the North American Waterfowl
Management Plan &#150; are consistently below $1,000 per acre.  In fact, during
the 1991 to 1995 period, the North American Waterfowl Management Plan conserved
wetlands at a cost of only $254 per acre, and the average cost of conserving
wetlands under the North American Wetlands Conservation Act was only $405 per
acre.  <p>
Compare the costs of these programs with the cost of compensating landowners
for the costs of regulations.  In recent years the federal government has lost
a handful of takings cases resulting from wetlands regulations (all of which,
incidentally, filed by wealthy landowners or corporations &#150; the only ones
who can afford to file such claims under current law).  In these cases, the
cost of compensation alone, excluding interest, lawyers fees and court costs,
has ranged from $30,000 to $230,000 per acre.  As illustrated in the
accompanying graph, there is no question which approach has been more
cost-effective.  Even if the cases cited are extreme examples, magnifying the
cost of conservation-through-regulation by a factor of ten, non-regulatory
programs are still more cost-effective.  Indeed, for the amount of money spent
by the federal government to compensate the owners of 35 acres of regulated
wetlands, non-regulatory, incentive-based programs could have conserved over
700 acres of wetlands.  <p>
Compensating land owners is not anti-environment.  If anything, it will
encourage more effective conservation efforts by the federal government, and
reduce the negative incentives facing the private sector.  Government should
learn to work with landowners, rather than against them.<p>
Existing administrative requirements are insufficient to ensure that agencies
consider the likely impacts of existing policy options.  Many rules are enacted
that produce minimal benefits while imposing extraordinary costs, at the
expense of both environmental protection and Constitutionally-guaranteed
protections.  Only those with an unquestioning faith in the wisdom of
regulatory bureaucracies would wish to leave this situation as it is.

<H1>Cyber Seducers?<BR>
The latest on-line outrage</H1><P>
by <B>Julie DeFalco</B>
</CENTER>



<P><BR>

If you thought the croaking Budweiser frogs were a bad influence on children,
and Joe the smoking camel was even worse, prepare yourself for... Tony the
Tiger?  In cyberspace, no less.<p>

The World Wide Web has been an enormous boon for scaremongers, offering a
continual array of frightening firsts that allegedly create unprecedented
threats to our safety -- and especially our children's safety.  A report released this spring fingers yet another Internet threat: big, hairy spiders of advertising lurk on the World Wide Web, threatening all the Miss (and Master) Muffets out there.  The report, from the Center for Media Education, accuses
Internet sites sponsored by various manufacturers of kid-oriented products such
as breakfast cereal and toys of being not just new places to advertise goods
but "highly manipulative forms of advertising, often disguised as information
or entertainment, [which] could intrude into every corner of the lives of
children."
<p>
	The CME is a Washington-based group "founded in 1991 to promote the democratic
potential of the electronic media."  Its report, entitled "Web of Deception,"
is a petition to the Federal Trade Commission.  Since the Internet is still in its development stage, the CME wants the FTC to take advantage of this "window
of opportunity to develop safeguards to protect children."

<p>
	The CME is offering "guiding principles for regulation" to ensure that "a
complete ban on children's advertising is not necessary."  But its alternative
doesn't leave a lot of wiggle room for advertisers.  Among other things, the CME suggests that "advertising should not be disguised as content" on
companies' Web sites; no promotion or advertising should be allowed on
children's content areas, or "play pages"; and there should be no links between these play pages and company pages, although "discrete underwriting should be allowed."  No direct interaction between "product spokescharacters" (such as
Kellogg's Tony the Tiger) should be permitted, and marketers would not be
permitted to tailor ads to -- or "microtarget" -- individual children. 

<p>
	Complaints about the dangers of advertising to children might seem familiar. The CME is the "designated successor" to Action for Children's Television (ACT), a group of crusaders experienced in decrying the evils of advertising. Act was well known in the '70s and '80s for lobbying against ads for pretty
much anaything targeted at children, including children's vitamins and games of
chance in specially marked packages of sugary cereal.  But ACT's greatest glory
was its near success in banning ads on children's television.

<p>
	In 1978, the FTC proposed an ACT-promoted ban on children's ads because, the agency said, kids are "too young to understand the selling purpose" of ads
during Saturday morning cartoons."  ACT's leader, Peggy Charren, was jubilant. "Never before has there been a better opportunity to help change a system that
permits children to be manipulated for private gain," she declared.  Charren was glowingly portrayed as a David facing many Goliaths; a laudatory
<i>Washington Post</i> article noted that she had come under "incredible
buffeting by the broadcasting, sugar, and food lobbies." 

<p>
	Although the effort ultimately failed, ACT received some fabulous consolation prizes.  Now broadcasters are not allowed to advertize toys during shows which
feature those toys (like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers), and they must clearly separate commercials from the program (for example, by singing, "after these messages, we'll be right back").

<p>
	Today, the technology is different, but the hype is the same: Advertisers are bewitching our children.  Parents are helpless.  Only government can save our
children. 

<p>
	The most revealing thing about the new CME report is not what it contains, but
what it lacks.  It has plenty of lurid descriptions of "manipulative,"
"exploitative," and "seductive" advertising, but the report produces no
evidence of damage.  It merely asserts that "a number of marketing and
advertising practices... are <i>potentially</i> harmful to children" (emphasis added). 

<p>
	Moreover, the report is vague on the details of just how these "new forms of manipulation and exploitation" are really new.  The CME asserts that Internet advertising is unique, but this is only true in the sense that radio ads once differed from print ads, and color TV ads differed from those shown in black-and-white.  Web sites are simply a new generation of advertising, and, contrary to the CME's fears, they are actually less intrusive than are
television and print ads. 

<p>
	Some children's activity pages do have links to advertising sites, but they are labeled and easy to avoid.  For example, one play page is sponsored by
Microsoft.  A bar at the top of the page says so.  When you click on it, you go
to Microsoft's children's page.  If you don't like it, you click back to the original page.  This exercise is only a problem if you are worried that
Microsoft might "have activities designed to keep children engaged for extended
periods of time," that is, that Microsoft might entertain your kids.  At any
rate, in many cases, a child would actually have to type in the Web address of a particular company's Web site to even get to the "incessant hucksterism" that the CME laments.

<p>
	Since the CME has no actual harm to point to in its report, it resorts to scare tactics that range from obvious to silly.  Did you know that "children's online areas are quickly being populated by a growing number of animated
characters and products.  Their purpose is to develop relationships with
children that will foster brand loyalty.  They are hosting online sites and
offering children endless opportunities to play with them"?

<p>
	Shelley Pasnik, co-author of the report, elaborates.  "If a child sees an ad on the 'Net for a product he wants," she says, "and he asks his mother for it,
and she says 'no,' the company has driven a wedge between the parent and child. The parent now looks like the bad guy."

<p>
	That's not a marketing problem; it's a parenting problem.  No matter how hard federal regulators try, they will never stop children from begging for stuff they see on TV, at their friends' houses, and, of course, on the Internet. 

<p>
	Apply Pasnik's reasoning to children meeting Mickey Mouse at Disneyland, and playing with mascots at sporting events, and you begin to see what the CME's real concern is.  The group appears to believe that advertising is all-powerful, and that its "emphasis... on continuing to refine techniques for
creating loyal, lifetime customers" is intrinsically bad.<p>


	Advertsing's purposes in a market economy are essential, and essentially benign: informing potential consumers of the existence and price of products,
new and old.  Since children rarely control their own disposable income, the dangers of having their decisions manipulated by advertising are even less than for adults.  And despite the psychology and communications research the CME
uses to bolster its assertions, the bulk of serious advertising and marketing
literature demonstrate that as children age, they are increasingly skeptical about advertising.  Very young children may indeed be susceptible to ads, but
by the age of 7, the vast majority of children understand the purpose and
techniques of advertising.  Most teenagers are even more skeptical of
advertising than are adults.  "The same cognitive development that enables
children to get around the Web also lets them recognize advertising when they see it," notes John Calfee, a former staff economist with the FTC, now a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

<P>
	If anti-advertising hysteria isn't enough to make the FTC dance to the CME's tune, it has a backup alarm to sound: privacy.  "A growing number of children's areas are now eliciting personal information," the report says.  "Some use incentives [such as free gifts] in exchange for such personal data as e-mail
address."  The CME suggests a ban on companies collecting and selling this
information.

<p>
	The CME has gained some unlikely allies by playing the privacy card.  The Electronic Privacy Information Center, for example, is directly involved with a lawsuit challenging the Communications Decency Act.  It is also dedicated to increasing the availability of privacy programs on the Internet.  Thus, while EPIC does not endorse the content restrictions the CME has proposed, EPIC Director Mark Rotenberg says, "We do support them on the privacy issue because
we think there's a lot of evidence to support it."

<p>
	Again, the Internet's novelty is creating phony distinctions and unwarranted fear of new threats.  Companies are following an old tradition in soliciting
names, addresses and other consumer information on the Internet.  For decades,
children have sent in cereal box tops -- and their addresses -- to get magic decoder rings and other sundries.

<p>
	Parents who do not approve of these practices still have the last word in what goes out online.  Many online services, such as Prodigy, currently offer
separate sign-on accounts so that parents can decide what sort of information each of their children has access to.  Inexpensive software, such as NetNanny,
which prevents children from releasing any personal information, is also widely available.

<p>
	Although the CME is well aware such technologies exist -- the report's appendix lists them -- the report still insists that "the best hope for children is a regulatory framework."  The CME is only skeptical of big business, not big government, which must, in their view, supplant the parent.  It is not "reasonable to expect parents to effectively protect [sic] their children from these practices."

<p>
	Commercial speech has recently been both vindicated and attacked.  The Supreme Court has recognized that the more information consumers have, the better; as Justice Thomas wrote in a recent decision, "all attempts to dissuade legal choices by citizens by keeping them ignorant are impermissible."<p>

	But others haven't heard the word.  The Food and Drug Administration and Philip Morris have both proposed advertising restrictions on tobacco.
Representative Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.), the grandson of a bootlegger, recently introduced legislation to limit alcohol advertising.  Given the regulatory precedent set by the Communications Decency Act, regulation of the Internet in
the name of children could be politically plausible.  "The FTC can regulate
almost any advertising media," says Calfee.  "And they are very actively
looking at the Internet."

<p>
	So far, the FTC's official position is ambivalent.  "This is a new area that developed a lot faster than we thought.  CME's report flags and raises issues
to think about," says an FTC official.  The FTC is primarily concerned with
"the question of how traditional consumer protection applies on the Internet." He raised concerns that sexual predators might "hack" in and obtain personal
information about children under the guise of collecting marketing data.  Also, "there's a long-standing public policy concern about the commercialization of
children," he says.  "The question right now is what combination of
self-regulation [by the industry] and government regulation would be best."  He does admit that "ultimately, it is the parent's job" to monitor what their children do on the Internet.

<p>
	Significantly, the veracity of the information on the Web sites has not been an issue.  It is advertising per se, not fraud, that the CME wants to protect children from.  But they might end up protecting them from Web sites in general.  "Advertising supports the Web," notes John Phillip Jones, professor
of advertising at Syracuse University's Newhouse School of Public
Communications.  "We won't have it without ads."  <p>

	If CME succeeds in forcing companies to dull down or eliminate their advertising, we would have to say goodbye to most of the ad-funded Web sites
for children -- and if the anti-advertising principle spreads in Internet
regulation, possibly for adults, too.  That would leave mostly
government-funded sites.  Talk about manipulation.

<H1>EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
<BR> AND THE PRIVATE STEWARDSHIP
<BR> OF MARINE RESOURCES
</H1>
by Michael DeAlessi

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Until recently, the prevailing notion among regulators was that
fisheries should be open and available to everyone. This assured that fisheries
were subjected to the tragedy of the commons, and led to their worldwide
decline.<p>
Maintaining open access to marine resources encouraged fishermen to develop
technologies that &#147;vacuumed&#148; the seas. In most other industries,
innovations develop to protect and increase the value and/or supply of
resources, but at sea they have only hastened the depletion of fisheries.<p>
Slowly, scholars and regulators are beginning to understand that if fisheries
are to survive, access to them must be limited. People will only work to
conserve resources when they have a vested interest in them. This can be
accomplished either partially or wholly by:<p>
<UL>	
<LI> creating government enforced rights to fisheries (ITQs),<p>
	<LI> creating or allowing common property rights to develop, or<p>
	<LI> creating or allowing private property rights to develop.<p>
</UL>
Government intervention has not allowed common and private property rights to
develop, and so government control has been the norm. Even though governments
are beginning to create rights to fisheries, these rights do not encourage
conservation as well as private rights. Common property promotes conservation,
but as resources increase in value and/or scarcity, private property rights
offer the greatest rewards for protecting resources.<p>
Private property rights encouraged entrepreneurs in the frontier American West
to develop and adapt technologies to protect their property, and as fishermen
secure rights to resources, they will do the same. Technologies exist today
that could be used to enforce ownership in the marine environment, just as
innovations like branding and fencing did in the American West. These
include:<p>
<UL>
	<LI> sonar systems like the IUSS,<p>
	<LI> tagging systems such as the PIT tag,<p>
	<LI> sonar and satellites that monitor areas,<p>
	<LI> submersibles to patrol areas,<p>
	<LI> artificial reefs that create and enhance habitat, and<p>
	<LI> aquaculture systems that farm fish inland, at sea, and on shore.<p>
</UL>
These technologies all offer a promising avenue for fishermen to exert control
over marine resources. Allowing private ownership in the oceans would encourage
their development and increase the private stewardship of marine resources.

<TITLE>CEI EBB: Interstate Transport of Waste</TITLE>

<H2>Interstate Transport of Waste</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>The United States Constitution explicitly forbids state and local governments
from interfering with interstate commerce.  In environmentally-related cases,
the Supreme Court has consistently held that &#147;a State may not accord its
own inhabitants a preferred right of access over consumers in other States to
natural resources located within its borders.&#148;  This is also true of waste
disposal services.  Congress should respect the Constitution and not enact laws
permitting state and local interference with the interstate transportation of
waste, including so-called &#147;flow control&#148; statutes.<p>
	States that seek to limit the interstate transportation of waste argue that
some states should not be the dumping grounds for others.  In effect, they
argue that all states should be self-sufficient with regard to waste disposal
services.  This makes no more sense than arguing that all states should be
self-sufficient with regard to food production, energy generation, or mineral
supplies.  Different regions have a comparative advantage in the provision of
certain goods and services.  Unrestricted commerce throughout the nation
promotes the public interest by allowing specialization to increase efficiency,
lower prices and spur innovation.  This is as true in the field of waste
disposal as it is in any other.<p>
	Trade between states occurs for the same reason as trade between countries.
Trade occurs between parties that seek mutual advantage.  Trade encourages
specialization and greater productivity.  The ability of waste disposal
companies to attract business from other states increases the incentive to
develop the most efficient and environmentally-sound waste disposal processes.
Limiting the interstate transportation of waste eliminates these incentives,
and can actually have a negative impact on the environment.<p>
	Related to limitations on the importation of out-of-state waste are so-called
flow control ordinances.  These local ordinances require local businesses to
process and/or dispose of waste at a predetermined facility.  This prevents
companies that generate waste from seeking the most efficient means of
disposing of that waste.  The Supreme Court has properly ruled that flow
control ordinances are unconstitutional violations of the interstate commerce
clause.  Such ordinances are also unreasonable infringements upon the right to
contract.  They discriminate against out-of-state companies, increasing waste
disposal prices at the expense of the consumer and the environment.<p>
	Reauthorizing the use of flow control would be a step backward in the handling
of municipal solid waste.  Rather than encourage expanded markets in solid
waste management that would foster greater efficiencies and innovation, flow
control would establish protected government monopolies that have no incentive
to increase the quality of their services.  According to one study, flow
control can increase the cost of waste disposal by as much as 40 percent.
Waste management prices would be set by political forces, without regard for
market pressures. Equally important, flow control laws unnecessarily inhibit
the ability of recyclers and other ecological entrepreneurs to compete in the
marketplace. <p>
	It is one thing for governments to impose health and safety regulations that
affect the transportation of waste.  It is quite another for governments to
limit the transportation of waste, as several states have tried to do.
Congress should refrain from authorizing any state or local infringements upon
interstate commerce in solid waste and waste disposal services.<p>
<i>Q:  Which states are most involved in shipping waste elsewhere and
why?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Most states <i>both </i>import and export solid waste.  In 1992, for
example, 47 states exported waste and 42 states imported waste from other parts
of the country.  Interstate trade in waste occurs because communities and waste
disposal companies are always looking for the least expensive and most
efficient means of handling trash.  Sometimes this means using a local landfill
or recycling facility, in other cases it means hauling the waste to a facility
somewhere else, perhaps across state lines.  <p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Why should some states be the dumping grounds for the rest of the
country?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Each region of the country has particular features &#150; geography,
population density, natural resource deposits, access to water, etc. &#150;
that make it particularly suited for the provision of particular goods and
services.  Just as some parts of the country are more suited for coal mining or
orange growing than others, some parts of the country have a comparative
advantage in the provision of waste disposal sites and services.  Some
communities reap significant economic benefits by providing waste disposal
services for other parts of the country.  Indeed, these communities see
importing waste as an opportunity, not a burden.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Don&#146;t local flow control ordinances enable municipalities and
counties to manage solid waste in a more environmentally sound manner?</i><p>
<p>
A:  The experience of most communities with flow control laws is that such
rules are used to prop up inefficient facilities at the expense of consumers
<i>and</i> environmental improvements.  By mandating that local waste haulers
use particular management facilities, they are prevented from using less
expensive or more environmentally-sound alternatives that may exist elsewhere.
The Sierra Club, for one, has pointed out that these regulations often inhibit
the development of recycling facilities and other waste management alternatives
in the marketplace.  This is why most major environmental organizations oppose
Congressional authorization of flow control.  It is actually likely that flow
control laws do far more environmental harm than good.

<H2>Mandatory Recycling</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Recycling can be a useful exercise, reducing the need for raw materials and
the costs of waste disposal.  Recycling can also be a wasteful use of energy,
time and money.  Even from the environmental standpoint, recycling is not
always the best option.  The benefits of recycling, environmental and
otherwise, vary on a case-by-case and material-by-material basis.  Recycling
can even impose environmental costs, such as the sludge generated from
recycling paper or the increased energy use of collecting and sorting some
recyclable products.  Whether or not to recycle a particular material or
product should be determined by the marketplace, not by government fiat.<p>
	The primary problem with recycling is that for most materials it is far more
expensive to sort, collect and process recyclables than it is to use raw
materials.  Indeed, the costs of collection alone are often more than the value
of the recyclable materials.  Where using recycled materials is not more
expensive than other options, recycling typically occurs absent government
intervention.  Thus mandatory recycling programs act as a hidden tax on
consumers who must pay for the additional cost of recycling through higher
prices, higher local taxes, or higher waste hauling assessments.  It is likely
that most people who support recycling are not aware that it will cost them
more.<p>
	A variant of mandatory recycling is to mandate a set percentage of recycled
content for particular products, such as newspapers.  As with other recycling
mandates, recycled-content laws increase costs for consumers while providing
minimal benefits.  For example, it has been estimated that a 25 percent
recycled-content standard for plastics would increase the price of soft drink
containers by 10 percent.  Additionally, some materials that are more difficult
to recycle are actually to be preferred on environmental grounds, because they
are lighter, more compact, and require fewer resources to manufacture (the
widely popular &#147;juice box&#148; is a perfect example of this).  Finally,
politically determined recycled-content mandates will always be set at
arbitrary levels.  There is no environmental basis upon which to prefer 10
percent recycled content over 12 percent or 7 percent.<p>
	It is important to remember that when recycling costs more than other options,
this reflects the higher value of resource expenditures required to recycle.
Dedicating these resources to recycling means that they cannot be used for
other things, no matter how useful or important.  If driven by the market,
recycling will only occur where it is the most efficient use of resources.  If
driven by politics, recycling will be an expensive and wasteful policy.<p>
	The United State generates approximately 200 million tons-per-year of
municipal solid waste.  There is no doubt that some portion of this will be
recycled.  How much should be determined by market forces, rather than by
government-imposed mandatory recycling or recycled-content laws.  <p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Don&#146;t we need to recycle because we are running out of landfill
space?</i><p>
<p>
A:  No. 200 million tons sounds like a lot of solid waste to dispose of in one
year.  However, disposing of that waste in landfills poses little problem for a
nation nearly three million square miles big (not including Alaska).  Indeed,
all of the solid waste produced in the United Sates over the next one-thousand
years could be landfilled on less than one-tenth of one percent of
America&#146;s land.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Doesn&#146;t recycling save resources?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Sometimes recycling does save resources.  Recycling aluminum, for example,
saves energy, and consequently money as well.  This is why aluminum has been
recycled for decades even without a government mandate.  In other instances,
however, recycling may not save resources.  Recycling may require a greater use
of energy or water, or even labor and money &#151; all of which are important
resources.  Finally, it needs to be recognized that as resources become scarce,
their prices rise.  This gives the market a signal to begin conserving,
recycling or developing alternatives.  Recycling can be encouraged by the
market in this way, without political intervention.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Doesn&#146;t recycling a ton of paper save 17 trees?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Not necessarily.  Demand for paper is not a significant factor in
deforestation.  Most paper is made from either sawmill waste, scrap wood, or
trees planted solely for that purpose.  The planting of trees has been a key
factor in the growth of America&#146;s forests during the past several decades;
timberland acreage has increased by approximately 10 percent since 1952 and
there are now more trees in America&#146;s forests than at any other time in
this century.  In fact, by reducing the demand for paper, recycling could
actually discourage timber companies from planting more trees.

Mismanaging Municipal Solid Waste</H1>

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>Everyone knows that the United States faces a Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)
crisis.  The nation is throwing away too much and landfill space is running
out.  Everyone also knows that the nation is responding with laudable efforts
to convert waste into energy, to recycle, and to reduce the volume of trash.<p>
<p>
Unfortunately, what &#147;what everyone knows&#148; turns out to be wrong.  The
reality is that:<p>
<p>
<UL>
<LI>MSW presents  a minor national housekeeping problem, not a crisis.<p>

<LI>The responses are for the most part pointless, wasteful and both
environmentally and economically destructive.<p>
</UL>
<p>
In 1990, the U.S. produced about 195 million tons of MSW.  This may sound like
a lot, but the practical import is small.   Compressed to the average
30-pounds-per-cubic-foot density that exists in a landfill, a year's worth of
MSW could be placed on one square mile of land, in a pile less than 500 feet
high.  Given that the nation has 3 million square miles of territory, and that
landfills can be covered over and used for other purposes, finding sufficient
space for MSW disposal is simply not a serious problem.  Already, the
combination of improved transportation combined with the construction of
&#147;megafills&#148; that can handle massive volumes of trash is putting many
problems well on the way to solution.<p>
<p>
One response to the assumption that space is at a premium has been the
construction of 170 incinerators to burn waste and produce energy.
Incineration does not appear to be a particularly efficient method of either
waste disposal or energy production, however, and combining the two functions
does not solve the problems of either.<p>
<p>
Perhaps the most prevalent response to the we-are-running-out-of-space argument
is recycling.  As of 1993, 39 states and the District of Columbia had some form
of recycling law.  Over 5,000 curbside pickup programs were in operation. <p>
<p>
 Most substances in MSW are at least potentially recyclable, and proponents
tend to equate possibility with practicality.  Much recycling makes no economic
sense because the effort uses up resources&#151;capital, energy,
labor&#151;that are worth more than the value of the recycled product.   <p>
<p>
Recycling raises complicated technical and economic issues that do not yield
easily to arbitrary policies cut from ideological cloth.  Three points are
crucial: <p>
<UL>
<LI>Recycling is itself a manufacturing process.  It uses resources of energy,
capital and labor, and produces wastes.  Recycling is not automatically
superior, as a matter of either economics or morality, to the process of
manufacturing a product from original raw material.<p>
<p>
<LI>It is very difficult to generalize about recycling, and careful attention must
be paid to the particular characteristics of individual industries and
products.  Steel, aluminum, glass, paper, plastic, and yard waste each presents
a different set of issues.<p>
<p>
<LI>Recycling requirements have a potential to undermine the quality of industrial
products and processes.<p>
</UL>
<p>
Most of the substances that are commonly recycled&#151;aluminum, steel, glass,
and some paper and plastic&#151;have some value when delivered in pure form to
a manufacturing plant.  The problem is that for most substances this value is
not great because the ordinary raw materials used to make these substances are
plentiful and cheap.  Collecting, sorting and processing trash is expensive,
and the costs far exceed the value of the materials recovered.  The reality is
that municipalities that expand recycling must cut other programs to subsidize
the effort.<p>
<p>
Recycling is sometimes justified by the arguments that there is a need to
conserve such non-renewable resources as iron ore and petroleum and that
recycling paper saves trees:  neither argument is valid.  Most paper is made
from trash wood or from small trees produced on tree farms.  Thus, recycling
paper has little relevance to preserving majestic trees or old forests.  Proven
reserves of most resources are expanding and commodity prices are declining. <p>
<p>
Despite the defects in the arguments underlying MSW policies, governments are
developing a whole new generation of misguided policies.  These include: <p>
<UL>
<p>
<LI>Requirements that products contain an arbitrary percentage of recycled
material.<p>

<p>
<LI>Compulsory source reduction efforts.<p>
<p>
<LI>Efforts to hold manufacturers responsible for ultimate disposition, as
exemplified by Germany's Green Dot program, and Advanced Disposal Fees.<p>

</UL>
<p>
All of these policies have serious flaws.  Recycled content mandates represent
arbitrary quotas imposed without regard to technical or economic realities.
Yet imposing arbitrary quotas is a silly way to run anything.  The system is
also creating a growing administrative apparatus that will burden both industry
and consumers.<p>
<p>
Source reduction diverts attention from the positive benefits of packaging and
can be harmful.  Reduced packaging can increase spoilage waste, for example,
and mandatory source reduction prevents consumers from making choices about
preferred characteristics.  As with other responses to the MSW crisis, the
result is actually destructive.  <p>
<p>
Manufacturers' responsibility programs combine the worst features of all the
other policies and are based on faulty premises.  An examination of the German
program leads to the conclusion that if has few, if any, benefits.  As with
other misguided MSW policies, it diverts investment into uneconomic uses and
undermines the quality and efficiency of important industries.<p>
<p>
The solution to the MSW non-crisis is to recognize that trash disposal is a
commodity, like coal or asparagus, and to treat it accordingly.  The government
could establish a few rules to avoid externalities and cost shifting, and then
let the free market work.   Operating within this framework, waste disposal
companies, truckers, railroads, municipal officials, recyclers, waste
generators and others could all perform their receptive functions.  The result
would be a complex amalgam of regional landfills, short- and long-haul
transportation by truck and rail, incineration, recycling, and source
reduction.  In a few years people would wonder what all the shouting was about.<p>

<H2>Chapter 9: Rescuing the Oceans</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>

<P>The commercial harvest of ocean fisheries has risen from an estimated 18
million metric tons in the late 1940s to well over 80 million tons today.  an
additional 24 million tons annually is estimated to be taken by local
fishermen.<p>
<p>
After thousands of years of extensive human use, many of the ocean&#146;s
resources have been seriously damaged or depleted by shortsighted practices.<p>
<p>
Out of eighty-one marine fishery stocks examined, fourteen are still considered
to be overexploited, and another thirty-six were being fished at the maximum
capacity, according to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.<p>
<p>
The annual operating costs of the global marine fishing fleet in 1989 were U.S.
$22 billion greater than the total revenues obtained from the sale of fish.<p>
<p>
The worldwide problem of overfishing has its source in the system of open
access and free use, with its norm that only capture confers ownership of the
fish.<p>
<p>
When oceans are part of the commons, users are more interested in extracting
what they can than in stewarding what they cannot own.<p>
<p>
The government has contributed to the overfishing of marine fisheries by
granting to all citizens the right to fish.<p>
<p>
The &#147;open access&#148; treatment of the oceans has allowed superefficient
commercial fishing fleets to deplete the fisheries, in spite of state action to
limit technologies, impose catch quotas, and restrict access to the
fisheries.<p>
<p>
Drift nets, which indiscriminately net and kill any species they entangle, are
an example of the inappropriate measures taken in the absence of property
rights.<p>
<p>
As a first step, individual transferable quotas-a personal right or license,
which may be sold or exchanged, to catch a given quantity of fish-can encourage
better management of fisheries.<p>
<p>
When water-based resources are privately owned, the same legal rights that
enable shopkeepers and homeowners to prevent trespass or property damage can be
used to ward off water resource abuse.<p>
<p>
Attaching property rights to coastal zones would encourage better management of
the fisheries and create legal rights against polluters.<p>
<p>
If coastal property rights are to be effective, they must be clearly defined,
defended against challengers, and transferable.<p>
<p>
The coastal fisheries cooperative associations (FCA) system in Japan is
exemplary of a property rights-based fishing industry. FCA property rights are
sufficient to block potentially harmful or polluting coastal developments.<p>
<p>
In Washington State, where oyster beds may be privately owned, the threat of a
damages suit against terrestrial sources of pollution has protected the state
coastal zones.<p>
<p>
The lobster industry in Maine has developed a fairly effective, if informal,
system of property rights management.  Along the coast, small boat fishermen
strategically place traps within their exclusively owned areas.
Self-enforcement by these fishermen is the common response to interlopers and
trap thieves.<p>
<p>
Aquaculture has great potential to relieve the impact of overharvesting
fisheries while simultaneously increasing the food supply. <p>

<H2>Chapter 8: Water Options for the Blue Planet</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>

<P>U.S. population has increased by 200 percent since 1900; per capita
water usage grew 500 to 800 percent during the same period.<p>
<p>
Global water use has tripled since 1950.<p>
<p>
Water recycling increased more than 400 percent between 1954 and 1985 and is
expected to double again between 1985 and 2000.<p>
<p>
Transferring just 5 percent of agricultural water to municipal uses would meet
the needs of urban areas in the western United States for the next twenty-five
years.<p>
<p>
Estimates show that a 10 percent increase in price would decrease agricultural
water consumption in California by 6.5 percent and cut overall consumption by
3.7 percent in the seventeen U.S. western states.<p>
<p>
Current government policies do not adequately reflect the costs of operation,
maintenance, and capital for water projects and fail to account for the
environmental damage associated with water storage and delivery.<p>
<p>
Special interest groups constitute a formidable political force to block the
efficient allocation of water.<p>
<p>
Inefficient water use prevails in urban areas because consumers do not have to
pay the full cost of the water they use.<p>
<p>
Water overuse adversely affects the environment by reducing water in streams.
Subsidized agricultural drainage water loaded with leached salts and trace
elements was dumped into California&#146;s Kesterson Wildlife Refuge, causing
the death and deformation of many animals, reptiles, and fish.<p>
<p>
Eliminating laws against water marketing and establishing private water rights
would give consumers an incentive to use water more efficiently.<p>
<p>
Removing legal impediments to water markets would allow private firms to enter
the water supply industry and take the burden off the public treasury.  Market
forces could pare demand, boost supply, reallocate water, and end the threat of
water crises.<p>

<H2>Wetlands</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>The federal government has implemented regulations to prevent the destruction
or alteration of America&#146;s wetlands.  These regulations deny private
landowners the productive use of their land without compensation.  These
regulations have bankrupted landowners and even sent Americans to jail for the
&#147;crime&#148; of wetland modification.  The cause of wetland protection is
better served through private conservation efforts than it is by imposing
limitations on the use of private land.<p>
	Under the current, expansive interpretation of section 404 of the <A HREF="/ebb/cleanh2o.html">Clean Water
Act</a>, landowners must obtain a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
before engaging in any activity that may affect a wetland.  Because of how the
federal government defines wetlands, there are over 100 million acres of
protected wetlands in the United States.  Nearly 80 percent of these wetlands
are on private property.<p>
	Wetlands regulations impose significant burdens on owners of private property.
Landowners are routinely denied permits from the Corps of Engineers to modify
wetlands, even when such activities have minimal environmental impact.   Under
these rules, one individual was even sent to jail for building duck ponds on
federally designated wetlands.<p>
	Federal wetlands protections also impse costs on state and local governments.
By prohibiting development, the regulations often depress land values and,
consequently, local government revenues from property taxes.  One study found
that local governments could lose over $180 million in revenue in the state of
Arkansas alone. If the Arkansas analysis is correct, local governments
nationwide could stand to lose up to $6.3 billion in property tax revenues.<p>
	While some argue that section 404 regulations are needed to protect
America&#146;s vanishing wetlands, recent evidence shows that America is
creating more wetlands than are being destroyed.  In 1994, the
government&#146;s top three wetland restoration programs restored a combined
total of 195,000 acres of wetlands.  At the same time, data from the
government&#146;s National Resource Inventory concludes that the U.S. converted
157,000 acres of wetlands to other uses.  In other words, by the end of 1994
there were tens of thousands more acres of wetlands than there were at the
beginning.  This does not even include the achievements of private conservation
organizations, such as Ducks Unlimited.<p>
	When the Clean Water Act is reauthorized, the wetlands protection program
should be reformed, if not eliminated.  Positive reforms would include:<p>
<UL>
<LI>	The compensation of property owners when reasonable use of their land has
been taken by wetland regulation;<p>
<LI>	Elimination of &#147;no net loss&#148; of wetlands as official government
policy;<p>
<LI>	The classification of all wetlands based not on their wetness but on their
ecological value;<p>
<LI>	The replacement of the Section 404 regulatory program with a non-coercive
incentive based program.<p>
</UL>
<P>These steps would enhance the protection of private property without
sacrificing the environmental goal of wetlands protection.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Some say that America is losing 300,000 acres of wetlands a year.  Is
this true?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  No. The 300,000 acre figure is based on an old study that did not account
for both public and private wetland restoration projects.  Current estimates
show that the U.S. has achieved and surpassed no net loss.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  What is wrong with a simple permit process for people who wish to
develop, and potentially destroy, ecologically-important wetlands?</i><p>
<p>
A:  While the permitting process may sound reasonable on paper to some, it has
been extremely onerous in practice.  Under current law, the Corps of Engineers
must approve or reject a wetland modification permit application within 60
days.  However, the average wait for a ruling on a permit application is
currently over a year!  Secondarily, if the federal government is to try and
protect America&#146;s wetlands for environmental reasons, it must account for
the fact that not all wetlands have equal ecological significance.  Some
wetlands perform important water filtration, flood mitigation, and habitat
enhancement functions.  Others are mere bogs and breeding grounds for pests.
It would be more appropriate for the federal government to seek to protect the
highest-value wetlands, and the ecological values they promote by encouraging
private conservation efforts, than to impose a blanket wetlands protection
policy.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  How can wetlands be protected without the Section 404 program?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  Programs such as the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, the Partners
for Wildlife Program and the Wetlands Reserve Program are far more effective at
protecting and restoring wetlands than the 404 program.  These programs
routinely conserve wetlands at a cost of $500 per acre &#151; sometimes even
less.  Regulatory programs, on the other hand, conserve wetlands at far greater
cost &#151; as much as $300,000 per acre when both public and private costs are
considered.  Voluntary, incentive-based programs, in combination with private
efforts, are largely responsible for the current achievements on wetlands and
exceeding no net loss.

The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is a pro-market, public policy group
committed to advancing the principles of free enterprise and limited
government.  Founded in 1984 by <A HREF="/staff/smith.html">Fred L. Smith, Jr.</A>, CEI emphasizes the
marketing and implementation of classical liberal ideals. <p>

<p>CEI utilizes a five-point management approach to affecting public policy:
analysis, education, coalition building, advocacy and litigation.  Its purpose
is to advance the free-market agenda, believing limited government and
competition best serve the public interest.<p>

<p>A non-profit, tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, CEI relies entirely on donations from corporations, foundations, and private individuals with an interest in restoring individual liberties and
economic freedom. <I>All contributions are tax deductible.</i><p>

<B>General Counsel<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:kazman@CEI.org">kazman@CEI.org</A></B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>Sam Kazman is General Counsel of the <A HREF="/">Competitive Enterprise Institute</A>, a
free market advocacy organization headquartered in Washington, D.C.  CEI is
dedicated to advancing private solutions to regulatory issues, and to
promoting public awareness of the often hidden costs of government regulation.

<P>Mr. Kazman has been extensively involved in public interest litigation and policy analysis, especially in areas of safety regulation.  In 1992 he won a
federal appeals court ruling that the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration had illegally concealed the lethal effects of CAFE (the
federal auto fuel economy program) on highway safety.  This marked the first
judicial overturning of a CAFE standard in the program's history.  
His writings include "Deadly Overcaution:  FDA's Drug Approval Process"
(<I>Jrnl. of Regulation and Social Costs</I>, Sept. 1990), "Death By Regulation" (<I>Regulation Magazine</I>, Fall 1991), "Saying Yes To Drugs" (<I>Jrnl. of Regulation
and Social Costs</I>, June 1992), and "Purer Politics, Greasier Pigs and Other
Wonders of Campaign Reform" (<I>Regulation Magazine</I>, Summer 1992).  He has been a guest on such shows as The Larry King Show, Crossfire, McNeil-Lehrer and
Good Morning, America, and was a script consultant on CEI's recently
produced documentary, "Science Under Siege," an examination of politicized
science and toxic scare stories.

<P>Mr. Kazman directs CEI's <A HREF="/fmlp.html">"Death By Regulation" Program</A> and is currently
involved in such issues as FDA reform, risk regulation, and First
Amendment/commercial speech questions.

<P>
<BR>
Ike C. Sugg is the Fellow in Wildlife and Land-Use Policy at the <A HREF="/">Competitive Enterprise Institute</A>, a free market research and advocacy organization
headquartered in Washington, D.C.  CEI emphasizes the marketing and
implementation of classical liberal ideals and believes limited government
and competition best serve the public interest.

<P>At CEI, Mr. Sugg works on <A HREF="/topic.html#biodiversity">wildlife</A> and <A HREF="/topic.html#lands">land use issues</A>, focusing both on the failures of governmental programs and the successes of private conservation
efforts.  Through intensive research, writing and speaking, Mr. Sugg seeks
to heighten public awareness of how government abuses private property
owners and mismanages natural resources.  By showing how private property
rights and economic incentives can work for natural resource conservation,
rather than against it, his work is aimed at reforming failing public
policies (both here and abroad) and fostering greater appreciation for the
ethical and conservation values of human liberty.  

<P>Mr. Sugg has presented his views before Congress, the President's Council on Environmental Quality, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, National Public Radio, CNBC, C-SPAN and other fora.  Some of his recent writings include a chapter in the book <I>Elephants and Whales: Resources for Whom?</I> (Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, UK: 1995); <I>Elephants and Ivory: Lessons from the Trade Ban</I> (IEA Studies on the Environment No. 2, UK: Nov. 1994); "Defining 'Harm' to Wildlife" (<I>The National Law Journal</I>, vol. 16, no. 42; June 1994); "Caught in the Act: Evaluating the
Endangered Species Act, Its Effects on Man and Prospects for Reform"
(<I>Cumberland Law Review</I>, vol. 24:1, 1993-1994); "California Fires -- Losing Houses, Saving Rats" (<I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, November 10, 1993 [which sparked ABC News program "20/20"'s breakthrough coverage of that disaster]); and numerous other articles in <I>The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Times, National Review</I> and <I>The American Spectator</I>, among others.

<H2>Introduction</H2>
by <A HREF="/staff/smith.html">Fred L. Smith, Jr.</A>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Environmental concerns both unite and divide the American people.  Every
American supports the goals of clean air, clean water, and the conservation of
natural resources.  This does not mean, however, that everyone supports
today&#146;s environmental policies.  Indeed, the past few years have seen a
rapid growth in opposition to the form and cost of existing federal
environmental laws &#150; opposition that fueled efforts to reform
environmental laws in the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress, and still demands
significant change today.<p>
	Today&#146;s overly politicized environmental policies too often restrict
economic opportunities while doing little to address legitimate environmental
concerns.  Policies are evaluated more by the pain caused to the economy,
rather than their gain to the ecology.  Environmental priorities have become
more responsive to media-derived sensational fear stories than to sound
science.  As a result, state and local officials are forced to divert resources
from critical local programs to meet arbitrary federal mandates.  Similarly,
landowners throughout the nation find themselves forced to organize at the
grassroots level to defend private property rights against environmental
regulatory assaults.  Small business owners, too, become increasingly irate as
they face ever escalating compliance costs designed to address ever more
infinitesimal environmental risks.  The result?  A growing consensus that
environmental policy is broken and needs to be fixed. <p>
	At the dawn of the information age, it is time to replace a generation of
environmental laws written in the midst of the industrial era &#150; a time
before personal computers, fiber optics, and the internet, a time when wage and
price controls were considered sound economic policy, and a time when
relatively little was known about the human impact on the world around us.  In
short, there needs to be a revolution in environmental policy &#150; a
revolution at least as dramatic and sweeping as that which has transformed the
rest of society. <p>
	<A HREF="/">The Competitive Enterprise Institute</A> has spent much of the past decade
advocating that critical reappraisal of environmental policy.  As a former
staffer at the Environmental Protection Agency, I have seen first hand how
misguided many environmental policies have become, and how easily environmental
protection can become a pretext for sacrificing individual liberties and the
economic well-being of the poor to a green regulatory hydra.  What is needed is
for all of us to take environmental issues seriously and to open our eyes to
new approaches, to a new environmental vision.<p>
	The environmental vision that CEI advocates is one that empowers individuals
and communities, not government bureaucrats.  CEI believes that the best
defense of environmental resources comes from property rights, competitive
markets and common law liability rules, not politically determined and enforced
regulation.  This view is commonly referred to as &#147;free-market
environmentalism.&#148;  <p>
	Under this approach, private stewardship arrangements would be encouraged to
empower all Americans to protect those environmental amenities they value most.
Free market environmentalism relies on entrepreneurial creativity, voluntary
associations, and private property arrangements to rescue ecological resources
now exposed to the tragedy of the commons.  Such an approach would reform the
institutional arrangements for addressing environmental risk by incorporating a
recognition that regulations can create risks as easily as they alleviate them;
there are indeed risks in technological change, but there are also large risks
in technological stagnation.  <i>Both</i> should be considered. Free market
environmentalism seeks to integrate ecological and economic values &#150;
seeing people as a part of nature, rather than as alien transgressors in the
Garden of Eden.<p>
	This <i>Environmental Briefing Book</i> &#150; the second edition produced by
CEI &#150; is designed to help citizens, candidates, and policy-makers share in
the free-market environmental vision and to better understand a range of reform
policies that would reorient environmental policy to complement our political
and economic freedoms, rather than to restrict them.  It promotes the greater
use of voluntary arrangements and private institutions, over the continued
reliance upon the coercive power of the state.<p>
	The <i>1996 Briefing Book</i> is expanded &#150; and we hope improved &#150;
from the 1994 edition.  The first section of this book is a series of brief
essays to summarize the insights and policy prescriptions of  free-market
environmentalism.  The latter section consists of brief summaries on key issues
that will confront policymakers during the next few years.  We have included a
selected bibliography for those who wish to learn more about the free-market
approach to environmental issues.  The CEI environmental staff &#150; one of
the largest free market environmental programs in the world &#150; is also
ready, willing and able to explain CEI positions and to discuss the research upon which CEI&#146;s positions are based.<p>
	Free market ideas have swept across the world in the past decade, improving
both the equity and efficiency of the world economy.  The virtues of the free
enterprise system and the individual liberties upon which it rests are widely
recognized as never before in human history.  Tragically, current environmental
policies threaten a return to the errors of centrally-planned societies.  CEI is working to change that.  We hope that this monograph will encourage you to as well.

It has become conventional wisdom that free trade and economic growth
reduce environmental quality.  In this speech delivered at the Cato Institute
Conference, Liberty in the Americas:  Free Trade and Beyond, Fred Smith
demonstrates that the reverse is true.  Bureaucratic controls and trade
restrictions can be as damaging to the ecology as they are to the economy.<p>

<i>The Less is More Mantra:  The Greens' Growing Control of American
Energy Policy</i><p>
Modern-day Malthusians are trying to put Americans on an energy diet.  Fred
Smith, in his speech to the Cato Institute Conference on National Energy
Policy, points out the errors in their thinking and proposes a free market
solution to encouraging energy efficiency.<p>
January 1992        $4.00<p>




<HR NOSHADE>
<i>Europe, Energy and the Environment:  The Case Against Carbon Taxes</i><p>
Delivered at the Aspen Institute conference in Berlin, Smith laments Europe's
reliance on failed central planning to determine the "desired" amount of energy
use.  Precisely because our environment is so important, we should not relegate
it to the political arena.<p>
January 1992        $4.00<p>




<HR NOSHADE>
<i>Images of the Scientist in Literature:  Prometheus Bound and
Frankenstein</i><p>
What will happen to a society that turns back progress?  Fred Smith examines
the models of scientist as innovator and scientist as destructor in
literature.<p>

<HR NOSHADE>
<i>Making Sense of Sustainable Development:  A Free Market Approach to
Environmental Issues</i><p>
Fred Smith, in a provocative speech delivered at the University of Geulph,
Ontario, challenges the assumption that prosperous free economics cannot
simultaneously provide continued economic growth and environmental
protection.<p>
September 1991           $4.00<p>





<HR NOSHADE>
<i>Science and Science Policy:  Can Environmental "Science" Inform
Environmental Politics?</i><p>
Fred Smith examines the recent politicization of science and the implications
for using science as a tool for public policy.  Delivered to the Cato Institute
Conference on Global Environmental Crises.<p>
June 1991      $4.00<p>

<i>A Free Market Environmental Program for the Soviet Union</i><p>
Fred Smith urges the Soviets not to follow the lead of the U.S. in
environmental policy, but to base their policies on the principles of property
rights.  Delivered at the Cato Institute Conference, Transition to Freedom:
The New Soviet Challenge in Moscow. <p>

<H1>Green but Anti-Government</H1>

<A HREF="/staff/adler.html">Jonathan H. Adler</A>, August 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>Numerous opinion surveys have documented widespread public support for
environmental protection.  Polls routinely find that over 70 percent of
Americans characterize themselves as environmentalists and seek stronger
environmental protections.
	
<P>To the media and inside-the-beltway pundits, such poll numbers provide the justification for urging ever-greater expansions of the regulatory state and opposing environmental reform.  They are undaunted by the fact that polls also show that Americans are skeptical of federal power.  This is, in part, due to the relatively scant polling conducted to determine which sets of policies Americans believe are most appropriate to address their environmental concerns.

<P>What little polling there has been prior to 1996 does suggest that Americans support many conservative and free-market reforms of environmental policy.

<P>To test the hypothesis that there is broad, untapped support for
decentralized, market-oriented environmental policies, the Competitive
Enterprise Institute commissioned the polling company to perform a
nationwide poll of 1,000 registered voters nationwide.  The poll was
administered June 29-July 2 and has a margin of error of +/- 3.1 percent at
the 95 percent confidence level.  The results of the poll were quite
encouraging, and allow us to make the following generalizations about
American attitudes about environmental policy:

<P>Most Americans support environmental protection, but are not activists.  80 percent of respondents consider themselves either "active environmentalists" or "concerned about the environment but not active," opting for the latter description by a margin of three-to-one. While a majority of respondents claim to consider a candidate's position on environmental issues in the polling booth, few Americans rate environmental protection as their top concern.  Indeed, fewer than five percent of respondents identified an environmental concern when asked to identify "the single most important problem facing the country."  (Just as many respondents identified the "most
important problem" as President Clinton.)

<P>Most Americans support a greater role for state and local governments in
environmental policy, and believe that state and local governments are
better suited to addressing most environmental concerns.  Consider that:
<UL><P>

	<LI> 65 percent of those surveyed believe that state or local government would
do better at environmental protection than the federal government.
<p><li>	 65 percent of those surveyed believe that state or local government
should have primary responsibility for protecting water quality in rivers,
lakes and streams.
<P><LI>	 77 percent of those surveyed believe that state or local government
should have primary responsibility for maintaining and improving drinking
water quality.
<P><LI>	 72 percent of those surveyed believe that state and local governments
should determine what air pollution control measures are used.
<P><LI>	 Only 28 percent of those surveyed support the imposition of unfunded
mandates on state and local governments to ensure environmental protection.
</UL>

<P>Most Americans support private property rights and prefer environmental
policies that do not infringe upon the rights of landowners.  This
conclusion is supported by the following findings:
<UL><P>

<LI>	 64 percent of those surveyed support compensating landowners when
environmental regulations prevent them from using their property.  
<P><LI>	 51 percent of those surveyed believe that environmental protection and
the protection of private property are compatible.
<P><LI>	 49 percent of those surveyed (a plurality) support a non-regulatory,
incentive-based approach to endangered species conservation.
<P><LI>	 45 percent of those surveyed (a plurality) support a non-regulatory,
incentive-based approach to wetlands conservation.
</UL>

<P>Americans support the use of taxpayer funds to promote conservation, but
oppose expenditures that seem to benefit special interests.  Of all the
generalizations, this one may be the shakiest (and the least in line with
free market environmentalism).  Nonetheless, this conclusion is suggested by findings like:
<UL>
<P><LI>	 Those surveyed narrowly support government funding of "environmental
organizations," 45 to 41 percent, but oppose government funding of "groups
that lobby Congress on environmental issues," 64 to 25 percent.
<P><LI> 48 percent of those surveyed believe that a program to conserve wetlands
is an excellent or good use of taxpayer dollars; only 17 percent believe
such a program is a poor or wasteful use of taxpayer dollars.
<P><LI> 69 percent of those surveyed oppose U.S. government support of
international family planning programs.
</UL>

<P>Most Americans support common-sense reforms of regulatory policy.  Or at
least they seem to support what those of us at CEI regard as common sense.
That none of these proposals have been enacted (in conjunction with the
opposition that all of them receive) tells us that there are plenty of folks out there who do not share our sensible views.  Nonetheless, the survey did
turn up the following results.
<UL>
<P><LI>	 68 percent of those surveyed support creating a "regulatory budget" to
set limits on the cost of new regulations.
<P><LI>	 75 percent of those surveyed support a policy to end "regulation without
representation" by requiring Congress to approve newly written federal
regulations before they are enacted.
<P><LI>	 67 percent of those surveyed support a "first, do no harm" environmental
policy that ensures that federal programs are not the cause of environmental
problems before imposing additional requirements or regulations on the
private sector.
</UL>
	<P>To even the skeptical observer, this new survey clearly demonstrates that
Americans do not accept the policy prescriptions put forward by Washington's environmental lobby.  Indeed, if rated by American opinion, rather than the
League of Conservation Voters, few of Congress' environmental reformers
would be classified in the "Dirty Dozen."
	
<P>Most Americans support environmental protection and significant reform of existing environmental laws.  For most Americans, devolution, regulatory
reform, and property rights are consistent with environmental protection.
For most Americans, there is nothing anti-environment about alternative
approaches to environmental policy.
	
<P>The challenge to those who wish to advance reform is to articulate a vision for the future of environmental policy that marries the public's concern for
environmental protection with the preference for limited government
policies. The American people seem to have discovered something that most
policy makers in Washington have not: Extensive federal bureaucracies are
not necessary to advance environmental protection, and there is nothing
anti-environment about pursuing environmental reform.

<H1>Noah Was No Bureaucrat</H1>
<A HREF="/staff/lewis.html">Marlo Lewis</A>, March 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>
Bringing religious concerns into public life is as old as politics itself.
People do not cease having religious convictions when they vote, run for
office, oppose or support legislation, and it is silly to demand of believers
that they leave God out of their hearts and minds when acting as citizens or
officeholders.  Indeed, in a nation founded on the proposition that "all
men are... endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,"
the faithful need make no apology for participating in politics.  <p>
	By the same token, however, when people of faith enter the public arena, they
have a responsibility to respect the institutions that secure their own freedom
as citizens and believers.  In particular, they have an obligation to respect
property rights.<p>
	Private property is the institutional foundation of civil and religious
liberty.  If your home is your castle, then your home can also be your
sanctuary (or your political meeting hall).  Where property rights to land and
other assets are protected, believers can build churches, endow seminaries,
establish religious schools -- and nobody else may lawfully interfere.<p>
	In contrast, where property rights are insecure or nonexistent, the exercise
of religion is hostage to the whims of politicians, bureaucrats, or mobs.  As
the history of the former Soviet Union makes clear, when government owns the
printing presses, paper mills, and book stores, just obtaining a Bible can 
be difficult and dangerous.<p>
	What prompts these reflections are efforts by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
and a group called the Evangelical Environmental Network to mount a theological
defense of the Endangered Species Act.  Recalling that Noah was commanded to
save every kind of living creature, Babbitt claims the ESA serves a divine
purpose: "to protect the whole of creation."  Babbitt suggests that
only a complete philistine, blind to the reflections of divinity in the works
of nature, could possibly oppose the ESA.<p>
	What such sermonizing overlooks is that the ESA is unjust and inhumane.  The
ESA empowers bureaucrats to regulate, and thus effectively "take,"
private property deemed to be endangered species habitat.  Under the ESA,
federal agents can prohibit you from farming, building a home, or even clearing
fire breaks on your own land; fine you up to $100,000 and/or put you in jail
for engaging in the aforesaid activities; and pay you no compensation for the
lost value of your land.  This violates the Bill of Rights ("nor shall
private property be taken for public use without just compensation")
<i>and</i> the Ten Commandments ("Thou Shalt Not Steal").<p>
		God in His infinite goodness can bring good even out of evil, said St.
Augustine; but when mere mortals use bad means, they usually get bad results.
By turning wildlife assets into economic liabilities, the ESA encourages
landowners to destroy habitat, even to "shoot, shovel, and shut up."
The ESA harms the very species it is supposed to protect.  <p>
	Babbitt cites Noah as his inspiration, but Noah was no bureaucrat.  Noah did
not seize anyone's property to build the ark, nor did he tax anyone to
finance the operation.  The supreme irony is that if Noah were alive today, he
would be put in jail under the ESA for capturing and transporting endangered
species without government permission. 	<p>
	Religious fervor is no excuse for forgetting the Golden Rule of democratic
politics:  As you would have your rights be respected, so respect those of
others.  Wittingly or otherwise, ESA apologists presume that their secular or
religious concerns trump the equal rights of other citizens.  Such presumption
is the opposite of the respect required to maintain civil and religious
liberty.  Invoking the Bible to defend an unjust and inhumane law should be
seen for what it is -- a pious fraud.

The Center for Private Conservation (CPC) is a project of the <A HREF="/">Competitive Enterprise Institute</A> that seeks to expand the knowledge and information base surrounding the ability to advance environmental objectives privately, absent government control or influence. 

<P>The Center researches and documents successful private efforts to conserve resources and ecologically sensitive
lands, and analyzes how various legal and social institutions assist or
hinder the ability of private individuals and associations to protect their
environment.  The Center seeks to publicize its findings through
publications, speeches, roundtables, and work with interested organizations.

<H2>Introduction</H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
     For the last decade, taxpayers have footed the bill for farm programs to the
tune of $10 billion a year.  Despite such tremendous expenditures, the American
public has reaped little benefit from this show of federal largess.  Farm
subsidies are no longer needed to ensure food security.  They are no longer
needed to support farm income.  And they are no longer needed to stabilize
agricultural markets.  Their sole purpose is to placate special interests.<p>
<p>
     Not only do these farm programs provide little benefit, they also carry
considerable costs.  Current farm policy, through supply control programs,
raises the price of many farm products.  These same supply control programs
encourage the more intensive use of agricultural land resulting in
environmental stress.  According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
agricultural runoff is the number one source of pollution in the nation&#146;s
rivers, streams, and lakes.<A HREF="agpap10.html#1"><sup>1</sup><p></A>
<p>
     An analysis of data from six major farm states shows that a fifty percent
reduction in subsidies would decrease chemical use by an estimated 17 percent
and fertilizer use by and estimated 14 percent.  The complete elimination of
subsidies could result in a 35 percent reduction in chemical use per acre and a
29 percent reduction in fertilizer use per acre. <p>
<p>
     In addition to commodity programs, other agricultural policies are often
responsible for local or regional environmental abuse.  It is clear, for
example, that the U.S. sugar program is responsible for not only increased
sugar production in south Florida but also more intensive sugar cane
production, contributing to the increased phosphorus contamination of the
Everglades, thus changing the unique nature of the ecosystem.  The elimination
of the U.S. sugar program would likely have a significant beneficial effect on
the environment of the Everglades ecosystem.<p>
<p>
     Another example of increased chemical use is the USDA peanut program.  Under
the peanut program the USDA licenses all peanut farmers and assigns each a
yearly quota.  One of the conditions of the peanut program is that farmers are
required to grow peanuts on the same farm.  This leads to a situation where
peanuts are grown year after year in the same handful of counties and nowhere
else.  In some regions this means that extensive quantities of pesticides are
used.  For example, peanuts grown in Georgia use four times more pesticide per
acre than those grown in Texas.  Obviously, from an environmental perspective
it would be better to grow peanuts where chemical inputs could be minimized.
The current peanut program, however, prohibits this.<p>
<p>
     Overall, both the environment and the consumer would be better off under a
free market agricultural policy.<p>

<H2>Background</H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
     Environmental analysts have often noted that government policies which
encourage more agricultural production from less land can directly conflict
with goals for environmental protection.  This has been observed by both
traditional and free market environmental thinkers.<p>
<p>
     In  their book <i>Free Market Environmentalism</i>, Terry Anderson and Donald
Leal note:<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The negative impact on the environment has been exacerbated by programs that
support commodity prices and reduce risks by subsidizing insurance.  With
returns higher and costs lower than they would be in a free market, farmers
plant more acres and produce more crops.  To reduce the surpluses, federal
programs require farmers to cut back on the acreage planted, but farmers
attempt to circumvent such efforts by using more pesticides and fertilizers to
increase output per acre.<A HREF="agpap10.html#2"><sup>2</sup></A><p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<sup></sup><p>
     Other researchers have come to similar conclusions using econometric and
mathematical models which show that government programs increase the use of
pesticides and fertilizers.<A HREF="agpap10.html#3"><sup>3</sup></A>  A study conducted on North Carolina
coastal plain agriculture, for example, determined that the elimination of farm
programs would have reduced nitrogen leaching due to fertilizer use by 46
percent.<A HREF="agpap10.html#4"><sup>4</sup></A>  Statistical analysis of chemical and fertilizer use has
also indicated that farm programs contribute to more intensive use of chemicals
and fertilizers.  Data from the 1991 and 1992 Cropping Practices Surveys showed
that corn producers who participated in the USDA feedgrain program used
nitrogen, herbicides and insecticides at greater rates than those who did not
participate.<A HREF="agpap10.html#5"><sup>5</sup></A> <p>

<H2>Farm Programs </H2>
</CENTER>


<p>
     The Department of Agriculture subsidizes farmers for growing most field crops,
such as corn, wheat, barley, oats, sorghum, cotton and rice.  They offer the 
farmer a guaranteed price per bushel of commodity.  Consequently, the farmer
has an incentive to maximize his production.<A HREF="agpap10.html#6"><sup>6</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Most direct subsidies to farmers take the form of deficiency payments.  When a
farmer goes to sell his product on the market, if the market price is higher
than the guaranteed price the government pays the farmer nothing.  But if the
guaranteed price is higher, the government pays the difference between the
market price and the guaranteed price.  <p>
<p>
     In the long run, the government ends up paying huge sums of money,
approximately $10 billion a year, directly to farmers.  This occurs because of
two compounding factors.  The guaranteed price is invariably above the market
price.  For example, in 1992 the target support price for corn was set at $2.75
per bushel.  The average U.S. market price that year was $2.05 per bushel.
Wheat subsidies are similarly elevated.  The target price for wheat in 1992 was
$4.00 a bushel, the market price was $3.25 per bushel.  Unless there is a
severe shortage of a particular commodity, the market price will likely stay
significantly below the guaranteed price.  Because the guaranteed price is set
higher than the market price, the farmer has an economic incentive to produce
more.  Consequently, farmers all across the country are increasing the supply
of certain crops beyond what would be produced in a consumer driven market.
But increases in supply drive down the market price, and when the market price
goes down the government has to make higher deficiency payments.  Not
surprisingly, USDA commodity programs routinely spend more than their budgeted
allocations.  For example, predicted budgetary expenditures in the 1990 farm
bill for direct payments were on average 75 percent of actual expenditures.  In
other words, between 1991 and 1994, the USDA actually spent $11.6 billion more
than Congress had anticipated in the 1990 farm bill.<A HREF="agpap10.html#7"><sup>7</sup></A> (See chart
below.)<p>
<p>
     In order to keep its budget under control, the USDA has historically engaged
in policies to drive up the market price of subsidized commodities.  Typically
this is accomplished by requiring farmers who participate in the subsidy
program to set aside a certain portion of their farmland and grow nothing on it
as a condition of receiving the subsidy.  In 1992, for example, the acreage set
aside was 5 percent for corn, sorghum, barley and wheat.<A HREF="agpap10.html#8"><sup>8</sup></A>  In other
words, to participate in the corn commodity program a farmer would have had to
set aside 5 percent of the acreage he would normally plant with corn and grow
nothing on it.<p>
<p>
     Equally important, the USDA also encourages farmers to participate in
voluntary set aside programs where they are paid to keep part of their land
idle.  The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is the best example of such a
program.  Under the CRP, the USDA pays annual rent to farmers who agree to idle
their land for ten years.<A HREF="agpap10.html#9"><sup>9</sup></A>  Currently the USDA has enrolled 36.4
million acres of land into the CRP, an area larger than the entire state of
Iowa.<A HREF="agpap10.html#10"><sup>10</sup></A>  In effect CRP is a supply control mechanism, restricting
the amount of land which is in production.<A HREF="agpap10.html#11"><sup>11</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Farmers participating in the subsidy programs are given tremendous economic
incentives to maximize their yields but they have fewer acres with which to
work.  Consequently, many of those farmers increase their non-land inputs,
typically by increasing chemical and fertilizer use.<p>

<H2>Case Study:<BR> Sugar Subsidies and the Everglades</H2>
</CENTER>




<p>
     The Everglades of South Florida provide a striking case study for the
potential effects of government policies and chemical use on the environment.
<p>
<p>
     In 1948, Congress authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to construct 1,500
miles of canals and levees throughout the area of southern
Florida.<A HREF="agpap10.html#12"><sup>12</sup></A>  This was done in an attempt to control flooding in the
region and promote the farming of sugarcane in the Everglades, a locality whose
soil was uniquely suited to this crop.  The Corps completed its task several
years later.  Over 700,000 acres of land was turned into the Everglades
Agricultural Area (EAA).<A HREF="agpap10.html#13"><sup>13</sup></A>  Through a series of pumps, canals, and
levees, the Corps now diverts over 2.5 million acre-feet of water every year
into the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico.<A HREF="agpap10.html#14"><sup>14</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The drainage project itself has caused several severe environmental problems,
including a shrinking water base for wildlife in the region.  In the twenty
year period from 1953 to 1973, when much of the Corps draining program was in
operation, the state of Florida lost 1.44 million acres of wetlands, almost
entirely in the Everglades region.<A HREF="agpap10.html#15"><sup>15</sup></A>  Furthermore, the state has
lost over fifty percent of the Everglades&#146; original area to drainage and
pollution in the past two hundred years, with much of that loss occurring over
the last fifty years.<A HREF="agpap10.html#16"><sup>16</sup></A>  While there have been some legitimate
concerns about flooding in the area, this drainage would, for the most part, be
unnecessary if the land was not used for agriculture.<p>
<p>
     In addition to the environmental damage caused by the drainage, agricultural
policies encouraging intensive sugar production have exacerbated the
environmental degradation.<p>
<p>
     The federal government has set up several different price schemes in an effort
to promote domestic sugar production.  These supports take the form of
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) non-recourse loans as well as import
restrictions on foreign produced sugar.  While each one seems to operate with a
different goal, their overall, cumulative effect is to support the price of
sugar in the U.S. and allow the increased marginal production of this crop.<p>
<p>
     The CCC non-recourse loans are an elaborate way for the government to
guarantee a minimum price for sugar.  Loans are made to the processors of
sugarcane who purchase the crop at a guaranteed price.  The processors can
store the final product for up to nine months, the time limit of the loan, to
see whether the price of sugar exceeds the USDA's established minimum price.
If it does not, the processors may simply default on their loan and give their
harvest to the USDA which accepts it as payment-in-full.  The dollar
&#147;floor&#148; price for raw sugar cane is 18 cents per pound, nearly twice
the going rate for sugar in the world market-place.<A HREF="agpap10.html#17"><sup>17</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Because the floor price is set so high, if there were no trade barriers for
sugar, domestic buyers would buy their sugar for the world price and sugar
producers would simply default on their loans and take the guaranteed price of
18 cents per pound.  This would leave the government holding millions of tons
of overpriced sugar.  To prevent this from happening, the USDA has established
a tariff-based quota on imported sugar.  Under this quota system, foreign
countries pay a low level tariff for sugar up until the point they reach the
quota set by the USDA.  Once they reach this point, any additional sugar they
export to the U.S. is subject to a 16 cent per pound tariff.<A HREF="agpap10.html#18"><sup>18</sup></A>  This
high duty, which is evaluated every year, allows the USDA to control the amount
of refined sugar coming into the country and maintains high domestic sugar
prices. <p>
<p>
     These higher prices are then passed on to the consumers.  Overall, the sugar
program is estimated to cost consumers $1.4 billion a year.  The higher prices
benefit both producers and processors.  For example, in 1992, farmers of
sugarcane received $161.5 million in benefits because of the commodity program,
and processors received $107.7 million.<A HREF="agpap10.html#19"><sup>19</sup></A><p>
<p>
     What the government fails to take into account, however, is the environmental
impact of their actions.  As already noted, the USDA&#146;s price supports
provide an incentive for farmers to produce more of their crop than they would
if no such subsidies existed.  To take advantage of this incentive, growers are
forced into overusing non-land inputs such as fertilizers, chemicals which
cause extensive harm to the Everglades ecosystem.<p>
<p>
     A major component of fertilizer is phosphorus, a chemical not abundantly found
in the natural water supply of the Everglades.  Due to the extensive use of
fertilizers in farming, a great deal of phosphorus leaches into the
groundwater, which is then pumped out to the Everglades National Park and
Loxahatchee Wildlife Refuge.  A recent study found that up to 80 percent of
phosphorus used in fertilizing sugarcane crops is transferred with drainage
water into the Everglades.<A HREF="agpap10.html#20"><sup>20</sup></A>  Once there, the phosphorus allows many
non-native plants to outgrow and crowd out naturally occurring species.  A
prime example of this phenomenon is the vast replacement of native sawgrass
with non-native cattails in nutrient rich waters.<p>
<p>
     Unfortunately, the consequences of overproduction are not only related to
compositional changes in plant life, but extend higher up the food chain.  The
plants that are appearing as a result of this pattern change cannot support
many kinds of animal life.  Without a ready supply of food, many animals once
common to the Everglades are shrinking in number.  This is not just affecting
certain classes of animals, but the entire food chain.  Bird populations have
been reduced dramatically due to the striking drop in habitat as well as fish
and other aquatic species on which they feed.  One study suggests that the
present number of birds in the Everglades National Park area is only 10 percent
of what it used to be at the turn of the century.<p>
<p>
     Changes in the U.S. sugar policy have accelerated the domestic production of
sugarcane in recent years.  Sugar consumption in the U.S. was 9 million tons in
1981, a level which has seen no overall growth in the past thirteen years.
Sugarcane production in the U.S., however, has increased approximately 26
percent from 1981 to 1991, from 2.7 million tons to 3.4 million
tons.<A HREF="agpap10.html#21"><sup>21</sup></A>  This is due to the increasingly strict tariff barriers set
up by the USDA in an effort to maintain the domestic price of sugar.  In 1977,
the U.S. imported 6.1 million tons of sugar.  By 1993 that amount had dropped
77 percent to only 1.35 million tons.<A HREF="agpap10.html#22"><sup>22</sup></A><p>
<p>
     This increase in production has been accompanied by both increases in land use
and the application of  non-land inputs such as fertilizer.  In Florida, for
example, the acreage that was farmed and harvested for sugar went from 233,000
acres in the early 1970s to 346,000 in the early 1980s to a high mark of
420,000 acres in 1990.<A HREF="agpap10.html#23"><sup>23</sup></A>  Phosphorus concentrations in agricultural
runoff water pumped into Lake Okeechobee from the Everglades Agricultural Area
(EAA) also increased during this time, from a level of  0.095 to 0.314
milligrams per liter (mg/l) between the years 1973 to 1979 to a level of 0.188
to 0.573 mg/l for the years for 1983 to 1985.<A HREF="agpap10.html#24"><sup>24</sup></A><p>
<p>
     It is clear that the U.S. sugar program is responsible for not only increased
sugar production in south Florida, but also more intensive sugar cane
production and its attendant environmental impacts.  The elimination of the
U.S. sugar program would likely have a significant beneficial effect on the
environment of the Everglades.<p>

<CENTER>
<H2> Other Farm Programs</H2>
</CENTER>
<p>
     Various other programs aimed at supporting the farm sector can also have
secondary environmental effects.  For example, market orders are used by the
USDA to control many fruit and vegetable crops.<A HREF="agpap10.html#25"><sup>25</sup></A>  Under market
orders the USDA does not restrict acreage, instead it applies an often strict
standard on the appearance or &#147;quality&#148; of the product.  By
restricting the amount of produce which can qualify as grade &#147;A&#148; the
USDA restricts the amount which can be marketed.  Consequently, market orders
often provide incentives to produce the highest &#147;quality&#148; produce in
order to receive the highest grade and therefore the highest price.  If grades
are determined on the basis of cosmetic standards and cosmetic quality can only
be achieved through high chemical use rates, the production of that commodity
will likely involve greater use of chemicals.<A HREF="agpap10.html#26"><sup>26</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     Another example of increased chemical use occurs in the peanut program.  Under
this program the USDA licenses all peanut farmers and assigns each a yearly
quota.  A farmer cannot sell more than his yearly quota in the domestic market.
One of the conditions of the peanut program is that farmers are required to
grow peanuts on the same farm two out of three years, and the quota must always
be grown in the same county.<A HREF="agpap10.html#27"><sup>27</sup></A>  This leads to a situation where
peanuts are grown year after year in the same handful of counties and nowhere
else.  In some regions this means that extensive quantities of pesticides are
used.  For example, peanuts grown in Georgia use 13 pounds of pesticide per
acre, while those grown in Texas require only 3 pounds per acre.<A HREF="agpap10.html#28"><sup>28</sup></A>
From an environmental, and perhaps from an economic perspective, it would be
better to be able to grow peanuts where chemical inputs could be minimized.
The current peanut program, however, prohibits this.<p>

<H2> Current Fertilizer and Pesticide Use</H2>
</CENTER>

  <p>
     Beginning in the early 1960s, the USDA began surveying the use of fertilizers
and pesticides in the United States.  Since that time pesticide use has more
than doubled and commercial fertilizer use has tripled.  These increases
resulted from increased acreage but more importantly from higher application
rates and increased proportion of acres treated with chemicals (see charts). <p>
<p>
     Total chemical and fertilizer use peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Since then per acre application rates have remained roughly constant at about
2.2 pounds of pesticide per acre and 130 pounds of fertilizer per acre.
Removing current agricultural programs would likely result in a decline of this
use.<p>

<H2>Commodity Programs and Chemical Use</H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
     Every five years the USDA conducts a survey of U.S. agriculture known as the
Agriculture (or Ag) Census.  In the Ag Census, USDA compiles both state and
county statistics.  Included in the 1992 statistics are county by county
chemical use, fertilizer use and government payment statistics.  <p>
<p>
     The states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas were chosen
as the study area.  These six states were chosen for several reasons.  First,
they produce a significant quantity of subsidized crops.  Not all field crops
are subsidized.  The most common subsidized crops are corn, wheat, barley,
oats, sorghum, cotton and rice.  With the exception of cotton and rice all the
other crops are routinely grown throughout the mid-west.  Soybeans are the one
major crop grown in the analyzed region which does not receive direct
government payments or subsidies.  Because soybeans do not receive government
payments they are not included for purposes of subsidized crop acreage.<p>
<p>
     Second, varying soil and weather conditions will undoubtedly affect the
quantity of chemicals and fertilizers which farmers apply.  In order to
minimize this type of variation states were chosen which have roughly similar
growing conditions so that any variations in chemical and fertilizer use due to
subsidy participation would not be overwhelmed by geographical causes.<p>
<p>
     A county by county analysis of the six states showed a significant correlation
between subsidies and chemical use as well as between subsidies and fertilizer
use. Comparisons are based on the amount of subsidy a county received per acre
of subsidized cropland and the amount of chemical or fertilizer purchased per
acre of cropland.<p>
<p>
     USDA statistics do not give the acreage of land in each county which is
subsidized.  This value was computed by taking the percentage of farms
receiving subsidies multiplied by the total harvested crop acreage minus the
acres of harvest soybeans in that county.<p>
<p>
     Government payments per acre of subsidized cropland for each county are
determined by dividing the total amount of government payments received in the
county reported in the Ag Census by the estimated farm acreage enrolled in
subsidy programs.  Chemical and fertilizer rates were similarly computed by
dividing the amount of chemicals and fertilizer purchased in each county by the
harvested cropland acreage.<p>
<p>
     Analyses were initially done which compared subsidy rates with chemical and
fertilizer levels per acre of farmland.  This was considered less accurate as
many types of farmland do not use chemicals or fertilizers.  Idle farmland,
pastureland and dairy farms, although included in farmland acreage, do not
contribute to significant pesticide and fertilizer use.  Normalizing both
subsidy rates, chemical and fertilizer use for the amount of land harvested for
crops gives a clearer picture of potential environmental effects of current
policies.<p>
<p>
     The correlation coefficient of government payments per acre of subsidized
cropland versus dollars of chemical use per acre cropland is 0.61 and for
fertilizer use it is 0.62.  The R squared for chemical use and fertilizer use
is 0.37 and 0.38 respectively.  This suggests that nearly 40 percent of the
variation in chemical and fertilizer use per acre can be explained by
government subsidy programs (see appendix #1).<p>
<p>
     Because there is such variation due to other factors, such as geography, crop
type, prevalence of pests and poor soil conditions, an averaging technique was
used to further clarify the correlation between chemical and fertilizer use and
participation in subsidy programs.  All data points were arranged in sequential
order according to government payments per acre, in ascending order (i.e.
lowest government payments per acre to highest government payments per acre).
Every ten data points were then averaged to yield both an average government
payment and average chemical and fertilizer consumption.  Comparing the ten
county averages gives a clearer picture of the effect of subsidies on chemical
and fertilizer use.  (See charts on pages 11 and 12.)<p>
<p>
     The correlation coefficient for ten county averages is significantly higher,
0.76 and 0.75 respectively.  It should be noted that both graphs show that
beyond a certain point agricultural subsidies have little or no effect on
chemical and fertilizer use.  This is what one would intuitively expect.  As
subsidies are initially offered the incentive to maximize production using
non-land inputs is greatest.  But as more and more chemicals and fertilizer are
used, their marginal benefit is decreased, (i.e. once all the weeds and insects
are killed there is little to no benefit from additional pesticide
applications.)  Consequently, beyond a certain point subsidies do not
significantly effect chemical or fertilizer use.<p>
<p>
     A regression analysis of government payments per acre of subsidized cropland
versus chemical and fertilizer use yielded results which suggest that
government payments contribute significantly to intensive chemical and
fertilizer use.  The upper 95 percent confidence interval of the y-intercept,
where subsidy payments are zero, is $10.42 of chemical use per acre, and $18.18
of fertilizer use per acre.  The average per acre chemical use in the analyzed
region is $16.1 per acre, and the average fertilizer use is $25.7 per acre.<p>
<p>
     The regression analysis suggests that current chemical and fertilizer use is
highly intensive due, in large part, to federal commodity programs.  In other
words, eliminating or reducing the commodity programs would decrease per acre
chemical and fertilizer use.  This model suggests that a fifty percent
reduction in subsidies would decrease chemical use by an estimated 17 percent
and would decrease fertilizer use by and estimated 14 percent.  <p>
<p>
     The complete elimination of subsidies could result in a 35 percent reduction
in chemical use per acre and a 29 percent reduction in fertilizer use per acre.
Although this most likely represents an extreme upper bound, it is not
inconsistent with the findings of Painter and Young in North
Carolina.<A HREF="agpap10.html#29"><sup>29</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Though suggesting that agricultural policies have a significant on-the-ground
effect, in terms of increased chemical and fertilizer use per acre, this model
is of limited value in evaluating scenarios of total chemical and fertilizer
use.  Principally this is due to the fact that as subsidy levels decrease
farmers tend to have increased options for crop production.  For example,
eliminating deficiency payments and the Conservation Reserve Program might mean
that farmers would plant more acres of commodity but use fewer chemicals per
acre.  If enough additional acres were planted more pounds of chemicals and
fertilizers might actually be used.  On the other hand, more acres might be
planted but the reduced use of chemicals and fertilizers might be so great that
even with the additional acreage a total reduction of chemical and fertilizer
use may be achieved.<p>

<H2>Environmental Fate of Agricultural Chemicals </H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
     The addition of larger quantities of agricultural chemicals to crops does not
directly imply increased environmental harm.  The fate of the chemicals once
they have been sprayed on the fields has as much or more to do due with actual
environmental damage as the quantities of chemicals used.  A persistent
pesticide, for example, is more likely to cause environmental harm than one
which degrades quickly in the field before it has a chance to run off into
surface water or seep into ground water.<A HREF="agpap10.html#30"><sup>30</sup></A><p>
<p>
     It is conceivable that the current policy of reduced acreage could result in
less chemicals and fertilizers entering into the surface waters if the land set
aside in idling programs acts as a buffer zone, especially between cropland and
surface water.  The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in particular was at
least initially designed to serve this very sort of function.<p>
<p>
     Originally the CRP was fashioned as a program to reduce soil erosion.  Under
the CRP, land which was considered highly erodible was to be put into the
reserve.  In recent years, however, the environmental benefits of the CRP have
been questioned.<p>
<p>
     One concern with the CRP has been the proximity of CRP land to surface waters.
An analysis was conducted of two Illinois streams to determine the effect of
enrollment in the CRP on sedimentation.<A HREF="agpap10.html#31"><sup>31</sup></A>   A total of 15.6 percent
of the cropland in the first watershed was enrolled in CRP and 26.5 percent of
cropland in the second watershed was enrolled in CRP.  Despite these relatively
high percentages of enrollment the study found that sedimentation in the two
streams was reduced by only 0.0125 and 0.265 respectively.  In other words,
even though a quarter of the cropland was idle, stream sedimentation was
reduced by a mere quarter of one percent.<A HREF="agpap10.html#32"><sup>32</sup></A>  The authors noted that
one of the reasons for this apparent lack of reduction in sedimentation was due
to the fact that, &#147;few of the CRP enrollments were in stream locations
where hydrologic theory indicates they would be most effective in trapping and
stabilizing existing near stream sediments.&#148;<A HREF="agpap10.html#33"><sup>33</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Additional studies have shown that this phenomenon is not isolated to Illinois
streams.  Analysis of the land enrolled in the CRP found that out of 36.4
million acres only 255,000 acres consisted of buffer strips separating cropland
for surface waters or wetlands.<A HREF="agpap10.html#34"><sup>34</sup></A>  An estimated 5.5 million acres of
buffer zones throughout the nation remain as cropland.  To date, acreage idling
programs appear to have negligible pollution control benefits.<p>

<H2>Conclusion</H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
     There is considerable evidence to suggest that many agricultural policies have
a negative effect on environmental quality.  Debate over pollution,
particularly water pollution, has turned away from point source and
increasingly focuses on non-point source pollution.  As a large component of
non-point source pollution, agriculture will increasingly come in conflict with
environmental regulations.  Farmers and farm groups, however, have historically
been resistant to increased environmental regulations.  One possibility which
could both improve the environment and decrease federal spending would be to
phase out commodity and other agricultural programs which have been shown to
have a detrimental effect on the environment.  To date, however, few
environmental lobbying organizations have endorsed this approach.<p>
<p>
     Overall, consumers, taxpayers and the environment would be better off under a
free market agricultural policy.  Direct and indirect payments to farmers
should be eliminated, and all supply control programs should be ended.  Several
commodities, such as soybeans and potatoes, are currently operated in this way
and should serve as models for all federal agricultural policy.<p>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>  The operating permits program under Title V is the most significant
innovation in the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act.  It fundamentally
changes the workings of state and federal air emission control.  However,
despite the recent focus on the Clean Air Act by reform-minded legislators,
Title V has received relatively little public attention.   <p>
<p>
     Although it makes no changes to the substantive provisions contained in the
rest of the Act, Title V requires &#147;major&#148; sources of air pollution to
incorporate all of these requirements in a single document or
&#147;permit.&#148;  This permit must be approved through programs run by the
states.  Operating permits will become the primary enforcement vehicle of the
Clean Air Act.<p>
<p>
     The stated purpose of  Title V is to bring to the Clean Air Act an
operating permits program similar to the one in the Clean Water Act.  Permits
are designed to clarify the requirements applicable to each emissions source
and facilitate their enforcement.<A HREF="title56.html#1"><sup>1</sup></A>  Whether the operating permits
program under the Clean Water Act can or should be duplicated in the realm air
emissions was never seriously debated.     <p>
<p>
     Title V exhibits many of the problematic characteristics of the current
federal approach to environmental protection.  It is a rigid and prescriptive
system of command and control emphasizing process over substance and fostering
an adversarial relationship between environmental regulators and industry.
Most states already have air emission operating permit programs.  Title V
federalizes these state programs, making them considerably more complex and
costly to implement.     <p>
<p>
     It is difficult to justify the implementation of Title V at this time.  With a
twenty year record of substantial declines in air pollution, particularly among
the large industrial emissions sources targeted by Title V, it is unclear why a
radically new federal enforcement scheme targeting such sources is needed now.
Moreover, Title V is unlikely to achieve additional improvements in air
quality.  The EPA has never attempted to quantify the benefits it expects Title
V to achieve, perhaps because they will be so meager. <p>
<p>
     While the benefits of Title V are questionable, the costs are not.  Title V
imposes startlingly high compliance costs.  More ominously, industries are
concerned about Title V&#146;s effect on timely operational flexibility.  In
addition to the initial delays in obtaining a permit, revising an existing
permit to account for operational changes at a regulated facility or other
post-permit events is a time consuming process, involving numerous precedural
steps.  Title V is replete with opportunities for the EPA and environmental
groups to tie up these permit revisions with procedural delays, in effect
giving them unprecedented power over industrial changes.  In fast moving
industries where changes are frequent, such as electronics or pharmaceuticals,
such delays will make it difficult to stay competitive, and deliver new
products to consumers in a timely fashion.  Once issued, these permits will
facilitate enforcement actions initiated by EPA, the states, and environmental
groups, for violations of permit terms, including minor technical violations.
No other nation has anything as onerous as Title V, giving foreign competitors
and American-owned plants located abroad a significant competitive advantage.<p>
<p>
     At the very least, legislative changes should be made to Title V to reduce the
costs and procedural delays imposed on American industry.  Ideally, Title V
would be completely eliminated.  Although less well publicized than some of the
other problems with the Clean Air Act<A HREF="title56.html#2"><sup>2</sup></A>, Title V, in its current
form, provides a very good reason for an extensive overhaul of the Act.<p>

<H2>Overview of Title V</H2>
</CENTER>



<p>
<b>Setting Up Title V: EPA Approval of State Programs</b><p>
<b></b><p>
     The day to day operation of Title V will, at least in theory, be run by the
states.  Each state will review permit applications, issue final permits, and
enforce them under its own program.  But states must first submit their planned
programs to EPA for approval.  Before receiving approval, each state must
demonstrate that its program will evaluate permit applications according to the
minimum standards set out in Title V and the EPA regulations.<A HREF="title56.html#3"><sup>3</sup></A>
States are permitted some flexibility regarding the specifics of their
programs, but only where EPA allows.  State permit program requirements are
described in the sections below.  <p>
<p>
     States were supposed to submit their applications to EPA by November 15, 1993
and EPA was required to approve or reject, in whole or part, within one year.
As is often the case with federal undertakings of this size, the process has
fallen severely behind schedule.  Many states missed the deadline.  EPA has
contributed to the delays by repeatedly making substantial changes to the
implementing regulations, including a new set of proposed rules due out in July
1995 (see the following figure).  To date, less than half the states have
obtained approval for their air permit programs.  Nonetheless, EPA is required
to impose sanctions on states that miss the deadline.<A HREF="title56.html#4"><sup>4</sup></A><p>
<p>
     If a state does not have an approved program in place by November 15, 1995,
the EPA must impose a federal operating permit program on the air emissions
sources in that state.<A HREF="title56.html#5"><sup>5</sup></A>  Once a state program is approved, or a
federal program is imposed, existing sources of air emissions have one year to
file a permit application.<A HREF="title56.html#6"><sup>6</sup></A>  States must act on at least one third
of all permit applications each year.<A HREF="title56.html#7"><sup>7</sup></A>  As an inducement to the
states, the law allows them to collect permit fees from the regulated sources,
based on the quantity of emissions by the permittee.<A HREF="title56.html#8"><sup>8</sup></A>  <p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u><b>Who Must Obtain a Permit</b><p>
<b></b><p>
     Each industrial source of air emissions must determine if it comes under Title
V and is required to file a permit application.  However, like nearly
everything else in Title V, the standards are unclear.  For now, EPA has
allowed state programs to limit the Title V requirements to &#147;major
sources.&#148;<A HREF="title56.html#9"><sup>9</sup></A>  A major source is defined as a stationary source
that:<p>
<p>
<UL>
<LI>emits or has the potential to emit 10 tons per year of 179 listed hazardous
air pollutants, or 25 tons per year of any combination of hazardous air
pollutants under [[section]] 112 of the Clean Air Act; <p>

<LI>emits or has the potential to emit 100 tons per year of any air pollutant
under [[section]]302 of the Clean Air Act; or <p>

<LI>emits or has the potential to emit certain criteria pollutants (volatile
organic compounds, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, particulates) in
nonattainment areas under Title I, part D, based on several sliding scales
which depend on the severity of the nonattainment and the pollutant at
issue.<A HREF="title56.html#10"><sup>10</sup></A>  <p>

</UL>

<p>
Additionally, there are complex rules designed to thwart efforts on the part of
industry to split up sites into two or more sources in order to fall below the
threshold levels.<A HREF="title56.html#11"><sup>11</sup></A>     <p>
<p>
     EPA initially limited the applicability of Title V to &#147;major&#148;
sources until the program is up and running, but may later expand the universe
of applicable entities when feasible.  Approximately 34,000 industrial sites
are &#147;major,&#148; and must be permitted.<A HREF="title56.html#12"><sup>12</sup></A>  EPA currently
allows states to exempt smaller, non-major sources.<A HREF="title56.html#13"><sup>13</sup></A>  Were this
exemption narrowed or eliminated, as many as 350,000 additional sources,
including small businesses such as gas stations and dry cleaners, would also
need to obtain a Title V permit.<A HREF="title56.html#14"><sup>14</sup></A>  There is little in Title V that
limits its reach in this regard.  And, if EPA hopes to control most of the
nation&#146;s industrial air emissions through Title V, much as it controls
water emissions, it will have to expand the number of sources subject to Title
V.<A HREF="title56.html#15"><sup>15</sup></A>    <p>
 <p>
     Important to recognize is that Title V applicability thresholds are based on
the &#147;potential to emit,&#148; not on actual emissions.  The
&#147;potential to emit&#148; assumes that a source operates 24 hours a day,
365 days a year, and ignores any efforts to reduce actual emissions unless they
are federally enforceable.<A HREF="title56.html#16"><sup>16</sup></A>  This standard has created irrational
results for many types of entities with much more limited emissions.  <p>
<p>
     &#147;Potential to emit&#148; ignores the seasonality of many kinds of
emissions.  For instance, many grain elevators will need to obtain a permit,
based on the assumption that they are constantly being filled and emptied and
emitting dust particles, though this is virtually impossible given the
realities of the business.<A HREF="title56.html#17"><sup>17</sup></A>  Title V also covers types of equipment
that make a negligible contribution to air pollution.  Potential emissions from
backup generators, for example, are calculated assuming they are in continuous
operation throughout the year, but in reality such equipment is rarely if ever
in operation.  Also, sources whose emissions are below Title V threshold levels
because of state or local requirements that are not federally enforceable, and
sources that have voluntarily undertaken measures to reduce pollution will
still have to comply.  Nothing other than federally enforceable limits can be
used in determining the potential to emit.<p>
<p>
     The result of the wide net cast by the &#147;potential to emit&#148;
thresholds is the application of Title V permit requirements to a large number
of sources with no regard for their actual air emissions.  In recent months,
EPA has, for the first time, shown some concern about Title V&#146;s extreme
breadth.  In a policy memorandum, EPA said they may allow states to exempt
certain sources whose actual emissions are considerably less than potential
emissions.  An EPA rule on this point may be forthcoming.<p>
<p>



 <b>Permit Applications and Permit Content</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>   Sources required to obtain a permit must submit a timely and complete
application.<A HREF="title56.html#18"><sup>18</sup></A>   Each application must include extremely detailed
information about
the emissions at the source,  a citation of all air pollution control
requirements, a compliance plan, and certification of compliance with all
applicable requirements.<A HREF="title56.html#19"><sup>19</sup></A>  Pending applications must be updated to
include any relevant new information arising after the initial
submission.<A HREF="title56.html#20"><sup>20</sup></A>  The permit application for a small iron foundry, for
example, runs several hundred pages, and must list such minutiae as the
estimated amount of dust kicked up by motor vehicles as they enter and leave
the parking lot.<A HREF="title56.html#21"><sup>21</sup></A>  A responsible official must attest to the truth,
accuracy, and completeness of each application, including the certification of
compliance.<A HREF="title56.html#22"><sup>22</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     Each permit issued shall list all federally enforceable air emission
limitations and standards.<A HREF="title56.html#23"><sup>23</sup></A>  The extensive monitoring,
recordkeeping, reporting, and inspection requirements must also be
included.<A HREF="title56.html#24"><sup>24</sup></A>   Permits are good for a maximum of five
years,<A HREF="title56.html#25"><sup>25</sup></A>  though most permits will probably have to be revised
several times during that span.  A new permit does not provide much long-term
certainty.  <p>
<p>
     Existing facilities going through the permit application process for the first
time as well as new facilities being planned or under construction will suffer
extensive procedural delays, up to 18 months, during which they cannot be
certain what their approved permit will or will not allow.<A HREF="title56.html#26"><sup>26</sup></A>  Long
lag times before commencing operations are very costly and in some cases render
a planned facility economically unfeasible.   <p>
<p>
     Intel Corporation provides a clear example of a company that will be hurt if
Title V causes procedural delays.  Those familiar with personal computers know
that Intel produces an entirely new generation microprocessor every few years.
The 386 microprocessor was introduced in 1985.  It was replaced by the 486 in
1989, followed by the Pentium in 1993.  The Pentium&#146;s replacement is
currently in the works.<A HREF="title56.html#27"><sup>27</sup></A>  Title V could prevent Intel from
maintaining this pace.  In a globally competitive field such as semiconductor
production, Intel is only slightly ahead of other manufacturers and already
must contend with numerous delays caused by other U.S. environmental laws and
regulations, such as the New Source Review program.  Now, Title V poses
additional delays that may slow new product introductions.       One of  Title
V&#146;s few purported benefits to industry is the so-called permit shield
provisions, whereby the actions of a permitted source that come within the
permit terms would be shielded against enforcement by EPA, the states, or the
public.<A HREF="title56.html#28"><sup>28</sup></A>  For example, a subsequent determination that a permit
term allows more than it should have, or a post-permit change in EPA&#146;s
interpretation of an existing rule could not be used in an enforcement action
against a permitted facility.   <p>
<p>
     Unfortunately, numerous exceptions reduce the permit shield&#146;s utility to
industry.<A HREF="title56.html#29"><sup>29</sup></A>  For one, permit shield provisions are optional to
states.<A HREF="title56.html#30"><sup>30</sup></A>  When adopted, they are limited to terms explicitly
addressed in the permit, and do not include applicable requirements promulgated
after the permit was issued.<A HREF="title56.html#31"><sup>31</sup></A>  Nor do they preclude EPA from
reopening a permit to eliminate any perceived deficiencies.<A HREF="title56.html#32"><sup>32</sup></A>  In
addition, the statutory and regulatory language describing the permit shield is
so unclear that, in many cases, regulated sources cannot confidently rely on
their protections.<A HREF="title56.html#33"><sup>33</sup></A>  In effect, the permit shield provisions do
little to reduce the uncertainty of Title V. <p>

<H2>The Clinton EPA and Post-Permit Facility Changes</H2>
</CENTER>



<P>Most regulated sources regularly make operational changes at their
facilities that may affect emissions, such as manufacturing process or product
design changes or increases in production levels.  Title V subjects many such
changes to review, making it a permanent bureaucratic imposition on
industry.<A HREF="title56.html#34"><sup>34</sup></A>  The needs of industry to stay flexible and competitive,
particularly in an increasingly globalized marketplace, is at odds with Title
V.  <p>
<p>
     To complicate matters further, last August the EPA proposed a new rule
affecting facility changes, and is now in the process of proposing another
rule.<A HREF="title56.html#35"><sup>35</sup></A>  Under the EPA rules currently in effect, there are three
categories of operational changes, with different procedural requirements for
each.<A HREF="title56.html#36"><sup>36</sup></A>  These categories were conceived so that environmentally
unimportant changes, such as a minor rearrangement of an assembly line, the
replacement of a broken or obsolete piece of equipment, or a switch to a
slightly different fuel source, can be made relatively quickly and easily,
while more serious changes, such as those likely to cause an overall increase
in emissions beyond that which the permit currently allows, invoke a greater
number of procedural steps.<A HREF="title56.html#37"><sup>37</sup></A>  Unfortunately, the regulations would
impose procedural delays on some environmentally minor modifications.
Companies must wait for approval before implementing changes, or risk the
expense of undoing the change should it be subsequently rejected, as well as
legal penalties in some cases.<p>
<p>
     The Clinton EPA rules proposed on August 29, 1994 will make matters worse.
These rules expand the scope of operational changes subject to procedural
requirements, including changes that are environmentally inconsequential and/or
have already been subjected to considerable process at the state level, such as
the tens of thousands of changes made each year under minor New Source Review
(NSR) program.<A HREF="title56.html#38"><sup>38</sup></A>   This complex proposal was strongly criticized by
industry, and EPA is currently considering a revised proposal.     <p>
<p>
     Whatever final rule on permit revisions emerges, it will significantly
influence regulated industries&#146; ability to compete, particularly in fields
where changes are frequent and necessary.  Thus, it is important for industry
to take advantage of every opportunity under the law to maintain as much
flexiblity as possible.  Sources of air emissions, when applying for their
initial permits, can, to an extent, reduce future problems by incorporating
leeway into their applications.  For example, a source can easily switch from
one reasonably anticipated operating scenario to another if both are part of an
approved permit.<A HREF="title56.html#39"><sup>39</sup></A>  But there are limits to what will be allowed in
a permit, and what can be anticipated years in advance.     <p>
     In addition to operational changes, Title V&#146;s procedural obstacle course
must be repeated when EPA promulgates a new regulation or standard that applies
to a permitted source, when EPA decides to reopen a permit &#147;for
cause,&#148; or when the five year permit term is up.<A HREF="title56.html#40"><sup>40</sup></A>   <p>
<p>
     One concern is that the procedural guantlet may create perverse incentives.
Technological advances continually give industry more efficient and less
polluting means to operate.  But because changes at a facility, even additions
of new equipment that may lead to reduced emissions, must go through Title
V&#146;s costly and time consuming process, owners and operators may choose to
continue using existing equipment because it has already been approved.  For
example, energy intensive manufacturing facilities have the incentive to save
on energy costs by periodically updating their equipment base with newer, more
energy efficient systems.  But such a change may now trigger Title V delays,
providing a reason to maintain the status quo.   <p>
 <p>
     Fast-to-market industries, already anticipating difficulties in complying with
Title V in its original form, are particularly concerned about the EPA&#146;s
proposed rule.  An electronics company, for example, may make numerous process
changes annually, any one of which could now cause administrative delays.
Intel estimates it makes 30 to 60 such changes annually at each facility, and
the Title V delays caused by just one of those changes could allow foreign
competitors to beat them to market.<A HREF="title56.html#41"><sup>41</sup></A>  Tom Davis, Director of
Environmental and Safety Affairs at AT&amp;T, notes that &#147;approval of
every change and modification might take as long as the life cycle of many of
our products.&#148;<A HREF="title56.html#42"><sup>42</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     In effect, under the Clinton EPA&#146;s August proposal, Title V red tape
could tie up a high tech product long enough for a global competitor,
unhindered by Title V, to introduce it first.  It could even delay the
introduction of a product until it is obsolete. &#147;Unless the proposed rules
are changed, we will have to consider locating new facilities overseas,&#148;
says Tim Mohin, Government Affairs Manager at Intel.<A HREF="title56.html#43"><sup>43</sup></A>     <p>
     In addition, changes as simple as stepping up production to meet an unexpected
surge in demand for a particular product may require time consuming procedures.
The pharmaceuticals industry is particularly concerned.  Thomas White,
Associate Vice President of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, notes that the &#147;administrative procedures hinder our response to
natural disasters or epidemics which force us to shift production to meet the
greater-than-expected need for [a] medicine.&#148;<A HREF="title56.html#44"><sup>44</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     The August 29th proposed revisions came about in part as a result of legal
pressure from environmental groups, claiming that the existing rules allowing
industrial changes without public participation violate the
statute.<A HREF="title56.html#45"><sup>45</sup></A>  But the Clinton EPA also seemed anxious to eliminate
what it perceived as an anti-environmental leftover from the Bush years.  The
Bush Administration&#146;s Competitiveness Council, in one of the most heated
debates over the Clean Air Act&#146;s implementation, fought hard for a modicum
of operational flexibility in Title V.  Under these rules, many environmentally
insignificant facility changes could be implemented without procedural delays.
However, in a July 1994 press release announcing the proposed rule, the EPA
derided these efforts as a &#147;Bush Administration Competitiveness Council
decision to restrict the public&#146;s right to participate in environmental
decision-making.&#148;<A HREF="title56.html#46"><sup>46</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     But now, as a result of strong industry opposition and the political
consequences of the 1994 elections, EPA is in the process of promulgating
another new proposal.  Although it may restore some of the flexibility that the
August 29th proposal would have taken from industry, it is not likely to
eliminate all of the time consuming and costly procedural requirements imposed
on environmentally minor facility changes. <p>

<CENTER>
<H2>Private Involvement in the Permitting Process</H2>
</CENTER>
  

<P>     Title V is wide open to federal and environmental group involvement.  Initial
permits and renewals, reopenings of existing permits, and some revisions
necessitated by operational changes at a source are subject to a period of
public comment, and a public hearing if requested, giving environmental groups
or local citizens the chance to inject themselves into the
process.<A HREF="title56.html#47"><sup>47</sup></A>  Each state, in addition to its own review process, must
submit all of the above actions to the EPA (as well as to other states that may
be affected).<A HREF="title56.html#48"><sup>48</sup></A>  The EPA is given veto authority.  States must
remedy EPA objections, and the failure to do so will result in a denial of the
application.<A HREF="title56.html#49"><sup>49</sup></A>  If EPA declines to object, any person may petition
them to do so.<A HREF="title56.html#50"><sup>50</sup></A>  Denials of such petitions are subject to review in
federal court.<A HREF="title56.html#51"><sup>51</sup></A>  EPA also retains oversight authority for all state
programs, and can impose sanctions for failures in administration or
enforcement.<A HREF="title56.html#52"><sup>52</sup></A>  In addition, interested parties may challenge a
state&#146;s issuance of a permit in state court.<A HREF="title56.html#53"><sup>53</sup></A>  Thus, the EPA,
environmental organizations and NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) groups have several
opportunities under Title V to block industrial operations by petitioning and
litigating for permit denials.  This can extend the permitting process
indefinitely and greatly increase uncertainty for businesses subjected to Title
V (see the accompanying table).<p>
<p>
     Once issued, the permits will facilitate enforcement of the substantive
provisions in the Clean Air Act by the states, the EPA, and citizen groups.
These provisions are similar to those contained in the Clean Water Act.  To
assist the public, nearly all of the information in permit applications, final
permits, and, most importantly, the data generated by subsequent
self-monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements must be made
available to members of the public upon request, giving these parties access to
the evidence necessary to take advantage of the Clean Air Act&#146;s citizen
suit provisions.<A HREF="title56.html#54"><sup>54</sup></A>  Any failure to provide the data is itself a
violation of Title V.    <p>
<p>
     Title V is designed to facilitate citizen suits under the Clean Air Act.  The
&#147;standing&#148; requirements are very broad &#151; for practical purposes,
standing is no barrier to environmental groups under Title V.<A HREF="title56.html#55"><sup>55</sup></A>
Also, as a result of a suit, civil penalties can be imposed in addition to
injunctive relief.<A HREF="title56.html#56"><sup>56</sup></A>  Litigation expenses are also recoverable,
sometimes in excess of the actual costs incurred by the litigating
party.<A HREF="title56.html#57"><sup>57</sup></A>  In some cases, fines, rather than going to the U.S.
Treasury, may go to environmental groups for use in what are termed
&#147;beneficial mitigation projects.&#148;<A HREF="title56.html#58"><sup>58</sup></A>     <p>
<p>
     In many respects, Title V represents a shift away from the traditional
presumption of innocence &#151; industry is presumed guilty of violating the
Clean Air Act, and must continually establish its innocence.  Industrial
sources are obligated by law to publicly demonstrate compliance, and anyone has
the power to prosecute for non-compliance.<p>
<p>
     Proponents of such citizen suit provisions have held up the Clean Water Act as
a successful model.  The operating permits program under the Clean Water Act
was designed to have a large private enforcement element.  Some point to the
large numbers of citizen suits as proof of their utility.  More than 100 such
suits are filed each year, comprising a significant part of Clean Water Act
enforcement.  As Title V was modeled on the Clean Water Act, citizen suits will
likely be common under Title V as well.  However, the citizen suits under the
Clean Water Act have proven an inefficient enforcement vehicle, and it is
unlikely that they will fare better under the Clean Air Act.<A HREF="title56.html#59"><sup>59</sup></A><p>
<p>
     One problem with citizen suits under the Clean Water Act is that they tend to
be misdirected.  Most of the suits are aimed at large industrial sources of
water pollution, while such sources contribute less than 10 percent of current
water pollution.<A HREF="title56.html#60"><sup>60</sup></A>  The dominant sources of water pollution today,
municipalities and agriculture, are largely untouched.  Industry is an
attractive target for reasons that have nothing to do with environmental
protection.  For one, businesses, more often than municipalities, choose to
quickly settle rather than go to court, providing environmental groups a
financial incentive to litigate. Settlements can be expected to cover
litigation expenses and mitigation projects.  In addition, for ideological and
public relations reasons, the environmental groups who bring most of these
suits prefer to target large corporations.<A HREF="title56.html#61"><sup>61</sup></A>  The defendants in
citizen suits under Title V will likely be chosen for the same reasons.     <p>
<p>
     The extensive monitoring and recordkeeping data made available to the public,
combined with the Clean Air Act&#146;s numerous requirements, are conducive to
citizen suits for relatively minor infractions.  Such infractions can be
spotted with minimal effort, often requiring no more than a few hours&#146;
effort from a student volunteer taught to scan the data, and a potentially
money-making suit can be filed at low cost.  Many suits under the Clean Water
Act focus on insignificant technical violations.  These suits have legal
grounding, but do nothing to enhance environmental quality.<A HREF="title56.html#62"><sup>62</sup></A>  The
problem of such &#147;nuisance&#148; citizen suits will likely occur under
Title V as well.  In fact, the EPA has indicated that a source in full
compliance with all air emission limits is nonetheless subject to enforcement
for a technical violation.<A HREF="title56.html#63"><sup>63</sup></A> <p>
<p>
     It should be noted that the generous public participation opportunities,
both in the permitting process and in subsequent enforcement provisions, will
likely be dominated by the large professional environmental advocacy groups
such as the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club Legal Defense
Fund, with only minimal involvement from local grass roots organizations and
community groups.  While Title V is promoted by the EPA as a vehicle for direct
participation by citizens concerned about the air quality in their communities,
it is actually ill-suited for that purpose.<A HREF="title56.html#64"><sup>64</sup></A>  It is so legally and
procedurally complicated that it will discourage (if not preclude) all but
professional environmentalists from meaningful participation, except in those
extreme cases where NIMBY groups are activated.  Whether the involvement of
professional environmentalists reflects the real interests and concerns of the
local communities is a matter of considerable debate.  <p>
<p>
     The prominent role of EPA and environmental groups in Title V also diminishes
state control of operating permit programs.  This is ironic, as Title V has
actually been characterized by EPA officials as a program that gives power back
to the states.  However, forty-five states, including most of the heavily
industrialized ones, already have some type of state-run air emission operating
permit programs.  By most accounts, these programs are relatively efficient and
effective, at least compared to federal programs.  Title V brings these
programs under EPA control, giving the federal agency the opportunity to meddle
in the permitting process and micromanage industry when it so chooses.  In
effect, the EPA treats the state environmental agencies like subordinates,
delegating extensive duties while retaining ultimate responsibility.<p>
<p>
     Special interest groups, exploiting the generous public participation
opportunites and lax standing requirements discussed above, can also get into
the act of second-guessing industrial decisions.  Lawyers at the national
environmental organizations can simply peruse the <i>Federal Register</i> each
day, make a note of any pending new or revised permit applications they object
to, and deny or delay them with public hearings, petitions, and/or lawsuits,
even if they don&#146;t have a legitimate environmental concern.  Activists who
dislike a particular corporation or industry, or have a general anti-technology
bias, will gain a powerful new weapon.  Title V may also be misused by
competitors or disgruntled former employees.  Some see the permit program as
little more than a costly vehicle for the EPA, large environmental groups and
others to exert increased power over industry.  <p>

<A NAME="title"></A>
<CENTER>
<H2>Title V and the Rest of the Clean Air Act</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>An operating permits program has been a part of the Clean Water Act
since 1972.  In contrast, the Clean Air Act evolved, since 1970, into an
extremely complex and potent statute without such a program.  Title V must now
mesh with numerous Clean Air Act provisions, including some that may no longer
be necessary once Title V is in place.  But Title V was added to the Act
without compensating deletions or streamlining of the other titles, despite the
fact that it is supposed to be the single comprehensive enforcement vehicle for
all of the Act&#146;s substantive provisions.  As a result, Title V brings an
additional layer of bureaucracy to a statute already notorious for massive red
tape and redundancies.<A HREF="title56.html#65"><sup>65</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     EPA has yet to explain precisely how Title V fits in with state
implementation plans (SIPs), the new source review program (NSR), the air
toxics program, enhanced monitoring, and others, let alone other pre-existing
state-level requirements.  The questions raised by the complex interface
between these provisions and Title V is beyond the scope of this analysis.  EPA
clarification on these matters would be helpful.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>


<A NAME="last"></A>
<CENTER>
<H2>Last Minute Revisions to Title V</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>At the time of this writing, the EPA is in the process of promulgating a new
rule on Title V.  While the proposed rule has not yet been published in the
<i>Federal Register</i>, the EPA has released a white paper describing the
suggested revisions.<A HREF="title56.html#66"><sup>66</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The white paper offers several measures to reduce the paperwork requirements
associated with obtaining a Title V permit, clarify some ambiguities in
previous rules, and streamline certification of compliance procedures.  Most
importantly, it reduces the number of environmentally insignificant changes
under minor New Source Review that need to be included in Title V permits and
permit revisions.   <p>
<p>
     The white paper is a belated step in the right direction, but leaves the
fundamental problems of Title V intact.  Even if these changes become final
rules, Title V will remain a program imposing costly delays and red tape while
achieving few environmental gains.  In addition, the white paper has no legal
force, thus industry cannot be certain about the manner and extent that Title V
will be changed until the final regulations have been promulgated &#151;
something that will not happen for several more months.   EPA may choose to
narrow some of the revisions in the final rule, and environmental groups will
undoubtedly pressure them to do so.  And, since EPA has substantially altered
Title V rules several times already, it is not unreasonable to assume future
changes in 1996 or 1997, perhaps ones that, political circumstances allowing,
will eliminate the prospective concessions that the white paper suggests.  <p>
       <p>

<A NAME="costs"></A>
<CENTER>
<H2>The Costs of Title V</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>As affected industries and state environmental agencies are preparing for
their Title V deadlines, they are realizing how expensive implementing this
program will be.  Compiling the permit applications, which require an
exhaustive amount of detail, running them through the gauntlet of procedural
steps, and complying with the monitoring and other ongoing requirements is
costly for regulated companies.  Compliance is so complicated that few
companies can handle it in-house, necessitating the use of consultants and
lawyers.  The costs of inital compliance can reach $200,000 per
facility.<A HREF="title56.html#67"><sup>67</sup></A>   Even the smallest affected sources will typically pay
tens of thousands to comply.<A HREF="title56.html#68"><sup>68</sup></A>  The impact will be particularly
severe for single-facility manufacturers and other small entities that come
under Title V, many of whom are already having difficulties absorbing high
regulatory compliance costs, and cannot afford much more. <p>
<p>
     States are also going to expend significant resources on Title V.  Many state
environmental agencies are doubling their staffs to meet the deadlines.  The
Ohio Environemntal Protection Agency, for example, is adding 100 to 150 people
and spending half its budget on Title V.<A HREF="title56.html#69"><sup>69</sup></A>    <p>
<p>
     The EPA estimates that the total costs, public and private, will exceed $500
million annually, including $14 million to expand its own
bureaucracy.<A HREF="title56.html#70"><sup>70</sup></A>  But the EPA concedes that the actual costs could be
considerably higher.<A HREF="title56.html#71"><sup>71</sup></A>  By analogy, the operating permits program
under the Clean Water Act has proven to be far more expensive than originally
estimated.<A HREF="title56.html#72"><sup>72</sup></A>  Most recently, EPA&#146;s estimates of the cost of its
storm water operating permits program are proving an order of magnitude too
low.<A HREF="title56.html#73"><sup>73</sup></A>  It would not be surprising if the same occurred with
estimates of direct costs associated with Title V.  One analyst estimates the
paperwork costs to industry alone at $34.1 billion dollars over the first five
years of the program.<A HREF="title56.html#74"><sup>74</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     More than the direct dollar costs of complying with Title V, the delays and
uncertainties created by its extensive procedural requirements pose the
greatest threat to industry.  The impact will be particularly severe in
fast-to-market industries as well as companies facing stiff competition from
foreign competitors.  <p>
<p>
     Title V will exact a heavy price in terms of opportunities foregone or shipped
overseas.  Some companies are willing to limit future expansion in order to
avoid Title V.  Others fear losing market share to foreign competitors.
Several are considering placing new facilities outside the U.S.  And the
burdens of initial compliance will become another regulatory barrier to entry,
particularly for fledgling companies.  While it is difficult to put the
indirect costs in dollar terms at this early stage, especially since the EPA
rules are still in a state of flux, they may be greater than the direct costs.
<p>
<p>
     There may even be costs to the environment.  Title V will delay the
replacement of older equipment and facilities with newer, more environmentally
benign ones.  Its onerous paperwork requirements will also divert resources
away from real pollution prevention.<p>
   <p>
<p>

<A NAME="benefits"></A>
<CENTER>
<H2>The Benefits of Title V?</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>The only purpose of Title V is the attainment of cleaner air through improved
enforcement of the substantive provisions in the Clean Air Act.<A HREF="title56.html#75"><sup>75</sup></A>
Unless Title V brings about significant improvements in air quality, the entire
program will amount to nothing more than regulating for regulating&#146;s sake.
While only time will tell, there appear to be limits on how much Title V can
really accomplish. <p>
<p>
     By most measures, the air has been getting dramatically cleaner for the past
several decades without the benefit of Title V, or any other of the 1990 Clean
Air Act&#146;s new provisions (see the figure below).  Some attribute this
success to the 1970 Clean Air Act and 1977 amendments, pointing to significant
declines in most regulated pollutants during the past two decades.<A HREF="title56.html#76"><sup>76</sup></A>
Others point to air quality improvements predating the modern environmental
movement and attribute the gains to increasing wealth and technological
progress, particularly among western nations during the 20th
century.<A HREF="title56.html#77"><sup>77</sup></A>  Either way, the 1990 Clean Air Act can take no credit.<p>
<p>
     Progress has been particularly impressive for pollutants emitted by stationary
industrial sources (as opposed to mobile sources or residences), the subject of
Title V.  There are significant downward trends for particulates and sulphur
dioxide, for example.<A HREF="title56.html#78"><sup>78</sup></A>  All of this has occurred without a federal
air operating permits program.  The empirical evidence does not suggest a Clean
Air Act under-enforcement problem, especially for the kinds of entities
required to obtain a permit under Title V.   <p>
<p>
     Against this backdrop of continuing success, Title V is now substantially
tightening Clean Air Act enforcement.  EPA has stated that Title V &#147;may
result in an improvement in air quality,&#148; but has not attempted to
quantify the expected additional reductions in air emissions.<A HREF="title56.html#79"><sup>79</sup></A>  It
seems that Title V, despite its high costs, will achieve no more than marginal
improvements at best.  At worst, it will impose tremendous costs for no
environmental benefits whatsoever, and may frustrate efforts to implement
environmental improvements. <p>
<p>
<p>

<A NAME="possible"></A>
<CENTER>
<H2>Possible Solutions</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>There are two approaches to improving Title V &#151; keeping the law intact
and allowing EPA to make changes through the regulatory process, or changing
the underlying legislation.  The latter is far preferable.  Despite the
seemingly new attitude at EPA expressed in its white paper, there is little
hope for a regulatory fix to Title V.  <p>
<p>
     Some of Title V&#146;s problems are written into the law itself, such as the
excessive public participation requirements and opportunities for judicial
review.<A HREF="title56.html#80"><sup>80</sup></A>  Further, EPA is not genuinely interested in alleviating
industry concerns.  In its August 29th proposed rule, the agency tipped its
hand regarding its philosophy towards Title V.  EPA was clearly bent on making
Title V as onerous as possible, to the shock of many in industry who thought
that the overall parameters of Title V had been agreed upon.  Only after a
severe backlash from industry and political changes in Congress did EPA express
regret about its proposal and recognize that industry may be adversely
affected.  EPA did not have a change of heart.  It is simply adjusting to new
political realities.  If the political winds shift once again, EPA will
undoubtedly take advantage of any opportunity to tighten the screws on Title V.
And, in its current form, the underlying statute gives EPA the latitude to do
so.  Unless legislatively constrained, the EPA is unlikely to make Title V
workable and keep it that way.<p>
<p>
     Moreover, environmental groups could frustrate attempts at moderation by the
EPA.  Under Title V, these groups will be capable of tying up industry in
procedural and legal knots, with or without the help of the EPA.  As the law
currently exists, there are few checks on their interference in the permitting
process, and they have given every indication that they will make full use of
Title V&#146;s public participation opportunities.  Lack of resources may not
be a limitation, since citizen suits could become profit centers, as they have
under the Clean Water Act.  Legislative change is necessary if reasonable
limits are to be placed on the degree of involvement from environmental
groups.<p>
<p>
     The real question is not whether legislative change is needed but how much.
The options are either making a few specific modifications to eliminate Title
V&#146;s most objectional elements (such as the constraints on timely
operational flexiblity caused by excessive and frequent procedural delays) or
the total elimination of Title V from the law.  <p>
<p>
     While a few targeted changes, such as the ones in the EPA&#146;s white paper,
can make Title V more tolerable than it currently is, there is no reason not to
do more.  No matter how modified, Title V will never achieve worthwhile results
at an acceptable cost.  Giving the federal government (and by extension,
environmental groups) that much discretion over industrial decisions is
incompatible with a free marketplace.  There now exists a unique window of
opportunity to eliminate Title V before it becomes an entrenched part of the
regulatory landscape.  If all that is accomplished is the softening of a
handful of Title V&#146;s more onerous aspects, the current period may one day
be looked back upon as a lost chance at getting rid of the most dispensable
title in the Clean Air Act. <p>

<A NAME="15"></A><sup>15</sup> There is a fundamental difference between water and air
permitting.  Water, by its very nature, is conducive to a permitting system.
Typically, the numerous small sources of water emissions at a locality flow
into one large source, and only the large sources need to be permitted.  Thus,
a manageably low number of permits can cover most water emissions.  Air
emissions, however, are much more diffuse.  They are immediately released at
the hundreds of thousands of points where they are created.  Compared to water
permits, it will take a much larger number of air permits to account for the
same percentage of total emissions.  Although no figures exist, the percentage
of emissions covered by the approximately 34,000 sources being initially
permitted is probably small.  This is one reason air permits are unlikely to
achieve results worth the costs.<p>
<A NAME="16"></A><sup>16</sup> 40 C.F.R. [[section]]70.2 (&#147;Potential to emit&#148;).<p>
<A NAME="17"></A><sup>17</sup> 99 percent of the grain elevators in Iowa, if constantly being
filled and emptied throughout the year, would emit more than 100 tons of dust,
thus requiring a permit.  In reality, elevators operate far less frequently,
and emit considerably less than 100 tons of dust.  They are filled during the
harvest, and slowly emptied throughout the rest of the year.  In fact, a single
mid-sized elevator, if constantly operated throughout the year as hypothesized
in the &#147;potential to emit&#148; definition, could handle more than the
entire U.S. corn crop.  Compliance with Title V, for a typical grain elevator
requires filling out a 280 page form, which is beyond the capabilities of most
elevator owners, necessitating the hiring of consultants who charge $25,000 to
$40,000. (Testimony of Rick Keith, Manager of the West Bend Elevator Company,
before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and
the Courts, February 22, 1995).  <p>

with social sciences, economics at New York University, Mr. Smith began to
apply market and property rights solutions to environmental issues when he
was president of an Audubon society chapter in 1970.  In his book, <I>Earth's Resources: Private Ownership vs. Public Waste</I>, he coined the term "free market environmentalism."  He was consultant to the Department of the Interior and the President's Council on Environmental Quality and a special assistant at the EPA.  He was Director of Environmental Studies at the <A HREF="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</A>.  Currently he works on <A HREF="/topic.html#biodiversity">wildlife, endangered species</A>, <A HREF="/topic.html#private">property rights and property stewardship</A>.

<BR>
Tom Miller is the Director of <A HREF="/errp.html">Economic Policy Studies</A> at the <A HREF="/">Competitive
Enterprise Institute</A>, a non-partisan public interest group committed to
advancing the principles of free enterprise and limited government.  Based
in Washington, D.C., the Institute is founded on the belief that free
markets and individual liberty  best serve the public interest, while
politicians and bureaucrats best serve themselves.  

<P>Mr. Miller directs the <A HREF="/errp.html">Economic Policy and Regulatory Reform program</A> at CEI.
As CEI's Senior Policy Analyst since 1986, his primary focus has been on
issues of financial services regulation, health care insurance, entitlement
programs reform, and antitrust regulation.  Mr. Miller is the author of <I>A Citizen's Guide To Banking Reform</I>, described by Representative Dick Armey as "A lucid, rigorous, and refreshingly accessible treatment of a complicated
and important subject." He is editor of the annual Competitive Enterprise
Index, which analyzes all congressional votes judged to have a significant
impact on competition, freedom, and opportunity in the U.S. economy. 

<P>Prior to joining CEI, Mr. Miller was a trial attorney, a broadcaster, and a
journalist.  At the firm of Powell, Goldstein, Frazer & Murphy in Atlanta,
his litigation activities included personal injury, insurance defense,
criminal defense, medical malpractice, and copyright cases.  Mr. Miller was
a news director at radio stations in Rome, Georgia and Anderson, South
Carolina; a sportscaster and talk show host at radio stations in Charlotte,
North Carolina and Atlanta; a writer/producer for current affairs programs
at the Voice of America; and a consulting producer for two television
programs, "The McLaughlin Group" and "John McLaughlin One-on-One."  Mr.
Miller was also a free lance writer on continuing assignment for <I>Reader's Digest</I> and an investigative reporter for syndicated columnist Donald Lambro.  

<P>Mr. Miller received his law degree from Duke Law School and a B.A. cum laude
in political science from New York University.  He is a member of the State
Bar of Georgia.   

<P>Mr. Miller's work on public policy issues has appeared in such publications
as <I>The Wall Street Journal, Reader's Digest, Reason, American Spectator,
Insight, Consumers Research, Los Angeles Times, Washington Times</I>, and
<I>Cleveland Plain Dealer</I>.

Even as they fought the Clinton health care plan, many Republicans signed
on to warm and fuzzy incremental insurance reform bills to show they were
in favor of "something."  In late January, President Clinton raised
the ante.  He challenged Congress to pass one of those measures, the
Kassebaum-Kennedy "Health Insurance Reform Act" (S. 1028).  If
congressional Republicans bite, Clinton will yell "Gotcha" and
America will once again be on the road to Clintoncare.<p>
	The proposed Senate legislation aims at making it easier for people to renew
or acquire health insurance coverage regardless of their health status,
particularly when they change or lose their jobs.  S. 1028 applies new
portability rules to all employment-based health plans and prohibits these
plans from limiting or denying coverage for more than 12 months for most
"preexisting" medical conditions.<p>
	Kassebaum-Kennedy also prohibits insurers and other health coverage issuers
from denying, based on health status, whole group coverage to employers with
two or more employees, and prevents employment-based health benefits plans from
excluding any employee from coverage through requirements based on
health-related factors.  In addition, the legislation generally provides
"guaranteed renewability" of health plan coverage to employer groups
and individuals, at the option of the insured, and guarantees
"group-to-individual portability" for individuals who leave group
insurance plans and lack access to other group insurance coverage.<p>
	Although the bill's goals seem compassionate and caring, S. 1028
misdiagnoses the problem.  Its remedial efforts will achieve little measurable
progress in expanding total levels of health insurance coverage and may
actually do some harm.  More dangerously, the bill would restore momentum for
surrendering the principles of individual choice, personal responsibility, and
risk-based pricing in favor of government-controlled health care markets.<p>
	The purpose of preexisting condition limits and exclusions in health insurance
policies is frequently misunderstood.  By providing partial coverage of persons
with preexisting conditions, the contractual clauses actually expand the
insurance market.  They offer some protection to persons who would be wholly
uninsurable unless some limits and conditions were attached to their coverage.
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill's permissible time period for preexisting
condition limits effectively eliminates their application to medical conditions
that will either not require immediate treatment or can be treated initially by
out-of-pocket payments until new insurance coverage is obtained.  New
restrictions on preexisting condition exclusions will also undercut the
incentive to prevent and avoid dangerous conditions in the first place.<p>
	If insurers are prevented explicitly from adjusting their premiums and
restricting their coverage to reflect the fact that different people have
different risks, they will resort to more indirect and less efficient means to
match the value of health insurance to the amount for which people will
voluntarily pay.  Insurers may devote more resources to pinpointing particular
high-risk individuals, industries, and small employer groups.  They then may
discourage such high-risk customers from seeking their coverage.  Techniques
will include more creative use of "objective" variables as health
status surrogates, selective marketing, geographic targeting, service-based
cues to customers, and so on.  <p>
	Employers also will respond to politically directed changes in the composition
of their risk pools.  On the margin, they may reduce or limit the number of
their employees; use more independent contractors; invest in more labor-saving
alternatives; relocate operations away from higher risk areas; or cut back the
scope of their group insurance coverage.<p>
	All of the above countermeasures will be set in motion by the political
impulse to "solve" a vastly overstated and mischaracterized problem.
Insurance coverage denials for medical reasons account for only a small portion
of uninsured individuals under age 65.  The much ballyhooed problem of
"job lock" is hard to prove and is not a significant impediment to
labor mobility.  The presence of more uninsured people does not lead to more
successful cost shifting and higher health care prices.  Nor do firms that do
not provide insurance succeed in shifting labor costs to other insured
businesses.  <p>
	Advocates of S. 1028 overlook the real factors that reduce the availability
and raise the cost of private health insurance coverage.  They include the
effect of poor health on earnings and labor supply, the rate of labor force
turnover in the small group market, the relative elasticity of small employer
demand for group health insurance, the higher-than-average risks of people who
switch health insurance policies, the effects of state mandated benefits, and
the inflationary effect of increased levels of insurance coverage.<p>
	Incremental insurance reforms such as guaranteed renewability, guaranteed
issue, and portability share several basic characteristics.  They restrict the
choices of most currently insured people and raise the cost of their insurance
policies, in exchange for subsidizing insurance coverage for a smaller group of
people with greater risks and higher likely health care costs.  The proposed
reforms force healthy people to subsidize sick people, regardless of income,
and undermine incentives to take personal responsibility for one's future
health care needs.<p>
	In a market where the purchase of health insurance is voluntary, raising the
cost of insurance will raise the number of uninsured people.  Estimates vary as
to the magnitude of this effect, depending upon how extensive the cost-raising
regulations are and who is affected by them.  A mid-range estimate of the
elasticity of demand for health insurance is probably -0.6.  That means that a
10 percent increase in the price of insurance may increase the number of
uninsured by about 6 percent.<p>
	Efforts to spread the cost of cross subsidies for a targeted population across
a wider base of insurance buyers is the public choice formula for politically
driven cost shifting (i.e., concentrated benefits, diffuse costs).  However, in
the group health insurance market segment where coverage levels are the most
disappointing -- small groups of 50 or fewer employers -- current
purchasers are very cost sensitive.  For them, relatively small changes in the
cost of health insurance create significant cutbacks in coverage.  The large
majority of the working uninsured, who pass up coverage not because of poor
health status but because it costs too much, place a low value on health
insurance relative to other forms of compensation.  <p>
	A voluntary insurance market can afford only a limited degree of premium cross
subsidies before the number of low-risk groups and individuals dropping
coverage exceeds the total of high-risk groups and individuals gaining access
to underpriced insurance.  At that point, one reaches a political no-man's
land in which the next logical step down the tunnel of cost shifting appears to
be mandatory universal coverage.  If the healthy are going to subsidize the
sick, it becomes imperative to round up as many overpaying conscripts as
possible.  <p>
	Therefore, S. 1028's guaranteed issue, renewability, and portability will
inevitably lead to tighter health insurance regulation on the federal level.
Renewal or issuance of insurance policies cannot be guaranteed without
involving the government in setting rating band limits on insurance policy
prices.  After all, in what sense can the availability  of an insurance policy
be considered guaranteed if it becomes too expensive for some policyholders to
buy or renew?  <p>
	Guaranteed issue, renewability, and portability also will increase pressure
for a policy of mandatory, standardized health benefits.  Variations and
changes in an insurer's package of health benefits can complicate those
mandated guarantees, because quality variation in health plans can be an
indirect means to exclude higher cost customers.  Addressing comparability
measures and integration rules for the varied quality and medical practice
style of health plans that mobile workers choose also will be difficult.  <p>
	Thus, despite its purportedly modest goals, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill's
efforts to remove health status considerations from the pricing and scope of
private insurance coverage leads down a one-way street where the ultimate
destination is the same one that Americans rejected in 1994: mandatory purchase
of standardized coverage, where the only cost constraints are imposed through
price controls and bureaucratic rationing.  <p>
	Advocates of Kassebaum-Kennedy deny the bill will raise insurance premiums
very much, if at all.  However, if providing guarantees of continued insurance
coverage is so inexpensive, why don't more people voluntarily buy such
protection on their own?  On the other hand, if individuals do find that the
cost of those insurance guarantees is more than they can (or are willing to)
pay, it's time to reexamine the cost estimates and search for different
answers to continuity of coverage issues.<p>
	S. 1028 takes a large step toward mandating that insurance companies offer
only multi-year policies at a fixed premium.  It assumes that voluntary market
arrangements have failed to meet the demands of consumers to provide products
that protect them from the consequences of health risk redefinition on an
annual basis.  Actually, the lack of more effective protection for individuals
against the risks of changing health status reflects the barriers of tax policy
and state restrictions on voluntary health plan purchasing coalitions, plus
variations in job status, income level, and risk preference.<p>
	Individuals who receive group health insurance through their employer enjoy
favorable tax treatment of employer-paid premiums.  If they work for a large
company, they also are likely to gain several additional advantages
(community-rated premiums, purchasing clout, lower administrative and
regulatory costs per worker.<p>
	On the other hand, employer-paid insurance policies are likely to provide few,
if any, continuing benefits for workers once they change or lose their jobs.
Employers sponsoring insurance plans are also less likely than their individual
employees to resist insurance policy exclusions for potentially costly
preexisting conditions.  <p>
	Theoretically, individuals who prefer other health insurance options and want
long-term protection against changes in their health status can purchase the
appropriate insurance policies on their own.  However, tax benefits are very
limited for individual health care buyers, and such policies cost more for
insurers to underwrite, market, and administer.  Given those costs, many
consumers are simply not willing to pay for multiperiod insurance contracts on
their own.  <p>
	Moreover, consumers may not want to be locked into one insurer for a long
period of time when health plan choices have significant, ongoing service
consequences (e.g., claims administration, provider networks, contract
interpretation).  Some consumers also need the contractual flexibility to
change insurers in the event that they later obtain a job offering better,
employer-paid insurance coverage.  Finally, many consumers are unwilling to
risk redistributing their income (when younger and healthier) through premium
subsidies to others in a voluntary pool, when they can instead be "picked
off" as good risks by other insurers and pay lower premiums.  <p>
	Kassebaum-Kennedy can round up support from consumers who do not want to pay
an actuarially fair price for health insurance, but prefer to have healthy
people subsidize their higher costs.  What can market-based alternatives offer
to other individuals who would try to pay their own way if less expensive
alternatives were available?<p>
	A short list of structural remedies would include (1) tax neutrality for all
health insurance purchases; (2) preservation of risk-based pricing; (3)
targeted income-based subsidies for the poor and those with medically
uninsurable risks; (4) legal reform that restores private insurers' rights
to enforce voluntary contracts regarding medical care choices and innovative
economizing options; (5) preemption or repeal of state mandated benefit laws;
and (6) encouragement of voluntary purchasing pools offering multiperiod,
experience-rated contracts.  (Kassebaum-Kennedy attempts to do the latter, but
undercuts the effort with rate restrictions.)<p>
	The most powerful solutions, of course, come down to fundamentals.  Ensuring
vigorous competition, unfettered consumer choice, and voluntary arrangements in
the insurance marketplace; empowering individuals to balance the risks,
rewards, and responsibilities of health care decisionmaking; and adopting
growth-oriented economic policies will do much more to expand insurance
coverage than incremental reform legislation that temporarily makes politicians
feel better but undermines its own official goals.  <p>

Bringing religious concerns into public life is as old as politics itself.
People do not cease having religious convictions when they vote, run for
office, oppose or support legislation, and it is silly to demand of believers
that they leave God out of their hearts and minds when acting as citizens or
officeholders.  Indeed, in a nation founded on the proposition that "all
men are... endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,"
the faithful need make no apology for participating in politics.  <p>
	By the same token, however, when people of faith enter the public arena, they
have a responsibility to respect the institutions that secure their own freedom
as citizens and believers.  In particular, they have an obligation to respect
property rights.<p>
	Private property is the institutional foundation of civil and religious
liberty.  If your home is your castle, then your home can also be your
sanctuary (or your political meeting hall).  Where property rights to land and
other assets are protected, believers can build churches, endow seminaries,
establish religious schools -- and nobody else may lawfully interfere.<p>
	In contrast, where property rights are insecure or nonexistent, the exercise
of religion is hostage to the whims of politicians, bureaucrats, or mobs.  As
the history of the former Soviet Union makes clear, when government owns the
printing presses, paper mills, and book stores, just obtaining a Bible can 
be difficult and dangerous.<p>
	What prompts these reflections are efforts by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
and a group called the Evangelical Environmental Network to mount a theological
defense of the Endangered Species Act.  Recalling that Noah was commanded to
save every kind of living creature, Babbitt claims the ESA serves a divine
purpose: "to protect the whole of creation."  Babbitt suggests that
only a complete philistine, blind to the reflections of divinity in the works
of nature, could possibly oppose the ESA.<p>
	What such sermonizing overlooks is that the ESA is unjust and inhumane.  The
ESA empowers bureaucrats to regulate, and thus effectively "take,"
private property deemed to be endangered species habitat.  Under the ESA,
federal agents can prohibit you from farming, building a home, or even clearing
fire breaks on your own land; fine you up to $100,000 and/or put you in jail
for engaging in the aforesaid activities; and pay you no compensation for the
lost value of your land.  This violates the Bill of Rights ("nor shall
private property be taken for public use without just compensation")
<i>and</i> the Ten Commandments ("Thou Shalt Not Steal").<p>
		God in His infinite goodness can bring good even out of evil, said St.
Augustine; but when mere mortals use bad means, they usually get bad results.
By turning wildlife assets into economic liabilities, the ESA encourages
landowners to destroy habitat, even to "shoot, shovel, and shut up."
The ESA harms the very species it is supposed to protect.  <p>
	Babbitt cites Noah as his inspiration, but Noah was no bureaucrat.  Noah did
not seize anyone's property to build the ark, nor did he tax anyone to
finance the operation.  The supreme irony is that if Noah were alive today, he
would be put in jail under the ESA for capturing and transporting endangered
species without government permission. 	<p>
	Religious fervor is no excuse for forgetting the Golden Rule of democratic
politics:  As you would have your rights be respected, so respect those of
others.  Wittingly or otherwise, ESA apologists presume that their secular or
religious concerns trump the equal rights of other citizens.  Such presumption
is the opposite of the respect required to maintain civil and religious
liberty.  Invoking the Bible to defend an unjust and inhumane law should be
seen for what it is -- a pious fraud.

When the answer is "Blizzards, heat waves, torrential rains, droughts,
hail, and hurricanes," the question must, of course, be "What
provides unequivocal evidence of imminent <a href="topic.html#global">global warming</A>?"  Is there
<i>any</i> climatic condition that might lead modern day apocalyptics to
reconsider their Chicken Little views?  I'm afraid not.  Consider the
comments of Jessica Matthews in a recent <i>Washington Post </i>column,
"Is Global Warming the Problem?": "think of the blizzard of
'96 as a glimpse of a part of the likely greenhouse future."
Jessica's concerns were echoed in the <i>New York Times</i> ("Blame
Global Warming for the Blizzard"), <i>Newsweek</i> ("Blizzards,
Floods and Hurricanes: Blame Global Warming"), and throughout much of the
media.  To Jessica and her environmental cohort:  <i>"It don't matter
whether it burns or freezes, it all proves Al Gore's thesis!" </i> <p>
	The argument for blizzards being the consequence of global warming leaps from
the observation that a warmer world is a more energetic world (true) to the
presumption that it will therefore experience worse weather (not necessarily at
all).  Although this apocalyptic linkage has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> by
the doomsday crowd, it is simplistic and almost certainly wrong.  Increasing
the energy of a system does not necessarily imply more chaotic behavior --
as anyone who has ridden a bicycle knows well.  <p>
	More significantly, weather is, in part, a by-product of the temperature
differences between the polar and equatorial regions.  If the impact of global
warming were to make the poles colder and the equatorial regions hotter, then
we might indeed expect stormier weather.  However, the models upon which
Jessica's hyperventilations are based suggest exactly the opposite; it is
the polar regions that are expected to warm most significantly, the equatorial
regions little if at all.  As extreme cold is produced by arctic air from the
polar regions, global warming should produce less of a deep freeze, even though
precipitation and hurricanes may rise.<p>
		Indeed, the balance of evidence suggests a warmer world will be a cloudier
world, with most of the warming occurring at night, moderating nighttime lows.
Also, the increased cloudiness will be greatest in the summer, least in the
winter, further reducing temperature variations across the seasons.  In effect,
the most likely impact of warming -- should it occur -- would be a more
benign climate, not a more hostile one.  <p>
		Not that anyone should throw away their snow shovels yet, however.   The
evidence that mankind is having any significant impact on present climate
patterns remains speculative.  The latest round of fear mongering stemmed from
a British study that claimed 1995 was the warmest year on record before the
December data was in.  As it turns out, December was mighty frigid, and 1995
was an ordinary year.  According to the satellite data released a few weeks
after the hysteria, 1995 was the 8th warmest of the last 15 years -- yet
Jessica and the papers largely ignored it. <p>
	Why is this?  To the Jessicas of the world, global warming is like any
religious belief, unmovable by facts or logic.  They find Paradise in nature,
the Fall in Man's increased reliance on technology and economic growth.
Only global planners can protect life outside the Garden!  Evidence that the
earth is robust, that disaster is not close, weakens the appeal of these
coercive utopians' policy prescriptions.<p>
	So, while the skies of Planet Earth are likely to remain clear for some time,
we should all expect far more stormy political weather.  Environmentalism has
become the last refuge of scoundrels; the last area where statism retains any
popular appeal.  We'll see much stormier weather before the policy skies
finally clear. <p>

The environmentalist assault on chlorine has taken a recent turn.  Organochlorines, we are now told, not only cause cancer, they are capable of altering human and animal sexuality as well.   For instance, environmentalists blame organochlorines such as dioxin for altering the sexual characteristics of fish.  Other compounds are blamed for (no joke) creating lesbian sea gulls, and shrinking alligators' penises.
<P>
	Perhaps the most potent weapon in the anti-chlorine activists' arsenal has been the charge of falling sperm counts.  The alarm over chemically-induced male infertility was prompted by a 1992 study from Copenhagen that claimed to show that sperm concentration per unit volume had fallen by over 40 per cent from 1940 to 1990.  A year later, one of the authors of the study, Niels Skakkebaek, penned a follow-up piece with Richard Sharpe of the British Medical Research Council Reproductive Biology Unit in Edinburgh, Scotland, in the journal <I>Lancet</I>.  The duo speculated that fetal exposure to synthetic estrogens may be the prime suspect in the sperm count crisis.
<P>
	Unsurprisingly, the <I>Lancet</I> article prompted a barrage of alarmist media reports. The BBC aired a documentary entitled "The Assault on the Male;" here in the U.S., Connie Chung devoted an installment of her now-defunct investigative show, "Eye to Eye," to the plight of infertile men under chemical siege. As scientists have noted, however, the original study -- a  meta-analysis  of 61 studies on falling sperm counts -- suffered from numerous statistical and methodological shortcomings. 
<P>
	First, the Danish researchers included studies irrespective of their sample size, many of which were so small that they would not normally be considered admissible evidence. In an editorial for the <I>British Medical Journal</I>, Stephen Farrow of Middlesex University's Health Research Center noted that one study was of seven men; 11 others were of fewer than 20 men; and another 29 were of fewer than 50 men. These were  given greater weight than they deserved,  Farrow wrote, through the misapplication of statistical tests. 
<P>
	After investigating the Skakkebaek data, a different team of researchers showed that nearly all of the alleged decreases could be explained by the changing definition of a normal sperm count over the past 50 years.  They concluded in a study also published by the <I>BMJ</I> that "The original evidence does not support the hypothesis that the sperm count declined significantly between 1940 and 1990."
<P>
	Furthermore, critics who reanalyzed the data have challenged the timing of the decline reported.  As reproductive specialists Anna Brake and Walter Krause of Philipps University in Marburg, Germany explained in a letter to the <I>BMJ</I>, 48 of the studies used in the meta-analysis were published since 1970 -- accounting for 88 percent of the men studied. These studies actually showed a slight <I>increase</I> in sperm counts. Krause and Brake concluded that "care should be taken when discussing a causal relation with environmental factors."
<P>
	The plea for caution fell upon deaf ears at Greenpeace headquarters.  Seizing on the Skakkebaek findings, the environmental group launched a new advertising campaign that publicized the alleged environmental threat to man’s virility.  "You’re not half the man your father was," the ads taunted.   
<P>
	The Skakkebaek findings have also been touted by the authors of <I>Our Stolen Future</I>, the self-described "sequel" to Rachel Carson's <I>Silent Spring</I>.  This book warns of "reports that human sperm counts have plummeted over the past half century, a blink of the eye in the history of the human species."  Researchers that are skeptical of the sperm count decline are compared to those who challenged the initial scientific findings linking chloro-flourocarbons to depletion of the ozone layer.
<P>
	Skepticim is warranted, Greenpeace and <I>Our Stolen Future</I> notwithstanding.  Responsible scientists have assailed environmentalists for exploiting the data.  As one set of outraged researchers argued, "there is no conclusive evidence" for blaming exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the environment for falling sperm counts or shrinking penises. The hypothesis "is based on evidence too limited to allow firm conclusions to be drawn.  It is premature to call for a ban on these or any other chemicals before more research is done.  They are misrepresenting this research.  They are taking something which is a clearly stated hypothetical link and calling it fact." The identity of these critics?  None other than Neils Skakkebaek and Richard Sharpe, whose research prompted the sperm scare in the first place.
<P>
	There is certainly evidence that some chemical compounds -- both natural and manmade -- are capable of impacting human and animal reproductive systems.  In theory, this could impact human fertility.  To date, however, the scientific evidence does not support such a claim.  The charge that synthetic compounds are sterilizing men, like so many of the charges leveled by environmental activists over the years, simply does not hold up to scrutiny.

<H1>Rachel Was Wrong</H1>

Rachel Carson's <i>Silent Spring</i> ushered in an era of national concern
over the potential effects of synthetic chemicals.  Published in 1962,
Carson's book suggested that the human use of synthetic chemicals amounted
to a "relentless war on life" and that modern society was
"losing the right to be called civilized." Americans experienced
widespread angst over the potential carcinogenic effects of chemicals over the
subsequent decades. As it turns out, Rachel Carson was wrong.<p>
	Last month, the National Research Council, the research arm of the National
Academy of Sciences, released a report on carcinogens in the human diet. Over
thirty years after <i>Silent Spring's</i> publication, a wealth of
scientific evidence suggests that many of the concerns Carson raised were
unfounded.<p>
	Plants have evolved numerous chemicals that serve as defensive agents against
predators. Some kill predators outright, others act as deterrents in some
fashion.  Many of these substances can be considered natural pesticides, and
are quite common.  These chemicals are likely present in our diet in amounts
exceeding the residues of synthetic pesticides.  <p>
	Nearly a decade ago Bruce Ames, of the University of California at Berkeley,
began to point out that many naturally occurring chemicals tested positive for
carcinogenicity in lab tests on rodents.  In fact, the percentage of
naturally-occurring chemicals identified as "carcinogenic" in rodent
bioassays does not differ significantly from that of synthetic chemicals. This
led Ames to the conclusion that insofar as there was a cancer risk in the human
diet, it was more likely the result of naturally-occurring chemicals than
synthetics.  There are after all, many more naturally occurring chemicals than
synthetic.  More importantly, Ames posited that the cancer threat posed by food
was likely small to nonexistent.  The NAS report confirmed the Ames thesis.<p>
	The NAS study concluded that based upon existing exposure data, the great
majority of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals in the diet appear to
be present at levels below which any significant adverse biological effect is
likely.  So low, in fact, that they are unlikely to pose any appreciable cancer
risk whatsoever.<p>
	The study also concluded that natural components of the diet may prove to be
of greater concern than synthetic components with respect to cancer risk.  Synthetic chemicals account for a
tiny fraction of the daily dietary intake of substances that have been labeled
carcinogens in lab tests.  Because of the greater abundance of
naturally-occurring substances in the diet, the total exposure to
naturally-occurring carcinogens far exceeds the exposure to synthetic
carcinogens.<p>
	Another finding of the NAS study was that the basic mechanisms involved in the
entire process of cancer -- from exposure of the organism to expression of
tumors -- are similar, if not identical for synthetic and naturally
occurring carcinogens.  The NAS study concluded that there was no notable
difference between synthetic and naturally occurring carcinogens.  The argument
made by many environmentalists that the human body has evolutionary defenses
against natural carcinogens, but not against synthetic ones, does not hold
water.<p>
	Despite the strong scientific consensus that underlies the NAS report, many 
environmentalists (who have made their careers opposing the trace levels of
pesticides on foods) still can't seem to believe it.  Al Meyerhoff, senior
attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council told the <i>New York
Times</i> that despite the report, synthetic chemicals "can still cause 
thousands of cancers in consumers, and they should be avoided whenever
possible."  Psychologists usually refer to this as denial.<p>
	The NAS study reviewed the issue of how many cancers might be caused by
carcinogens in the diet.  In citing one study the authors acknowledged that
"except for alcohol, the known dietary carcinogens could not account for
more than a few hundred cancer cases." This amounts to less than 0.01
percent -- one ten-thousandth -- of all cancers. What actually does
cause cancer, if not pesticide residues and other chemicals, is not earth
shattering news.  Smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and over eating were
listed as the biggest contributors to an increased cancer risk.<p>
	But just when you thought it was safe to go back into the supermarket,
environmentalists have created another environmental affliction.  Using cancer
as a scare tactic appears to be waning, so environmentalists have latched onto
a new cause celebr&eacute; -- endocrine disrupters.<p>
	The new theory is that certain synthetic chemicals, such as DDT, PCBs, various
organochlorines and other synthetic chemicals,  mimic estrogen or other
hormones and can interfere in human development and reproduction.  Among the
charges made is that these chemicals are responsible for a global decline in
human sperm counts -- even though there is no conclusive evidence that
sperm counts are declining.<p>
	This collective hypochondria is laid out in the new book by World Wildlife
Fund Senior Scientist Theo Colburn, environmental writer Diane Dumanowski, and
W. Alton Jones Foundation Director John Peterson Myers.  Their collective angst
is ominously entitled, <i>Our Stolen Future</i>.<p>
	Unfortunately for the proponents of synthetic endocrine disruption, mother
nature has already beaten them too it.  Just as they produce carcinogens, a
large number of plants routinely produce significant quantities of hormone
mimicking chemicals.  The human diet is simply filled with foods that contain
naturally-occurring endocrine disrupters from genestein in soybeans to
cafesterol in coffee. <p>
	Given the wealth of human exposure to these substances, if there were
widespread human effects, the world would have seen them by now.  The lack of
compelling data suggests that the kids are all right, and there is no cause for
alarm.  The issue of endocrine disruption clearly warrants further study, but
not the sort of hysteria routinely ginned up by environmental activists.<p>
	Let's just hope that it doesn't take science 30 years to do for
concerns about endocrine disrupters what it did for concerns about cancer.<p>

<P>In March the President’s Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD), made up of governmental, environmental and business leaders, presented to President Clinton its final report, Sustainable America.  Impressed by this document, the <I>New York Times</I> reported a truce between environmentalists and businessmen over environmental issues.  Apparently, both agree that the GOP freshman are too  radical  and that Congress should not roll back environmental regulation.  

<P>	Ever the font of pro-government conventional wisdom, the <I>Times</I> fails to realize that industry often finds government regulation desirable.  In fact, most lobbying efforts are designed to secure regulation which improves a firm’s or an industry’s competitive advantage over its rivals.  For example, the Archer Daniels Midland Company pressed hard for a rule in the <A HREF="topic.html#air">Clean Air Act</A> that would guarantee a market share for ethanol, despite the lack of clear environmental gains from such a rule.  The book <A HREF="/books.html#politics"><I>Environmental Politics: Public Costs, Private Rewards</I></A> exhibits several examples of such rent-seeking behavior.
<P>
	That said, the PCSD report serves two primary purposes.  First, it gives credence to a whole array of discredited and failed welfare state programs.  For example, the council calls for an  adequate  minimum wage, more federal job training, greater federal involvement in education, more foreign aid, an expansion of Medicaid, more funding of family planning services, greater federal involvement in agriculture, increased daycare programs, etc., all to ensure better environmental protection.
<P>
	Second, the report recommends new environmental programs which would further exacerbate the anti-competitive and anti-growth features of environmental laws.  Particularly objectionable is the recommendation for  extended product responsibility.   Under this system  manufacturers, suppliers, users, and disposers of products share responsibility for the environmental effects of products and waste streams.  
<P> 
	This proposal would lessen rather than expand responsibility.  In the market, the books are cleared at each stage of a product’s  life-cycle,  allowing each agent to consider the costs of his or her own actions.  Extending liability throughout the life-cycle would force each agent, when determining costs, to consider a whole range of possible costs imposed by others, as well as the associated probabilities.  The result would be a dramatic increase in uncertainty, blurring the lines of responsibility, rampant litigation, and a decrease in risk-taking by entrepreneurs.  Even though the PCSD claims to work toward  economic growth, environmental health, and social justice  many of its recommendations would destroy economic growth without advancing the other two goals.
<P>
	The PCSD has called for extensive use of the  Precautionary Principle.   It states that  Even in the face of scientific uncertainty, society should take reasonable actions to avert risks where the potential harm to human health or the environment is thought to be serious or irreparable.   Many of the most notorious environmental scares --  dioxin, alar, asbestos, etc. --  prompted such precautionary measures.  Government’s pursuit of perfect safety in the absence of reasonable scientific certainty  has led to policies that are irresponsible, extremely costly and in some cases, even deadly.
<P>
	Finally the report is completely devoid of any discussion of the institutions   property rights, contracts, and the rule of law   which have made sustainability possible.  This oversight is indicative of the anti-market, pro-government bias throughout the report.
<P>
	There are some redeeming qualities.  The PCSD does call for the elimination of environmentally damaging subsidies.  The report also constitutes a rhetorical move toward the market.  However, in reality it is a thinly veiled excuse for extensive government intervention into the market.  As such it should be rejected.

<CENTER>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
</CENTER>

<P> World trade has been expanding rapidly for several decades, even outpacing
global production.  In the U.S. alone, the economy quadrupled in size since the
early 1950s, while exports grew sevenfold.<A HREF="trade7.html#1"><sup>1</sup></A>  In
recent years the
trend has been even more pronounced.  Trade&#146;s share of the U.S. economy
rose from 5 percent of GNP in the 1970s to 15 percent by the late
1980s.<A HREF="trade7.html#2"><sup>2</sup></A>   In part, the growth in world trade is the
result of a
reduction of average tariffs from 40 percent in the 1950s to less than 5
percent today.<A HREF="trade7.html#3"><sup>3</sup></A>  In addition, technological
innovation has reduced
the costs of transportation and communication, easing the flow of goods and
services.<p>
<p>
     By the early 1970s, world trade had significantly liberalized under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but the lowering of selected tariffs
did not mean an end to protectionism.  Increased competition brought on by
growing trade put pressure on governments to find new ways to protect domestic
production in the absence of tariffs.  The terms of GATT offered countries
&#147;a freeway to still more protectionism,&#148; through subsidies,
standards, regulations, and other non-tariff barriers during the
1980s.<A HREF="trade7.html#4"><sup>4</sup></A>  Though average tariffs are currently low in
the U.S.,
extremely high tariffs remain in place for key products, especially those of
greatest importance to developing countries.<A HREF="trade7.html#5"><sup>5</sup></A> 
Important sectors,
such as agriculture, remain protected by massive price support programs.
Subsidies and import restrictions protect sugar, cotton, tobacco, peanuts and
other commodities.  The Multi-Fiber Arrangement, though negotiated under the
auspices of GATT for &#147;the reduction of trade barriers,&#148; allowed the
U.S. to impose quota restrictions on textile and apparel imports.<A
HREF="trade7.html#6"><sup>6</sup></A>
Likewise, the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences program (GSP) utilizes
GATT provisions allowing preferential tariff treatment to developing country
exports.<A HREF="trade7.html#7"><sup>7</sup></A>  Provisions in the U.S. Harmonized Tariff
Schedules
provide differential treatment for certain U.S. products assembled abroad and
imported back to the U.S., enabling multinational corporations to engage in
Third World production-sharing.<A HREF="trade7.html#8"><sup>8</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Concerns about &#147;fair trade&#148; prompted the U.S. to depart somewhat
from the GATT process in order to negotiate a regional trade bloc in North
America, and related trade arrangements in Latin America via the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative and the Caribbean Basin Initiative.<A
HREF="trade7.html#9"><sup>9</sup></A>  These
preferential trade schemes are a mixed blessing since they promote trade and
investment diversion, rather than true free trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#10"><sup>10</sup></A> 
Separately,
the U.S. government has negotiated import quotas for steel, autos, machine
tools, and ocean shipping.<A HREF="trade7.html#11"><sup>11</sup></A>  During the 1980s, the
U.S. signed over
170 bilateral trade agreements.<A HREF="trade7.html#12"><sup>12</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The fastest growing form of protectionism takes place through administrative
trade retaliation laws.<A HREF="trade7.html#13"><sup>13</sup></A>  Section 301 of the Trade
and Tariff Act
of 1974 authorizes the U.S. Trade Representative to take action to eliminate
foreign barriers to U.S. exports.  In addition, the 1988 Super 301 provision
sets timetables for the removal of foreign trade barriers, and authorizes
punitive and retaliatory trade sanctions against the imports of trading
partners the U.S. considers to be unfair traders.  These laws amply demonstrate
that protectionists desire &#147;free trade abroad but not so much at
home.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#14"><sup>14</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The merits of U.S. trade actions are often highly dubious.  Under anti-dumping
laws, the individual companies can initiate procedures to restrict imports
which they feel are priced too low.  Trade bureaucracies find dumping in
approximately 95 percent of the cases investigated.<A
HREF="trade7.html#15"><sup>15</sup></A>  Likewise,
countervailing duties may be placed on imports which the U.S. determines to
have benefited from government subsidies.  In one example from 1986, the U.S.
countervailed a Thai rice subsidy 100 times smaller than the U.S. subsidy to
its own rice growers.<A HREF="trade7.html#16"><sup>16</sup></A>  During the 1980s,
Congress broadened the
scope of administrative trade barriers, leading to a steady increase in the
number of complaints filed.<p>
<p>
     Pursuant to Section 301, the U.S. government has made prolific use of GATT
dispute settlement procedures.  As a result, according to the U.S. trade
representative, &#147;we [the U.S.] have been the complaining party in the
dispute settlement system in the GATT more often than any other
member...&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#17"><sup>17</sup></A>  Because of this, Congress in
1988 authorized the
President to strengthen GATT&#146;s dispute settlement system to encourage
&#147;tougher&#148; trade retaliation procedures.  In addition, the U.S. sought
to preserve its protectionist trade laws in the most recent Uruguay Round of
GATT trade negotiations.  As the U.S. trade representative reported to
Congress:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The Uruguay Round will not impair the effective enforcement of our trade laws,
especially Section 301 and our anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws.  Our
trade laws will continue to be our most important and effective response to
dumping and subsidies that injure U.S. industries.  As a result of the Uruguay
Round agreements, Section 301 will be even more effective than it has been in
the past in addressing foreign unfair trade barriers.  We have an improved
dispute settlement system with tight time periods for action, panel reports
that cannot be blocked by one party and the right of cross-sectoral
retaliation.<A HREF="trade7.html#18"><sup>18</sup></A><p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
     Though non-tariff barriers are proliferating, world trade continues its
expansion.  Yet a new rationale for protectionism is emerging which argues for
the restriction of trade as a means of preserving and protecting the
environment.  This form of &#147;green&#148; protectionism demands that high
environmental standards be linked to trade.  &#147;Environmentalism in various
guises has crept kudzu-like into the international trade arena so that we are
currently witnessing a &#145;greening&#146; of international trade,&#148;
writes William H. Lash III, associate professor of law at George Mason
University.<A HREF="trade7.html#19"><sup>19</sup></A>  The &#147;greening&#148; of trade
could fundamentally
change the international trading system.<p>

<H2>The Environmental Critique of Trade</H2>
</center>

<P>     Environmental objections to trade and proposals for the &#147;greening&#148;
of trade are a fundamental assault on free trade principles.  &#147;A more
accurate name than the persuasive label &#145;free trade&#146;...is deregulated
international commerce,&#148; scolds World Bank environmentalist Herman
Daly.<A HREF="trade7.html#20"><sup>20</sup></A>  International regulation of trade is
necessary &#147;to
build environmental responsibility into economic activity,&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#21"><sup>21</sup></A>
and to assure that &#147;trade meets the goals of environmentally sustainable
development,&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#22"><sup>22</sup></A> in the words of Jay Hair,
president of one of
the largest environmental organizations in the U.S., the National Wildlife
Federation.  As trade has become globalized, environmentalists argue, so has
the magnitude of environmental degradation.  &#147;Further growth beyond the
present scale is overwhelmingly likely to increase costs more rapidly than it
increases benefits, thus ushering in a new era of &#145;uneconomic growth&#146;
that impoverishes rather than enriches,&#148; the foreboding Daly
intones.<A HREF="trade7.html#23"><sup>23</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The &#147;green&#148; trade agenda necessarily entails greater political
management and regulation of the private sector to safeguard social and
environmental goals.  In the eyes of environmental groups like the Worldwatch
Institute, &#147;trade can bring greater prosperity and improved quality of
life, if properly managed, but if not it can become an engine of enormous
destruction&#148; of biodiversity, the global climate, and natural
resources.<A HREF="trade7.html#24"><sup>24</sup></A>  Fearing destruction of the
&#147;global&#148;
environment, environmental groups call for radical alterations in the free
market system by government.  The World Wildlife Fund, for instance, takes aim
at the market&#146;s calculation of prices:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The environmental impacts and consumption of natural resources stemming from
the production of goods are rarely fully accounted for in the goods&#146;
market prices.  The costs of these impacts are said to be
&#145;externalized.&#146;  International trade generates adverse impacts on the
environment and natural resources largely as a result of the externalization of
these costs at the production stage.<A HREF="trade7.html#25"><sup>25</sup></A><p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
     The lack of &#147;accurate&#148; pricing in a market leads to economic
distortions, which prevent environmental quality from reaping the benefits of
the market&#146;s efficiency.  Instead, the environment becomes a victim of
human exploitation. <p>
<p>
 Robert Repetto, senior economist at the World Resources Institute, calls for
&#147;effective legal, regulatory, or economic policies [to] substitute for the
lack of markets in environmental quality.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#26"><sup>26</sup></A><p>

     Environmentalists are particularly concerned with trade between progressive
nations (with high regulatory standards) and more free-market or less developed countries (with lower regulatory standards).  Nations without strict regulatory
standards attract accelerated flows of international capital investment,
leading to the creation of &#147;pollution havens.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#27"><sup>27</sup></A>  The lack
of stringent environmental regulation gives firms an unfair competitive trade
advantage, amounting to an environmental subsidy which enables firms to
undercut prices in export markets.  This phenomenon is called environmental
dumping, or &#147;eco-dumping.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#28"><sup>28</sup></A>  Vice
President Al Gore, in
his bestselling <i>Earth in the Balance</i>, argues that &#147;weak and
ineffectual enforcement of pollution control measures should also be included
in the definition of unfair trading practices.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#29"><sup>29</sup></A> <p>
<p>
     The remedy for eco-dumping is a mixture of protectionism, industrial policy,
and regulation.  To offset the unfair cost advantages of another nation, a
government can impose tariffs on the offending nation&#146;s imports
(protectionism), or a government can subsidize the exports of its politically
preferred businesses (industrial policy).<A HREF="trade7.html#30"><sup>30</sup></A>  The
purpose of import
and export restrictions and subsidies is to induce nations to adopt stricter
environmental standards, &#147;internalizing&#148; the externalized costs of
unenlightened environmental policies.  In this manner, nations can
&#147;harmonize&#148; their trade-related regulations and risk assessment
practices to facilitate an overall improvement in standards.<A
HREF="trade7.html#31"><sup>31</sup></A>
Harmonization of production standards is envisioned as a means of establishing
minimum environmental standards, either in the context of a regional trade
agreement, or through a system of global environmental
standards.<A HREF="trade7.html#32"><sup>32</sup></A><p>

<H2>Free Trade and Environmental Quality</H2>
</CENTER>


<b>Market &#147;Failure&#148;?</b><p>
<p>
     Environmentalist opposition to free trade stems from harsh scrutiny of
&#147;market failure&#148; and the uncritical acceptance of political
approaches to environmental protection.  Wherever the market &#147;fails&#148;
to protect environmental values to the desired degree, political intervention
is assumed to be the solution.  Because all economic activities have some
impact on environmental quality, there is no end in sight for government
intervention in the marketplace.<A HREF="trade7.html#33"><sup>33</sup></A>  Viewing
economic growth as
incompatible with a healthy environment, the environmental lobby insists on
political restraints on private activity, both domestically and
internationally.  The environmentalist perspective is rapidly becoming
conventional wisdom.  <p>
<p>
     Ultimately, however, there is no contradiction between a commercial free
market and environmental quality.  Numerous academic studies demonstrate a
positive link between economic growth and environmental quality.  Princeton 
University economists Gene M. Grossman and Alan B. Krueger have found that
&#147;economic growth tends to alleviate pollution problems once a
country&#146;s per capita income reaches about $4,000 to $5,000 U.S. dollars.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#34"><sup>34</sup></A>  In
fact, levels of sulfur dioxide are significantly lower in countries that engage
in significant international trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#35"><sup>35</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The link between economic growth and environmental improvement becomes clear
in reviewing the ecological successes of the developed world.  According to the
World Bank, the economies of OECD countries have grown by approximately 80
percent since 1970.<A HREF="trade7.html#36"><sup>36</sup></A>  During that time period,
these countries have
achieved nearly universal access to clean water supplies, sanitation, and waste
disposal.  Air quality has improved dramatically, with particulate emissions
dropping by 60 percent and sulfur dioxide emissions by 38 percent.  Pollution
from large shipping accidents and oilspills has declined, and nearly all
countries have increased the acreage of their forestlands.  Similar statistics
for the developing world demonstrate that improved environmental quality in all
of these areas is generally associated with higher income.<A
HREF="trade7.html#37"><sup>37</sup></A><p>
<p>
     There are a variety of reasons for the beneficial relationship between growth
and environmental quality.  As economic activity increases, so does human
interaction with nature.  Since most human actions strive to improve quality of
life, environmental amenities receive greater attention.  Environmental
improvements are particularly significant in market-oriented economies.  The
societal institutions that facilitate prosperity, such as property rights,
market-based prices, and overall economic freedom, are equally essential for
rising environmental quality.  These institutions form the bulwark of private
stewardship of natural resources, and thus, sustainable management practices.
Market forces naturally drive economies to become more efficient by reducing
the costs associated with energy and materials use, and waste disposal.
Moreover, since growth creates wealth, greater economic resources are made
available to address the primary human needs, which must be fulfilled before
individuals will focus on environmental amenities.  According to Marian
Radetski, an economist at the University of Luleo in Sweden, &#147;rich
consumers are more willing than poor ones to spend substantial parts of their
income for safeguarding high environmental standards.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#38"><sup>38</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Furthermore, poverty is a significant cause of environmental degradation.
Poorer people are more likely to exploit environmental commons in search of
fuelwood and other basic necessities, causing overhunting, overfishing, and
stress to water resources.<A HREF="trade7.html#39"><sup>39</sup></A>   Lacking significant
employment
opportunities and productive land, the Third World poor often must utilize
marginal lands for food production, attempting to farm in deserts or tropical
forests. The result is environmental degradation in the form of soil erosion,
desertification, and deforestation.<A HREF="trade7.html#40"><sup>40</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Moreover, economic growth enables societies to advance in ways that are
environmentally beneficial.  At earlier stages of development, pollution
problems are likely to be more threatening to human beings.  Air and
water-borne hazards can result in immediate illness and/or death.  As societies advance, pollution
problems decline in severity.  Environmental concerns generally become less
life-threatening, and more aesthetic in nature.<p>
<p>
     Even though growth coincides with environmental improvement, &#147;market
failure&#148; is often blamed for the existence of pollution itself.  Many
environmentalists consider the system of capitalism and private enterprise inherently responsible
for environmental externalities.  Only government regulation in the public
interest can force businesses to internalize social costs, according to this
argument, and such regulation must be extended to trade.  Thus, there is a
strong anti-market bias to environmentalist arguments.<p>
<p>
     The environmentalist argument leads inexorably to central planning; any human
activity with environmental impacts must be politically controlled.  Government
is entrusted to effectively foster only the types of economic growth which are
environmentally friendly, while preventing the types that are not.  Yet no
government has the capability of assimilating the vast amounts of economic,
technological, and scientific data necessary to make such determinations.  The
task of ecological central planning is no easier than economic central
planning.<A HREF="trade7.html#41"><sup>41</sup></A><p>
<p>
     If market failure was truly the cause of pollution, we would expect that the
absence of markets in the centrally planned economies of Eastern Europe would
have been environmentally beneficial.  On the contrary, without the profit
motive of the market, some of the worst environmental degradation in the world
has occurred in the former Soviet Bloc.<A HREF="trade7.html#42"><sup>42</sup></A>  Central
planning failed
largely because it could not efficiently distribute resources.  Neither could
it safeguard environmental resources.  Data from sample market and socialist
economies shows that market economies become more resource-efficient with
economic growth.  Socialist countries, however, are generally more resource
intensive, even in times of recession.<A HREF="trade7.html#43"><sup>43</sup></A>  Without a
profit motive,
there is little incentive for political owners of a resource to conserve for
the future in order to maximize returns.<A HREF="trade7.html#44"><sup>44</sup></A><p>
<p>
<A NAME="markets"></A>
<b>Free Markets Are Truly Green</b><p>
<p>
     In a market economy, environmental and other costs are internalized more
thoroughly via the price system.  Internalization is made possible by the
extension of property rights and a system of voluntary exchange, to an ever
wider array of resources.  As environmental and other resources are integrated
into the market system of voluntary exchange, information is conveyed through
prices, which encourages more creative resolutions of environmental and other
problems.  Falling prices for energy and raw materials demonstrate that the
market&#146;s technological improvements and efficiency gains are making
resources more abundant.<A HREF="trade7.html#45"><sup>45</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The &#147;market failure&#148; argument misses the fundamental cause of
pollution &#151; the lack of private property institutions.  Individuals are
far more likely to care for the environmental sustainability of their own
resources.  Logically, the less common property there is, the less pollution
will be tolerated by a society of individual property owners.  Likewise, by
internalizing external costs, market forces obviate the need for corrective
regulations.  By reducing the scope of government intervention, markets enable
individuals to seek redress from those who impose unwanted pollution costs.
Political owner/managers are incapable of seeking adequate redress primarily
because they cannot calculate accurate prices and values for environmental
amenities.<A HREF="trade7.html#46"><sup>46</sup></A>  Thus, a free market effectively
implements the
&#147;polluter pays principle,&#148; making capitalism the only form of
sustainable development.<A HREF="trade7.html#47"><sup>47</sup></A>  Pollution externalities
could be reduced
further by eliminating the remaining barriers to full private property
rights.<p>
<p>
     Environmentalists need not fear that expansion of trade will produce growth in
pollution.  To the extent that expanded trade is generating economic growth,
environmental quality should also improve.  This fundamental economic reality
does not change simply because goods and services are crossing borders.  The
same free market institutions which generate economic gains also generate
environmental gains.  To the extent that protective tariffs and subsidies
restrict and distort trade, they reduce income and, hence, the demand for
environmental quality.<p>
<p>
     Environmentalists have more to fear from protectionism.  Current agricultural
policies cause major distortions of world food production and
trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#48"><sup>48</sup></A>  Industrial countries encourage agricultural
production
with price supports and other subsidies totaling $200 billion per year, while
developing countries discourage agricultural production through tax and trade
policies.<A HREF="trade7.html#49"><sup>49</sup></A>  Agricultural subsidies in the U.S., for
example, are
responsible for intense chemical pesticide and fertilizer use on farmlands.  By
fostering inefficient land use, U.S. subsidies and land setaside programs
contribute to soil erosion and loss of wetlands and forests.  Federal
mismanagement also encourages farmers to overplant while discouraging crop
rotation, depleting soils and exacerbating pest eradication.<A
HREF="trade7.html#50"><sup>50</sup></A>  By
scaling back interventionist government policies, trade liberalization would
have significant environmental benefits.<p>
<p>
<A NAME="focus"></A>
<b>Focus on Global Environment Fosters Ecological Central Planning</b><p>
<p>
     Environmental problems tend to become oversimplified when characterized as
global problems in which responsibility for their solution is commonly shared
by all.  It is no coincidence that global solutions for environmental
protection require global institutions.  In reality, there is no single
&#147;environment&#148; or &#147;ecology&#148; to protect, but rather a vast
array of environmental resources owned by individuals and governments.  Viewing
environmental issues in global terms can only promote state-directed, command
and control regulation, as well as heightened political control of resources.<p>
<p>
     This perspective also leads to a consideration of trade matters as if
government controls the country&#146;s &#147;trade&#148; for the good of the
overall &#147;economy&#148; (or the &#147;international trading system&#148;
for the good of &#147;the international marketplace&#148;), neglecting the
diversity of trading interests of all individuals, as both consumers or
producers.  Indeed, environmentalists propose that care for the global
environment necessitates that the traditional concept of a nation-state be
revised, and that global regulation and governance are required.<A
HREF="trade7.html#51"><sup>51</sup></A>
Because of the global character of the environment, &#147;the distinctions
between jurisdictional and extrajurisdictional interests and rights become
increasingly blurred.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#52"><sup>52</sup></A><p>

<H2>Trade-Related Environmental Standards</H2>
</CENTER>
<A NAME="green"></A>
<P><b>Green Protectionism</b><p>
<p>
     Various measures have been proposed to counteract &#147;ecological
dumping&#148; and to promote fair competition &#147;on a level playing
field.&#148;  Countries with lower standards should &#147;harmonize up&#148;
their standards; countervailing duties should be imposed against imports not
subject to certain environmental standards; and domestic industries subject to
higher environmental standards should be subsidized in order to restore their
trade competitiveness.<A HREF="trade7.html#53"><sup>53</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The many variations on these proposals to incorporate environmental standards
into trade claim to promote freer trade by minimizing the differences between
the environmental protection policies of separate countries.<A
HREF="trade7.html#54"><sup>54</sup></A>  Yet
precisely the opposite has happened when GATT has attempted harmonization of
other government policies in areas such as antidumping, subsidies, technical
standards, customs valuation, import licensing, and procurement.<A
HREF="trade7.html#55"><sup>55</sup></A>
The promulgation of new international rules on these matters has led to
increased litigation and disputes as countries have utilized the wording of
GATT codes to justify new forms of discriminatory protectionism and managed
trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#56"><sup>56</sup></A>  Anti-dumping laws have been the most
virulent of these
practices.  Prior to 1990, roughly two dozen countries had anti-dumping
statutes.  By 1994, 40 countries had adopted them, and soon all GATT
signatories will adopt anti-dumping laws pursuant to harmonization under the
Uruguay Round.<A HREF="trade7.html#57"><sup>57</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Harmonization of environmental policies would be no different.  Since 1979,
GATT standards codes have urged harmonization of technical regulations using a
set of international standards.  Though intended to improve the transparency of
standards for businesses, harmonization has led to heightened use of technical
regulations.  Between 1980 and 1990, GATT recorded 211 instances where nations
had adopted technical regulations under the standards code which had
significant adverse effects on trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#58"><sup>58</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Harmonization under GATT also discourages reform of excessive regulations,
because deregulation is perceived politically as a unilateral concession to
trading partners.<A HREF="trade7.html#59"><sup>59</sup></A>  In practice, then, harmonization
under the
auspices of GATT has served to codify existing measures, which were intended to
disguise protectionism through formalized procedures.<A
HREF="trade7.html#60"><sup>60</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Some standards impede trade only incidentally, as with the use of metric
versus imperial measurements; others pose far more serious non-tariff barriers,
such as pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food standards coupled with rigid inspection and
customs procedures.  To the extent that such standards impose transaction
costs, they distort trade and protect domestic producers.  Even if such
standards treat all products equally, they still raise production costs.  If
product standards are strict
enough, causing foreign suppliers to withdraw from a market, they are no
different than an outright prohibition on imports.<A
HREF="trade7.html#61"><sup>61</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Harmonization of environmental policies would be inappropriate for many
reasons apart from free trade.  Environmental policies are unique to each
country, depending on factors such as natural resource endowments, pollution
absorptive capacity, and underlying material wealth, not to mention cultural
preferences.<A HREF="trade7.html#62"><sup>62</sup></A>  Some communities in rural or
coastal areas can
tolerate higher emissions than urban populations.  Some communities are better
equipped than others to deal with the income trade-offs involved in
environmental regulation.  Wealthier countries can afford greater trade-offs
than poorer countries.  Wealthier countries are also more likely to have
advanced technologies and equipment, while poorer countries and state-directed
economies typically make use of obsolete production methods.  Forcing higher
standards on Third World as a pre-condition for trade would be
counterproductive.<p>
<p>
     &#147;It is only in rare cases that [two countries] will have identical
environmental standards and expenditures in the same industry,&#148; argues
Columbia University&#146;s Jagdish Bhagwati; &#147;To demand that such
harmonization be made a precondition for free trade is therefore to ask for
something that makes no economic sense at all.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#63"><sup>63</sup></A>  Bhagwati
also points out that in industrial countries, rapid economic development has
depended on higher levels of pollution in the early stages, with clean-up
coming later on.<p>
<p>
     If environmental policy differences are unfair trade distortions, the same
reasoning can be used to indict a myriad of other policy
differences.<A HREF="trade7.html#64"><sup>64</sup></A>  Tax rates and incentives, robust
education policies,
and skill-based immigration policies all impact a nation&#146;s trade
competitiveness.  Other intangible factors, such as technological, historical
and socio-economic circumstances, vary from country to country.  To view all of
these differences as sources of unfair advantage is to justify widespread use
of trade barriers, a justification easily exploited by businesses eager to
blame declining competitive performance on cost differences abroad.  In its
&#147;Trade and the Environment&#148; report, the GATT Secretariat properly
asks, &#147;Where is the line to be drawn if the competitive implications of
differences in so many government policies are to become a source of demands
for the neutralization of the consequences for trade?&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#65"><sup>65</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The requirement that trade with another nation be conditioned on its
environmental standards is a recipe for unbridled protectionism, particularly
when mixed with the inherent tendencies of bureaucracies.  If having lower
environmental
standards is considered an unfair trade practice, countervailing duties would
have to be imposed in the same way as U.S. laws remedy dumping and subsidies.
Thus, the amount of the duty would have to be calculated by a government
bureaucracy, which would make its decisions based on political factors and
objectives.  According to Bhagwati, &#147;anyone familiar with the way dumping
calculations are made knows that the Environmental Protection Agency could come
up with virtually any estimates it cared to produce.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#66"><sup>66</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Even imputing the best possible motives to government officials, it would be
exceedingly difficult to achieve real environmental improvements using trade
measures.  Countervailing duties or tariffs would create new barriers to the
expansion of trade, certainly reducing potential income gains for both
producers and consumers.  Trade measures are relatively ineffective against
countries that strenuously object to outside pressure.  A government under the
threat of coercive trade measures is not likely to alter environmental policies
to suit the needs of a foreign government.  Trade measures are more likely to
inspire nationalism in the target country and resentment against foreign
interference.  Consequently, trade measures to promote reduction of trade
barriers have seldom achieved their objectives.<A
HREF="trade7.html#67"><sup>67</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Governments are easily influenced by interest group prodding for
&#147;unwarranted, trade-inhibiting restrictions,&#148; especially when setting
levels of environmental risk.<A HREF="trade7.html#68"><sup>68</sup></A>  Knowing this, many
experts see the
very purpose of harmonization as raising compliance costs for business:
&#147;common standards often result in a high degree of environmental
protection, not infrequently higher than any individual country would have been
willing to adopt on its own.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#69"><sup>69</sup></A>  Harmonized
standards, like
other multilateral environmental policies, promote &#147;coordinated
trade,&#148; not free trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#70"><sup>70</sup></A><p>
<p>
<A NAME="policy"></A>
<b>Policy Uniformity Breeds Cartelization</b><p>
<p>
     Harmonization of non-trade policies does not secure the efficiency gains of
free trade, it does just the opposite.  According to David Robertson of
Australian National University:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
[A]rguments that policies on the environment should be harmonized to avoid the
creation of new trade restrictions demonstrate misunderstanding of the
mechanisms that provide efficiency gains from international trade.  Worse, in
many instances these proposals are made jointly by environmentalists and
industry lobbies which implies a hidden agenda.<A
HREF="trade7.html#71"><sup>71</sup></A><p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>     That agenda is the creation of a government-protected cartel.  Rather than
promoting trade, harmonization will result in cartelization of the global
economy into protected monopolies, and erosion of the free trade principle of
comparative advantage.<A HREF="trade7.html#72"><sup>72</sup></A><p>
<A HREF="trade7.html#"><sup></sup></A><p>
<A HREF="trade7.html#"><sup></sup></A>    Under true free trade, an international division of
labor arises
through each nation maximizing its own trade advantages.<A
HREF="trade7.html#73"><sup>73</sup></A>
Comparative advantage is partially determined by each nation&#146;s regulatory
policies toward business, with excessive regulation driving firms away from
more oppressive countries.  Environmentalists understand that harmonized
standards would alter this dynamic of competitive trade.<A
HREF="trade7.html#74"><sup>74</sup></A> <p>
<p>
     Harmonization reduces competition between governments, leaving them little
incentive to liberalize economies.  Harmonization fosters increased government
intervention, and reduces freedom to revise regulatory policies.<A
HREF="trade7.html#75"><sup>75</sup></A>
Thus, harmonization curtails industrial output by raising testing, production
and distribution costs for producers.  Yet harmonized standards also benefit
established industries by locking in familiar regulations and protecting them
from competition.  New entrants and foreign competitors are put at a distinct
disadvantage by harmonized standards.<p>
<p>
<A NAME="eco"></A>
<b>Eco-imperialism</b><p>
<p>
     When social values are injected into trade politics, the priorities of
developed countries inevitably prevail, a phenomenon known as eco-imperialism.
Yet such paternalistic environmental standards imposed on the Third World come
at the expense of economic development and the poor.  Industrialized countries
tend to support environmental trade measures to ward off some global
environmental crisis that may arise in the next century.  However, the greatest
environmental crises in the Third World involve immediate and local health
concerns.  Inadequate sanitation causes more than 2 million deaths and more
than a billion illnesses annually from water-borne diseases such as cholera and
typhoid.<A HREF="trade7.html#76"><sup>76</sup></A>  Environmental trade measures tend to
penalize the Third
World for its poverty, and force a diversion of resources away from real
problems in order to cater to the preferences of First World environmentalists.
Moreover, green trade measures intrude on the sovereignty of Third World
peoples, depriving them of the use of natural resources such as fisheries,
rainforests, and energy supplies.  Thus many developing countries have come to
suspect that the term &#147;sustainable development&#148; means minimal
development for them.<p>
<p>
     An illustrative example of eco-imperialism was the Tuna-Dolphin dispute
between the U.S. and Mexico.  The 1972 U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act 
(MMPA) sets dolphin protection standards for the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean
fishery.  The law provides a ceiling on the number of dolphins that may be
incidentally killed by tuna fishermen, whose purse-seine nets encircle
yellowfin tuna and the dolphins that school with them.  The U.S. must embargo
tuna imports from any country that takes more than 1.25 times the number of
dolphins as the U.S. fishing fleet in a given year.  The embargo must also be
applied to intermediary countries that import tuna products from an embargoed
country.  Embargoes have been imposed against Mexico, Venezuela, and Vanuatu,
and against intermediate countries in Europe and Central
America.<A HREF="trade7.html#77"><sup>77</sup></A><p>
<p>
     In February 1991, Mexico brought the dispute before the GATT.  A dispute
settlement panel ruled that the MMPA constituted a discriminatory barrier to
trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#78"><sup>78</sup></A>  The regulation was applied beyond U.S.
jurisdiction,
involving an attempt to impose a standard on other countries.  The regulation
did not involve a standard relating to a product characteristic.  Rather, the
MMPA attempted to embargo a product based on a process and production method,
i.e., the manner in which the tuna was produced; thus the MMPA did not qualify
as an internal regulation under GATT.<p>
<p>
     The rejection of extra-jurisdictional enforcement was an important precedent
under GATT.  If allowed, numerous types of import bans could be carried out
&#147;merely because the exporting country pursues environmental or health
policies different from [the importing country].&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#79"><sup>79</sup></A>  The
decision drew visceral opposition from many environmental activists.  Despite
the decision, the U.S. did not withdraw the MMPA, and Mexico has refrained from
seeking adoption of the dispute panel report by the GATT Council, under
diplomatic pressure from the U.S. and under constraints relating to its trade
agreement negotiations with the U.S.<p>
<p>
     The Tuna-Dolphin dispute encapsulates the clash between trade and
environmental values.  The impact was most acute in Venezuela, whose fishermen
contend that U.S. standards are virtually impossible to meet for poorer Third
World countries.  There is no way for a country to predict what the U.S. take
of dolphins will be, making it difficult to remain under the ceiling that
triggers the U.S. embargo.  Venezuelan fishermen have limited access to
dolphin-safe techniques and gear, and cannot afford the prohibitive costs
associated with traveling to the western tropical Pacific, where tuna
congregate with dolphins less frequently.  Venezuela&#146;s tuna fleet shrunk
from 118 boats in 1988 to 34 four years later.  Embargoes under the MMPA have
disrupted trade, destabilized tuna prices, and thrown fishermen out of
work.<A HREF="trade7.html#80"><sup>80</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The MMPA reflects not only the peculiar supremacy of dolphins over human
needs, but also the supremacy of dolphins over other competing ecological
values.  Dolphin protection measures lead to overexploitation of marine
resources and foil sustainable management of the eastern tropical Pacific
fishery.<A HREF="trade7.html#81"><sup>81</sup></A>  Deterred from harming dolphins,
fishermen are forced to
pursue smaller, sexually-immature yellowfin and skipjack tuna.<A
HREF="trade7.html#82"><sup>82</sup></A>
For every dolphin saved, approximately 9,000 undersize tuna are
lost.<A HREF="trade7.html#83"><sup>83</sup></A>  According to James Joseph, director of the
Inter-American
Tropical Tuna Commission, avoiding dolphins also means higher incidental kills
of sharks, mahi-mahi, billfish, and many other marine species.<A
HREF="trade7.html#84"><sup>84</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The Tuna-Dolphin dispute demonstrates that trade-restrictive policies
undertaken for environmental purposes can effectively close markets, but do not
necessarily result in tangible environmental benefits.  Environmental arguments
and value judgments are easily manipulated for protectionist purposes, with
serious consequences for the world&#146;s poor.<p>

<P>There is a growing body of international law involving trade restrictions for
environmental protection.  Emerging global environmental policies are beginning
to have profound impacts on trade and international economic affairs.
According to legal experts, international environmental agreements and treaties
may be harbingers of sweeping new global environment policies which &#147;use
trade restrictions as an integral element of their protective mechanisms and
link international regulation of environmental problems to complex questions of
trade and development.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#85"><sup>85</sup></A><p>

<b>The Earth Summit: Defining Sustainable Development</b><p>
<p>
<u>Agenda 21:</u><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Sustainability requires a process of national, regional, and local resource and
environmental planning, which is in direct conflict with the principle of free
trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#86"><sup>86</sup></A><p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
     Proposals for &#147;socially responsible&#148; trade open up a
&#147;Pandora&#146;s box&#148; of regulations for various production sectors,
including energy resources, mining, metals, plastics, chemicals, agriculture,
lumber, pulp and paper, fisheries, and so on.<A HREF="trade7.html#87"><sup>87</sup></A> 
Environmental
standards for trade gained momentum in June 1992, when world leaders broadly
endorsed the concept of &#147;sustainable development&#148; at the United
Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, also called the Earth Summit.  The conference produced <i>Agenda
21</i>, an 800-page blueprint for environmental planning and international
policy coordination covering a wide variety of issues, including trade,
forestry, desertification, ocean resources, rivers, and women&#146;s rights.
Under the agreement, governments commit themselves to adopt a national strategy
for sustainable development and to strengthen international cooperation on
sustainable development policies.  <i>Agenda 21</i> urges nations to:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
harmonize the various sectoral economic, social and environmental policies and
plans that are operating in the country. . .to ensure socially responsible
economic development while protecting the resource base and environment for the
benefit of future generations . . .[National strategies] should be developed
through the widest possible participation.<A HREF="trade7.html#88"><sup>88</sup></A><p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
     Governments are expected to consider &#147;the implications of economic
instruments and incentives for competitiveness and international trade,&#148;
and &#147;global transboundary issues&#148; related to energy, transportation,
agriculture and forestry, water, wastes, health, tourism and other areas.  The
aim of sustainable development is to facilitate the &#147;integration of social
and environmental costs into economic activities,&#148; by promoting &#147;the
efficient planning and utilization of resources for sustainable development
through sound economic and social policies.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#89"><sup>89</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Sustainable development was first conceived by the 1987 World Commission on
Environment and Development, which had specifically recommended that the GATT
&#147;reflect concern for the impacts of trading patterns on the environment,
and the need for more effective instruments to integrate environment and
development concerns into international trading
arrangements.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#90"><sup>90</sup></A>  The first program area of
<i>Agenda 21</i>
calls on all national governments to achieve Earth Summit goals by

<u>The Rio Declaration:</u><p>
<p>
     The Earth Summit participants also approved the Rio Declaration on Environment
and Development, a set of twenty-seven sustainable development principles.  <p>
<p>
     This global ecological charter effectively places environmental resources
within international jurisdiction.  In it, countries are warned not to degrade
the environment in &#147;areas beyond the limits of national
jurisdiction,&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#101"><sup>101</sup></A> and are urged to
&#147;cooperate in a spirit
of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity
of the Earth&#146;s ecosystem.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#102"><sup>102</sup></A> 
Countries are instructed to
&#147;enact effective environmental legislation&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#103"><sup>103</sup></A> that will
bring about the elimination of &#147;unsustainable patterns of production and
consumption.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#104"><sup>104</sup></A>  Industrialized countries
are blamed for
environmental degradation, and told to take financial responsibility for its

command.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#105"><sup>105</sup></A>  Thus, wealth redistribution
is implicit in
sustainable development.<p>
<p>
     The Rio Declaration calls for environmental standards to be linked to trade in
&#147;a supportive and open international economic system&#148; that would lead
to &#147;sustainable development in all countries, to better address the
problems of environmental degradation.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#106"><sup>106</sup></A> 
Escaping poverty
through international trade would be discouraged, as countries are instructed
not to transfer &#147;activities or substances&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#107"><sup>107</sup></A> that are
considered unhealthy for the Earth&#146;s ecosystem.  Important chemicals and
industrial materials would be removed from ecologically permissible commerce.
The charter also endorses a &#147;precautionary approach&#148; to environmental
policy: &#147;Lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason
for postponing&#148; environmental regulations and
restrictions.<A HREF="trade7.html#108"><sup>108</sup></A><p>

<A NAME="multi"></A>
<b>Multilateral Agreements</b><p>
<p>
     There are approximately 180 international environmental agreements and
treaties.<A HREF="trade7.html#109"><sup>109</sup></A>  More than two thirds of these treaties
were signed
subsequent to the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held
in Stockholm, Sweden.  The U.N. has continued to provide the momentum for
international action since then, sponsoring a dozen major conferences on a
variety of global environmental issues, including population control,
desertification, ozone depletion, and climate change.<A
HREF="trade7.html#110"><sup>110</sup></A>  Of these
international agreements, 19 employ trade restrictions in varying ways to carry
out and enforce their objectives.<A HREF="trade7.html#111"><sup>111</sup></A>  Among the
most important and
far-reaching of these multilateral agreements are those dealing with
ozone-depleting substances, endangered species, and hazardous waste.<p>
<u>Montreal Protocol:</u><p>
<p>
     Signed in 1987, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone
Layer restricts the production and consumption of certain substances thought to
erode the ozone layer, including chloroflourocarbons (CFCs), other chemical
refrigerants, and halons.  Signatories must reduce their consumption of these
controlled substances according to specific deadlines and
percentages.<A HREF="trade7.html#112"><sup>112</sup></A>  Parties must ban trade in
controlled substances and
related products that contain controlled substances, even from countries that
have not signed the Protocol.<A HREF="trade7.html#113"><sup>113</sup></A>  Parties are also
discouraged from
exporting technology that either produces or utilizes CFCs, such as
semiconductors washed with CFCs, and ultimately must ban such
trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#114"><sup>114</sup></A>  The Protocol also contains provisions for
financial and
technical compliance assistance and technology transfer for developing
countries via a Multilateral Fund.<A HREF="trade7.html#115"><sup>115</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The phaseout of CFCs will be very costly &#151; as much as $100 billion in
costs over the next decade for the U.S. alone, by one estimate.<A
HREF="trade7.html#116"><sup>116</sup></A>
The impacts will hit hardest in the Third World, however, where refrigerated
pharmaceuticals and foods are essential to the health and well-being of the
poor.  Refrigerants are responsible for reducing food spoilage and for enabling
a wider distribution of food products.  The Protocol is an exercise in
eco-imperialism &#151; developing nations are made to bear the burden of the
West&#146;s questionable environmental priorities.<p>
<p>
     The Protocol stipulates different trading terms for parties and for
non-parties.  It phases out trade in CFCs between parties, while it bans
imports from non-parties.  In addition, the Protocol bans exports of CFCs to
non-parties.  By restricting imports made with CFCs or other controlled
substances, rather than the substances themselves, parties are enacting trade
measures extra-jurisdictionally regarding a process and production method,
raising the same sort of trade barrier as the Marine Mammal Protection
Act.<A HREF="trade7.html#117"><sup>117</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The principal reason for these Protocol provisions is to encourage
non-signatories to join the agreement, and to prevent non-parties from
undermining the agreement&#146;s goals.<A HREF="trade7.html#118"><sup>118</sup></A>  By
compelling countries
to sign, it is hoped that greater environmental benefits will accrue from the
agreement.  Yet, there is no avoiding that such provisions constitute trade
barriers; they conflict with the free trade principle of non-discrimination
sought by GATT.<A HREF="trade7.html#119"><sup>119</sup></A>  For that reason,
environmentalists fear that a
GATT member could try to invalidate the Montreal Protocol under GATT&#146;s
dispute settlement procedures, proving once and for all that the agreement is
inconsistent with free trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#120"><sup>120</sup></A>  For action under
the Protocol to
be consistent with a country&#146;s obligations under GATT, a rules change or a
GATT waiver of the rules would be required.<A
HREF="trade7.html#121"><sup>121</sup></A><p>
<A HREF="trade7.html#"><sup></sup></A><u></u><p>
<u>Basel Convention</u>:<p>
<p>
     The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous
Wastes and Their Disposal is a treaty &#147;designed to regulate, but more 
fundamentally, to bring to an end, international trade in a very large number
of materials,&#148; according to N. R. Evans.<A
HREF="trade7.html#122"><sup>122</sup></A>  The
Basel Convention was convened to manage the production, trade, and disposal of
waste materials according to baseline international standards.<A
HREF="trade7.html#123"><sup>123</sup></A>
It prohibits export of these waste, scrap and recyclable materials to nations
that prohibit such imports, to non-parties, and to Antarctica.<A
HREF="trade7.html#124"><sup>124</sup></A>
Exports are also prohibited if a party has reason to believe the materials will
not be managed sustainably.<A HREF="trade7.html#125"><sup>125</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Environmental restrictions on the waste trade will not make such trade safer
per se, but will make it less frequent.  Businesses engaged in the waste trade
must 
conform to detailed requirements for written information, in addition to
complex 
notification and consent requirements prior to shipment.<A
HREF="trade7.html#126"><sup>126</sup></A>
According to Evans, the Basel Convention will subject trade in recycled
materials to interminable red tape and bureaucratic delay:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The extra transaction costs imposed on international traders in these materials
will tend to reduce that trade, perhaps very greatly . . .Where the margins on
a particular trade are low. . .then a dramatic increase in transaction costs
will kill the trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#127"><sup>127</sup></A><p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
     Among those hurt will be developing countries which have begun to specialize
in industries based on secondary and scrap materials, which will become more
expensive and harder to find in global markets.<A HREF="trade7.html#128"><sup>128</sup></A> 
Evans describes
the Convention as a government cartel to prevent individuals from trading with
one another for mutual benefit.  Despite environmentalist fears of
&#147;hazardous&#148; wastes, there is no reason why international competition
in recycling and disposal will not result in safer practices.  According to
Evans, the waste trade contains none of the elements of global commons abuse
&#151; &#147;property rights are secure at all times in the
trade.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#129"><sup>129</sup></A>  Thus, internalization of costs is
accomplished by
competitive markets.<p>
<p>
     Like the Montreal Protocol, Basel Convention provisions are inconsistent with
free trade principles.  These provisions apply environmental measures
extra-jurisdictionally, and apply different standards to trade with parties
versus non-parties, making them inconsistent with GATT.<A
HREF="trade7.html#130"><sup>130</sup></A>
Likewise, the ban on exports to the Antarctic region may constitute an
arbitrary trade barrier under GATT.<A HREF="trade7.html#131"><sup>131</sup></A><p>
<p>
<u>CITES</u>:<p>
<p>
     The Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) strictly regulates
international trade in wildlife, with the intent of protecting biodiversity and
preventing extinction.  CITES puts threatened species in three categories, each
with different trade restrictions.  Parties are required to create complex
permit systems for trade in any listed species.<A
HREF="trade7.html#132"><sup>132</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Appendix I bans commercial trade in any species currently endangered,
including trade in the species itself or in species-derived
products.<A HREF="trade7.html#133"><sup>133</sup></A>  Appendix II requires trade permits in
species which
are nearing threatened status, but are not endangered currently.<A HREF="trade7.html#134"><sup>134</sup></A>  Appendix III lists species
that a party
wishes to restrict trade in, if a population or sub-species in its own
territory is threatened.  Certificates of origin are required for other
countries that wish to trade in species on this list.<A
HREF="trade7.html#135"><sup>135</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Under CITES, there are bans on imports of elephants, whales, flying foxes,
polar bears, fur seals, and migratory birds, among other species.<A
HREF="trade7.html#136"><sup>136</sup></A>
Because trade in non-domestic species can be banned, CITES may constitute an
extra-territorial environmental trade barrier of the type that was struck down
in the U.S.-Mexico
tuna-dolphin panel.<A HREF="trade7.html#137"><sup>137</sup></A>  Also, because CITES
parties are required to
regulate trade even with non-parties, the agreement may run afoul of GATT
prohibition against quotas, bans, and licensing schemes.<A
HREF="trade7.html#138"><sup>138</sup></A><p>
<b></b><p>
<A NAME="merging"></A>
<b>Merging international trade and environment rules.</b><p>
<p>
     By defining a steadily increasing number of environmental quality issues as
global commons problems, multilateral treaties are effectively expanding
international jurisdiction in these areas. Environmentalist advocates of
multilateralism welcome the expanding principles of international law, pointing
out that under the Law of the Sea convention, for example, &#147;the
international community has reserved jurisdiction over these [global] commons
areas.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#139"><sup>139</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The multitude of environmental restrictions mandated by international
agreements is having a growing impact on world trade.  Obligations under many
environmental agreements conflict with the obligations of multilateral trade
rules, which were originally intended to expand trade, not restrict it.
Political trade management regimes, such as GATT, have traditionally not
recognized much of a governmental role in environmental regulation outside of
national jurisdictions.  As multilateral action to regulate the global commons
continues to grow, environmental advocates argue that international
environmental policies should be incorporated into government-negotiated trade
rules so that there is no inconsistency between the two.<p>
<p>
     An even greater factor in the greening of trade policies is the environmental
establishment&#146;s desire to strengthen compliance with multilateral
agreements 
and to quicken the pace of multilateral action.  Implementation of
environmental agreements is frustrated in part by inadequate monitoring and
enforcement,<A HREF="trade7.html#140"><sup>140</sup></A> and by the chronic managerial
inefficiency of the
U.N. system.<A HREF="trade7.html#141"><sup>141</sup></A>  Some countries, especially in the
poorer Third
World, are deterred by the prohibitive costs of environmental restrictions and
by loss of national sovereignty.<A HREF="trade7.html#142"><sup>142</sup></A><p>
<p>
     To overcome these problems, a report by the General Accounting Office suggests
that a greater sense of urgency about global environmental crises might be necessary, and recommends more active participation by environmental
interest
groups in monitoring enforcement of multilateral agreements.<A
HREF="trade7.html#143"><sup>143</sup></A>  GAO
further recommends greater use of technology transfer programs and financial
inducements for Third World governments, such as the Global Environment
Facility, the financing instrument for the U.N. Biodiversity and Global Climate
Change Conventions.<A HREF="trade7.html#144"><sup>144</sup></A>   These proposals would
increase the foreign
indebtedness of developing countries, strengthen central governments, and
impede free market economic reforms.<p>
<p>
     Enforcement of multilateral environmental agreements can also be ratcheted up
gradually, as Worldwatch Institute&#146;s Hilary French explains: <p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Paradoxically, one way to make environmental agreements more effective is in
some cases to make them less enforceable &#151; and therefore more palatable to
the negotiators who may initially feel threatened by any loss of sovereignty .
. .[Such agreements] can help to create an international consensus, mobilize
aid, and lay the groundwork for the negotiation of binding treaties
later.<A HREF="trade7.html#145"><sup>145</sup></A><p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
     Under this strategy, a non-binding framework convention is agreed to first,
which identifies a global crisis and establishes a political commitment to take
some undefined action at a later date.  Then, information from research and
monitoring programs is used by governments and environmental interest groups to
justify binding targets and timetables in protocols and treaties.<A
HREF="trade7.html#146"><sup>146</sup></A>
Along these lines, the World Resources Institute calls the creation of an
institution to monitor <i>Agenda 21</i>, the U.N. Commission on Sustainable
Development, &#147;one of the quiet successes of the Earth
Summit.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#147"><sup>147</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Ultimately, however, adequate enforcement of global environmental regulatory
policies is possible only through trade measures.  In some international
environmental agreements, like the Montreal Protocol, trade restrictions are
seen as integral to the agreement&#146;s purpose.  In others, trade measures
are necessary to induce additional countries to join an
agreement.<A HREF="trade7.html#148"><sup>148</sup></A>  Many environmentalists argue that
effective solutions
to &#147;transboundary&#148; pollution problems would be impossible without
greater coordination of trade and environmental policies, including trade
measures.<A HREF="trade7.html#149"><sup>149</sup></A>  For example, the threat of U.S. trade
sanctions has
been instrumental in pressuring whaling nations to adhere to the strictures of
the International Whaling Convention.<A HREF="trade7.html#150"><sup>150</sup></A><p>
<p>
     International institutions such as the OECD, GATT, and UNCTAD have each
attempted to address the need for coordinated, multilateral trade and
environment policies<A HREF="trade8.html#151"><sup>151</sup></A>  In 1972, the major
industrial powers of
the OECD collaborated to produce a report entitled &#147;Guiding Principles
Concerning the International Aspects of Environmental Policies,&#148; which
recommends more stringent environmental standards and that governments should
harmonize their standards.<A HREF="trade8.html#152"><sup>152</sup></A>  Since that time,
OECD efforts have
evolved, and in 1991 an OECD report declared that &#147;unlike sustainable
development, free trade is not an end in itself. . .&#148;<A
HREF="trade8.html#153"><sup>153</sup></A>  An
EPA trade and environment advisory committee, created in 1990, recommended that
the U.S. seek to integrate environmental concerns into multilateral and
regional trade agreements, and that the U.S. seek to harmonize international
environmental standards.<A HREF="trade8.html#154"><sup>154</sup></A><p>
<p>
     GATT&#146;s theoretical work has been marginally less sympathetic to
multilateralism than that of other international institutions.   Nevertheless,
even GATT concedes the environmentalist premise that multilateral solutions to
environmental problems are necessary, arguing that they &#147;offer the best
chance of ensuring that the policy changes deal directly with the problem at
hand and that they provide minimum scope for protectionist
abuses.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#155"><sup>155</sup></A>  Though GATT seeks to
minimize trade discrimination
and unilateral sanctions, it does not seek to prevent the growing use of trade
measures through multilateral environmental agreements.<A
HREF="trade8.html#156"><sup>156</sup></A>  In fact,
the GATT panel decision in the Tuna-Dolphin dispute argued that U.S. trade
restrictions on dolphin-unsafe tuna from Mexico could be GATT-consistent if
part of an international agreement.<A HREF="trade8.html#157"><sup>157</sup></A>  And in
1993, countries
participating in the GATT Working Group on Environmental Measures and
International Trade agreed that the underlying philosophy of GATT is basically
compatible with the guiding principles of <i>Agenda 21</i>.<A
HREF="trade8.html#158"><sup>158</sup></A>
Thus, the intellectual case for linkage of trade and environmental policies
remains fundamentally unopposed by traditional defenders of a free trading
system &#151; the United States, the other industrialized nations, and GATT.<p>

<P><B>Environmental Standards and the European Customs Union</b><p>
<p>
     Tangible actions to incorporate environmental standards into trade policies
initially began in the European Community, which has long fancied placing
environmental protection, along with economic policies, under international
jurisdiction.  The EC can be seen as a model for regional free trade area
regimes, in that its trade and environment rules govern separate and distinct
sovereign nations.<A HREF="trade8.html#159"><sup>159</sup></A>  The EC model for
integration of trade and
environment policies could have significant influence on GATT.<A
HREF="trade8.html#160"><sup>160</sup></A><p>
<p>
     EC international law is based on the Treaty of Rome, as modified by the Single
European Act of 1987 and the Maastricht treaty of 1991.  The former eliminated
internal barriers to trade as of 1992 (hence the term &#147;EC-92&#148;) and
established a general framework for European environmental policies.
Maastricht, when fully implemented, will further amplify the relationship
between economic integration and uniform environmental
policies.<A HREF="trade8.html#161"><sup>161</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The establishment of a single market and customs union in the EC has provided
the basis for a harmonization of environmental standards to a uniform level.
According to an EC report on environmental policy, Article 100a of the Treaty
of Rome establishes a base level of environmental protection within a framework
that allows some flexibility to member countries.<A HREF="trade8.html#162"><sup>162</sup></A> 
Given that
different countries have different priorities, member countries&#146; standards
may exceed the stringency of the base level.  Yet they may not fall short of
the minimum EC level, so generally, standards are upwardly
harmonized.<A HREF="trade8.html#163"><sup>163</sup></A>  The EC report states: &#147;the
purpose of Community
level quality targets is to ensure that minimum standards are observed.&#148;<p>
<p>
     Rising environmental standards have become legally accepted in the EC despite
their status as non-tariff trade barriers.  The tone of European trade and
environment policy was set in 1981, when Denmark passed a bottle bill requiring
all beverages to be sold in returnable containers.  This requirement is
effectively a protectionist measure since it discriminates against producers
outside of Denmark, whose higher transportation costs make recycling
uneconomical.  However, the measure was upheld in the European Court of
Justice, which determined that Denmark&#146;s duty to avoid trade
discrimination was outweighed by its responsibility to protect the global
environment.  Denmark&#146;s victory has emboldened other countries to adopt
similar protectionist legislation justified as environmental protection.
Germany, for instance, subsequently passed legislation requiring recycling of
all forms of consumer product packaging.  &#147;Companies that are unable to
establish a return cycle in Germany will not be able to sell in that
market,&#148; writes Konrad von Moltke, senior fellow at the World Wildlife
Fund; &#147;presumably these regulations ...will set a pattern for the
EC,&#148; and possibly GATT.<A HREF="trade8.html#164"><sup>164</sup></A><p>
<p>
<A NAME="green"></A>
<b>NAFTA&#146;s Green Accords</b><p>
<p>
     Some hope that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) could parallel
the EC.  Carol Browner, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, calls the NAFTA between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, &#147;the
&#145;greenest&#146; trade agreement ever negotiated.&#148;  NAFTA was
remarkable in that the Clinton administration secured the endorsement of six
environmental groups for a trade agreement &#151; Natural Resources Defense
Council, National Wildlife Federation, Environmental Defense Fund, National
Audubon Society, Conservation International and the World Wildlife Fund.<p>
<p>
<u>History and Evolution:</u><p>
<p>
     Environmentalist support was cultivated throughout the NAFTA negotiations.
Environmental organizations participated in numerous public hearings, and
submitted advisory reports to the U.S. trade representative.  Representatives
of these groups were briefed extensively during the negotiations and the
ratification process.  Remarkably, some even received security clearances to
participate in an advisory role with U.S. negotiators.  In addition, several
environmental regulatory agencies were involved directly in the negotiations,
especially EPA, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Interior.<A
HREF="trade8.html#165"><sup>165</sup></A>
&#147;These participating agencies...incorporated many [business and
environmental] groups&#146; proposals into U.S. negotiating positions,&#148;
reveals the U.S. trade representative&#146;s office.<A
HREF="trade8.html#166"><sup>166</sup></A><p>
     The consultation process began under the Bush administration, and produced a
number of significant recommendations which guided the U.S. negotiating team.
Among them were commitments to:<p>
<UL>
<LI> maintain the right to maintain and enforce through trade              restrictions,
product standards and technical regulations            that are more stringent than
international standards. . .;<p>
<LI> maintain the right to impose trade restrictions pursuant to                U.S. health,
environmental, conservation, and endan-           gered species legislation and
international agreements;<p>
<p>
<LI> develop dispute resolution mechanisms that are sensitive              to
environmental
programs and values; and<p>
<p>
<LI> harmonize safety and environmental standards for motor                carrier,
hazardous
materials, and rail transportation.<A HREF="trade8.html#167"><sup>167</sup></A><p>

</UL>
<p>
     This process produced NAFTA&#146;s unprecedented environmental provisions,
widely seen as the model for &#147;greening&#148; future trade agreements.
They include:<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<i>The preamble</i>: This commits the countries to conduct trade in &#147;a
manner consistent with environmental protection and conservation&#148; and
calls on them to &#147;promote sustainable development&#148; and
&#147;strengthen the development and enforcement of environmental laws and
regulations.&#148;<p>
<p>
<i>Primacy of international environmental agreements</i>: The treaty affirms
that trade obligations in international agreements supersede NAFTA.  Such
treaties include: Montreal Protocol, CITES, the Basel Convention, and two
conventions on migratory birds and game mammals with Canada and Mexico.<p>
<p>
<i>Upward harmonization</i>: Two treaty chapters on sanitary and phytosanitary
measures and standards-related measures commit the three countries to harmonize
health, safety, and environmental regulations without reducing them.<p>
<p>
<i>Anti-deregulatory measures</i>: Countries renounce the relaxation of health,
safety, or environmental standards to encourage or retain investment.<p>
<p>
<i>International bureaucracy</i>: NAFTA creates a Committee on Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures to strengthen food safety regulations and agricultural
standards.  A Committee on Standards-Related Measures is created to enhance
safety, consumer, and environmental standards.  Numerous other bureaucracies
are formed.<p>

     The environmental lobby remained unsatisfied with these provisions, however.
Worried that environmentalists would oppose NAFTA, in early 1993 the new
Clinton administration commenced negotiations for additional environmental
commitments with Mexico and Canada.  Environmentalists outlined a detailed
proposal for an environmental side accord as a condition for their support of
NAFTA.  They demanded:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
1) the establishment of a North American environmental bureaucracy;<p>
<p>
2) a role for the bureaucracy in promoting compliance with environmental laws
and authorizing trade remedies for non-compliance;<p>
<p>
3) substantial funding for border environmental spending projects and
conservation programs;<p>
<p>
4) access to the government decisionmaking process through &#147;public
participation&#148; measures; and<p>
<p>
5) a means to clarify NAFTA&#146;s rules regarding upward harmonization of
process standards.<A HREF="trade8.html#168"><sup>168</sup></A><p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
     The supplemental environmental side accord of August 1993, negotiated by U.S.
trade representative Mickey Kantor, conforms broadly with the environmental
lobby&#146;s proposal.  The agreement establishes a new supra-national
bureaucracy, called the North American Commission on Environmental Cooperation,
to monitor environmental conditions, to promote compliance with environmental
laws and regulations, and to authorize trade sanctions for failure to enforce
environmental laws.<A HREF="trade8.html#169"><sup>169</sup></A>  The Commission is
comprised of a Council,
Secretariat, public advisory committees, and arbitral panels.  According to a
legal analysis commissioned by environmental organizations, the side
agreement&#146;s &#147;sanctions and penalty provisions are arguably stronger
than the penalty provisions proposed [by environmental
groups].&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#170"><sup>170</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The CEC&#146;s Council will develop recommendations for the upward
harmonization of regulations across the continent, &#147;without reducing
levels of environmental protection.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#171"><sup>171</sup></A>  The
agreement lists
several areas for consideration, including pollution prevention techniques,
endangered species protection, ecologically sensitive national accounts, and
eco-labelling.  The purpose of harmonization of rules and standards is to
prevent a country from gaining improper trade advantages through deregulation,
which is considered a kind of subsidy.<A HREF="trade8.html#172"><sup>172</sup></A>  The
CEC also provides for
a high degree of public participation and access to environmental
decisionmaking, features which will allow environmental groups to continue to
exert influence over trade and environmental policies in the region.  Citizen
petitions to the CEC, for example, can lead to formal dispute settlement.<p>
<p>
     The environmental agreement commits the countries to &#147;promote sustainable
development&#148; and to &#147;enhance compliance with, and enforcement of,
environmental laws and regulations.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#173"><sup>173</sup></A>  It further
provides that each
country &#147;shall ensure that its laws and regulations provide for high
levels of environmental protection and shall strive to continue to improve
those laws and regulations.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#174"><sup>174</sup></A>  To ensure
compliance with laws
and regulations, countries agree to utilize several enforcement measures:
on-site inspections, environmental audits, administrative orders, searches and
seizures, fines, imprisonments, and closure of facilities.<A
HREF="trade8.html#175"><sup>175</sup></A>   Alland regulations. 
Arbitral panels can levy fines on governments in the amount
of $20 million per infraction, or authorize the complaining party to impose
equivalent trade sanctions (maximum fine/sanction may rise with trade after the
first year).  Canada is exempt from trade sanctions, but must enforce rulings
in domestic courts.<A HREF="trade8.html#178"><sup>178</sup></A>  Fines are paid into an
environmental fund,
which the Commission may use to improve environmental enforcement.<p>
<p>
<u>The Formal Language:</u><p>


<p>
     Some environmentalists have discounted the extent of NAFTA&#146;s
environmental commitments.  Environmental groups such as the Sierra Club,
Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace viewed the NAFTA as insufficiently
&#147;green&#148; because of the cumbersome process of securing trade
sanctions.<A HREF="trade8.html#179"><sup>179</sup></A>  Similarly, the Cato Institute reads the
harmonization
features of the treaty to be totally meaningless: &#147;no reasonable reading
[of NAFTA&#146;s environmental provisions] can possibly lead one to conclude
that upward harmonization of environmental law is required by those parts of
the treaty.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#180"><sup>180</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Others see NAFTA as a major innovation in trade and environment policy.  Legal
advisors to the EPA write that the U.S., &#147;in its negotiation of a NAFTA,
committed not to weaken U.S. environmental and health laws or regulations [and]
to maintain enforcement...&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#181"><sup>181</sup></A>  Daniel
Magraw, EPA&#146;s
associate general counsel for international activities, points to the NAFTA
obligation that each country provide for high levels of environmental
protection, and improve environmental laws and regulations.  Magraw calls that
provision, Article 3 of the environmental side agreement, &#147;an
anti-rollback provision...intended to prevent a country from reducing its level
of [environmental] protection...&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#182"><sup>182</sup></A>  And
the U.S. trade
representative&#146;s office, in its &#147;Report on Environmental
Issues,&#148; explains how the treaty commits the three countries to
&#147;upward harmonization:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The NAFTA provisions on sanitary and phytosanitary measures were spec-ifically
negotiated to make clear that there would be no &#145;downward
harmonization&#146; of such measures...Article 713.1 explicitly states that [harmonization] is to be done &#145;<i>without</i>
reducing the level of protection of human, animal or plant life or
health&#146;....[Article 714.1 harmonizes the parties&#146; measures] in order
to minimize the differences between the three NAFTA countries&#146; sanitary
and phytosanitary measures...the text makes clear that these procedures must
not reduce the level of protection of human, animal or plant health or of the
environment. (Emphasis in original).<A HREF="trade8.html#183"><sup>183</sup></A><p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
     The NAFTA countries are obligated to engage in harmonization talks through
various tri-national committees, which will encourage the countries to make
their standards equivalent.  The most widely respected authorities on NAFTA,
Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott of the Washington DC-based Institute for
International Economics, describe this process as harmonization of NAFTA
standards &#147;at levels that are not lower than the highest minimum standards
within the NAFTA region.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#184"><sup>184</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     William H. Lash III, writing for the Center for the Study of American
Business, uses even stronger language: &#147;Under NAFTA, the United States,
Mexico, and Canada are expressly forbidden from lowering environmental
standards to attract investment.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#185"><sup>185</sup></A>  The
three countries
renounce the relaxation of environmental measures to attract or encourage
investment in NAFTA&#146;s investment chapter, and the side agreement&#146;s
dispute settlement provisions provide a mechanism to enforce that
commitment.<A HREF="trade8.html#186"><sup>186</sup></A>  Legally, a country may choose to
reduce its desired
level of environmental protection, but not for the purpose of encouraging
investment.  Determining a country&#146;s intent in relaxing its environmental
enforcement may become a controversial subject of future arbitral panels.<p>
<p>
     NAFTA&#146;s &#147;green&#148; provisions persuaded many environmentalists
that NAFTA would not reduce environmental protection in North America, but
might actually improve environmental regulatory enforcement.<A
HREF="trade8.html#187"><sup>187</sup></A>
EPA&#146;s Carol Browner claimed in congressional testimony that these NAFTA
provisions would lead to &#147;cooperation on region-wide environmental
planning, not just pollutant-by-pollutant controls.&#148;<A
HREF="trade8.html#188"><sup>188</sup></A>
Authorities in environmental law contend that NAFTA&#146;s provisions
&#147;should result in a major improvement in law enforcement. . . .these
provisions should ensure a sea change in how Mexico (and improvements in the
way the United States and Canada) develop, implement and enforce environmental
law.<A HREF="trade8.html#189"><sup>189</sup></A>&#148;  According to a Federal Reserve
Bank of Dallas study,
the NAFTA agreements &#147;open broader opportunities to protectionists to
reduce trade through appeals against environmental and workplace enforcement in
areas with little direct effect on the international exchange of goods and
services.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#190"><sup>190</sup></A><p>
<A HREF="trade8.html#"><sup></sup></A><p>
     NAFTA effects are expected to be visible more through international
cooperation than through confrontation.<A HREF="trade8.html#191"><sup>191</sup></A>  In the
future, the
effect of NAFTA will be the internationalization of environmental regulation.
According to Hufbauer and Schott, for example, the agreement has made possible
new cooperative environmental efforts such as an Air Pollution Control Zone
covering El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez.  A joint project of the EPA, State
Department, and a Mexican agency, the Control Zone would initially entail
monitoring activities and voluntary emissions control programs.  Once the
Control Zone is operational, it &#147;will have the power to establish and
enforce emission standards.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#192"><sup>192</sup></A><p>
<p>
     This is but one example of the far-reaching implications of NAFTA&#146;s
environmental provisions.  EPA&#146;s Magraw claims that NAFTA&#146;s
institutional innovations represent if not a redefinition of traditional
notions of sovereignty, at least a refinement of those notions and a
development of types of social organization that allow countries to exercise
and realize the legitimate aspects of sovereignty in a way that reflects the
growing environmental, economic, and political interdependence of the world.<p>

<u>The Experience to Date:</u><p>
<p>
     Many opponents of trade with Mexico strenuously objected to its lower social
and regulatory standards, and cited fears that U.S. standards would be
undermined by NAFTA.  &#147;We have in fact seen the opposite, that is, Mexico
is rising to the same standards we have in the United States,&#148; reports
Susan K. Ross, a Los Angeles international trade attorney.<A
HREF="trade8.html#193"><sup>193</sup></A>  In
the environmental arena, the treaty has been the impetus for greater regulation
and government intervention, particularly on the Mexican side of the border.<p>
<p>
     In preparation for NAFTA harmonization negotiations, Mexico&#146;s transport
ministry published 125 pages of new regulations in March 1994, classifying
hundreds of important industrial materials as officially &#147;hazardous.&#148;
These classifications used United Nations-approved standards as a baseline.
Other rules are being issued for vehicle emission standards, engine
manufacturing requirements, fuel standards, and food inspection
regulations.<A HREF="trade8.html#194"><sup>194</sup></A> Before the end of 1995, the three
NAFTA countries
will harmonize standards for weights and transport regulations.  The regulatory
upheaval will not be as burdensome to large corporations used to dealing with
red tape.  But for small and medium-sized firms &#147;unfamiliar with the
regulations. . .it&#146;s going to be a tough time,&#148; complains Carlos
Cantu, a Mexico City international sales manager.<A
HREF="trade8.html#195"><sup>195</sup></A>  Over time,
this could represent a barrier to competitive trade.<p>
<p>
     In June of 1994, Mexican commerce officials published new regulations
concerning food and beverage labelling and packaging, which will require
product information to be included on all imports.  They also proposed new
rules on product safety and consumer information labels.  U.S. exporters fear
the regulations will create further delays at the already burdensome Mexican
border.  &#147;What winds up happening is you&#146;re just giving another tool
to some guy at Customs to hold you up,&#148; one trade expert told the
<i>Journal of Commerce</i>.<A HREF="trade8.html#196"><sup>196</sup></A>  When
confronted with this trade
barrier for entrepreneurs, Mexican president Carlos Salinas was unsympathetic:
&#147;We have to protect the interest of Mexican consumers,&#148; he
said.<A HREF="trade8.html#197"><sup>197</sup></A><p>
<p>
     By the end of 1994, Mexico will have upgraded its food inspection regulations
to meet U.S. standards.  The changes are causing substantial delays at border
crossings, where as many as 1,000 trucks per day must pass.  According to
agricultural producers, the Mexican distribution system is so plagued by
inefficiency and delay that 35 percent of Mexico&#146;s perishable items are
destroyed by spoilage.<A HREF="trade8.html#198"><sup>198</sup></A>  Inspection procedures
are in dire need of
streamlining, as eight government agencies are currently responsible for
inspecting perishables at the border.<A HREF="trade8.html#199"><sup>199</sup></A>  Beginning
in late June
1994, Mexican officials began placing every truckload of U.S. beef into cold
storage in order to verify compliance with Spanish-language labelling
requirements and meat inspection laws.<A HREF="trade8.html#200"><sup>200</sup></A>  The
U.S. Meat Export
Federation protests that &#147;the Mexican cattlemen are trying to stifle
imports&#148; by using inspections as new trade barriers.  But Mexican
officials say the barriers are fully justified by NAFTA: &#147;Now we need to
put together normal measures for nations that do trade &#151; safety standards,
health standards.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#201"><sup>201</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Upward harmonization will be very costly for Mexican entrepreneurs, small
businesses, and consumers.  Harmonization of an assortment of vehicle emissions
standards, engine manufacturing requirements, and fuel standards will force
substantial investment by Mexican motor carriers and drive up their operational
costs close to U.S. levels.<A HREF="trade8.html#202"><sup>202</sup></A>  One California
official revealed
that Mexicans have no choice under NAFTA: &#147;They will have to change to
meet our requirements, or they will not be allowed in
California.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#203"><sup>203</sup></A>  Many U.S. trucking
companies and exporters
have falsely assumed that NAFTA would allow direct shipments to clients in
Mexico, only to find barriers at the border in the form of customs brokerage
fees, complex interliner arrangements, and onerous paperwork
requirements.<A HREF="trade8.html#204"><sup>204</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Higher environmental regulations in Mexico are starting to take their toll on
small businesses, which are being forced to invest more in environmental
compliance.  Demand for pollution control equipment stands at approximately
$1.5 billion in 1994, but is expected to double over the next few years because
of government restrictions.<A HREF="trade8.html#205"><sup>205</sup></A>  Mexico&#146;s
Confederation of
Industrial Chambers expects that NAFTA will force Mexican businesses to
increase their spending on pollution control equipment, and is calling for tax
relief to offset losses in corporate profits.<A HREF="trade8.html#206"><sup>206</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Harmonization is also to be a costly barrier to trade, with regulatory
barriers being erected to compensate for lower tariffs.  The Border Trade
Alliance, a coalition of free trade businesses along the U.S.-Mexico border,
reports that a variety of government-imposed customs fees are being used as
non-tariff barriers against traders, transport companies, and even individuals
crossing the border.  For example, when the U.S. imposed a $30 fee for
phytosanitary certificates, within thirty days Mexico had imposed a $32
phytosanitary fee.  According to the Alliance, some traders fear that NAFTA is
becoming a &#147;fee-trade agreement&#148; in which tariffs are being replaced
with fees that are having the cumulative effect of raising cross-border trading
costs to pre-NAFTA levels.<A HREF="trade8.html#207"><sup>207</sup></A>  A customs broker
in El Paso, Texas
laments that NAFTA is &#147;a managed trade agreement.  Or a preferred trade
agreement.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#208"><sup>208</sup></A><p>

<b>Global &#147;Free&#148; Trade: Greening the GATT</b><p>
<p>
<u>Historical development:</u><p>
<p>
     GATT was established in 1948 without any significant environmental provisions.
GATT&#146;s primary purpose was to expand trade by reducing tariffs and other
trade barriers.  GATT&#146;s general trade principles include
&#147;most-favored-nation,&#148; which provides that barriers to imported
products should be non-discriminatory (all GATT parties should enjoy equal trading privileges), and &#147;national
treatment,&#148; which requires equal treatment of imports and domestic
products in the application of non-tariff regulations.<p>
<p>
     Several significant features of GATT allow consideration of environmental
issues as they relate to trade.  According to the foremost authority on GATT,
University of Michigan Professor John Jackson, &#147;the GATT relatively easily
accommodates national government environmental regulations that concern the
characteristics of imported products.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#209"><sup>209</sup></A> 
However, an
exception to GATT&#146;s general trade principles is required for many
environmental measures that do not regulate product characteristics, but
instead regulate the process by which they are produced.<p>
<p>
<i>  Article XX:  </i>Defined in Article XX, environmental exceptions to GATT
principles, as qualified in a preamble,<A HREF="trade8.html#210"><sup>210</sup></A> provide
that:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which
would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between
countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on
international trade, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent
the adoption or enforcement by any contracting party of measures:<p>
<p>
. . .(b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;<p>
<p>
. . .(g) relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such
measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic
production or consumption. . .&#148;<p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

 <p>
     When these GATT clauses were written in 1947, they were not intended to cover
broad environmental protection issues at all.  The first was meant to exempt
quarantine and other sanitary regulations,<A HREF="trade8.html#211"><sup>211</sup></A> while
the second was
intended to cover efforts to conserve oil, minerals and other finite raw
materials.<A HREF="trade8.html#"><sup>212</sup></A>  As environmental issues have
become more politicized,
however, GATT has been forced to evolve.  The first consideration of an Article
XX exception came in 1982, when Canada disputed a U.S. ban on imports of tuna.
In that case, both parties agreed that tuna should be considered an
&#147;exhaustible natural resource.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#213"><sup>213</sup></A> 
GATT ruled against the
U.S. primarily because the trade measure was not taken in conjunction with
similar domestic restrictions.<p>
     GATT has come under mounting pressure to broaden its environmental exceptions.
For the most part, GATT has resisted this pressure, interpreting
environment-related exceptions very narrowly for fear that their abuse would
lead to disguised protectionism.<A HREF="trade8.html#214"><sup>214</sup></A>  Under
exception (b), dispute
settlement panels, notably in the first Tuna-Dolphin panel report, have
construed the word &#147;necessary&#148; to mean that the measure must be the
least-GATT-inconsistent measure available.<A HREF="trade8.html#215"><sup>215</sup></A> 
Panels have also
limited the exception to measures taken with regard
to resources within a party&#146;s own jurisdiction, reasoning that parties
should not impose trade barriers simply because other parties have differing
policies within their own jurisdiction.<A HREF="trade8.html#216"><sup>216</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Exception (g), in addition to impeding extra-jurisdictional environmental
measures, has been interpreted to require such measures to be &#147;primarily
aimed at&#148; conservation and to &#147;render effective&#148; complementary
domestic restrictions.<A HREF="trade8.html#217"><sup>217</sup></A>  Environmentalists
contend that such
narrow interpretations could virtually nullify the exceptions by hindering
trade measures taken under multilateral environmental agreements, and by
precluding use of unilateral measures aimed at environmental protection of the
&#147;global commons.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#218"><sup>218</sup></A>  Importantly,
they argue that
regulation of process and production methods are sometimes the only means to
protect global commons resources.<A HREF="trade8.html#219"><sup>219</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     In the second Tuna-Dolphin panel decision in 1994, however, GATT suggested
that greater latitude exists in applying Article XX to resources outside of
national jurisdiction.  This was a dispute over the U.S. secondary embargo of
tuna products from countries which import tuna from countries under the Marine
Mammal Protection Act&#146;s primary embargo.  According to the panel report:
&#147;the Panel could see no valid reason supporting the conclusion that the
provisions of Article XX (g) apply only to policies related to the conservation
of exhaustible natural resources located within the territory of the
contracting party invoking the provision.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#220"><sup>220</sup></A> 
This statement
appears to reverse the first Tuna-Dolphin ruling on
extra-jurisdictionality.<A HREF="trade8.html#221"><sup>221</sup></A>  One commentator calls
the panel
report&#146;s argument &#147;a brave stance for the panel since virtually all
of the trade policy community holds to the opposite
conclusion.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#222"><sup>222</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Shortly thereafter, GATT ruled on a European Union complaint regarding the
U.S. fuel efficiency standards under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy law,
which acted to restrict imports of European automobiles to the U.S.  The most
significant part of GATT&#146;s decision related to the fleet averaging
requirement of the law, which was found to be inconsistent with GATT&#146;s
general trade obligations.  The panel found that the fleet averaging
&#147;clearly served the purpose of fuel conservation, and served to render
effective the [domestic] conservation measure...,&#148; thus meeting the key
requirements of Article XX (g).<A HREF="trade8.html#223"><sup>223</sup></A>  The decision
marks the first
time GATT has ever ruled that an environmental measure was GATT-legal.<p>
<p>
<i>  Technical regulations and standards</i>:  The GATT Standards Code was
adopted at the 1979 Tokyo Round in order to minimize obstacles to trade
resulting from the imposition of technical regulations and product standards.  The Code
encourages use of international standards and scientific justification in order
to avoid conflicts.  Some environmentalists feared that this would lead to
downward harmonization, though little empirical evidence exists that this has
occurred.<A HREF="trade8.html#224"><sup>224</sup></A><p>
<u></u><p>

<u>Demands for Change &#151; Greening GATT:</u><p>
<u></u><p>
     GATT&#146;s unusual historical beginnings have prevented it from addressing
the emerging issue of multilateral environmental protection.  By design, GATT
is relatively non-binding and powerless, lacking an international organization,
a charter, or enforcement provisions.  Originally, GATT was intended to be an
interim arrangement pending ratification of the International Trade
Organization (ITO), through the Havana Charter.<A
HREF="trade8.html#225"><sup>225</sup></A>  GATT was
continued after the failure of the ITO to come into force in 1948, but GATT
itself was never ratified as a treaty.<A HREF="trade8.html#226"><sup>226</sup></A>  
Substantively, GATT was
limited to commercial policy subjects, and did not deal with most of the
ITO&#146;s other objectives such as full employment policies, economic
development, and raw materials.<A HREF="trade8.html#227"><sup>227</sup></A><p>
<p>
     These historical circumstances bequeathed various institutional weaknesses
which have inhibited GATT from accruing excessive regulatory powers over
 world trade.  GATT&#146;s rigid voting procedures make it extremely difficult
to amend.  Formal amendments require unanimous consent of the parties, or in
some circumstances, a two-thirds majority.  Since amendments must be ratified
by over one hundred parties, consensus for broad expansion of GATT powers has
always been elusive.<A HREF="trade8.html#228"><sup>228</sup></A>  According to Jackson,
&#147;during the
history of GATT, it appears that there has never been a Contracting Party vote
that imposed a new obligation on GATT Contracting Parties.&#148;<A
HREF="trade8.html#229"><sup>229</sup></A>
Instead of revision through amendment, GATT has been progressively strengthened
by several protracted negotiating rounds which required ratification by
participating nations, but these rounds have not introduced dramatic changes
with regard to environmental policies.<A HREF="trade8.html#230"><sup>230</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The exercise of GATT&#146;s powers are also limited by its cumbersome dispute
settlement procedures.  GATT&#146;s ability to enforce its rulings against
losing parties has been curtailed by the single-nation veto, which enables any
country to block panel decisions, including the defendant.<A
HREF="trade8.html#231"><sup>231</sup></A>  Thus,
the remedy for violation of GATT provisions, trade sanctions, is almost never
authorized.  Since arbitration procedures are confidential, they have been
relatively immune to environmental special interest pleadings and influence.<p>
<p>
     GATT&#146;s convoluted institutional rules have prevented it from succumbing
to significant environmental policy entanglements.  Because the GATT is
inhospitable to rapid revision, environmentalists have bemoaned the
time-consuming process of creative interpretation that would be required in
order to reverse unfavorable dispute settlement panel precedents.<A

For environmental activists experienced in
&#147;public interest&#148; advocacy, only a comprehensive overhaul of
defective GATT trade rules can accomplish their objective.<A
HREF="trade8.html#233"><sup>233</sup></A><p>
<p>
     According to the World Wildlife Fund&#146;s Von Moltke, a sufficiently rapid
greening of trade can take place only under &#147;a formal treaty establishing
an international organization with authority to act within its charter to
identify emerging issues and bring them to negotiation in a timely manner
without requiring consensus on all details.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#234"><sup>234</sup></A>  For GATT to
embrace a new
environmental agenda, its legal authority over world trading policies would
have to be restored to the level intended for the ITO in the Havana
Charter.<A HREF="trade8.html#235"><sup>235</sup></A><p>
<p>
     A new institution with greater legal authority, the World Trade Organization
(WTO), was proposed during the latest Uruguay Round of
negotiations.<A HREF="trade8.html#236"><sup>236</sup></A>  The WTO accord was signed by
approximately 120
countries on April 15, 1994.  Peter
Suchman, a former Treasury Department trade official under three presidents,
explains that U.S. acceptance of the WTO had little to do with free trade:<p>

The Uruguay Round final provisions on dispute settlement and the WTO represent
a major victory for U.S. negotiators, who had rejected the WTO concept as
proposed early in the Round by Canada and the EC.  The U.S. held out on the WTO
as a means to ensure that its own trade laws, including section 301, would not
be unreasonably limited.  And it worked!<A HREF="trade8.html#237"><sup>237</sup></A><p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
     Jackson describes the WTO charter as &#147;a fairly radical new technique for
changing the GATT,&#148; that would &#147;provide, for the first time, a
definitive legal treaty text to establish the organization, and put it on a
sounder footing for future evolution.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#238"><sup>238</sup></A> 
Although it is
unclear precisely how the new WTO will incorporate environmental standards into
world trading rules, the drafting history of the ITO suggests that the
WTO&#146;s earlier incarnation would have done so.<A
HREF="trade8.html#239"><sup>239</sup></A>  On strictly
environmental grounds, developing countries might not have considered a WTO to
be in their best interests.  However, they assented to the proposal in the
hopes that it would lead to enhanced access to global markets.<p>
<p>
<u>The WTO and Formal Environmental Language:</u><p>
<p>
     According to a report by the U.S. Trade Representative, the United States
considered several key environment-related provisions of early Uruguay Round
drafts to be inadequate, and began to seek substantial revisions in late 1992.
Almost entirely due to efforts by the Clinton administration, the final text of
the Uruguay Round accord incorporated several new environmental features.<p>
<p>
<i>  The preamble</i>: Early drafts made vague reference to the &#147;optimal
use of resources of the word at sustainable levels.&#148;<A
HREF="trade8.html#240"><sup>240</sup></A>  The
U.S. modified this provision in the final text, which now calls for &#147;the
optimal use of the world&#146;s resources in accordance with the objective of
sustainable development, seeking both to protect and preserve the environment
and enhance the means for doing so...&#148;<A
HREF="trade8.html#241"><sup>241</sup></A><p>
<p>
<i>  Standards Harmonization</i>:  The Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary
Measures applies to a wide range of public health measures such as food safety
and pesticide standards, meat inspection rules, and quarantine procedures.  Early
drafts would have required all public health measures to be the &#147;least
restrictive to trade&#148; of available alternatives.<A HREF="trade8.html#242"><sup>242</sup></A>  Countries would be
required to base
their standards on international standards, with higher standards allowed only
with &#147;scientific justification.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#243"><sup>243</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The U.S. feared that it would not be able to maintain standards higher than
international standards (i.e., downward harmonization), and that U.S. measures
might not withstand scientific scrutiny.  The Clinton administration
successfully changed this provision, requiring only that food safety measures
are &#147;not more trade restrictive than required to achieve their appropriate
level of protection, taking into account technical an economic
feasibility.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#244"><sup>244</sup></A>  A footnote elaborates that a
health measure
will not be considered more trade restrictive than required unless there is
another measure significantly less restrictive to trade.  However, the
requirements for the alternative measure are very rigorous.  It must 1) achieve
the level of protection demanded by the importing country; 2) be considered
&#147;reasonably available&#148;; 3) be technically and economically feasible;
and 4) be significantly less restrictive of trade.<A HREF="trade8.html#245"><sup>245</sup></A> 
As the U.S.
Trade Representative explains, the first requirement alone would preclude
virtually any alternative measures that are &#147;demonstrably less effective
in protecting public health (for instance, warning labels are less effective
than product bans, and voluntary labelling is less effective than mandatory
labelling).&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#246"><sup>246</sup></A><p>
<p>
     As with earlier drafts, the final agreement requires nations to harmonize
their food safety and sanitary standards, basing them on international
standards set by international bureaucracies such as the Codex Alimentarius
Commission, a U.N. body.<A HREF="trade8.html#247"><sup>247</sup></A>  Due to U.S. efforts,
a provision
specifically enables countries to &#147;introduce or maintain sanitary and
phytosanitary measures which result in a higher level&#148; of protection than
international standards, provided there is scientific
justification.<A HREF="trade8.html#248"><sup>248</sup></A>  The U.S. insisted that only a
government itself
could determine scientific justification, not dispute settlement
panels.<A HREF="trade8.html#249"><sup>249</sup></A>  No specific provision is made at all for
measures to be
lower than international standards.  To monitor the harmonization process, this
agreement creates a Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary
Measures.<A HREF="trade8.html#250"><sup>250</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The requirement that no measure should be maintained without &#147;scientific
evidence&#148; was also changed, now simply barring measures maintained without
&#147;sufficient scientific evidence.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#251"><sup>251</sup></A> 
The final standards
provisions are so flexible, even the scientifically flawed Delaney Clause,
which sets a zero-risk level for food additives, could not be judged a barrier
to trade.<A HREF="trade8.html#252"><sup>252</sup></A>  The reason: The WTO gives sole
discretion to determine
the appropriate level of protection or health risk to central government
authorities, with little regard for the consequences of such decisions for
trade.<A HREF="trade8.html#253"><sup>253</sup></A>  As the U.S. Trade Representative boasts:
&#147;the mere
fact that a food safety measure may have a disproportionate effect on imports
is not sufficient to qualify it as a disguised restriction on
trade.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#254"><sup>254</sup></A><p>
<p>
<i>  Harmonization of Technical Barriers:</i>  The Agreement on Technical
Barriers to Trade applies to environmental, health, and safety standards, as
well as technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures.  The
agreement calls on
countries to harmonize technical regulations by participating in standardizing
bodies such as the International Standards Organization (ISO).  A Committee on
Technical Barriers to Trade is formed to monitor the harmonization process and
to guard against &#147;downward harmonization.<A
HREF="trade8.html#255"><sup>255</sup></A> The U.S. objected
to early draft provisions which suggested that environmental measures should be
&#147;proportionate&#148; to the risk, and had the provision
deleted.<A HREF="trade8.html#256"><sup>256</sup></A><p>
<p>
     One draft provision barred environmental measures if alternate measures could
accomplish the same objective in a less trade restrictive manner.<A
HREF="trade8.html#257"><sup>257</sup></A>
Fearing this would prevent countries from enforcing stringent environmental standards, the
U.S. pushed to modify the requirement such that environmental measures merely
must not be &#147;more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate
objective.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#258"><sup>258</sup></A>  A legitimate objective is
defined as &#147;. .
.the protection of human health or safety, animal or plant life or health, or
the environment.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#259"><sup>259</sup></A>  This provision makes
clear that any
alternate measures less restrictive to trade would have to fulfill a central
government&#146;s own determination of its &#147;appropriate&#148; level of
protection in satisfying a legitimate objective.<A
HREF="trade8.html#260"><sup>260</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The agreement&#146;s technical standards language prevents standards from
being applied &#147;with the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to
trade.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#261"><sup>261</sup></A>  However, this hopeful language
is mitigated by the
agreement&#146;s definition of a technical regulation, which is one that lays
down product characteristics.  According to trade expert Kenneth Berlin of the
law firm of Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam and Roberts, since the only regulations
covered by the agreement are those that affect product characteristics,
&#147;environmental laws like the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and
regulations promulgated thereunder are not subject to review under the TBT
agreement.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#262"><sup>262</sup></A>  Likewise, the
agreement&#146;s provisions
&#147;do not permit a nation to argue that a market-based incentive is less
trade restrictive than a command and control regulation.&#148;<A
HREF="trade8.html#263"><sup>263</sup></A>
Moreover, the agreement does not require a nation to give any scientific
justification for technical regulations.<p>
<p>
<i>  Dispute Settlement</i>:  The Dispute Settlement Agreement broadens the GATT
language so that arbitration panels will be able to seek scientific and
technical advice from any individual or organization.  Each nation that is
party to a trade dispute must make summaries of its dispute-panel submissions
publicly available.<A HREF="trade8.html#264"><sup>264</sup></A>  In cases involving
environmental issues,
panels may consult with expert review groups regarding relevant scientific and
technical issues, meaning that it is possible for environmental matters to have
greater impact on panel decisions.  These public- participation\transparency
provisions are unprecedented in GATT, and can be used by industry,
environmental, and other special interest groups to influence the WTO.<p>
<p>
     Strict time limits are set for dispute settlement panels to adjudicate
complaints.  The WTO permits cross-retaliation, meaning that countries have
expanded rights 
to impose punitive trade sanctions as a way of enforcing WTO rulings.  These
features will give the WTO more binding authority than GATT.<p>
<p>
<i>  Subsidies</i>:  Government assistance to private businesses is given a
&#147;green light&#148; under the Subsidies Code.  Twenty percent of the cost
of adaptation to environmental regulatory requirements may be subsidized
without the threat of challenge under the WTO.<A HREF="trade8.html#265"><sup>265</sup></A>  
An exemption is
also available for subsidies which are part of a government&#146;s policies
focusing on research and development, and regional assistance.  Assistance for
up to 75 percent of industrial research costs, and 50 percent of development
costs are specifically permitted.<A HREF="trade8.html#266"><sup>266</sup></A>  In the U.S., this
provision
could effect subsidies for environmental technology under the green industrial
policy being promoted by the Clinton-Gore administration.<A

<B>The Greening of Trade Policy: "Sustainable Development" and Global Trade</B><BR>

<P><P>
<u>Future changes?</u><p>
<p>
     The environmental movement is far from satisfied with current progress in
greening the GATT.  Yet by threatening to sidetrack trade agreements in the
U.S. Congress, it has had a significant impact on environmental provisions in
GATT.  According to a business advisory report to the U.S. Trade
Representative, &#147;U.S. negotiators worked to obtain limited changes now,
while leaving more comprehensive [environmental] reforms to post-Uruguay Round
negotiations.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#268"><sup>268</sup></A><p>
<p>
     At the conclusion of the Uruguay Round on December 15, 1993, trade negotiators
agreed to a Decision on Trade and Environment and designed a work program for
modifying GATT.  Among the objectives of this program was &#147;the adherence
to effective multilateral disciplines to ensure the responsiveness of the
Multilateral Trading System to environmental objectives, including principle 12
of the Rio Declaration.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#269"><sup>269</sup></A><p>
<p>
     An outgrowth of the Decision was the creation of a Committee on Trade and the
Environment (CTE), which will recommend modifications to WTO rules.  The
Committee will consider economic instruments, pollution charges and
environmental taxes, recycling regulations, processes and production methods,
packaging and labelling requirements, and public participation rights.  It may
review any trade-related issue, including &#147;eco-dumping,&#148; carbon
taxes, levies on fossil fuels, and transportation restrictions.<A
HREF="trade8.html#270"><sup>270</sup></A>
Within the CTE, the Clinton administration intends to press the WTO to broaden
its environmental provisions by clarifying &#147;the circumstances under which
GATT rules permit countries to use trade measures to protect the
environment&#148; and also by clarifying &#147;the scope of the exceptions for
environmental measures.<A HREF="trade8.html#271"><sup>271</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Stronger environmental provisions could be established in several ways.
Member countries could vote to 1) waive WTO trade obligations under certain
conditions; 2) adopt authoritative interpretations of WTO obligations and
exceptions; or 3) amend WTO agreements and dispute settlement
rules.<A HREF="trade8.html#272"><sup>272</sup></A>  If the CTE determines that incremental
environmental
reforms of the WTO would be insufficient, it could recommend an entirely new
environmental charter for world trade.<p>
<p>
     The first item in the CTE&#146;s list of priorities is the legal relationship
between multilateral environmental agreements and the WTO.<A
HREF="trade8.html#273"><sup>273</sup></A>  This
relationship is critically important, since it could effectively create new
exceptions to general trade principles, and open the door further to green
protectionism.  Jackson suggests that multilateral treaties (and their process
and production regulations) could be made WTO-consistent very easily by
adopting a waiver of general trade obligations.  The current number of GATT
countries which have signed the Montreal Protocol would be a sufficient number
to sustain a vote for such a waiver.<A HREF="trade8.html#274"><sup>274</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Once exceptions are made for multilateral agreements, the WTO would be able to
consider exempting certain unilateral trade measures as well.  Once the
principle is established that the global commons are in need of protection via trade
policies, inevitably there will arise certain environmental problems that
multilateral agreements do not remedy.  The U.S. argues that there should be
international consensus for using unilateral trade measures as a valid means of
forcing &#147;rogue&#148; countries to sign multilateral environmental
agreements.<A HREF="trade8.html#275"><sup>275</sup></A>  In effect, the U.S. proposal would
obfuscate the
distinction between unilateral and multilateral trade measures, thereby
legitimizing a host of U.S. environmental laws within the WTO, including the
Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Pelly Amendment.<A
HREF="trade8.html#276"><sup>276</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     WTO provisions on technical regulations and environmental product standards
could have profound effects on world trade.  The most recent set of standards
being developed by the International Standards Organization, the ISO 14000
series, and are scheduled to be implemented in early 1996.<A
HREF="trade8.html#277"><sup>277</sup></A>
Previously, the ISO merely set obscure technical and safety standards.  The ISO
14000 will now set standards for international environmental management
systems, auditing, performance evaluations, eco-labelling and life-cycle
analysis.<A HREF="trade8.html#278"><sup>278</sup></A>  Such standards are used in enforcing
government
regulations and international agreements, and could impose hefty costs on
exporters who must obtain ISO certification for their products to enter
international commerce.  Consequently, the WTO could result in an entirely new
layer of bureaucratic rules and regulations, non-tariff barriers whose costs
will be passed along to consumers.<p>
<p>
     If the WTO is to integrate broader pollution and conservation standards into
world trade, it must also resolve the problem of harmonizing such standards
among many countries at varying stages of economic development.  Many experts
have proposed global minimum environmental standards as a pre-condition for
access
to global markets.  Such standards would include general environmental
objectives and principles, protocols on minimum standards for pollution emissions, and
financing mechanisms.<A HREF="trade8.html#279"><sup>279</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Since the GATT/WTO has little experience in determining appropriate
environmental standards, some cooperation with relevant U.N. institutions such
as the Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Commission on Sustainable Development
(UNCSD) would be required.<A HREF="trade8.html#280"><sup>280</sup></A>  The U.N.
Commission on Global
Governance, the successor to the 1987 World Commission on Environment and
Development, is in the process of designing a comprehensive reform of
international institutions in the U.N. system and the GATT for this purpose.
Among its goals are &#147;multilateral free trade,&#148; &#147;sustainable
development on a global basis,&#148; and solutions to &#147;grave environmental
problems beyond national remedy. . .&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#281"><sup>281</sup></A> 
Greater cooperation
between existing multilateral institutions would likely be more practical than
consolidating their functions in a single body.<A
HREF="trade8.html#282"><sup>282</sup></A><p>
<p>
     According to Jackson, WTO-consistent rules to enforce minimum environmental
standards would ensure increasingly stringent standards.  International
cooperation on minimum standards would discourage deregulatory competition, and
thus reinforce the interplay between environmental lobbyists and government.
Jackson describes how this process would work in the trading system:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
In many cases, domestic leaders find it politically difficult to implement a
preferred course of action unless there is some external pressure that help
them in their domestic advocacy, and also in some cases gives them an
&#145;excuse&#146; for taking that action.<A HREF="trade8.html#283"><sup>283</sup></A><p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
     Integration of environmental and trade policies cannot proceed without the
involvement of non-governmental organizations in the process.  Future change in
the WTO hinges on the degree of public participation in and transparency of the
organizations procedures.  Environmental interest groups have demanded access
to the WTO dispute settlement body, the Committee on Trade and Environment, and
all other aspects of WTO decisionmaking.  Environmental lobbyists describe the
goal of greater transparency as a &#147;battle cry&#148; for participation in
&#147;the formation, negotiation, and implementation of trade policies and
accords.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#284"><sup>284</sup></A>  Jackson illuminates the
motivation of
environmental lobbyists:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
. . .the environmental policy groups, perhaps partly because they primarily
operate on the national scene, have become used to using the processes of
publicity and lobbying pressure on Congress or Parliaments, to which they have
considerable access.  There is, thus, a much broader sense of
&#145;participation&#146; in the processes, which the international processes
have not yet accommodated.  Furthermore, the environmental policy groups...have
a sense of power achieved through successes in the legislative and public
discussion processes.<A HREF="trade8.html#285"><sup>285</sup></A><p>

<H2>Implications of the Greening of Trade</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>The merging of trade with environmental policies can only produce increased
protectionism, regulation and bureaucratic interference in international
commerce.  The historical development of environmental restrictions in the U.S.
offers an appropriate analogy.  For more than a century, environmental regulation was
strictly limited by the American system of federalism.  The Constitution&#146;s
decentralized structure placed wildlife under the exclusive jurisdiction of the
states, notwithstanding the federal government&#146;s superior authority under
the interstate commerce clause.  During the nineteenth century, the Supreme Court ruled that
national environmental regulations were precluded by this exclusive state
jurisdiction.<A HREF="trade8.html#286"><sup>286</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The roots of the federal government&#146;s centralization of power can be
found in an international agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom,
the 1916 Migratory Bird Treaty.  The Supreme Court, in <i>Missouri v.
Holland</i>, used that treaty to establish federal jurisdiction in regulating
the hunting of wild birds.  Later 
Court decisions built upon this decision&#146;s implication that relying on
states for conservation policies was inadequate,<A HREF="trade8.html#287"><sup>287</sup></A>
establishing
federal control over wildlife in interstate commerce.<A
HREF="trade8.html#288"><sup>288</sup></A>  Over time,
these trends permitted a virtually unlimited consolidation of federal power
over environmental matters through a gradual &#147;process of
accretion.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#289"><sup>289</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Federal consolidation would soon contradict the original purpose of the
interstate commerce clause: to free commerce from &#147;stifling
regulation,&#148; according to constitutional scholar Laurence
Tribe.<A HREF="trade8.html#290"><sup>290</sup></A>  The federal commerce power was
intended to create a
&#147;regulatory vacuum&#148; in which competing economic factions would
produce minimal regulation of private commerce by Congress.<A
HREF="trade8.html#291"><sup>291</sup></A>
Indeed, as long as Congress refrained from enacting strict national standards
during the 1940s, &#146;50s and &#146;60s, &#147;states sold themselves as
attractive sites for new industrial facilities at least in part because they
offered low costs, including lax pollution control requirements,&#148; writes
former EPA official Daniel C. Esty.<A HREF="trade8.html#292"><sup>292</sup></A><p>
<p>
     By the 1970s, however, centralized federal power produced a vast system of
heavily bureaucratized national laws and regulations which stifled competition
amongst the states for new investment and jobs.  Like federal wildlife
regulations earlier this century, comprehensive environmental laws were
installed to prevent states from engaging in an inevitable &#147;race to the
bottom&#148; of environmental destructiveness.<A
HREF="trade8.html#293"><sup>293</sup></A>  Major pieces of
restrictive national legislation, such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water
Act, &#147;might otherwise have been impossible to achieve or enforce if
individual states were free to maintain lower standards,&#148; writes
Esty.<A HREF="trade8.html#294"><sup>294</sup></A>  Today, &#147;[T]he entire body of
environmental law and
regulation in the United States rests solely on the authority of the federal
government to regulate interstate commerce (an exception to the general rule
that powers not specifically ceded to the federal government are reserved to
the states).&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#295"><sup>295</sup></A><p>
<p>
     As the American system of federalism has evolved, the states have retained
limited authority to enforce environmental standards, provided they exceed
national standards, though even this auhority is preempted in some cases.  The
primary limit on the stringency of state standards is central government
oversight to ensure that such standards do not obstruct free trade amongst
states, functioning much as the NAFTA and GATT/WTO bureaucracies do
internationally.  In balancing trade and environmental considerations, U.S.
courts have grappled with many of the same issues surrounding the
interpretation of GATT&#146;s Article XX.  In fact, Esty advances U.S. commerce
clause jurisprudence as &#147;a valuable starting point for analyzing how
environmental considerations might be woven into the fabric of the
GATT.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#296"><sup>296</sup></A><p>
<p>
     What this analysis fails to take into account, however, is that centralization
in the U.S. has facilitated the creation of cartels &#151; large-sized business
groupings protected against competition from efficient new entrants.  According
to University of Chicago economist B. Peter Pashigian, &#147;Environmental
rules have not only reduced the number of plants in the affected industries but
have made it more difficult for small plants to compete with
large.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#297"><sup>297</sup></A>  Cartelization on a global scale
would benefit
neither trade nor environmental objectives.<p>
<p>
     On a global level, there is no Constitution or Supreme Court to interpret
international environmental law apart from the GATT/WTO.  International
environmental agreements are implemented only to the extent that individual
governments agree to enforce them.  Economic enforcement of international
environmental standards through trade measures has traditionally been minimal,
in large part due to the free-market orientation of GATT and other trade
agreements.  GATT in particular has provided a free-market safety valve,
allowing countries to escape the more onerous environmental commitments.  The
merging of environmental standards into trade agreements like NAFTA and WTO is
an attempt to close off that safety valve and to allow for enforcement of international
environmental laws through trade policy.  This can only result in more
stringent regulation of world trade; indeed, the evolution of GATT&#146;s trade
and environment jurisprudence is already beginning to resemble the U.S. federal
government&#146;s.<p>
<p>
     To the extent that the greening of trade rules makes international
environmental law more enforceable, it shifts responsibility away from nations,
sub-national units (states), and individuals, creating an even greater distance
between individuals and their governments.<A HREF="trade8.html#298"><sup>298</sup></A> 
Green-trade advocates
seem to view the loss of accountability to international bureaucracies (such as
the WTO) as necessary.  Esty, for example, argues that the global character of
all environmental problems implies that natural resources can only be protected
&#147;by surrendering a bit of national sovereignty and by participating in an
international regime.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#299"><sup>299</sup></A><p>
<p>
     In the U.S., environmental trade rules could be used by the federal government
to justify further unfunded mandates on the states, greater infringements on
private property rights, and higher trade barriers.  However, political
centralization of trade and environmental policies will have its most serious
effects in the Third World.  International environmental agreements attempt to
dictate the resource management policies of poorer countries.  Moreover, by
restricting development, international environmental regulations work to
perpetuate Third World poverty.  Such political domination through intrusive
environmental controls is resented by developing countries as
eco-imperialistic.<A HREF="trade8.html#300"><sup>300</sup></A>  Since all the major players
&#151; big
business and environmental lobbyists, the U.S. government, participants in the
WTO Committee on Trade and the Environment &#151; appear to accept the need to
incorporate environmental standards into world trade, the future of free trade
is in doubt.  In the end, competitive trade may depend on greater Third World
resistance to the environmental strictures being imposed on the world&#146;s
poor through trade agreements like the WTO, NAFTA, the Basel Convention, and
others.<p>

point of view since the overall population is rising 2 to 6 percent.  Moreover,
if significant numbers of tuna are caught before they spawn, dolphin protection
measures could actually reduce the tuna population by 30 to 60 percent.<p>

<A NAME="156"></A><sup>156</sup> See GATT Secretariat, pp. 30-31. The GATT
Secretariat generally
discourages environmental trade measures as discriminatory trade barriers.  Yet
it maintains that trade measures are acceptable for preventing the undermining
of a multilateral agreement, or to broaden participation in an agreement.  GATT
also endorses foreign aid incentives to developing countries.<p>
<A NAME="157"></A><sup>157</sup> Repetto, pp. 8-9.  Such exceptions to free trade in
GATT were
explicitly rejected during trade negotiations in 1946, when the U.S. attempted
to insert international agreements into the charter of the proposed
International trade Organization, but was rebuffed by Brazil.<p>

Signifying Little,&#148;  <i>Policy Analysis </i>198, Cato Institute , November
17, 1993, p.8.  This paper contends that because each country retains the right
to set its own level of environmental protection, it cannot be forced to abide
by NAFTA&#146;s environmental provisions.  &#147;It has often been alleged that
various provisions of NAFTA require the upward harmonization of environmental
standards while preventing such standards from ever being relaxed...such
conclusions are unfounded and without merit.&#148;  Also, &#147;the various
clauses providing for obligations and commitments of treaty signatories are
literally toothless and of little consequence.&#148;<p>

<A NAME="187"></A><sup>187</sup> Charnovitz has expressed concern that the upward

stipulates that a country shall ensure that its standards are &#147;applied
only to the extent necessary to achieve its appropriate level of
protection...&#148; (<i>Environmental Law Reporter</i> p.10071).  However, the
U.S. trade representative&#146;s office clarifies that this article addresses
&#147;how a health law or regulation is <i>applied</i>&#148;  but  that it
&#147;does not address the validity of the underlying health law or regulation,
or the level of protection afforded by those laws.&#148;  See &#147;The NAFTA:

Because the U.S. business community was reluctant to put trade under the
control of a bureaucracy, GATT exists only by virtue of the 1947 Protocol of
Provisional Application, proclaimed by the president without formal
ratification by the Senate.  The Protocol lacks the binding authority of a
treaty; even its name implies a more tenuous legal standing.  See pp. 28-29.<p>

GATT Article XX, signed in October 1947, is identical to Article 45 of the

differences.  When the U.N. Conference on Trade and Employment completed the
ITO Charter, in March 1948, Article 45, a(x) was added, which exempts measures

months service for our business Web Page. Compare this to Internet service providers charging up to $5000 in design and set-up fees, and $50 per month storage. Our Web Page design is a low-cost turn-key method for small businesses to utilize Internet services --- and Internet advantages.

Any Internet service can post your business's Home Page, but CommunityNetwork
directs potentially interested Internet and World Wide Web traffic to your
Business Home Page(s).  CommunityNetwork will hook your Page(s) to the most
popular Internet searches, and seek out other related Information Home Pages
where your potential customers may be browsing.

Here at Community Network, we are always thinking of ways to take advantage of new technologies and develop sites which will let our customers (and visitors to our sites!)  enjoy the maximum capabilities of the internet.  For example, we have big plans for "Shockwave," which will enable visitors to not only view features of your home page through scanned-in photos or professional graphics, but to hear them as well.  Show potential customers the view of the ocean from your motel room, and enhance it with a sound byte of the waves on the shore! Entice customers to your Victorian B&B with a byte of the Brandenburg Concertos.  The possibilities are endless!

<IMG SRC="gifs/yorkdropcap.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>he town of York is a beautiful southern Maine town that has managed to retain its historic heritage better than most.  York is actually a sprawling area of 66 square miles within which there are four distinct communities: York Village  (often referred to as "Old York"), York Beach, York Harbor, and Cape Neddick.   Within these four communities a visitor can see not only some of the most spectacular views and beaches on the Maine coast, but some of the most well-preserved and authentic historic buildings and sites.  Get a preview of some of those sites right here!<BR>

We are glad to welcome you to the York Web Information Center.  By browsing our York Web Site you will get a taste of the local area, its accomodations and restaurants, and the many outdoor activities available to its visitors - whatever the season.<BR>
If you choose to visit York this summer, please let us know if Community Network's sites were helpful.  Enjoy!

<H3>Kennebunkport - The Salt of the Sea </H3>
Kennebunkport has been bustling with commerce since the 1800's, when many ships were built and sent to sea from its harbor.  Historically, Kennebunkport has been very important in the shipping industry of Maine. Folks settling this area were bound to the sea, and even today the seafaring culture is still much in evidence.  <P> Kennebunkport is a beautiful coastal town that has much to offer. Please browse our page and visit the various topics that may be of interest. Our sponsors encourage you to call ahead and plan your vacation.

<TD ALIGN=LEFT>To insure our guest's privacy, we only rent out 1 of the rooms, unless there are two couples traveling together.<P>
Each room opens onto a large (8' by 35') covered lanai that 
has tables, chairs and a BBQ, and a view of Haleakala 
Mountain. One room is 14' by 17' with a mountain and ocean 
view; the other is slightly smaller with a mountain view only.
The rate for the room is $55 per night single or double, with 
a large closet, dresser, and queen bed. If you need the second 
room, add $35 per night. Everything is new and very clean. 
This is in a private wing of our very large home, so we keep 
it very nice, and you have your own private entrance.If you 
have been to Maui before, you will be familiar with the areas 
of Maui; we are in the community of Haiku, which is on the 
North side of the island. Very green and tropical due to lots 
of rainfall, thankfully mostly at night. We are in the country, 
rural and very quiet. Not a resort setting. You are bout 3 
minutes away from the nearest small grocery store, 6 
minutes from excellent restaurants in the town of Makawao, 
15 minutes from Ho'okipa, and 25 minutes from Kanaha.

<H3>Ogunquit's Artistic place in Maine </H3>
Ogunquit has lured artists since 1888. In 1888 Charles Woodbury stubled
upon a quaint cove named <A HREF="http://www.communitynetwork.com/ogunquit/pcove.html">&quot;Perkins
Cove&quot;</A>. Charles stumbled upon the &quot;Cove&quot; when it was only
a fisherman's small inlet. He dubbed it the artists paradise and by the
end of the century <A HREF="http://www.communitynetwork.com/ogunquit/pcove.html">Perkins Cove</A> had become a well established art colony.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout the 20th century the reputation continued and the &quot;Cove&quot;
prospered from the artists coming to see the beautiful Maine rocky coast.
Many of America's famous artists visited or even summered in Ogunquit. Some
to name a few are: Hamilton Easter Field, Henry Strater, Pegy Bacon, and
the famous Walt Kuhn.</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD > <IMG SRC="salty.gif"
WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="217" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom></TD> <TD >In
1952 Henry slater founded the Ogunquit Museum of American Art just above
another inlet called Narrow Cove. The Museum has been nicknamed &quot;the
most beautiful small museum in the world&quot;. The indoor exhibits vary
as artists show thier works during different exhibits. Many show reflections
of emotions that are inspired by the beauty of the local Ogunquit scenery.
From the cliffs above Narrow Cove, just steps from the entrance of the museum,
one can view the outdoor exhibits of past and present artisits.<BR>
</TD> </TR> </TABLE> <BR>
In 1928 Charles Woodbury and Henry Slater founded the Ogunquit Art Association
with other artists. The association holds auctions and run colorful galleries
to show the work of the local artists.<BR>
<BR>
Additionally Ogunquit has many private galleries in addition to the above
mentioned gallery. Please feel free to visit one and/or all. Here are just
a few art galleries in <A HREF="http://www.communitynetwork.com/ogunquit/ogunquit.html">Ogunquit</A>. 
<UL>
<LI>Scully Gallery 
<LI>Shore Road Gallery 
<LI>June Weare Gallery 
<LI>Hearthstone Gallery 
</UL>
Ogunquit has also been blessed with some great performing arts as well.
During summer visits Walter Hatwig thought that the area was ideal for a
permenant playhouse. In 1933 the Ogunquit playhouse was established (now
known as the Ogunquit Square Movie Theatre).<BR>
<BR>
The playhouse was so successful it outgrew it's small location and in 1937
the new Ogunquit playhouse was opened. The Ogunquit playhouse was so successful
many top rated stars preformed in the playhouse. Frolicing in the surf during
the day and acting during the evening.<BR>
<BR>
In 1950 John Lane came to town as an actor and when Walter Hartwig's wife
Maude retired purchased the playhouse. To this day the Ogunquit playhouse
is still known as &quot;John Lane's Ogunquit Playhouse&quot;.<BR>

<H1>Welcome to the Marginal Way</H1>
<HR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="winterway.gif" align=center><BR> Little Beach Marginal Way <P>
The Marginal Way (an old Indian 
trail) takes you along the rocky Maine coast and ends at <A HREF="http://www.sirius.com/~fitch/ogunquit/pcove.html">Perkins Cove</A>. The footpath is a beautiful elevation of land which resides just Southwest of the village of Ogunquit. It follows the shoreline and is a must for any visitor to the area.
<P>
While on a stroll down the Marginal Way stop and ponder how it used to be! Just look at the picture to the right and you can see how many other people have moved into the area to also enjoy this beautiful seashore community. One can see why so many <A HREF="http://www.sirius.com/~fitch/ogunquit/art.html">artists</A> have opted to spend time as this Beautiful Place By The Sea.<BR>

<P>
<H1>Welcome to Perkins Cove</H1>
<HR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="ogunquit8.jpeg"> Perkins Cove at dusk <P>
Perkins Cove is one of Ogunquit's most beautiful spots. The Marginal Way (an old Indian 
trail) takes you along the rocky Maine coast and ends (or begins) here. 
<P>
<H5>How it all Began </H5>
Perkins Cove started out as a small fishing community! It was the place where men 
set off to sea for their daily haul! From the cove men made their traps and fixed 
their lines and nets.
<P><CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=10><TR><TD>

<IMG SRC="ogunquit7.jpeg" WIDTH=200 HIEGHT=150><BR>Perkins Cove 1940</CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
As time wore on not only the fishermen noticed the beauty of the cove. More and More 
stores and restaurants moved in bringing in more visitors to also share this wonderful 
part of Ogunquit.
<P>
(Notice the footbridge is in each of these photos. It has changed it's appearance 
but always remained. Just like many of the restaurants in Perkins Cove!)

<IMG SRC="gifs/kitterydropcap.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>ettled in 1623 and Maine's oldest town, Kittery is famous for ship building. In the 1800's, the Navy Yard in Kittery was its biggest attraction.  The 74-gun ship Washington was launched from the Navy Yard in 1815.  &quot;Kearsage&quot;, the ship famous for sinking the Confederate raider &quot;Alabama&quot;, was launched from this yard during the Civil War. <P><IMG SRC="../york/lobstershack.gif" WIDTH=257 HEIGHT=191 ALIGN=LEFT> History was made here in 1905 when the Treaty of Portsmouth was signed at the Kittery Navy Yard's naval administration building, thus ending the Russo-Japanese War. 
<P>
Kittery's historic roots spread farther than just the Navy yard; Kittery is home to some of the oldest houses in Maine. From Garrisons to Capes all the typical colonial architecture of early America can be found here. If you are interested in seeing a very fine example of Palladian-style architecture interpreted in Early America, you may want to visit the  Lady Pepperrell's Mansion, which is on a hillside on the Piscataqua River (just past Fort McClary on Route 103).  Note: inquire locally as to the times available for public viewing as the mansion is now privately-owned and only open at selected times through the year.
<P>
Kittery also offers some beautiful seashore vistas and beaches.
<P>
Welcome to the Kittery Web Information Center. Please, browse the cobbled
streets, pubs and antiques shops. We hope you will add a stop in Kittery to your itinerary, so you too can enjoy our town's timeless New England charm.

Shorelands is a relaxed Maine Cottage Resort. The way life used to be! We've grown gradually over the years and we are constantly adding improvements. Consequently our spotless cottages and apartments are all different in size and style. In any season, you'll find our prices moderate, and we have some great spring and fall packages. There's so much to do here at any time of year, and our location allows you to feel so close to everything, yet removed from noise and congestion. We're not posh . . . we're a friendly, family style resort that many guests come back to again and again for the quiet relaxed atmosphere, cleanliness, attentive service and Casual Country Comfort!<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/ogunquitdropcap.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>gunquit is a small village that proves that nice things often come in small packages.  Ogunquit offers views of beautiful white beaches and rocky coast.  Ogunquit is home to two fine golf courses, and many <A HREF="http://www.communitynetwork.com/ogunquit/art.html">art
galleries</A>.  A quaint town designed for foot traffic, most of Ogunquit's shops, eateries, beaches and boardwalks are within a short walk from "downtown."  For those wanting to relax even more, a trolley system runs from May until mid-October and will whisk you from your beach chair on the white sand beach to shopping, back to your hotel, or off to Perkins Cove for more sightseeing.<A HREF="http://www.communitynetwork.com/ogunquit/pcove.html">Perkins Cove</A> is one of the most picturesque coves in all of Maine. Here you can enjoy the sights, take a chartered fishing trip, or just kick back for cocktails and fine dining.   <BR>Catering to many styles or tastes, Ogunquit's countless restaurants and shops will surely have something to offer you.  I am glad to welcome you to the Ogunquit Web Information Center. Someday you may find yourself in our beautiful slice of Maine coastline, but in the meantime, browse our web page and enjoy! 
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/ogunquit1.gif" ALIGN=left>
<B>A Beautiful Place by the Sea </B>
For many years, Ogunquit has attracted visitors from all over the world.  Known not only for its beautiful beaches and cool summer breezes, Ogunquit has been a haven 
for artists as well.  Whether you're setting up your easel at Marginal Way, or visiting the local galleries, you will see why Ogunquit has inspired visitors to call it &quot;the beautiful place by the sea&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Ogunquit's beaches run the coastline for about three miles and can be accessed by three main entrances. The main beach, off Beach Street in Ogunquit's "downtown," is the southernmost beach.  The Footbridge Beach is located off Borne Lane, and finally, the northernmost beach is called Moody Beach. Each of these entrances have parking and a trolley station stop. <BR>
<BR>
We hope to see you soon in Ogunquit, &quot;a beautiful place by the sea&quot;.

The "business" of Winter in Wells is a term I signify with getting the Town ready for the awakening of the community in Spring.  It is capped off by the Annual Town Meeting on April 26 and 27, following an intense 15-week budget development process. The
finishing touches also go into the 1995 Town Report, dedicated this year to late   Selectman   Harry Margeson, to be ready for reading in March.<P>

The business of Winter also means the continual work on the big issues facing the community. These include fighting the LNG Tank Project and applying for  the Harbor   dredge/beach restoration permits.  Developments to watch for are with the construction of the York County Technical  College, the Intermodal Transportation
Center and the new movie theater. All are slowly moving forward.<P>

The  business  of this winter appears to be dodging the weather. No matter if you were fighting the snow, wind or rain, again our Highway Department did an excellent job cleaning the roads so that we got to where we were going safely.<P>
 
Finally, the business of Winter is traveling, either for pleasure or for work.  Traveling for work sometimes means conventions in warmer climates but, more often than not this Winter, above average stress and strain on ourselves was the norm as we have had to navigate through rough weather to make a living.  However, for   the lucky,  warmer climates became a reality and were very welcomed for some with a few days or months in the sun.<P>

Now we turn our attention towards Spring and Summer and thoughts of Route One traffic, walking the trails at the Wells Reserve,  and the reopening of seasonal businesses as we start welcoming many back to Wells.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/kitterydropcap.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>ettled in 1623 and Maine's oldest town, Kittery is famous for ship building. In the 1800's, the Navy Yard in Kittery was its biggest attraction.  The 74-gun ship Washington was launched from the Navy Yard in 1815.  &quot;Kearsage&quot;, the ship famous for sinking the Confederate raider &quot;Alabama&quot;, was launched from this yard during the Civil War. <P><IMG SRC="../york/lobstershack.gif" WIDTH=257 HEIGHT=191 ALIGN=LEFT> History was made here in 1905 when the Treaty of Portsmouth was signed at the Kittery Navy Yard's naval administration building, thus ending the Russo-Japanese War. 
<P>
Kittery's historic roots spread farther than just the Navy yard; Kittery is home to some of the oldest houses in Maine. From Garrisons to Capes all the typical colonial architecture of early America can be found here. If you are interested in seeing a very fine example of Palladian-style architecture interpreted in Early America, you may want to visit the  Lady Pepperrell's Mansion, which is on a hillside on the Piscataqua River (just past Fort McClary on Route 103).  Note: inquire locally as to the times available for public viewing as the mansion is now privately-owned and only open at selected times through the year.
<P>
Kittery also offers some beautiful seashore vistas and beaches.
<P>
Welcome to the Kittery Web Information Center. Please, browse the cobbled
streets, pubs and antiques shops. We hope you will add a stop in Kittery to your itinerary, so you too can enjoy our town's timeless New England charm.

<IMG SRC="gifs/ogunquitdropcap.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>gunquit is a small village that proves that nice things often come in small packages.  Ogunquit offers views of beautiful white beaches and rocky coast.  Ogunquit is home to two fine golf courses, and many <A HREF="http://www.communitynetwork.com/ogunquit/art.html">art
galleries</A>.  A quaint town designed for foot traffic, most of Ogunquit's shops, eateries, beaches and boardwalks are within a short walk from "downtown."  For those wanting to relax even more, a trolley system runs from May until mid-October and will whisk you from your beach chair on the white sand beach to shopping, back to your hotel, or off to Perkins Cove for more sightseeing.<A HREF="http://www.communitynetwork.com/ogunquit/pcove.html">Perkins Cove</A> is one of the most picturesque coves in all of Maine. Here you can enjoy the sights, take a chartered fishing trip, or just kick back for cocktails and fine dining.   <BR>Catering to many styles or tastes, Ogunquit's countless restaurants and shops will surely have something to offer you.  I am glad to welcome you to the Ogunquit Web Information Center. Someday you may find yourself in our beautiful slice of Maine coastline, but in the meantime, browse our web page and enjoy! 
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/ogunquit1.gif" ALIGN=left>
<B>A Beautiful Place by the Sea </B>
For many years, Ogunquit has attracted visitors from all over the world.  Known not only for its beautiful beaches and cool summer breezes, Ogunquit has been a haven 
for artists as well.  Whether you're setting up your easel at Marginal Way, or visiting the local galleries, you will see why Ogunquit has inspired visitors to call it &quot;the beautiful place by the sea&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Ogunquit's beaches run the coastline for about three miles and can be accessed by three main entrances. The main beach, off Beach Street in Ogunquit's "downtown," is the southernmost beach.  The Footbridge Beach is located off Borne Lane, and finally, the northernmost beach is called Moody Beach. Each of these entrances have parking and a trolley station stop. <BR>
<BR>
We hope to see you soon in Ogunquit, &quot;a beautiful place by the sea&quot;.

Although summer is the busy season in Ogunquit there are now more reasons
to visit in the off-season. A cozy room at one of Ogunquit's hotels or bed
and breakfasts is a great way to escape that city hustle. Shops are less
crowded and the town seems a little more inviting.<BR>
<BR>
Ogunquit is a beautiful coastal town that has much to offer. Please browse
our page and visit the various topics that may be of any interest. Make
plans before you get to the area through our sponsors. Many businesses will
be listed here with varying degrees of information and available services.

<B>What is RABIES?</B>

<P>Rabies is a viral disease of the central nervous
system (brain and spinal cord) that is almost
always fatal. Rabies in humans is very rare in
the US, but rabies in animals - especially
wildlife - is common in some parts of the
country.


<P><B>How is rabies spread?</B>

<P>The rabies virus lives in the saliva (spit) and
other body fluids of animals and is spread when
they bite or scratch. The virus can also be
spread if one of these body fluids touches
broken skin or a mucous membrane (in the
mouth, nose or eyes).


<P><B>What kind of animals sDread rabies?</B>

<P>The rabies virus can infect any mammal (if it
has flir or hair, it's a mammal), but it only
becomes common among certain mammals such
as bats, skunks, foxes and raccoons. Rabies is
very rare among rodents (squirrels, rats, mice
and chipmunks. Thanks to vaccines, rabies is
extremely rare among pets and farm animals.
However, a rabid horse has been recently
confirmed in Southern Maine.

<P><B>How common is rabies in Maine?</B>

<P>In 1995 there were 101 cimically confirmed
cases of rabies in Maine. 45 of these cases were
in York County and the Town of Wells has had
2 confirmed cases; one in `95 and one in `96.

<P>Suspected animals who have contacted either a
human or domestic animal are tested by the Health  and  Environmental Laboratory in
Augusta.

<P><B>How can you tell if an animal is rabid?</B>

<P>Rabid animals usually bebave abnormally, but
signs vary. Some animals may appear shy and
fearful, others become aggressive, and some
may simply stumble as though drunk or appear
lame.

<P>Contact with all wild animals - especially bats,
skunks, foxes, and raccoons should be avoided.


<P><B>What should you do if you think you have
been exposed to rabies?</B>

<P>If you have been bitten or scratched by a wild
animal, or by a pet or farm animal that has
been behaving oddly, follow these steps:

<P>1. Immediately wash the wound with soap
and water, and continue washing for at least 10
minutes.

<P>2. Call your doctor or health care
professional as soon as you finish washing.
They will help you decide if you need to be
treated for rabies. Follow their instructions
completely.

<P>3. Contact the Wells Animal Control
Officer through the Wells Police Department at
646-9354. If the ACO is not available, explain
what has happened to the dispatcher or police
officer. The ACO or Police Officer will need
your help in locating the ammal that has bitten
or scratched you. If the suspected animal is
located and captured it will be sent to the State
Health  and  Environmental Laboratory in
Augusta.

<P>4. If your pet has been bitten or scratched
by an animal that you think might be rabid,
follow  the same steps  and notif' your
veterinarian.


   <H3>VACCINATE YOUR PETS</H3>

<B>Facts about Rabies</B>
<UL>
<LI> Clinical signs usually appear within 15 to
  25 days after exposure. It may take as long
  as one year for the virus to travel to the
  brain.

<LI> Rabies can be spread by animals eating the
  carcass of infected animals.

<LI> In a frozen state, the rabies virus can last
  for years.

<LI> Normally, the rabies virus cannot live in a
  warm putrefied environment and survives
  in the body less than 24 hours after death.

<LI> Post exposure treatment for people exposed
  to a rabid animal can cost over $2,000.00.
</UL
<PRE>
        Incubation Period

    DOGS      2 weeks to 6 months

       (average is 3 to 8 weeks)

    CATS      2 weeks to 6 weeks

  HUMANS     2 weeks to up to 1 year

       (average is 2 to 23 weeks)
</PRE>
<P>This period varies depending on the location of
the bite wound or exposure. Once the virus
reaches the central nervous system the spread is
relatively rapid; 48 to 120 hours.

<P>The incubation period in wild animals is
unknown and extremely variable.

  <P><B>Management of Dogs & Cats that Bite
            Humans</B>

<P>Vaccinated or unvaccinated dogs and cats that
bite a human must be quarantined for at least
10 days.

         <P><B>Quarantine Periods</B>

<P>Denending on exposure: Vaccinated animals,
up to 45 days. Unvaccinated animals, up to 6
months.

        <P><B>Type of Confinement</B>

<P>Depending on exposure: Home quarantine up to
complete separation and segregation in a State
Licensed facility or Veterinary CImic.

<P>It is so very important to vaccinate your pets
for rabies. The quarantine period for a
suspected rabies exposure is much longer for
unvaccinated pets.

<B>Barnacle Billy's has been a family run restaurant anchored in Perkins
Cove harbor for decades. People come for the coladas, daqueries,
and sunsets. At the cove-end of Marginal Way, a stop at &quot;Billy's&quot;
might mean, sitting on the sunset lit deck sipping frozen drinks and feasting
on aromas of lobster, or, it could mean an ice cream cone and and a stroll
around the loop. <BR>
<P><CENTER>Perkins Cove also is home to one of the oldest foot drawbridges
in New England.<BR>
<BR>
 Here's how it looks while you're all in Florida this winter!</B></CENTER>

the lobster rolls and the deck&quot; that keeps 'em coming back.</H4>

<b>BUSINESS EUROPA</b> gives you Central Europe - minus the mystery.<p>

<b>First in the field: Business Europa,</b> the original regional magazine entirely devoted to coverage of business developments in Central and Eastern Europe.<p>

<b>Regular check-list:</b> the central feature of the magazine is its <a href="besummy.html">regional brief</a>, a country by country check-list of key business and economic developments in recent weeks.  Who's bought whom, for how much. Who's invested in whom.  Who's started, who's stopped.  This regular feature is a <i>must read</i> for anyone with an active interest in the region, an opportunity to catch up on events that may have been missed, overlooked or plain forgotten.<p>
<b>Lively features:</b> on a wide and varied range of topics, including Hungarian Wine, the Danube's ecology, Czech Beer, Macedonia, Kosice, Krakow, Slovenia.  <b>Business Europa</b> is the most readable source of business information on the region.  Never dull, always interesting.<p>
<b>Reliable information:</b> other regular features include book reviews, a calendar of events - fairs, conferences, exhibitions etc., key indicators and data on all the region's major economies.<p>

<h3>ALBANIA</h3>

Albania held its third free parliamentary elections on 26 May. The result held few surprises with the ruling Democratic Party of President Sali Berisha securing a comfortable majority in the first round of voting. 
However the poll did `not meet international standards for free and fair elections' according to British, German and Norwegian observers from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Voting rigging, manipulation, violent intimidation by the police and fraud were widespread, with reports that ballot boxes arrived at the polling stations stuffed full of votes for the Democratic Party. Many of the candidates not already banned refused to participate, with the opposition parties likely to boycott the new parliament.<br>
Demonstrations in Tirana by opposition supporters were ruthlessly supressed by the police with protestors beaten and arrested. Among those attacked was Servet Pellumbi, the leader of the Socialist Party.
<P>
Albania's first ever stock exchange officially opened for business on 2 May. The market is limited to trading in treasury bills and privatisation vouchers under the control of the Bank of Albania.

<h3>ARMENIA</h3>

The Midland Bank opened its first branch in the former Soviet Union in Yerevan on 16 March.
<P>
Armenia became the first Transcaucasian republic to gain guest status at the European Council, the first step in gaining full membership of the EU.
<P>
The energy systems of Iran and Armenia will be connected by the end of 1996. Armenia will receive 200 MW of electricity a day.
<P>
Armenia's largest chemical plant, Nairit, increased production in 1995. The factory, employing 4,000 workers, has developed trading links with companies in Russia, Georgia, Ukraine and Belarus and is working on co-operation plans with firms in the USA, France and Belgium.
<P>
Of over 200 privatised enterprises in Armenia foreign investors have become co-owners in 21, with stakes ranging from 1 to 30 per cent according to Armen Shamshian, Chief of the Government Auction Centre.
<P>
Although the Armenian economy has suffered a considerable decline since the collapse of the USSR, other areas of activity have been more fertile. Armenia's population grew by an impressive 9.5 per cent in 1995 to 3,763,000 according to the State Statistics Agency.

<h3>AZERBAIJAN</h3>

In February agreements were signed with Russia to pipe up to five million tonnes of oil a year from Baku to the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, and with Turkey to pipe oil through Georgia to Supsa, also on the Black Sea.
<P>
A consortium led by British Petroleum and Statoil of Norway have signed an agreement with the Azeri Government to explore and develop oil and gas fields on the Karabakh geological structure in the Caspian Sea.
<P>
The McDermott oil company has sold its 2.45 per cent stake in the Azerbaijan International Operating Company developing the Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli fields in the Caspian Sea. 
The stake has been bought by the Japanese Itochu Corporation. Itochu (formerly C. Itoh) will invest US$245 million in the development of the US$10 billion project.
<P>
A second American company, the Pennzoil Corporation is also set to reduce its stake in the Azerbaijan International Operating Company. 
Pennzoil's stake will be reduced from 9.82 to 4.82 per cent. The Japanese Itochu Corporation will also buy the shares for US$132 million, increasing its total stake to 7.45 per cent.
<P>
The IMF has agreed to loan Azerbaijan US$80 million to finance the privatisation of 8,000 small businesses.
<P>
The former Agriculture Minister Muzamil Abdullayez has been sentenced to death by the Supreme Court which found him guilty of treason over his role in the failed coup attempt in October 1994. 
The only person who can revoke the sentence is President Aliyev, the man he tried to topple.
<P>
In another development that will cement President Aliyev's grip on power Ayaz Mutalibov (Azerbaijan's first post-Soviet president) and Rahim Haziev were arrested in Moscow in April. 
Accused of several crimes, including alleged coup attempts in October 1994 and March 1995, they are likely to face the death penalty if extradited to Baku.
<P>
Elf Aquitane, the French oil company, has reached agreement with the Azeri Government for a 10 per cent stake in the Shakh Deniz oil field. BP and Statoil each hold 25.5 per cent stakes in the project, with the state oil company Socar holding 40 per cent and Turkish Petroleum  9 per cent. Socar's share will be reduced to 30 per cent. Other oil companies considering the venture include LUKoil of Russia, Total of France and Ramco Energy of the UK. The field has estimated reserves of 1.4 billion barrels of oil and 500 billion cubic metres of gas.

<h3>BELARUS</h3>

In an attempt to strengthen relations and foster the independence and sovereignty of Belarus, the EU signed an Interim Trade Agreement on 25 March.
<P>
The trade deficit more than doubled in 1995 to US$572 million from US$225 million in 1994. Trade with countries of the CIS resulted in a deficit of US$630 million, only slightly eased by a surplus of US$58 million with non-CIS states.
<P>
GDP increased by 1 per cent in February according to the Bureau of Statistics.
<P>
Monthly inflation was 4 per cent in February.
<P>
The Belarussian Central Bank has reduced its refinancing rate to 55 per cent annually, effective from 21 March.
<P>
From bad... The 1996 state budget has been passed by parliament. The predicted deficit of US$500 million, 3.1 per cent of GDP, is well outside the target set down by the IMF. 
The final deficit is likely to be significantly higher as last minute subsidies to the agriculture sector of US$480 million were not taken into account. 
The IMF has given up any notion of resuming credits to Belarus due to the lacklustre and ineffective market reforms. A US$300 million standby credit agreed in 1995 will not go ahead.
<P>
To worse... The Belarussian legal, economic and political environment for attracting foreign investment is one of the weakest in the world, according to a report by the World Bank. 
The `extremely tangled, cumbersome and unstable' taxation system was identified as the principle obstacle to foreign investment, which is currently averaging a meagre US$20 million a year.
<P>
In December 1991 69 per cent of Belarussians felt the end of the Soviet Union was a positive move, yet only four years later a mere 6 per cent thought the decision to abolish the Soviet Union was the correct one. 
Playing on the memories of the good old days of a command economy Alexander Lukashenkaa is doing his best to end Belarus' brief dalliance with independence. 
Presiding over a ruined economy dependent on Russian subsidies President Lukashenka has become increasingly vocal in proclaiming integration with Russia as the panacea for his country's ills. 
Quite where Russia will find the money to solve Belarus' economic problems seems to have been conveniently ignored.

<h3>BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA</h3>

Moslem and Croat leaders in Bosnia agreed to create a customs union in March. The agreement also includes a single state budget, a unitary banking system and a new federation flag. Whether any notice of the accord will be taken on the ground remains to be seen.
<P>
Bosnia became a member of the World Bank at the beginning of April. 
The president of the bank, James Wolfensohn, signed three loan packages worth US$270 million on a visit to Sarajevo. The projects to be funded by the money include rebuilding roads, bridges and airports, restarting agricultural production and repairing water and sanitation systems.
<P>
The Bosnian Prime Minister Hasan Muratovic estimates his country will need US$16 billion to fund post-war reconstruction. 
The most critical areas identified by the World Bank - health care, education and basic infrastructure, will require US$5.1 billion. He also estimated the total physical damage to Bosnia at a staggering US$80 billion.
<P>
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have pledged US$100 million to assist the Bosnian army train and re-equip.
<P>
The US Congress agreed an aid package for Bosnia at the end of March. Small and medium sized enterprises will receive US$65 million, with US$80 million for infrastructure projects.

<h3>CROATIA</h3>

The Croatian Ambassador to the USA, Mario Nobilo went on the offensive in March over claims of violence and intimidation against Serbs living in the Krajina area of Croatia. In a statement defending the capture of the region in 1995 he compared the incidence of violence and robbery against American citizens to reported incidents in Krajina, with residents of Miami more than four times as likely to be victims of violent crime as those living in Krajina.
<P>
Industrial output in the first two months of 1996 saw a 3.5 per cent increase on the same period last year, according to the State Institute for Statistics.
<P>
Croatia's external debt increased by US$400 million to US$3.2 billion in 1995, excluding the country's share of the foreign debt of the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
The first Croatian firm to launch a global share offer, the drug company Pliva, has seen strong interest from international investors.

<h3>CZECH REPUBLIC</h3>

The Czech parliamentary elections on 31 May and 1 June succeeded only in creating confusion rather than a new government. Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's ruling coalition of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and the Christian Democratic Union (KDU) won 99 seats in the 200 member parliament. Despite slightly increasing their share of the vote they lost six seats and their majority.<br>
Support for the Social Democrats (CSSD) of Milos Zeman quadrupled from about 6 per cent to 26.4 per cent, making them the second largest party, and the real victors in the election.<br>
Although the overall vote for left-wing parties has not grown significantly since 1992, Zeman succeeded in consolidating that vote and creating a more united and therefore powerful opposition force. The passive campaign of the ODS, relying on past achievements, retained existing support but did not do enough to capture new votes.<br>
On 6 June President Vaclav Havel asked Klaus to form a minority government after the CSSD said they would accept Klaus as prime minister in return for certain conditions. These include the post of parliamentary chairman, decentralisation of power to the regions and the separation of the social-welfare fund from the state budget.<br>
The only party to lose a major share of the vote was the unreformed Communists, losing 13 seats. Six parties gained seats in parliament compared to nine in 1992, as those failing to gain 5 per cent of the vote have their share redistributed among the larger parties.<br>
Calling new elections is a possibility, however the Czech constitution prohibits the dissolution of parliament until elections to the Senate have taken place. The earliest date for another ballot would be the spring of 1997, with a government of `experts' ruling until then.<br>
The positive outcome of the election is that a clear mandate has been delivered to reformist and democratic parties, with extremist groups effectively sidelined. The long-term stability and the economic reforms of the Czech Republic are unlikely to be affected by the election result. What is guaranteed is a period of politicking, deals and compromises behind the scenes.

ODS: centre-right party with a strong record on the economy and reform.<br>
CSSD: centre-left party supporting privatisation but opposes price liberalisation.<br>
KSCM: unreformed communists whose strong links to the past rule out a significant role in any government.<br>
KDU: centre party and part of previous coalition government, likely to demand more cabinet seats as price for co-operation.<br>
ODA: also a coalition partner, a centre-right party in favour of economic reforms and decentralisation, will also be looking for more cabinet seats.<br>
SRP: extreme right party, anti-German and gypsy policies exploited fears over crime and German influence in the economy.

Among the aerial sites TMobil will use are Catholic churches.
<P>

Moldovan GDP shrank by 3 per cent in 1995, a significant improvement on the 31.2 per cent fall in 1994. The government is predicting growth of 7.7 per cent for 1996.
<P>
Monthly inflation fell to 2.5 per cent in February, from 3.5 per cent in January.
<P>
According to the National Bank of Moldova the country's external debt grew by 55 per cent in 1995 to US$576 million. Of the total debt, US$435 million was due to state purchases of energy, grain imports and the promotion of exports. Hard currency reserves increased to US$256 million during 1995.
<P>
The privatisation of Moldova's tourism sector has been completed, with 165 hotels, restaurants and other facilities sold off. Although tourism increased by 130 per cent in 1995 on 1994 figures, the total revenue was still only L19 million, less than US$5 million.
<P>
An agency for the development of the private sector has finally been established in line with World Bank guidelines. Created by the Ministry of Finance it has already received a US$35 million loan for public sector development projects.
<P>
Moldovan industry continues to be in heavy debt to the state - over L100 million by the end of 1995. The largest debtors are:<br>
Tractor Factory (L13.5 million)<br>
Refrigerator Factory (L2.5 million)<br>
Alfa IC (L3.7 million)<br>
Moldtelecom (L2.5 million)<br>
Vitanta-Intravest (L1.5 million)<br>
Aroma (L1.5 million)<br>
MoldovaHydroMash (L1.3 million)<br>
<P>
By 1 January 1996 2,278 enterprises had been privatised, 2,231 for National Patrimonial Bonds and only 47 for cash. A total of 3.2 million Moldovans have taken part in the privatisation process. Of all privatised enterprises 17.3 per cent are industrial, 11.9 per cent agrarian, 12.8 per cent medical, 11.6 per cent transport and distribution and 45.4 per cent trade and service.
<P>
In an attempt to reduce Moldova's dependence on Russia an agreement has been signed with Iran for the supply of two million tonnes of crude oil over the next five years.
<P>
Moldtelecom and Intracom of Greece have signed a contract to build automatic telephone exchanges with a total of 14,000 lines. The project will cost US$5 million.
<P>
The success of the government's economic programme in Moldova has been recognised by the IMF which has agreed a US$200 million three year loan to assist further reforms.

<h3>POLAND</h3>

Queen Elizabeth II became the first reigning British monarch to visit Poland at the end of March. She emphasised the strong relations between Poland and the UK and expressed her hope that Poland would become a member of NATO and the EU in the near future.
<P>
General Motors Corp (GM) has chosen a greenfield site at the southern town of Gliwice to build a car-assembly plant. The factory, costing US$340 million, will eventually produce 150,000 cars per annum with the first car rolling off the production line in autumn 1998. Gliwice beat off competition from three other short-listed sites due to a well developed communication and transportation network and a skilled local workforce. The project will create 2,000 jobs. The decision to build the new plant was made after GM was beaten by the South Korean conglomerate Daewoo in a race to buy the Fabryka Samochodow Osobowych (FSO) car plant.
<P>
That'll be the Daewoo: Minutes after the announcement of GMs investment at Gliwice, Daewoo revealed they will invest US$80 million in production at Daewoo FSO Motors during 1996, not to mention increasing the capital of the joint venture by US$20 million to US$200. Daewoo plan to produce over 300,000 cars a year in Poland by the year 2000.
<P>
Daewoo's Honker: Daewoo have purchased the rights to produce the Tarpan Honker off-road vehicle, until recently used by the Polish military. About 2,000 Honkers will be produced by the end of the year, with production eventually increasing to 40,000 a year.
<P>
Fiat Auto SA have also announced a US$250 million investment in Poland as part of its `World Car' project, the manufacture of cars based on the same chassis and similar parts on five continents. Poland will be one of four or five manufacturing centres. Fiat has invested US$1 billion in Poland since 1992 and is facing increasing competition from GM and Daewoo as it defends its 50 per cent market share.<br>
General Motors Acceptance Corp, a subsidiary of General Motors Corp, has bought a Warsaw based bank to offer car financing to Opel dealers and their customers. The purchase of a controlling stake in Polbank has been funded by the Polish-American Enterprise Fund and a private equity fund.
<P>
From 1 July 1996 the Zaklady Samochodowe car manufacturer will begin producing the Mercedes `Vitos' model. The plant, which plans to produce 30,000 cars a year, will receive DM50 million from Mercedes.
<P>
In - Two Polski Bank Rozwoju (PBR) vice presidents are facing jail sentences and fines of US$2,000 following the alleged failure to let government auditors inspect state property. The state has a 62.4 per cent stake in PBR who refused to let central bank auditors inspect the bank's non-credit activities, including corporate deposit accounts records.
<P>
Out - Anyone contemplating illegal parking in Warsaw faces a new threat with the creation of a 20 strong squadron of female meter readers. Part of the capital's city guard auxiliary police unit, the force will levy fines of between US$2 and US$200.
<P>
Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy (BPH) has finally received US$6 million in aid from the Fund for Privatisation of Polish Banks. The money had been withheld while contributors to the fund waited to see if the already privatised BPH would be consolidated with two state-owned banks.
<P>
Poland's banks had a more profitable 1995, reporting an aggregate profit of Zl 2.8 billion (US$1 billion) following a loss of Zl 230 million in 1994.
<P>
The Polish Government has pledged to spend US$9 billion over the next five years in an attempt to clean up the country's environmental problems. Poland's 700 plus environmental consultancies will also be hoping to clean up.
<P>
The Privatisation Ministry has invited bids for a 30 per cent stake in the food trader Rolimpex SA.<br>
Industrial production rose 9.6 per cent in 1995 to its highest level since 1989, with domestic consumption and export growth fuelling the increase. Although an 8 per cent lower figure than 1994, the increased production involved a 20 per cent increase in the value of products sold.
<P>
The Central Statistical Office estimated February's inflation at 1.5 per cent.
<P>
The minimum monthly wage has been set at Zl 350 for the second quarter of 1996.
<P>
The Gdansk Shipyard is facing bankruptcy after losing US$22.2 million last year. The government, which holds 60 per cent of the equity, has announced plans to privatise the yard, selling more than 10 per cent to strategic investors. The remaining 40 per cent is held by the employees.
<P>
With the prospect of 2,000 jobs being lost, the shipyard took on another worker on 2 April, an electrician named Lech Walesa. The former president claimed he was returning to his old job after the government ruled he was ineligible for a state pension. Perhaps he just wanted to get his hands back on the levers of power.
<P>
The Swedish development company Skanska Building AB has won a US$130 million contract to develop a site next to the Atrium Business Centre in Warsaw. The Atrium South development will include a 230-room four star hotel, 25,000 square metres of retail space and eventually a 16-floor office block.
<P>
The Warsaw Stock Exchange will begin operating a new data transmission system from August.
<P>
The government announced on 16 March that 9.13 million mass privatisation certificates had been issued since 22 November.
<P>
The privatisation of the Polish tobacco industry should be complete by October. The government has already sold a 33 per cent stake in each factory it owns, with a further 20 per cent due for sale in the large Augustow, Radom, Cracow and Poznan factories.
<P>
Gdansk municipal bonds will be issued by a consortium of Bank Gdansk, Bank Handlowy and Merrill Lynch as the city aims to raise Zl l90 million. The bonds will be distributed in six tranches over three years, with 30 per cent on sale outside Poland.
<P>
The purchase by the publishing conglomerate Infor Sp of the economic weekly Zycie Gospodarcze from Przyjaciolka Sp, a Swiss-owned women's magazine publisher, gives Infor a near monopoly on legal and business publications in Poland.
<P>
Foreign investment in Poland increased to US$6.8 billion in 1995 from US$4.3 billion in 1994. The USA was the largest investor at the end of the year with investments worth US$1.7 billion, followed by Germany (US$680 million), France (US$570 million), Italy (US$460 million), Holland (US$410 million) and the UK (US$370 million).
<P>
A loan of Ecu1 billion from the EU's PHARE programme has been granted to increase the competitiveness of Poland's industry and help the country prepare for integration into the EU.
<P>
The corporate tax rate will be cut by 8 per cent to 32 per cent by the year 2000 according to the government. In a staged reduction corporate tax will fall to 38 per cent from 40 per cent on 1 January 1997 and then by 2 per cent every year until it reaches 32 per cent in 2000.
<P>
The dominant position of the state owned Powszechny Zaklad Ubezpieczen (PZU) insurance company is being eroded by western insurance firms. Amplico Life (USA) has sold over 100,000 policies and Commercial Union (UK) over 250,000 causing PZU to lose 7 per cent of its 95 per cent market share in 1995.
<P>
Poland's agricultural trade gap was US$474 million in 1995, an increase of US$126 million on 1994.
<P>
A restructuring programme for the debt ridden coal industry has been developed by the Ministry of Industry. The plan involves reducing output from 140 million to 120 million tonnes a year to cut losses on exports, which are currently subsidised, and laying off 80,000 miners.
<P>
Figures released by the Ministry of Privatisation show that 3,465 enterprises have been privatised since 1990, however nearly 40 per cent of these were liquidated outright or transferred to another firm. Privatisation revenue in 1995 was US$660 million.
<P>
Texaco and Tenneco, the American oil and gas companies have been awarded licenses to explore for natural gas near the city of Lodz. The joint venture created by the companies, Wielkopolska Energia SA, will begin the first phase of exploration within the next few months at an initial cost of US$6 million.
<P>
Texaco has also announced plans to build 150 petrol stations across Poland over the next five years.
<P>
About Time: A Polish language version of Time Magazine is set for publication before the end of the year, with an initial print run of 100,000 eventually increasing to 250,000.

<h3>ROMANIA</h3>

The first distance learning programme for professional training has been launched by the Romanian Banking Institute(RBI). The programme is supported by the UK Know How Fund and run in collaboration between the RBI and Attitudes, Skills & Knowledge Ltd of the UK. It is the first such project in Romania. The course has been structured with respect to the Romanian banking system and will train participants in economic and banking theory.
<P>
Revised figures issued by the Ministry of Trade showed a US$1.89 billion trade deficit in 1995, rather than US$1.5 billion as was originally thought. The government has set the ambitious target of limiting the 1996 trade deficit to US$1 billion through a 13 per cent increase in exports and maintaining imports at 1995 levels.
<P>
Industrial production increased by 2.7 per cent in February, a recovery from January when output fell 10.5 per cent, according to the National Statistics Board.
<P>
The 1996 budget, approved by parliament on 17 April, has a planned deficit equivalent to 3.45 per cent of GDP, down from 4.1 per cent in 1995. The budget is in line with the IMF approved reform programme.
<P>
Romania has emerged as a major player on the international grain market following 1995's wheat harvest which produced a surplus of one million tonnes. However, antiquated storage, distribution and export infrastructure are preventing Romania from taking full advantage of buoyant wheat prices. The government predicts a wheat harvest of six million tonnes in 1996.
<P>
Increased demand and insufficient energy stocks led RENEL (the State Electricity Authority) to cut off electricity supplies to non-paying customers - principally large state-owned enterprises, in February. Priority was given to domestic consumers and companies which had paid their bills.
<P>
The National Bank of Romania (NBR) stripped all but four of Romania's banks of their foreign exchange dealership licences at the end of March.<br>
The severe measures were imposed following the alleged failure of the banks to comply with strict new legislation introduced at the beginning of March, which fixed daily ceilings on the amount of foreign currency commercial banks could hold. The four lucky banks to keep their licences were the Banca Comerciala Romana, Banca Romana pentru Dezvoltare, Banca Romana de Comert Exterior (all state-owned banks) and Banca Ion Tiriac, a private bank. Eight foreign banks lost their licences including ING, ABN Amro NV, Citibank and Societe Generale.<br>
The four dealer banks will operate as market-makers with non-licenced banks forced to operate as brokers, unable to hold overnight positions of over US$10,000. The move has been condemed as a politically motivated method of underpinning the weak looking leu. Private bankers have put the exchange rate at 3,100 per US$1 rather then the artificially strong 2,850 held by state banks.
The move has been strongly condemned as a backwards step in Romania's economic reform programme, although the NBR claims it it a positive move in raising standards without harming the development of a western style market. The central bank maintains that banks which prove themselves able and willing to work responsibly will soon be readmitted as dealers.
<P>
Daewoo Motors have completed the construction of the Rodae Automobile SA plant in Craiova. The plant has an annual capacity of 100,000 cars, which will be increased to 200,000 by 1998. Rodae, a joint venture between Daewoo and Automobile Craiove, is the largest overseas car plant built by Korean car manufacturers. Daewoo plans to have a 30 per cent share of the eastern European car market by 2000.
<P>
The start up of the 700 MW Cernovada nuclear power station has been postponed for six months. Reactor and safety tests are due to start in April or May.
<P>
South African Breweries Ltd (SAB), the fifth largest brewer in the world, is set to invest US$20 million in the Vultural beer factory. SAB is planning to acquire 70 per cent of the stock and invest US$10 million in upgrading and modernising the brewery. Vultural has an annual production of 500,000 hectolitres of beer and 11,000 tonnes of malt with a combined value of US$11 million.
<P>
Romania's first ever country rating by Standard & Poor's Corp and IBCA Ltd predict that the country will become the next eastern European destination for international investors. Irreversible reforms and low wages will attract investors as wages in the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary reach western levels. Romania's foreign currency debt has been assigned a BB rating. Low inflation (25 per cent in 1995), unemployment (8.7 per cent) and external debt and a 6 per cent increase in GDP in 1995 are making the region's second largest market increasingly attractive to foreign investors.
<P>
A US$280 million financial and enterprise sector adjustment loan has been approved by the World Bank. A separate loan of US$120 million has also been granted to assist in the rehabilitation of Romanian railways.

<h3>RUSSIA</h3>

In a historic meeting at the Kremlin Boris Yeltsin met with the Chechen leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev on 27 May. A ceasefire signed by the two parties is due to come into effect at midnight on 31 May, two weeks before the Russian presidential elections. The death of Dzhokhar Dudayev on 22 April in a Russian attack had thrown the possibility of a peaceful solution into doubt, with inter-factional fighting among the Chechen warlords expected. However Yandarbiyev, who had previously vowed to keep on fighting until every Russian soldier had left Chechnia, has succeeded in maintaining unity among the rebel groups.<br>
The ceasefire, as long as it is implemented on the ground, should give Yeltsin a timely boost as he runs for re-election on 16 June. From the Chechen perspective a Yeltsin victory would be preferable to one for the communist Gennady Zyuganov whose hardline attitude would leave little room for negotiation. Whether the agreement was merely a pre-election ploy by both sides will only become clear after the June election. Chechnia's future status, over which the 17 month conflict has been fought killing 30,000, was not discussed in the Kremlin talks.
<P>
Russia has upset the EU after imposing a minimum price of US$8.20 for a litre of vodka imported from the EU, compared to only US$3.80 from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The Commission claims these measures are incompatible with the Interim Trade Agreement which came into force on 1 February, under which improved access to Russian markets for particular products including alcohol and cars was agreed.
<P>
The amount of foreign capital in the Russian oil company Chernogorneft is set to increase from the present 20 per cent following the registration of an American Depository Receipt (ADR) programme with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in a move to attract long-term foreign investment. The company announced profits of US$31 million on gross sales of US$465 million in 1995.
<P>
ING Barings is planning to more than double the number of companies it offers through its Russian depository receipts by the end of 1996. Regional and second-tier manufacturing companies will be the main focus.
<P>
The troubled south Caucasus region of Russia received some sweet news with the announcement that Queen Margaret College of Edinburgh in Scotland will assist Ingushetia state (next door to Chechnya) in establishing a modern food production facility. The unlikely coupling will manufacture chocolate, biscuits and confectionary.
<P>
Taylor Woodrow International has won a US$15.4 million contract to modernise a tobacco factory for BAT in Saratov.
<P>
Good news and bad news: Monthly inflation fell to a mere 2.8 per cent in February, the lowest level since 1991 according to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. However the improvement is likely to be shortlived as LUKoil and Yukos, Russia's largest oil companies, have announced that they will be increasing prices by up to 25 per cent.
<P>
Deutsche Telekom has bought a 40 per cent stake in Russkaya Telefonna Kompaniya, a Russian GSM mobile phone operator. The deal is part of the group's expansion by DeTeMobil, the mobile phone subsidiary, in eastern Europe. By 2000 the new venture expects to have 250,000 clients. DeTeMobil also has a 39 per cent stake in Mobile Telesysteme, a mobile phone operator in Moscow.
<P>
A joint venture between Royal Dutch/Shell and the Russian oil company Evikhon has been formed to develop and operate oil fields in western Siberia. Recovery of the estimated 139 million tonnes of crude oil are due to begin in 1998 and reach six million tonnes a year by 2003.
<P>
The Krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter is setting up a joint venture with the Swiss based Glencore trading group. The new operation, Krazpa Metal will give the second largest aluminium smelter in the world direct access to western markets.
<P>
Russian coal companies extracted 68.8 million tonnes of coal in the first quarter of 1996, a 0.3 million tonnes increase on the same period last year, although still short of official expectations.
<P>
The minimum pension was raised by 10 per cent on 17 April to R69,575 (US$14) a month. The increase was approved following a raise in compensation payments that pensioners receive along with their pensions. Those on an average pension will receive R350,000.
<P>
The fuel and energy sector owed the 1995 state budget R26 trillion (US$5.7 billion) principally due to non-payments of R105 trillion, according to Fuel and Energy Deputy Minister Anatoli Kozyrev. An estimated 24 per cent of enterprises in the sector were run with losses totalling over R2 trillion.
<P>
Collapsed: A landmark deal between the Russian central bank and Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, to issue US$500 million of government bonds has collapsed. The deal, which would have attracted international investors into the Russian Treasury-bill market, was an attempt by the government to raise desperately needed revenue.
<P>
Russia reached an agreement with the Paris Club of sovereign creditors on 19 April to reschedule over US$40 billion of the former Soviet debt. Following on from a provisional agreement with the London Club of commercial creditors last November and the signing of a three year US$10.1 billion loan with the IMF, Russian finances are looking stronger than they have for several years. The Paris Club deal gives Russia a six year grace period on the principal repayments, with phased repayments of the remaining debt over 25 years. Annual interest payments will continue and are estimated at US$2 billion for this year. However the agreement hinges on Russian economic reform and the accord with the IMF.

<h3>SERBIA & MONTENEGRO*<br>
*Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</h3>

Industrial output increased by 8 per cent in the first two months of 1996 compared to the same period last year according to the Federal Statistics Office.
<P>
Monthly inflation in March accelerated to 7.2 per cent according to the Federal Statistics Office, an increase from 4.7 per cent in February.
<P>
Economic growth of 20 per cent in 1996 has been predicted by the government, however economists at the Economic Institute seem to have a better grasp on reality, claiming that growth of 8 per cent would be an achievement.
<P>
In a US$1 billion agreement reached in March China will supply Serbia with one million barrels of crude oil a month from April. The deal with Sinochem, the Chinese state oil company is the biggest foreign trade agreement Serbia has reached since UN sanctions were lifted last November.
<P>
Pirot-based Tiger, a manufacturer of rubber products, has agreed a deal to export one million car tyres to western Europe in 1996. Michelin will receive 650,000 and the London based joint venture Tiger Europe 350,000.
<P>
The Greek state telecommunications company OTE and PTT of the rump Yugoslavia have agreed to build a fibre-optic cable linking the island of Corfu with the town of Bar and also a cable between Bar and Belgrade. The construction is due for completion in April 1997 and is costing between US$15 and US$20 million.

<h3>UKRAINE<br></h3>

On 28 May President Kuchma sacked Prime Minister Evhan Marchuk following accusations by the president that he was pursuing his own political career rather than managing the economy. Ukraine's new Prime Minister is Pavlo Lazarenko, a close ally of President Kuchma and a former collective farm manager. Mr Lazarenko, whose reformist creditentials are limited, was promoted from first deputy prime minister.
<P>
The Ukrainian Enterprise Corporation, a Toronto direct investment fund, was launched in February. The fund aims to raise US$36.5 million from institutional investors and the Toronto Stock Exchange. The money will be used to finance privatised and start-up companies in the food processing and energy sectors.
<P>
Following a sequence of banking crises in the Baltic states Ukraine has raised the minimum starting capital requirements to Ecu100,000 for local banks, increasing to Ecu1 million by 1998.
<P>
The Chernobyl nuclear plant has received Ecu2 million from the European Commission to support the continued monitoring and treatment of victims following the 1986 disaster.
<P>
The US Export-Import Bank has approved US$171.3 million in credit guarantees. The money will be used to buy agricultural equipment.
<P>
Off: Gas supplies have been cut to 86 large factories with unpaid bills. Total arrears stand at about US$840 million. This move follows the suspension of electricity supplies to 7,000 enterprises with outstanding bills, estimated at US$980 million.
<P>
On: The IMF has agreed to resume its programme of stand-by loans to Ukraine. The change of heart follows the adoption of a 1996 budget which set a maximum deficit of 6.2 per cent of GDP. By the end of the year nine tranches of the loan, worth US$100 million each, will have been distributed at monthly intervals.
<P>
Out: The coal miners strike in Donetsk which began at the beginning of April involved 16 mines and 2,000 miners by the middle of the month. The main cause of the strike is unpaid wages - some workers have not been paid since last September.

<h3>TRAVEL BRIEF</h3>
The Polish national airline LOT has been awarded the title of Best Eastern European Business Airline by the Business Travel World magazine.
<P>
The Czech national carrier CSA has implemented a non-smoking policy on trans-Atlantic and European flights. The airline is also opening a city terminal in Prague near the Renaissance hotel.
<P>
CSA will be the launch airline for a new passenger aircraft built by the French-Italian consortium Avions de Transport Regional. The ATR 42-400 turboprop carries between 46 and 50 passengers and will increase performance, lower operating costs and offer greater comfort, according to the manufacturers.
<P>
From 1 April Canadians and Czechs can visit each others' countries without visas. The Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec has also expressed hopes that the USA will follow Canada's example in granting visa free travel.
<P>
Air Baltic is replacing its Boeing 727s on the Riga-London Gatwick route with Avro RJ70s. The airline is planning services to Moscow and Kiev from Riga.
<P>
A three times a week on-board courier service between London and the Azerbaijan capital Baku has begun, operated by Inter-Logistic Ltd in conjunction with British Airways.
<P>
All airfares out of Budapest increased by between 3 and 10 per cent from 1 April following a recent decision by the International Air Transportation Association.
<P>
Dac Air, the private Romanian airline, will buy 24 aircraft from the Canadian manufacturer Bombardier over the next three years in a contract worth US$425 million.
<P>
The prospect of a Slovak national airline being set up grew stronger in February when the government agreed to accept four Yak 42s and one Tu-154 aircraft from Russia in a `jets for debts' agreement. The new airline, provisionally called the Slovak Air Transport System (SATS), would connect seven Slovak cities to all the major European capitals and carry half a million passengers a year.
<P>
Tatra Air of Slovakia is beginning flights to Zurich from the Stafanik airport in Bratislava.
<P>
In a fiercely contested bid CSA has chosen Boeing to supply 10 new passenger aircraft rather than the European Airbus Industries. The 737-500 airplanes have a capacity of between 120 and 150 passengers and cost between US$20 and US$35 million each.
<P>
Austrian Airlines began flights from Vienna to Skopje (Macedonia) and Kosice (Slovakia) in April and is planning to fly to Dnepropetrovsk in the Ukraine within the next few months.

<h3>ALBANIA</h3>

Out - The Albanian Appeals court ordered the release of former president Ramiz Alia. In July 1994 Alia had been sentenced to a nine-year prison term. The release was widely seen as related to Albania's admission to the Council of Europe at the end of June.
<p>
In - Former Central Bank governor Ilir Holt has been sentenced to six years in jail for abuse of office in a US$1.6 million fraud scandal. Also jailed were three former directors of the National Commercial Bank. The fraud was based, somewhat improbably, on a payment of US$1.6 million for negotiations to resolve Albania's foreign debt. (See over).
Albania finally signed a technical agreement in late July to resolve the problems surrounding its US$501 million foreign debt. The deal effectively reduces Albania's total debt to US$100 million due to be repaid by the end of August 1995. This represents a `20 cents in the dollar' deal, probably the best terms secured by any of the region's debtor nations.
<p>
July saw the `soft' opening of the four star Europa Hotel in Tirana. The hotel is operated by the Austrian Rogner group, who also operate Prague's Don Giovanni hotel and formerly managed Warsaw's Sobieski hotel. Inter-Continental Hotel Corporation has announced plans to open a 262 room hotel in Tirana, which will be the city's first 5-star property. The hotel is to be constructed by the Kuwaiti Kaharafi Group.
<p>
Premier Oil of the UK has embarked on a renovation programme of the extraction equipment in the Kucova, Marinza and Amonika regions. Oil production in Albania fell by over 30,000 tonnes from 1993 to 1994, causing a sharp rise in oil related products.
<p>
Albania ranks sixth in terms of foreign capital invested per capita in the region according to IMF figures. Top of the list is Hungary with US$514 per capita, followed by the Czech Republic at US$200 per capita. The figure for Albania is US$21.00 per capital. Foreign investments in Albania make up 8.6 per cent of GDP, second only to Hungary (15 per cent of GDP).
Albania's Central Bank has cut its 12 month deposit rates from 14.5 per cent to 13.5 per cent. The year-on-year inflation figure for the end of June dropped to 2.1 per cent from 5.72 per cent in May.
<p>
Consumer goods imports in 1994 were up 12.5 per cent over 1993. Principal exporters to Albania were Italy (34.11 per cent), Greece (27.68), Bulgaria (8.75), Turkey (6.75), Macedonia (2.63). 
<p>
Albania - come bank with me
In June the bank of Albania approved new regulations for the establishment of private banks in Albania. The move has met with a favourable response from the international financial community. Albania could do with a few new banks: at present there are only six banks in the country - the National Commercial Bank, Italo-Shqiptare Bank (Italo-Albania Bank) and the Arab Albanian Islamic Bank are joint venture banks, with the National Commercial Bank holding 40 per cent in each. Dardania Bank, a Kosovan-owned bank, is the only private bank operating in Albania at present.
The initial capitalisation level for new, private foreign banks in Albania is set at US$2,000,000, one of the lowest bank captialisation levels in Europe. Foreign banks are also able to repatriate bank profits.
Planned revisions to the existing Law for the Banking System of Albania will bring it more into line with Albania's fast changing business environment. It's all very new to Albania's banking authorities, but they are well advised by consultants from the USA and the ubiquitous Irish. The policy is to make sure that the laws are, in practice, enforceable, and do not give rise to indecision on the part of banks in granting credit. The Central Bank maintains that it is receiving a growing number of enquiries, but to date no-one has signed on the dotted line.

<h3>ARMENIA</h3>
To no-one's surprise, the ruling All Armenian National Movement party won the country's 6 July elections. Western observers complained that the polls had been heavily biased in favour of the government and the ruling party, with the opposition Dashnak party banned for the duration of the election period. (See Armenian Elections, Media Brief, page 55).
<p>
Armenia's Metsamor nuclear power station, closed following the 1988 Spitak earthquake, was due to be reopened in September, boosting Armenia's electricity supplies by 40 per cent. Electricity supplies should be restored to between eight and 10 hours per day.<br>
Armenia's first foreign owned bank, the Midland Armenia has been licensed. A joint venture between UK-based Midland Bank Plc and Liechtenstein's Wing establishment, the new bank has an authorised capital of US$10 million. Four foreign banks - Bank Melli Iran, the Menatep and Russki Banks (Russia) and Inko Bank of the Ukraine have branches in Armenia, but Midland Armenia will be the first foreign owned local bank.
<p>
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan in a post election cabinet shuffle, has appointed new ministers for the Economics (Andranik Andreasyan) and Information (Grach Tarmazyan) portfolios. The new constitution, adopted after the June elections, abolished the institution of Minister of State. Grant Bagratyan continues as Prime Minister, Vagan Papazyan as Foreign Minister.

<h3>AZERBAIJAN</h3>

Azerbaijan's grain harvest for 1995 is expected to be up on 1994, at 1.1 million tonnes according to Azeri news agency Assa-Irada.
<p>
Germany and Azerbaijan have signed a new air agreement providing for a three times a week winter schedule, increasing to four weekly in the Spring of 1996.  Lufthansa already operates a twice weekly service from Frankfurt to Baku, and plans to start a weekly cargo service in 1996.
<p>
The State Oil Company of the Azerbaijani Republic (SOCAR) is ceding a 25 per cent stake in a Caspian sea offshore development to Elf of France. SOCAR will retain a 25 per cent stake, the balance of 50 per cent being held by US company Chevron.
<p>
Russia's LUKoil has purchased 500,000 tonnes of refined oil products from state oil company SOCAR at a price of US$131 per tonne. The deal followed a reduction in imports of Azeri exports of diesel fuel and kerosene to Iran. Talks with Iran on restoring deliveries to their original level broke up after Iranian demands for a 25-30 per cent reduction on the price of diesel fuel. Discussions are also under way with Turkey for the supply of oil from the Chirag 1 field.
<p>
The international oil consortium reached a compromise on the routing of Azeri oil. The initial output will be routed both through Russia's pipelines and through Georgia to the Black Sea.
BELARUS
President Alexander Lukashenko has approved a programme to privatise some 600 large and medium-sized businesses by the end of 1995. Included in the programme are clothing, textile and furniture manufacturers and food processing industries.

GDP for the period January-August 1995 fell by an estimated 12 per cent over the same period for the preceding year.<br>
Responding to pressure from the IMF, the Belarussian government has revised its 1995 budget, projecting a deficit of 2.9 per cent of GDP, down 0.3 per cent from the original figure of 3.2 per cent. Belarus had originally been set a 1 July deadline by the IMF to meet its conditions for a US$300 million standby loan. The loan, approved in September, is to be used for balance of payments support and will be drawn down in five equal instalments.
<p>
Rolling heads department: Central Bank Chairman Stanislav Bogdankevich a known opponent of government plans for closer links with Russia, has been sacked by President Lukashenko. Former Deputy Chairman Nikolai Kuzmich is to take over as the bank's acting head.
<p>
The government has announced the proposed sale of over 1,000 collective enterprises during the latter part of 1995. Most are in the agricultural sector and employ over 35,000. Total value of the enterprises up for sale is US$430 million.
<p>
The US Trade and Development Agency is to grant US$750,000 towards the cost of a feasibility study for the establishment in Minsk of a diesel engine manufacturing plant. The balance of the cost - US$897,000 - is to be provided by potential partners in the venture - Navstar Detroit Diesel and Lam Technicon.

The Soros Foundation will no longer provide aid to Belarus as the government refuses to exempt it from taxes and import duties. The foundation had budgeted donations of US$5 million for Belarus in 1995.

economic union with Russia. Integration has been presented by the Lukeshenko administration as the only 
viable option for reversing the country's continued economic decline. <p>

<b>Ford</b> of the USA is proceeding with plans to establish a passenger vehicle assembly plant in 
Belarus. Production is expected to start in late 1996 or early 1997. <p>

<h3>GEORGIA</h3>
The lari, Georgia's new unit of currency, came into circulation on 26 September 1995 and became sole legal tender on 2 October 1995. The initial exchange rate for the lari is 1.3 to the dollar.
<p>
Following the 29 August assassination attempt on President Eduard Shevardnadze the commanding officer of Georgia's Alpha special security unit, Gela Papuashvili was arrested in late September. It was reported that explosives, detonators and timing devices had been found in the police chief's apartment. Later reports suggested that the attempt had been planned by former security minister Igor Georgadze with Russian support.

<p>
<h3>HUNGARY</h3>
In mid-September Hungary and the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) ended a round of talks without reaching agreement on new funding. Hungarian hopes were pinned on a US$300 million standby credit facility. Instead of agreeing to the loan the IMF warned that Hungary's indebtedness was increasing and that the government needed to do more to control its budget deficit, which had widened to a cumulative Ft206.2 billion by the end of July 1995. The government target for the end-year cumulative deficit is Ft156 billion.
<p>
Ministry of Agriculture officials are forecasting a US$1.5 billion surplus in agricultural trade for 1995. At the end of July the government approved the draw-down of a further US$55 million loan from the EBRD for the development of the agricultural sector. The 1995 budget originally allocated Ft35 billion to agricultural export subsidies. This figure was later augmented by an additional Ft1.4 billion. 
<p>
An impending strike by 55,000 electricity sector workers was called off in July. An innovative deal was struck whereby 5 per cent of revenues collected by privatising the MVM company would be set aside for retraining programmes for laid off workers. Electricity prices were due to be increased by 8 per cent on 1 September 1995, with a further increase of 18 per cent on 1 March 1996. Gas prices will also go up by 8 and 25 per cent on the same dates.
<p>
Hungary's Constitutional Court has ruled that some of Finance Minister Bokros' austerity measures are unconstitutional. Apart from yet more embarrassment for the hard pressed Horn administration (see below), the court's decision means the government has to find an additional Ft35 billion to cover a budget that is already starting to look optimistic. The austerity package was designed to reduce the budget deficit by Ft170 billion in total. Revised Ministry of Finance forecasts put the current account deficit at around 6 per cent, or US$3.2 billion, well up on the original forecast of US$2.5 billion but down on 1994's 8.5 per cent deficit. The increase in the deficit was attributed, by Finance Minister Bokros, to the weakening of the dollar. The Horn government appears to be targeting income tax as its immediate priority for increasing overall tax revenues. An already unhappy electorate are unlikely to welcome the proposed abolition of the zero tax rate for incomes up to Ft110,000. Equally unwelcome are proposed amendments in Hungary's record-breaking social security payments. At present, employers' contributions are 44 per cent of gross salary, employees' 14 per cent. Long term plans are to alter these to 30 and 14 per cent respectively.
<p>
Rolling heads: Minister of Trade and Industry Laszlo Pal was dismissed in July by Prime Minister Horn. The dismissal followed differences of opinion over the sale of electricity utilities to foreign investors. Mr Pal was replaced by his deputy, Imre Dunai. Mr Dunai immediately struck an upbeat note when addressing a meeting of the Hungarian Chambers of Commerce, claiming that capital investment had increased by 10 per cent in the first half of 1995, and that industrial production had increased by 9 per cent in the same period. (Central Statistical Office figures suggested a rise in industrial production of 7.4 per cent). Industrial exports were estimated to have risen by 30 per cent, those of machinery by 40 per cent. Plans have been announced by APV Rt, the Hungarian privatisation and holding company,  to sell a further 73 companies by the end of 1995. Companies for sale will include a hotel, bakeries, printing companies, building contractors and a financial training institute.
<p>
More rolling heads: Labour Minister Magda Kovacs Kosa tendered her resignation in October, agreeing to stay in the post until 30 November. Kosa resigned following a cabinet decision to extend the period of sick leave to be paid by an employer from 10 to 25 days.
<p>
Confusion still surrounds the privatisation plans for telecommunications giant MATAV. Press reports have suggested that the APV Rt privatisation agency has agreed to allow the US German MagyarCom consortium to increase its shareholding from the current 30.29 per cent to over 50 per cent. 
<p>
In the first four months of 1995, Hungary's imports grew at a staggering 18 per cent, to reach US$4,797 million dollars. Exports for the same period grew at a more modest 11 per cent, reaching US$3,252 million dollars, and leaving a trade gap of US$1,545 million. Exports to developed countries grew to over 71 per cent, of which 65 per cent was with EU countries, notably Germany. Figures for May showed some signs of improvement as the monthly current account deficit was cut from April's US$358 million to US$189 million.
<p>
Privatisation Minister Tamas Suchman has ruled out the possibility of foreign firms being able to purchase majority stakes in Hungarian energy utility MOL. The government plans to sell 50 per cent of the company through a public tender, 25 per cent is to be sold to the company's employees with 25 per cent being retained by the state. Newly appointed Industry and Trade Minister Imre Dunai optimistically forecast foreign investments of US$1 billion in the energy sector by the end of 1995. 
<p>
Hungary's largest bank, the Orszagos Takarekpenztar es Kereskedelmi Bank (OTP) has sold a 20 per cent equity stake through an issue of 5.6 million Global Depositary Receipts (GDR), each representing one ordinary share at a price of US$9.50 per GDR. The issue, which was managed by Schroders the UK merchant bank, together with Creditanstalt Securities Budapest of Austria, was only the second large privatisation to take place since Mr Horn's government took office in 1994. To the government's relief, the offer was over-subscribed, raising an estimated US$88.9 million, the country's largest capital transaction to date.
ING Bank of the Netherlands and the US based General Electric Capital Corporation have emerged as front runners in the bidding to buy the Budapest Bank. To date, only two banks, the Foreign Trade bank and the OTP Bank have been partially privatised.
<p>
The sale of a 28 per cent stake in Hungarian pharmaceutical company EGIS took place in August, the largest single transaction to date on the Budapest Stock Exchange. The shares were purchased by the UK's Natwest Securities. Reportedly, Natwest paid Ft2,560 each for 2.18 million shares, selling 20 per cent of its holding within 24 hours at a premium per share of Ft65. The Hungarian government also plans to sell a 19.5 per cent share in the country's largest pharmaceutical company Richter Gideon Rt. The government's share of the US$130.5 million company currently stands at 62.3 per cent following earlier disposals. 
<p>
British power company POWERGEN bought the Csepel Electricity Company for a reported US$13 million. 
<p>
Central Statistical Office figures show that 2,466 businesses with foreign participation opened in Hungary in 1994.
<p>
Revenues from privatisation for the first half of 1995 added up to Ft27 billion, of which Ft16 billion was in cash. Some Ft2.4 billion of the cash element represented foreign investments.
<p>
UK property consultants Healey and Baker have ranked Budapest sixth in the top 10 league of European industrial property growth. Healey and Baker's quarterly European Property Performance Index indicates that industrial rents have increased by 8.3 per cent in the past year.
<p>
Gyor based Graboplast is to receive an equity injection from the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The EBRD has purchased 300,000 shares, corresponding to 9.2 per cent of the company's equity.
<p>
Agrobank, the troubled commercial bank which lost its senior management in June (see Business Europa issue 12), is to merge with Mezobank. The managing director of the merged banks is Istvan Bakos.
<p>
UK retailer Marks and Spencer is to open a new store on Budapest's Vaci ut. The M & S stores in Budapest are operated on a seven-year franchise basis by S-Modell Trading Rt a subsidiary of Skala-Coop Rt. The new shop will concentrate on women's apparel and lingerie. 
<p>
Insurance company Gloria Biztosito has sold the 51 per cent of its shares held by Il mare Assicurazioni SpA and Hungarian Mezobank to Swiss Life.
<p>
UK supermarket group TESCO has purchased a 28,000 square metre site on Budapest's Pesti ut in the 17th district. The site will be used for the construction of a 4,000 square metre supermarket site, the company's first in Budapest. 
<p>
The OECD on Hungary
The latest Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) survey on Hungary, published mid-September, concludes on a guarded, but somewhat optimistic note concerning the future. The current government has `shown its political determination to come to grips finally with the key macroeconomic imbalances' with its March 1995 policy measures, the report states in its final paragraph. `If the 1995 budget is held on course . . . and reinforced by further consolidation over the medium term, the Hungarian economy should once again justify the optimism in which it was previously held.' <br>This despite the authors citing numerous instances in the recent past when various stringent policies have been introduced at or beyond the 11th hour, only to be quietly eased after a public furore, thus much diluting their effect.<br>Indeed the essential message of this very readable 195 page report, which succinctly analyses the period from 1993 to mid-1995, is a story of seemingly strong measures applied too late in the day which are then regularly side-stepped by the worst offenders, who too often have the political clout to gain exceptional treatment. <br>This pattern applies to almost every aspect of economic policy, whether it be government spending, subsidies, the bankruptcy law, banks or the tax regime, according to the authors.
The report details failings and gives limited praise to improvements made in all aspects of economic policy. In particular recommendations are made in the following areas: fiscal and monetary policy, the banking system, subsidies, specific measures to improve the supply side of the economy, and privatisation.<p>
Among the numerous recommendations, the report notes:
The National Bank of Hungary (NBH) must be able to raise interest rates to whatever level is necessary to defend the exchange rate and prevent the onset of endemic inflation. The contradictory forces at work in the monetary system highlight the need for a centralised Treasury to manage cash flow.<br>
Allowing a period of high inflation to reduce real levels of debt, never officially advocated, but hinted at in some high circles, would in the medium and long term be counter-productive. Hungary's foreign debt cannot be reduced by increased monetisation and inflation, the authors warn.<p>
Hungary faces a debt trap and steadily rising interest payments. Fiscal adjustment to attain a moderate primary surplus is thus clearly called for. It is also necessary to achieve a sustainable current account by increasing domestic savings, and to preserve investor confidence and ensure gains in competitiveness from devaluations do not evaporate in higher inflation. This is most easily achieved by concentrating policy deliberations on the budget deficit, rather than the current account.<p>
Wage restraint in the budget sector is crucial in the fiscal consolidation foreseen for 1995. Broader administrative reform may be necessary beyond 1995 when it may prove difficult to maintain the compression of budget sector wages.<p>
Reform of the family allowance system, now taking effect, is welcome. However, the new targeted family support system may prove difficult to implement and be inefficient. Age structure assessment of the household, as is done in most OECD countries, might prove more efficient.<p>
Reform of the pension and health system to remain a key priority. Much more needs to be done to remove costly abuses of disability pensions and extended sick leave.
Short term prospects depend on the implementation of the March austerity package. If fully implemented, foreign investor confidence should be maintained, and foreign debt repayments of US$3bn to be rolled over, and the current account deficit to be financed.<br>
The consolidated budget deficit is larger than normally believed, especially when privatisation receipts are treated as financing rather than current revenues, and all fiscal entities such as the railways are considered. This represents a serious drain on domestic savings, and has contributed much more to stimulation of consumption than indicated.<<p>
The report has already stirred a reaction in some government circles, who disagree with its assertion that Hungary has lost its leading position among the economies in transition in the eyes of many western experts.
<p>
Little doubt though, that many of the conclusions must be sweet music to the ears of Finance Minister Bokros and NBH President Suranyi, who are no doubt now learning much of it by heart as additional ammunition to do battle with the left at future government meetings.

<h3>LATVIA</h3>

Final figures for the September/October parliamentary elections were: Democratic Party (18 seats), Alliance Latvia's Way (17 seats) and People's Movement for Latvia (Siegerist's Party) (16 seats). President Ulmanis has held talks with all parties and will not announce the name of the prime minister until 7 November at the earliest.
<p>
Failed Bank Baltija was officially declared bankrupt at the end of June. The bank was reported to owe US$32 million to other Latvian banks and over US$90 million to foreign banks. The bank's collapse prompted the government to introduce three draft banking laws in mid-July. The legislative package includes a deposit insurance scheme, rules on the recovery and the bankruptcy of commercial banks and a new law governing the establishment and activities of commercial banks. The insurance of individuals' deposits will now be obligatory for all commercial banks (except foreign banks) operating in Latvia. In the past year 12 banks have been declared insolvent in Latvia, three have been banned from trading and two have been declared bankrupt at the request of the Bank of Latvia.
<p>
Baltic International's apparently successful bid to purchase a controlling interest in Latavio Latvia's state airline has run into difficulties. Latavio was to be restructured in partnership with Scandinavian Airlines - SAS but the deal has been set back by a claim from failed Bank Baltija for the repayment of a debt of US$18 million. As a result of the Bank's claim, the Latvian Economic Court has frozen all the airline's bank accounts. To make matters worse, Latavio's employees have objected to the privatisation, passing a vote of no-confidence in the airline's new board and writing to President Ulmanis asking him to suspend the airline's privatisation.
<p>
Latvia's exports increased by 32.6 per cent in the first five months of 1995. But a 34.2 per cent increase in imports over the same period caused the country's trade gap to widen by 1.5 per cent, from 27.5 per cent to 29 per cent.
<p>
Unemployment at the end of June 1995 was 6.1 per cent, with a total of 77,874 registered unemployed according to the State Statistics Committee.
<p>
In the second round of privatisation held in June, 5,120,279 shares in 13 state-run enterprises were offered by the Latvian Privatisation Agency. 3,626,049 were bought by individuals, 1,456,184 by companies or institutions.
<p>
The Rural credit state stock company Laukkredits is to merge with the Hipoteku un Zemes banka (Mortgage and Land Bank. The move increases the Mortgage Bank's registered capital from Lats1.20 million to Lats1.43 million.
<p>
25 July saw the opening of the Riga Stock Exchange (RSE). The RSE will be the officially appointed auction agent in the State Privatisation Programme which will bring over 150 companies to the market over the next two years.

<h3>LITHUANIA</h3>

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) awarded Lithuania a loan of US$15 million (SDR10.35 million) in September. This brings to a total of SDR134.55 the loans granted to Lithuania by the IMF in the past three years.
<p>
Rolling heads department: Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius demanded in June the resignation of Economics Minister Aleksandras Vasiliaukas formerly responsible for Lithuania's lethargic privatisation programme. It seems that Mr Slezevicius had run out of patience at the snail's pace progress of the privatisation legislation through parliament. Mr Vasiliaukas had barely held the position for a year.
<p>
The Innovation Bank and the Litimpex Bank are planning to merge into the United Bank of Lithuania before the end of 1995.
<p>
Lithuania's unemployment rate rose to 5.9 per cent in June, well up on the June 1994 figure of 3.2 per cent.

End June inflation was 1 per cent, its lowest level since independence. For the first six months of 1995 the annual inflation rate was 16.7 per cent, down on 1994's 23 per cent.
At the end of June the Bank of Lithuania appointed an administrator to oversee the affairs of the troubled Aurabank.
<p>
Bitor Europe Ltd, a subsidiary of Venezuela's Petroven has signed a contract with the Lithuanian State Energy Co for the supply of 25,000 tonnes in 1995 of orimulcion fuel. The quantity is set to rise to an annual figure of 550,000 tonnes per year by the end of the decade as orimulcion becomes Lithuania's principal fuel.

<h3>MACEDONIA</h3>
President Kiro Gligorov  was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in early October, losing an arm and being partially blinded. Parliamentary Speaker Stojan Andov was appointed acting President.
<p>
The assassination attempt was seen by many as related to the agreement signed in New York on 13 September 1995 which went some way to normalising Macedonia's relations with Greece (although the dispute over the country's name is to be further discussed. Macedonia now has its own flag, carrying a rising sun motif curiously similar to that of Japan. The agreement should result in increased trade with Greece and, crucially, restores Macedonian access to its main sea port, Thessaloniki; sanctions against Serbia remain a problem.
<p>
Macedonian exports dropped dramatically in the first quarter of 1995. According to official figures `black' exports remained buoyant, however.

Macedonian officials were meeting with the Paris Club in July to discuss rescheduling Macedonia's debt. At the end of 1994 Macedonia owed some US$258 million to Paris Club members and a further US$1.1 billion to the so-called London Club of commercial creditors.
<p>
According to the Macedonian Privatisation Agency 130 companies have now been privatised, with a further 462 privatisations approved and due to be completed within a matter of months. 58.4 per cent have been privatised through employee buy-outs, 12 per cent through management buy-outs. At the end of June total revenue from privatisations was DM13.5 million.
<p>
A lot of rolling heads department: Macedonia's Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski hinted at suspicions of corruption when, in July, he replaced six senior government officials - the directors of the public revenue administration and the directorate for legal and property affairs; the under-secretary for economic relations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the under-secretary for Civil Engineering at the Ministry of Urban Planning and Environment and the chief market and labour inspectors.
<p>
Macedonia's mix
The former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia is a concoction of ethnic groups. After the majority Slav-speaking Macedonians, the main ones are Albanians, Turks, Rhomas (Gypsies), Vlachs and Serbs. Not for nothing is the term `Macedonian Salad' used to describe a hotchpotch of ingredients. Now some spice has been added to the dish - Egyptians.
`Most of us 3,000 Macedonian Egyptians are located in the south, around Lake Ohrid', says Usni Zemoski, 48 and a civil engineer. `But in Kosovo ther are 300,000 and in Albania there are 400,000.
His numbers of `Egyptians' are delivered in a sincere voice as we sit on a cafe terrace in the warm winter sunshine overlooking the southern lakeside city of Ohrid. Zemoski claims to be a direct descended of the original settlers in the Lake Ohrid area 4,000 years ago. For 20 years he has pressed for greater rights for Egyptian descendants and is a member of the Egipcani Association. His favourite phrase is `we have documents to prove this'.<br>
Unlike other ethnic groups in the country of two million people, these `Egyptians' are not linguistically distinct. `Not one of us speaks Egyptian or Arabic', he says. `Mostly, we speak Macedonian and Albanian. We aren't recognised as a distinct group by our governments but we are pressing for this'.<br>
Not many of the `Egyptians' can say they have seen Egypt, according to Zemoski. So a few years ago a little bit of Egypt came to see them, in the shape of the Egyptian ambassador in Belgrade. `We have had many contacts with the embassy.' he says, `It will be a happy day for us when Egypt recognises Macedonia'.
While the Greeks and the Macedonians fight over the who, when and where of the name Macedonia, Zemoski says he has the real answer: `An ancient Egyptian pharaoh sent one of his sons to rule this area. The son was called Makedon'.<p>
What exactly does the Egipcani Association want from the central government in Skopje? `We want official recognition as an ethnic group', he says. `We met with the heads of radio and TV and proposed several hours a week of programming dedicated to Egyptian history and topics.' The response, he says, was `positive'. `After all, the Albanians, Turks and Rhomas have their programmes'.<p>
Zemoski's struggle is peaceful. Militancy is not on their agenda, he says. `There is no hostility to us from other Macedonians.' Indeed, Zemoski's sincere and serious attitude to the subject of `Egyptian Macedonians' makes people of all other ethnic groups sceptical and they often smile at the mention of `Egyptians'. Later, and out of earshot of our departing guest, my Macedonian friends finally breaks into laughter. `Let's face it', she says, `they are really just upper class Rhomas!'

<h3>MOLDOVA</h3>
A three day investment forum - Moldova, Open to the World opened in Chisinau on 20 September. The forum was attended by an impressive 200 delegates from more than 20 countries. (Sadly, the Moldovan government forgot to invite the international press). Total foreign investment in Moldova has yet to reach the US$100 million mark.
<p>
Major General Valery Yevnevich, new commander of the Russian forces occupying the breakaway Trans Dniestr region got off to an unpromising start when he arrived in Moldova. Supporters of his predecessor, presidential wannabee Alexander Lebed blocked the runway at Tiraspol, Trans Dniestr capital, in protest at Lebed's sacking. The protesters, mostly women, surrounded Yevnevich's garrison quarters, eventually obliging him to beat a retreat to Moscow for consultations.
<p>
Moldova is set to become a grain exporter according to the Minister of Agriculture. This year's bumper harvest will allow exports of between 250,000 and 300,000 tonnes. In recent years Moldova has had to import up to 550,000 tonnes of grain.

Bread rationing was introduced in Tiraspol, capital of the Transdniestr region, on 24 August. Each citizen has a daily allowance of 500 grams. Bread can still be bought without rationing in the region's private bakeries, but at three times the cost of subsidised - and rationed - bread.
<p>
Moldova's industrial production increased by 9.4 per cent from May to June 1995, but remained a depressing 9.3 per cent lower than at the same point in 1994. Accurate GDP figures are not readily available in Moldova: however the country's Net Material Product (NMP) the communist measure that does not include the service sector, was down 15 per cent over the year.
<p>
The London office of US securities brokerage Merrill Lynch is reported to have expressed an interest in buying Moldovan Treasury Bonds to the value of US$50 million.
<p>
Monthly consumer price inflation dropped to 0.2 per cent in June 1995.
<p>
Privatisation Minister Ceslav Ciobanu announced that between 75-80 per cent of the National Patrimonial Bonds are likely to be used by individual purchasers. An estimated 30 per cent of the bonds remain in private hands, the balance invested in privatisation investment foundations (PIFs).
<p>
Varo Inform a Chisinau based advertising and information agency, has published Directory '95  containing information on 2,500 Moldovan enterprises.
<p>
Harsh commercial realities are being felt in Moldova, not least at the Chisinau Tractor Factory which in August refused to fulfil an order for Uzbekistan agreed between the countries' presidents. The `tractors for cotton' deal fell over because the tractor factory's management refused to sell the tractors at the stipulated unit price of US$7,800, saying that each unit cost US$10.500 to produce. (See Eyewitness Moldova).

<h3>POLAND</h3>
Poland's inflation rate for 1995 is forecast at 25.6 per cent by the Institute of Market Studies and at 22 per cent by the Central Office of Planning, who also foresee a 6 per cent growth in GDP for the year. The free market Gdansk Institute for Market Economics calculated growth in the first quarter of 1995 at 7 per cent. Paris based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that Poland's 1995 GDP growth will be 5.5 per cent, followed by a respectable 5 per cent in 1996. <br>This would make Poland the region's fastest growing economy, ahead of the Czech and Slovak Republics. Meanwhile, year-on-year inflation rates at the mid-year point stood at 32.4 per cent, although government austerity measures were forecast to bring down the rate over the second half of the year. June's monthly inflation rate was 0.9 per cent, half that of May.
<p>
Central Statistical Office (GUS) figures indicate that real wages rose by 1.2 per cent in the first quarter of 1995 in comparison with the same period of 1994. GUS figures give an average monthly gross wage of Zl670 (US$290), a 43.8 per cent increase over 1994.

Total reserves in the Polish banking system at the end of the first quarter of 1995 amounted to US$13.1 billion, an increase of US$1.8 billion over the end December 1994 figure.
<p>
Central Bank President Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz has formally entered the presidential race. Polls put her well behind the leading candidate, Aleksander Kwasniewski.
<p>
Poland's Central Planning Office (CUP) has come up with some sobering thoughts on the future of Poland's foreign debt, which totalled US$39.3 billion at the end of 1994. During 1996-97 the CUP estimates the annual cost of servicing the borrowing will be US$2.5 - US$3.0 billion, rising to US$4.5 billion after the year 2000. That's the good news. The worst period will be the years 2005-2008 when the annual costs will rise to US$6 billion. Phew!
<p>
Foreign investment in Poland for the first half of 1995 increased by US$1 billion, and now totals over US$5 billion. US companies top the list, with US$1.7 billion, followed by multi-nationals with US$872 million, and German companies in third place, with US$512 million invested.
<p>
The good news: July saw the go-ahead for the transfer of shares in 400 enterprises to the 15 National Investment Funds (NIFs) created to manage them. At the 11th hour 12 companies were withdrawn from the sale because they were bankrupt or holding insolvency discussions with their bankers. Joint foreign and Polish teams have been appointed to run the NIFs, which will control assets of over US$2,6 billion.
The first stage in the process was the transfer of controlling stakes in 28 companies, and minority stakes in a further 400 or so, to the NIFs, as the government handed over 60 per cent of its stock to the NIFs. A further 15 per cent is to be distributed free to the enterprises' employees with another 15 per cent being allocated to pensioners and social funds. The government will retain a 10 per cent stake. By the end of 1995 a further 300 companies are to be added to the NIFs portfolio.
<p>
At the end of September, the Polish government added another 101 state-owned enterprises to the Mass Privatisation Programme, bringing to 514 the total number of state enterprises being sold off through the NIFs.
<p>
The bad news: with admirable timing, the Sejm also approved the new Law on Commercialisation and Privatisation of State Enterprises. The new law removes any time constraints on the transition of state enterprises from Treasury-owned joint stock companies to genuinely private concerns. The new law is seen by many as a retrograde step vesting the responsibility and authority for transformation in the hands of the individual ministries. So much so that President Lech Walesa attempted to veto the legislation, but the move was overturned by parliament, by the narrowest of margins (three votes). Opposition leaders have joined forces with the president, claiming that the legislation, if introduced, will slow privatisation, centralise economic decision making, and act as an invitation to control by the government's supporters. By the end of July, the Solidarity trade union was contemplating calling a strike of its 1.5 million members to register their protest at the new legislation. 
<p>
More good news: Poland looks like becoming a net food exporter by the end of 1995 if exports to the CIS countries hold up over the second half of 1995. During the first three months of 1995 agricultural exports rose by 6 per cent. 
<p>
And even more good news: unemployment in August fell to 2.67 million, just over 15 per cent. The fall came after two months of rising unemployment figures. Labour Minister Leszek Miller forecast that the rate would continue to decline in September and October.
<p>
Polish State Railways (PKP) has, since 1990, reduced its payroll by almost half, to 246,000. Subsidies have been reduced from 18.7 per cent of the budget in 1990 to 13.4 per cent at the end of 1994. This compares favourably with Austria's 45.2 per cent and the UK's 18 per cent. 51 per cent of all goods in Poland are moved by rail. 
<p>
Too good to be true, news: in September the National Bank of Poland (NBP) cut its Lombard and discount base rates by a further two points to between 25 and 29 per cent. The reverse repo rate was also lowered. 
<p>
US investment banker JP Morgan acted as lead manager in Poland's return to the international bond market. High demand meant that the issue was raised from US$200 to US$250 million. The bond pays a fixed coupon at six-monthly intervals. 
<p>
The Koreans are coming: on 16 August Korean carmaker Daewoo announced that it had signed a memorandum of understanding to begin immediate negotiations with the Polish government to acquire a 60 per cent stake in FSO  the state-owned car manufacturer. At the time Daewoo announced plans to assemble its Nexia saloons in Lublin, with production rising to 50,000 per year by the end of the century.
Daewoo's announcement caused consternation at General Motors. GM has been in talks with FSO for some years, but to date the only concrete result has been the assembly of Opel Astras using CKD kits supplied by GM's German plant. Watch this space.
<p>
Daewoo has also initialled an agreement with the Polish government whereby it will take a 61 per cent stake in a joint venture with state owned Fabryka Samochodow w Lublinie. Daewoo will invest US$340 million over a five year period. The plant will build 90,000 passenger cars per year. Daewoo recently signed an agreement with Romania's Oltcit manufacturer (see Business Europa issue 13). 
<p>
Moody's Interbank Credit Service, the bank rating agency, has granted a non-investment grade Ba2 rating to long term deposits with the Bank Rozwoju Eksportu. Moodys also gave a Ba2 long term deposit rating to Krakow based Bank Przemyslowo- Handlowy.

Poland's Industrial Development Agency - Agencja Rozwoju Przemyslu (ARP) saw revenues drop by 8 per cent to Zl183 million (US$78 million) in 1994, although profits rose by 3 per cent to Zl27 million (US$11.5 million). Established in 1991, the ARP has restructured some 400 companies. In 1994 35 loans totalling US$9 million were made, with US$4.2 million invested as equity in new companies. 
<p>
German Chancellor Kohl's state visit to Poland was seen by many as a celebration of Germany's predominant role in Polish business. There are an estimated 6,500 German firms doing business in Poland, around 36 per cent of the total number of registered businesses. Germany is the second largest investor in Poland; major investors include Siemens and Commerzbank. 
<p>
Nestl‚ of Switzerland has purchased a 45 per cent stake in Winiary Poland's largest producer of powdered soups and deserts. 55 per cent of Winiary's equity was sold for US$75 million, the balance being purchased by Bank handlowy. A further 20 per cent of the shares are to be offered to employees, and 20 per cent to agricultural suppliers.
<p>
Gazeta Bankowa has produced its 1994 bank ratings, putting Citibank at the top of a controversial list, and dropping Bank Handlowy from its 1993 number one position down to sixth. Second in the ranking came Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy followed by Katowice-based Bank Slaski whose share offering caused some palpitations on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in late 1993 and early 1994. See table below for full listing based on the Gazeta's jury ratings.

National Bank of Poland President Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz granted a licence to Germany's Deutsche Bank to conduct banking and foreign exchange operations. Deutsche Bank Polska, with a start-up capital of Zl20 million, is to bail out ailing Warsaw based Prosper Bank through the purchase of Prosper Bank bonds.
<p>
Lodz city council has approved a US$20 million project whereby US Polish Genesis Hotels Co Inc are to build an hotel and business centre. The company also plans to build hotels in Poznan, Szczecin and Wroclaw.
<p>
UK-based David S. Smith paper manufacturing group have paid US$15 million for a controlling interest in Kieleckie Zaklady Wyrobow Papierowych SA (KZWP). David S. Smith has committed itself to a US$12 million investment programme and has agreed not to reduce the payroll during a 27 month period. The International Paper Group of the USA has invested over US$290 million in Zaklady Celulozowo- Papiernicze mill, in which it owns an 80 per cent interest.

Krakow will shortly have a new bank; Malopolski Bank Regionaly is to open in the autumn with Zl300 million share capital (US$12.8 million). Bank Gospodarski Zywnosciowej is a major shareholder.
<p>
Sweden's SKF has paid US$6 million for 80 per cent of Polish roller bearings factory Fabryka Lozysk Tocznych. The company employs 1,300 people and had sales of US$12.7 million in 1994.
<p>
Poland is to grant three licences to cellular telephone operators - two by the end of 1995 and one in 1996. Tenders are to be invited for a Global Mobile System (GSM) operation in September 1995. At present Poland has only one cellular telephone operator, Centertel which uses an older, analog, system.
<p>

THE CHURCH, THE CANDIDATE AND THE CONFLICT
The first round of the presidential election went, predictably  - to former communist SLD candidate Alexandr Kwasniewski. The 41-year-old Kwasniewski had held a lead in the polls for some time, although this had been eroded in a late surge from incumbent Lech Walesa. Walesa's prospects had not been helped by the fragmentation of the non-communist vote following the entry into the race of Central Bank governor Hannah Gronkiewicz-Waltz and former Solidarity labour minister Jacek Kuron. His prospects in the 19 November run-off against Kwasniewski will depend on the number of his non-communist rivals' supporters that switch to him. At that stage, though, the issues become less straightforward. <br>Walesa has not been the most popular President, least of all among his former solidarity supporters. But better the devil you know. For Poland's Roman Catholic hierarchy, Kwasniewski and his SLD party have certainly become the devil they don't want to know. Ninety per cent of Poles are Catholics, so the church's opinion is not insignificant. In September Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek urged Catholics to vote against Kwasniewski. Later, Archbishop Tokeureuk went further, attacking government (i.e. SLD) policy for `conducting an open front battle against workers, the retired and the disabled and with the Church'.<p>
The Church's attacks brought immediate protests from Prime Minister Oleszky, who accused the Church of `creating a conflict between government and people.' While this was good news for the Walesa campaign managers, the Catholic bishops significantly omitted to endorse the Walesa candidacy. The Church's opposition seems to have had a negligible effect in the first round of voting.<br> Kwasniewski is more than a youthful, photogenic, well-tailored politician. He is a shrewd politician, very much the `eminence grise' behind the ruling coalition government. He has managed to retain the support of the communists - even the old-school die-hards, while attracting significant support from the younger voters, for many of whom these are their first Presidential elections. He also appears to have cast aside the stigma of having held ministerial office in Poland's last communist government, headed by Mieczyslaw Rakowski.<br>The image today seems to draw on early Fran‡ois Mitterand and Felipe Gonzalez; although Kwasniewski's suits would put either to shame.<br> Walesa fought his rear-guard action by presenting the electorate's choice in the 19 November run-off as a stark choice between building a free market economy, integrated into Europe or returning to a disguised communist rule. There is no doubt that the business community's sympathies do not lie with Kwasniewski. <p>The political uncertainty surrounding his election performance has led to unease in the business community: in October the Warsaw Stock Exchange registered a 10 per cent drop as investors anticipated his victory.<p>
Meanwhile, Kwasniewski and his electoral team have gone to great lengths to reassure the business community, with promises to guarantee the independence of the Central Bank, and not to raise taxes. But as one Warsaw banker observed: `They would, wouldn't they.'

<h3>ROMANIA</h3>
Inflation for the first four months of 1995 was 1.5 per cent, the lowest figure since the liberalisation of prices in 1991 and well down on the 1994 figure of 6.3 per cent. However, fuel price increases look like pushing the rate up to around the 3.5 per cent mark.
<p>
Ministry of Labour figures put unemployment at 10.9 per cent at the end of March 1995.
<p>
In April 1995 the net nominal average salary was Lei199,030 (US$103) up on March's figure of Lei182,803. Employees in the banking sector had the highest monthly average net wage of around Lei524,000 (US$ 272.00). Lowest wages were found in the catering sector, with an average of Lei147,000 (US$77.00).
<p>
The Romanian Stock Exchange opened in June after a gap of 50 years. Operations are not due to start until the autumn. Housed in the National Bank of Romania building, the RSE is headed up by Stere Farmache of the Securities Commission.
<p>
Romania is expecting a good harvest this year. Wheat crops are expected to be around 7.835 million tonnes, an increase of over one million tonnes. Barley and maize are also expected to show gains. 
Brasov-based Intreprinderea Aeronautica Romana (IAR) is to manufacture 96 AH-1F Cobra helicopters under licence from Bell Helicopters of the USA. Bell is considering licensing IAR to produce the Cobra for export to other former Warsaw Pact countries.
<p>
The National Bank of Romania (NBR) signed a US$150 million syndicated loan at the beginning of June. Arranged by the London office of Citibank the loan was increased from its original figure of US$75 million after being heavily oversubscribed. The NBR will pay a group of 32 international banks a margin of 275 basis points over the London interbank rate.
<p>
Romania's budget deficit widened to Lei255.2 billion at the end of April, an increase of Lei38.5 billion over the March figure, according to figures issued by the National Statistics Board. The 1995 Budget Bill fixed a budget deficit of Lei1.93 trillion.
<p>
Romania's current account deficit for the period January-May 1995 was US$670 million, largely created by a negative trade balance of US$637 million. Although exports increased by 22.5 per cent during the first quarter, imports soared by 39.1 per cent. April's figures maintained the trend, with exports up 25 per cent over the March figure, at US$629.5 million although imports slackened a little, down by 6.6 per cent over March at US$732.7 million.
<p>
Romania's industrial output in the first quarter of 1995 registered an increase of 10.2 per cent over the same period on 1994. The manufacturing sector posted the highest gains with an increase of 13.1 per cent. The April 1995 figure showed a 6.5 per cent increase over March.
<p>
Total foreign investment in Romania by mid-May 1995 was US$1.339 billion, an increase of US$67.4 million since the beginning of 1995. Principal investing countries were Korea (US$158 million, the USA (US$122.3 million), and Germany (US$117.6 million). The five largest foreign investors are: Shell, Stima Engineering, AMOCO, Enterprise Oil and Coca Cola. 
<p>
Romanian-French bilateral trade in 1994 totalled US$677.3 million, of which Romanian imports were US$315 million. With US$105.7 million invested, France is the fourth largest investor in Romania. 
<p>
A satellite telephone link in Bucharest failed in late July, cutting off millions of homes and businesses. Engineers from Germany's Siemens were flown in to deal with the crisis, which reduced outgoing traffic to 20 per cent of normal levels, and incoming calls to 50 per cent.

<h3>RUSSIA</h3>
Russia's 1996 budget deficit is forecast to drop to 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), down from  the 1995 forecast figure of 4.9 per cent. 
<p>
Russia's financial markets came to a halt in August when a credit crunch forced interest rates as high as 1,000 per cent. The Central Bank was forced to provide the commercial banking sector with around 300 billion roubles (US$65 million) in short term credits to solve a liquidity crisis which left a number of banks unable to meet their obligations. The credit crunch was attributed to the tight grip exercised by the Central Bank - under the direction of now acting head Tatyana Paramonova. The bank had moved to stop rouble speculation through the imposition of a rouble corridor allowing the rouble to fluctuate between 4,300 and 4,900 to the dollar.
<p>
The American Templeton Russia Fund (TRF) has become the first US investment fund exclusively geared to investments in Russia to trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
<p>
A reported 35 per cent of national carrier Aeroflot's fleet is out of action due to a lack of spare parts. Part of the problem is the high prices charged by Russian monopoly engine and spare part suppliers. The government has reportedly allocated US$110 million for improvements to Moscow's airports, but officials estimate that US$1.5 billion is needed to bring the city's four airports up to international standards.
<p>
A report produced by Moscow's Analytical Department of Police and Parliamentary Committee on Security provides a helpful guide to the going rate in the capital for various kinds of inducements, sweeteners or consultancy fees - oh, alright, bribes - to officials. These are:
<p>
Traffic policeman (for overlooking offence) US$6.00.<br>
District Housing Administrator (for finding your file) US$40.<br>
City Official (for doing something about your file): US$400.<br>
Senior Police Office (for losing your file): US$ 2,000.
Senior Ministry Official (for ignoring your file): US$3,000.<br>
Top State Officials (for designing your file): a Mercedes 300SL, or: BMW 7 Series (with smoked glass), or: a villa in Florida (must have air conditioning), or: an antique sword, or: a diamond ring, or: an English language course at Oxford for their children.
A recent test of police honesty found that only two officers out of 24 refused a bribe.
<p>

Khlebny Dom (House of Bread), St Petersburg's largest chain of bakers with 4,500 branches, launched the city's first public share offer at the end of August. The offer is aimed at individual Russian investors, with a minimum purchase of R11,250 (US$2.50). The lead managers for the offer Lenstroimateriali, St Petersburg's largest broker, hopes to raise R15.55 billion (US$3.45 million) from the offer. Lenstroimateriali are being advised by a group of foreign banks, funded by the UK's Know How Fund and led by Kleinwort Benson.
<p>
US petroleum giant Mobil is to open up to 50 petrol stations over a five year period under a joint venture with the Russian Balcar crude oil trading group. Mobil is to invest US$30 million in the project.
<p>
LUKoil Russia's largest oil company has accepted a bid by Atlantic Richfield (ARCO) of the US for an equity stake. ARCO has agreed to pay a fixed sum of US$250 million for its stake. The ARCO bid will give it between 4.5 and 6 per cent of LUKoil.
<p>
Vladimir Tokarev, General Director of Khantymansiyskneftegasgeologia (which surely qualifies for the longest one-word corporate name) has accused Shell and Amoco of delays in developing the West Salym and Priobskoye fields in Siberia. Officials from the two companies put the delays down to the lack of a legal framework to guarantee long term stability of the project.<p>
A World Bank report puts the number of Russians living below the poverty line at 30 per cent of the population. A 43 per cent fall in average incomes between 1991 and 1993, combined with price liberalisation has meant that an increasing number of people cannot afford the minimum subsistence basket, estimated at US$30 per month in November 1994.

Take my chevvy, Lev. US automobile giant General Motors is to begin assembly of the Chevrolet Blazer in Yelabuga, Tartarstan in the spring of 1996. An eventual annual output of 50,000 vehicles is projected. 
<p>
Export tariffs on a number of commodities have been reduced by 30 per cent. The move is designed to help exporters overcome the adverse effects of the appreciation of the rouble. The lost revenue is to be replaced by increased taxes on Gazprom. The duty on natural gas is to be raised by 10 per cent, from 25 to 35 per cent, an increase expected to produce an additional US$750 million in revenue.
<p>
Deputy Agriculture Minister Magomedtagir Abdulbasirov announced in late August that the 1995 grain harvest could fall to 67-69 million tonnes. The 1994 figure was 81.3 million tonnes. Grain reserves are put at 15 million tonnes. Andrei Sizov of agricultural analysts SovEcon forecast minimum imports of 10 million tonnes in 1995-96 to avoid livestock slaughter.

<h3>SERBIA & MONTENEGRO</h3>

In late March the Serbian government was obliged to shore up the dinar by denying rumours of an 
imminent devaluation. The dinar, introduced in January 1994, is officially pegged at DM1, but in March 
dropped to a rate of 4.5 to the DM, subsequently stabilising at 2.6 to the DM. <b>Central Bank</b> 
governor Dragoslav Avramovic claimed that there had been no change in the government's tight monetary 
policy.

<h3>SLOVAKIA</h3>
Mystery still surrounds the 31 August kidnapping of Michal Kovac Jr, son of President Michal Kovac. Kovac Junior's car was stopped, he was later found in the car's boot outside a police station in Austria. Kovac Jr is detained in Austria pending enquiries relating to a suspected fraud in Germany dating back to 1992. Suspicion is rife in Bratislava that the Slovak Intelligence Service (SIS) were involved in the kidnapping. 
<p>
Slovakia's privatisation agency the National Property Fund (NPF) has sold its 15.2 per cent stake in Kosice based steel maker VSZ. The shares have been purchased by employee-owned Ferrimex sro. The purchase price was Sk502.5 million. Earlier this year VSZ's senior management departed (see Business Europa issue 13). 
<p>
Finance Minister Sergej Kozlik forecasts a 5 per cent growth in GDP in 1996 with a budget deficit of 1.5 per cent of GDP. The government expects unemployment will fall to 13 per cent in 1996, with annual inflation dropping below the 10 per cent figure.
<p>
`Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me. . .' unless I'm German. A dispute over the Slovak term for Germany has resulted in the latter taking umbrage and refusing to sign seven bilateral treaties with Slovakia. It seems that the Germans were happy with `Spolkova Republika Nemecko', the Slovak term for German Federal Republic. This, though, turned out to be grammatically incorrect, according to Bratislava's Ludovit Stur Institute responsible for maintaining Slovakia's linguistic purity. The Germans, though, don't like the grammatically acceptable `Nemecka Spolkova Republika, claiming it to be a cold-war term.' Good to know that while Bosnia burns, diplomats have got more important things to worry about.
<p>
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is paying the National Property Fund US$59 million for a 10.5 per cent share in petrochemical group Slovnaft, making it the company's biggest foreign shareholder. Slovintegra  a company set up by Slovnaft employees, has acquired a 39 per cent stake in the company for US$138 million.
<p>
Power company Slovenske Elektrarne is to issue five-year bonds totalling Sk1.5 billion following the deal's approval by the National property Fund in July.
<p>
Whatever else happens, the Mochovce nuclear plant is certain to claim a record for the longest construction period. Started before the fall of the wall, work on the plant has been on hold since 1990. Discussions over financing the project with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have been abandoned. Contractor Electricit‚ de France has seen its tender offer sidelined (and has withdrawn its staff) as the Slovak government seeks ways of making the plant affordable, probably by striking a deal with Skoda Praha of the Czech Republic, who are interested in the US$1 billion plus contract. In July the German contractor Bayernwerk announced that it was withdrawing from the contract. Economics Minister Jan Ducky announced at the end of July that Russia is prepared to provide Slovakia with a US$150 million loan to assist with the completion of the plant. But read the small print: only 30 per cent of the amount would be made available in cash. The rest in a predictable combination of `expert' consultation and `documentation' and the supply of nuclear fuel.  
<p>
Vseobecna Uverova Banka, Slovakia's largest bank, plans to open offices in London, Frankfurt and Zurich, according to incoming bank president Jan Gabriel. 
<p>
Citibank and Bank Austria are to open subsidiaries in Bratislava in late 1995. 
<p>
A new state holding company grouping Slovakia's arms manufacturers is to be established at the beginning of September based in Trencin. Slovakia's arms industry has been hard hit by the end of the cold war. The former arsenal of the Warsaw-pact countries has seen sales fall to less than 10 per cent of former levels, with unemployment in the industry averaging 22 per cent.
<p>
The National Bank of Slovakia has received a loan of Ecu50 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB).

<h3>SLOVENIA</h3>

The tolar was due to become convertible in international transactions from 1 September 1995, on the recommendation of the central bank Banka Slovenije. The convertibility was attributed by the bank to Slovenia's declining inflation rate.
<p>
At the end of August 1995 Slovenian unemployment was 14 per cent, with a total of 120,219 people unemployed, an increase of 0.1 per cent over the preceding month but 3.4 per cent below the August 1994 figure. 
<p>
Ljubljana's Lev Hotel is to become a part of the Inter-Continental chain. The hotel will be closed during a period of refurbishment.

A free trade agreement has been entered into by Poland and Slovenia. Signed by Polish Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Jacek Buchacz and Slovenian Minister of Economic Relations and Development Janko Dezelak, the agreement provides for a gradual lifting of tariffs and customs duties. Polish exports to Slovenia were US$22.5 million in 1994, while Poland imported US$96.2 million from Slovenia. The largest component of Slovenian exports is the pharmaceutical industry.
<p>
Slovenia, almost alone among the former Yugoslav republics, most of whom admittedly have other worries, continues to make inroads into its foreign debt liabilities. US$122.5 million dollars has been deposited in the fiduciary account of the Bank of Slovenia with the Dresdner Bank in Luxembourg, due to a US-based consortium of commercial banks, with a further US$20.9 million deposited into the country's trustee debt account in Luxembourg. Slovenia's total debt to international financial institutions at the end of May 1995 was US$530 million. US$1,207 million was also owed to the consortium of banks, the USA, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, UK, Italy and other countries, US$125 million more than at the end of 1994. Slovenia's total external debt is US$2.5 billion.
<p>
The average Slovenian gross salary in May 1995 was SIT111,313 (US$968), a 17.6 per cent increase over the May 1994 figure.
<p>
LB Leasing d.o.o., a wholly owned subsidiary of Nova Ljubljanska Banka a.s. has been granted an international credit facility. The syndicated credit facility, for US$7.5 million, is to be financed by the Washington based International Finance Corporation and Credit Suisse of Zurich. The funds are to be used for equipment purchase.
<p>
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is to lend Slovenski Plinovodi DM15 million (US$10.4 million) for the construction and operation of six gas distribution systems.

Revised estimates put Slovenia's forecast inflation rate at 10 per cent for 1995. In June 1995 the annual rate had fallen to 12.6 per cent, well down from December 1994's 18.3 per cent. 
<p>
At the beginning of June Slovenia reached agreement with its creditor banks over repayment terms. Slovenia has a relatively low level of foreign indebtedness at US$2.465 billion owed to directly assignable creditors. At the end of April 1995 Slovenian debt to foreign institutions, including the EBRD, amounted to US$527 million. 
Unemployment reached a total of 14.3 per cent in July, with 125,546 reported unemployed.

Pharmaceutical company Krka began the public sale of its shares in September. 27.1 per cent of shares were sold to employees, 72.9 per cent of the shares in the US$84.4 million company were made available to Slovenian citizens and companies. (See Slovenia - sunny side up  page 17).

<h3>UKRAINE</h3>
Some countries can, and some simply can't . . . introduce new currencies without difficulties. Since its introduction in 1992, the Ukrainian Karbovanet has been one of the world's less attractive currencies, depreciating 15-fold. The government's decision to replace the karbovanet with the Hryvna and to prohibit all hard currency transactions was hardly designed to maintain confidence in the tired old karbovanet. And it didn't. Within days of the decision to replace the karbovanet with the hryvna the rate dropped from 150,000 to the dollar - a rate it had held for some months, to 170,000 on the inter-bank currency auction. At one time the parallel market had reached 200,000. In mid-September the government appeared to accept that the planned date for the introduction of the Hryvna - October 1995 - was unrealistic although no official statement had been made.
<p>
President Leonid Kuchma celebrated 4 July with a cabinet re-shuffle. The key change was the replacement of Victor Pynzenyk as deputy prime minister responsible for the economy, to be replaced by Roman Shpek, a (reputedly) less radical reformer.  
<p>
Monthly inflation in the Ukraine dropped to 4.8 per cent in June but bounced up half a point again in July, casting a shadow over theories that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) austerity programme - linked to a US$1.57 billion standby loan - appears to be working. In June the Ukraine qualified for the second US$365 million instalment of the loan, with the third due to be drawn down in September 1995 if approved by the IMF board due to meet at that time. The government has promised the IMF that monthly inflation will be brought down to 1-2 per cent by December 1995.
<p>
Troubled Odessa-based shipping group Black Sea Shipping Co (Blasco), one of Europe's largest shipowners, is seeking to restructure its US$250 million debt. The company's cash crisis, allegedly due to the failure of state enterprises in other Soviet republics to pay their bills, has resulted in the arrest or embargo of 51 of the company's fleet of 220 vessels.
<p>
Deputy Economics Minister Tatyana Shandra confirmed the government's programme for the continued privatisation of state-owned enterprises. 483 enterprises, including 70 large and medium sized companies, are expected to be privatised before the end of 1995.

Foreign investors are being invited to bid for 30 per cent of the shares of nitrogen producer Cherkassy Azot as part of a plan to introduce foreign capital into the country's fertiliser industry.

<h3>TRAVEL BRIEF</h3>
Reverse thrust. Uzbekistan Airways has taken a 40 per cent stake in UK based European Airways for US$160,000. European Airways currently operates the Newcastle - Southampton route with two Jetstream 31s. A Newcastle - Hamburg route is planned. 
<p>
Hungarian flag carrier MALEV cut its losses for the first half of 1995 to US$3.3 million (same period 1994 US$5.5 million). The airline is forecasting a year end profit of US$900,000 as against a US$5.4 million loss in 1994.<p> Troubled Italian flag carrier Alitalia itself suffering from crippling losses, owns 30 per cent of the airline, with 64 per cent currently held by the Hungarian government. Rumours have persisted for some time that the Hungarian government is seeking to replace Alitalia as a shareholder in view of the Italian carrier's inability to increase its investment in the airline.<p>
Tajikistan International Airlines (TIA) plans to double its flights from the UK to Bombay via the Tajik capital Dushanbe. Since February 1995 TIA has operated two flights per week, one from London Heathrow and the other from Birmingham, using Lockheed L10-11-500 Tristars.
<p>
At last . . . the motorway linking Prague to Plzen has been completed, and opened on 26 October. That's the good news. The bad news is that motorists will still have to pick their way through Plzn itself until the city has a by-pass. The motorway section linking Plzen to the German border is due to be completed in 1997. However, the Bavarian government does not plan to extend the autobahn to the frontier until after the year 2000.
<p>
British Airways (BA) is to increase its London Gatwick-Sofia service to four flights per week. The airline is also rumoured to be considering the launch of a London-Bratislava service, having recently opened a sales office in the Slovakian capital.
<p>
Tirana's Rinas airport is now served by 12 airlines with 1,300 flights handled in the first half of 1995.
Airlines of Britain Holdings owners of British Midland in which Scandinavia's SAS has a 20 per cent stake, launched a daily London-Prague-London service at the end of October. The airline was reported to be planning to undercut rivals CSA (Czech Airlines) and BA (British Airways) by as much as Kc5,000 (US$160) off round trip fares. British Midland's proposed fare structure lead to complaints of `dumping' from Czech flag carrier CSA. The new fares are subject to approval from the Czech ministry of transport, which in mid-October appeared opposed to them, claiming that they contravened the terms of a bilateral treaty between the two countries. British Midland is reported to be considering other routes in the region.
<p>
Meanwhile Airlines of Britain Holdings has leased two ATP 42's to the Czech republic's second airline Air Ostrava. 
<p>
Deutsche BA a British Airways subsidiary has started services from Berlin to Vilnius and Riga. 
<p>
US aircraft manufacturer Boeing estimates the market in aircraft in Russia, CIS and the Baltic states to be US$70 billion for the next 20 years. 
<p>
Yugoslav airlines JAT started flying to Kiev (Ukraine) from Belgrade at the beginning of August. Ukraine International now operates four weekly flights on the London (Gatwick)-Kiev route.
<p>
A ferry service linking Constanta (Romania) with the Turkish port of Samsun was inaugurated on 9 August 1995.

LOT Polish Airlines has introduced a telephone check-in service for business class passengers travelling without baggage on the Heathrow-Warsaw route.

<h3>Labour Market</h3>
In 1989 at the fall of the communist régime, around 46 per cent of the 
population was in the labour market. About 22 per cent of the working 
population was in the agricultural sector and 34 per cent in industry. The
appearance of unemployment in 1991 was an early sign of the transition to 
a market economy. Rates of unemployment fell more slowly than real 
production as businesses were keener to merely survive than attempt to 
maximise profits. Average payroll numbers fell in 1991 by 14 per cent. 
In the year ending mid 1991 the total population fell from 8.682 million 
to 8.623 million. At the same time the economically active population fell 
by 180,000 - this represented about 4.6 per cent of the total population. 
The steepest decline in employment between 1990 and 1991 was in the 
following sectors: construction (a fall of 25 per cent), trade 
(21.5 per cent) and industry especially mechanical engineering, machine 
tools, electricals, food processing, textiles.
<P>
In 1992 there was a labour force of 3.613 million, 3.113 million of whom 
were in employment - 2.653 million in the state and co operative sector and 
439,000 in the private sector. The unemployment rate in April 1994 was 
16.1 per cent.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
</CENTER>
After nearly 50 years of isolation from the democratic process, Bulgaria's
first free elections in June 1990 were won by the former Communist Party, 
now known as the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP). The BSP government did 
not last long - popular opposition and unrest forced the resignation of a
number of politburo members and, in October 1991, fresh elections.
<P>
The second elections were won by an improbable coalition of the anti 
communist Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) and the mainly ethnic Turkish 
Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF). With the UDF candidate Zhelyu 
Zhelev as president, Bulgarian politics seemed to have settled down. But 
in late 1992 the MRF, for reasons best known to themselves, withdrew from 
the coalition and brought down the government. In December 1992 a so called
`government of experts' was voted in by the BSP and MRF, headed by Zhelev's
former economic adviser, Lyuben Berov. Ironically, this government - which 
stayed in power throughout 1993 - has no socialist minister and only one 
from the MRF.
<P>
The continued political resilience of neo communism in Bulgaria has 
adversely affected its relations with the west. Full Bulgarian membership 
of the European Union (EU) and, even more, NATO, remains a long term 
proposition. Meanwhile, Bulgaria has suffered large losses as a result of 
the imposition of UN economic sanctions against rump Yugoslavia. Many 
Bulgarian enterprises have had to indulge in sanctions busting activities, 
further complicating Bularia's relations with the west.
<P>
No real economic recovery can be expected before 1995. The recent fall in 
new fixed investment is not expected to reverse until the year 1995 96. In 
1993 new investment fell by 8 per cent. Sectorally Bulgaria's capital growth
orientated and state controlled industries are the weakest component of the 
economy. In 1993 industrial output fell by 9 per cent, against a fall of 16 
per cent in 1992 (see INDUSTRY).
<P>
The 1994 government budget assumes tax increases will result in revenues of 
Lev100 billion, generally accepted as a hopelessly unrealistic figure. 
Projected expenditures will push the budget deficit to 7.6 per cent of 
projected GDP in 1994.
<P>
In February 1991 the first liberalisation package supported by the IMF was 
introduced, with profound results. Prices more than doubled in the first 
month, and the lev crashed from its rate of 1.27 to the US dollar to over 
20. Annual interest rates of over 50 per cent have kept inflation to around 
5 per cent per month (70 80 per cent per year). The budget deficit 
mushroomed to an estimated 8 per cent for 1993, causing the IMF to have 
second thoughts about renewing its stand by agreement with Bulgaria in 
March 1993.
<P>
Privatisation in general - and small scale privatisation in particular 
has been the achilles heel of Bulgarian economic reforms. All the Bulgarian 
parties initially rejected privatisation schemes based on the Czech, Russian
or Romanian models. But foreign investment - a paltry US$50 million per 
year - has not proved an alternative. This low level is attributed to three
factors: disarray in the Bulgarian privatisation agency, lack of 
international awareness of Bulgaria and the fear of more widespread war in 
the Balkans. Having declared itself to be the `government of privatisation', 
the Berov government is now hard pressed to demonstrate some successes.

<h2>Political Structure</h2>
</CENTER>
<UL>
<LI>Head of State: President Zhelyu Zhelev
<LI>Head of Government: Prime Minister Zhan Videnov (leader of BSP)
<LI>Ruling Party: Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP)
<LI>Opposition Party: Union of Democratic Forces
<LI>Leader of Opposition: Filip Dimitrov
</UL>
<P>
As with many other former communist countries of Europe, 1989 was a year 
when democracy was reborn. Bulgaria's new constitution came into effect in 
July 1991. Its substance arose from a desire to move quickly from 
totalitarian government to democracy and a free market economy. Among its 
provisions were freedom of the individual, protection of investments and 
the division of powers.
<P>
Parliament consists of a single chamber, the people's assembly, with 240 
deputies elected for a four year term of office. The right to initiate new 
legislation is vested in the deputies and the executive - the council of 
ministers. The head of state is the president of the republic assisted by 
a vice president. The president of the republic is elected by direct 
popular vote for a period of five years. A president must be Bulgarian born 
and at least 40 years old. Among the duties of the president are to 
announce elections to the parliament, conclude treaties, promulgate laws 
and act as supreme commander of the armed forces.
<P>
The president cannot initiate new laws and cannot veto illegal acts although
he can bring a law back to parliament for further consideration. The council 
of ministers is the supreme executive body of the government and normally, 
though not necessarily, consists of elected members of parliament.
<P>
Local government is based on a division into provinces (oblasti) and 
municipalities (obstini). Each oblast is ruled by a governor appointed by 
the council of ministers. Local government is provided at obstini level by 
municipality councils each led by an elected mayor.
<P>
The country had its first free elections in 1990. The result was the 
overthrow of Todor Zhivkov the dictator who had held power for over 30 
years. The winning party was made up of former communists who blocked most 
of the important reforms needed for a return to a market economy. This 
position changed after further elections in October 1991 when the Union of 
Democratic Forces (UDF) an alliance of anti communists, won a small majority
in parliament. Governing for over a year with the help of the (mainly 
ethnic) Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) party, fundamental 
reforms began albeit slowly. The UDF came to power on the back of support 
from various powerful groups such as the church, trade unions and private 
sector. The MRF is a party representing the country's one million ethnic 
Turks. Although it only holds 10 per cent of parliamentary seats, the MRF 
held the balance of power in a chamber where the largest parties (UDF and 
the Socialists) are fairly evenly matched.
<P>
In early 1992, a former leading dissident Zhelyu Zhelev was re elected as 
president in a contest with an arch conservative candidate. 
<P>
After a four month government crisis, in January 1993 the Bulgarian 
parliament elected Lyuben Berov as the new prime minister; it also 
elected his new cabinet. Trouble had been simmering since August 1992 when 
President Zhelev criticised the ruling party, the Union of Democratic Forces
(UDF), for causing rifts with other important political groupings in the 
country. After a deep cabinet split, the then prime minister, Philip 
Dimitrov lost a vote of confidence and consequently resigned. After the 
failure of the UDF and the second biggest party, the BSP (Bulgarian 
Socialist Party - former communists) to form a government, President 
Zhelev asked the third largest party, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms 
(MRF) to choose a prime minister. Splits within the UDF allowed the MRF 
candidate to come through forming a government of national responsibility. 
This government of `experts' was the creation of Zhelev and was headed by 
his former economic adviser, 67 year old Lyuben Berov. Although loosely 
supported by the BSP. There is no Socialist member of parliament in the 
cabinet, and only one from the MRF.

Up to 1990, Bulgaria's growth rate was quite high. Wealth is based on a 
large iron and steel industry (with a new mill at Burgas). Much of the 
production methods are ecologically unsound and investment has been targeted
at dealing with this problem. Engineering industry focused on transport 
equipment such as motor cycles, ships, electric cars, fork lift trucks and 
on agricultural and electrical equipment. There is a growing machine tools 
industry and a developed chemicals sector specialising in artificial 
fertilisers, plastics, pharmaceuticals, synthetic rubber, paints and 
petrochemicals. Woollen textiles are produced and there is a significant

Bulgaria's foreign trade in 1992 amounted to Lev162,000 million, of which 
51 per cent was exports and 49 per cent imports. Exports in 1993 totalled 
US$3.6 billion and imports totalled US$4.3 billion.

The decline in industrial production slowed in 1993 to  9 per cent, against 
16 per cent in 1992. Up to 1993, the involvement by foreign firms in 
Bulgarian industry had been quite small. Net foreign direct investment in 
the first half of 1993 was US$22 million, against a total of US$42 million 
for 1992. The lethargic pace of reform and liberalisation had done little 
to encourage inward investment in  manufacturing. Among the more promising 
areas is vehicle assembly. There was existing capacity to produce Russian 
designed Moscovitch cars. In the spring of 1992, there were reports of a 
possible joint venture between the government and Rover cars. This would 
involve the supply and possible assembly of Maestro cars and vans. There 
were talks about a possible joint venture between the Ministry of Defence 
and Rover. It was believed that up to 50,000 units per year could be 
produced in Bulgaria.
<P>
In 1992, the privatisation of the national electronics industry was 
announced. Consultants were called in to identify components of the industry 
which have the potential to compete in world markets.
<P>
Economic activity in Bulgaria is increasingly dominated by a small number 
of companies controlled by Bulgaria's new entrepreneurial class. Known as 
the Group of 13 (G13) these enterprises have interests in steel, banking, 
newspapers, agriculture and insurance. The largest - Multigroup - is 
estimated to have a turnover in excess of US$1 billlion.
<P>
With its sea resorts, skiing and historic places of interest, Bulgaria has 
long enjoyed a thriving tourist industry. By the beginning of 1993, all 
tourist organisations were transformed into joint stock companies. 
Privatisation began in February 1993. About 30 per cent of all hotels were 
expected to be privatised by the end of 1993, the whole process would take 
5 years to complete. It was thought that only 6 per cent of high class hotel
s would come up to acceptable European standards. In 1992, the tourist 
industry seemed to recover with about 90 per cent of hotels fully booked 
during the winter season. About one million people vacationed in Bulgaria 
in 1992; more than 60 per cent visited the country between June and 
September. Western Europe was the largest incoming market, accounting for 
41 per cent of foreign holidaymakers. Of these, 70 per cent were Germans. 
In 1993, tourist numbers were expected to rise by 3 to 4 per cent. Tourist 
revenues were Lev5,000 million in 1992 - resulting in a 37 per cent increase
in profits since 1991.

The Trade Law of 1991 sets out the business structures which are available 
in Bulgaria. Limited liability and joint stock companies are the main forms 
of business structure in what is still a fledgling market economy. The 
minimum share capital for a joint stock company is Lev1 million unless the 
capital is to be raised by  public offer when the sum is Lev5 million.

<P>
The economy continued to decline in 1993 with the biggest falls in 
industrial output and sales felt in petrochemicals, electronics and 
electrical engineering. There was some growth: ferrous metals, mechanical 
engineering, printing and power generation.
<P>
In September 1992, Bulgaria's Privatisation Agency began operations. It 
replaced the former body whose task it was to lay the foundations of the 
privatisation process in terms of the law and expert advice. The agency has 
11 regional offices and employs over 100 experts. Its aim is to privatise 
around a quarter of all businesses where capital exceeds Lev10 million. 
According to official statistics, 18.5 per cent of the economy is now 
controlled by the private sector. The actual share is probably somewhat 
larger. About 60 per cent of all claims for resititution of property 
appropriated under the communist régime have been settled, either by the 
return of the property to its rightful owners or by payment of compensation.
Outside experts are called in to evaluate schemes on a project by project 
basis. The 1992 Privatisation Act lays down the means by which companies 
are to be privatised. The process is to be initiated by the government. It 
was thought that early candidates for privatisation would be in the 
construction sector or municipally owned companies. In theory foreign 
investors are allowed to be involved in a privatisation on equal terms 
with locals. In reality, foreign investment is beset with numerous 
difficulties, casting doubt on government estimates of up to US$400 
million in new direct foreign investment from equity sales to foreigners 
in 1994 95. Many Bulgarian state enterprises are technically insolvent, 
particularly in the capital goods sector. In practice, most foreign 
investors' interest is limited to the service and agriculture food 
processing sector. Direct foreign investment in agriculture itself is 
unlikely due to the ban on foreign ownership of land in Bulgaria.
<P>
Western consultants were drafted in to advise on which companies were ready 
for privatisation. These experts were drawn from Bankers Trust, Boston 
Consulting Group, Arthur Anderson, S.G. Warburg, Ernst and Young and others.
<P>
By mid 1993 the Privatisation Agency had only completed one major 
transaction, the sale of the Tsarevichni Produkti maize processing plant 
to Belgian Amylum for US$20m. Tsarevichni Produkti owed its bankers US$20 
million, part of which has been converted to equity. Delays on regulations 
concerning the proposed Mutual Fund which was to be part recipient of sales 
proceeds were also cited as reasons for the slow progress towards a 
privatised sector. Despite this lack of real progress, the government set 
its privatised targets for 1993 as 292 enterprises. Of these, the plan 
envisaged that 83 would be privatised by the Privatisation Agency. The 
rest to be handled directly by various government ministries. Priority 
areas were recognised as being industry, agriculture, trade, tourism, 
construction, transport and telecommunications. Privatisation proceeds 
were expected to be in excess of Lev 9.2 million although the slow and 
uncertain pace of privatisation makes this figure hypothetical.
<P>
In June 1994 Bulgaria began its long delayed mass privatisation through 
vouchers. The scheme, modelled on the Czech pattern, entitles Bulgarians 
to privatisation vouchers representing assets with a book value of 
Lev25,000 ($450) on payment of Lev500. The vouchers can be exchanged for 
shares in around 500 state owned enterprises, with assets totalling 
Lev110.8 billion. Private investment funds will be created to manage and 
invest the vouchers on behalf of the public. Officials from the newly funded
Centre of Mass Privatisation are drafting a separate law to govern 
investment funds.

At the beginning of 1993 there were 105,564 private companies registered in 
Bulgaria but only 72,863 had submitted annual reports according to the 
National Statistics Institute.

<P>
Electricity output in 1992 was 35,600 MkWh, down from 38,900 in the previous 
year.
<P>
Bulgaria is dependent on imports for 70 per cent of its energy supplies.
There are virtually no supplies of oil and small reserves of gas 
(although it is hoped that preliminary discoveries in the Black Sea by 
Texaco Bulgaria will prove to be commercial) and there is a high level of 
oil and gas import dependency. Traditionally most came from the former 
Soviet Union. Since 1991, Bulgaria has had to pay in hard currency at world 
market prices. Supplies have become less reliable. A typical problem is 
faced by the coal fired station at Varna which used to burn hard coal 
imported by barter from the Ukraine and which now has to buy supplies on the 
world market.
<P>
Electricity was also traditionally imported from the former USSR but some is
also exported to neighbouring countries. Oil was also exported to 
contribute to hard currency earnings.
<P>
Electricity is mostly generated by the National Electric Company (NEC) 
although all power stations including Kozloduy operate as separate companies.
Capital spending is controlled by the NEC and policy on pricing and output 
is controlled by the government.
<P>
There are large deposits of brown coal although quality is quite low. The 
bulk of coal reserves are lignite and most hard coal has to be imported. 
Yearly production of lignite is around 34 million tonnes, hard coal 200,000 
tonnes. As this coal is insufficient for power station needs, most has to be 
imported. Hydroelectric power provides just over 5 per cent of total energy 
capacity is limited by the uncertain flow of the rivers and priorities 
given to agriculture.
<P>
A paucity of natural resources and the existence of uranium shifted 
attention to nuclear power. One nuclear station at Kozloduy accounts for 
40 per cent of all Bulgaria's needs. It has the capacity to produce 3,760 
MW of electricity. This power station was the focus of a visit by 
international nuclear power experts and donor agencies in early 1993 to 
consider ways to enhance safety at the plant. 
<P>
In May 1994 the NEC announced that it was to invest a further US$200 million
to upgrade and increase the safety of four Soviet designed 440 MW reactors 
at the Kozloduy plant. The NEC has already spent US$50 million on upgrading 
the plants. Concerns over safety, especially following the Chernobyl 
disaster, led to the shut down of some older capacity and the cancellation 
of the building of new plants such as one in Belene. There have been severe 
energy shortages with frequent blackouts in Sofia and the industrial sectors.
<P>
There are 16 210 MW coal fired stations and a number of smaller units 
burning oil, fuel oil and gas some of which provide combined heat and power 
(CHP) and centralised heat only units for domestic and industrial customers.
<P>
In March 1992, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) 
approved an Ecu40 million loan to help Bulgaria's energy crisis. It costs 
Bulgaria US$500,000 a day to import 600 MW of electricity. The funds were 
set to secure the completion of part of the Maritza Power Plant. Funds were 
also allocated for the improvement in environmental standards by building 
the country's first desulphurisation plant for the coal industry.

Mineral deposits are varied but of generally low quality. Iron ore, and
lead zinc ore are mined at Kremikovtsi and there are substantial deposits of 
manganese ore at Obrochishte near Varna where reserves are estimated at more
than 120 million tonnes. Other iron ore deposits are found in Sofia, 
Chiporovtsi, Yambol, and Troyan. The iron ore near Sofia is made up of 
hematite, limonite and siderite with iron content varying from 23 to 46 per 
cent. The ore contains significant quantities of manganese, lead, copper and 
silver. Chromium mineralisations occur in the Rhodopi area of Southern 
Bulgaria. There is also a deposit of tungsten in the area of Gruncharitsa.
<P>
Non metal minerals include over 100,000 tonnes of refractory dolomites with 
a 20 per cent content of manganese oxides extracted each year. Proven 
reserves are over 60 million tonnes. Proven reserves also exist for 
quartzite, pegmatites, vermiculite, garnet, vein quartz, chalcedony 
silicides, quartzite sand, 600 million tonnes of deep mined gypsum and 
pearlite.
<P>
The government had decided to close down loss making ore and uranium mines. 
Against an increasing rate of unemployment, galloping inflation and falling 
living standards, miners in the poorly equipped pits staged a series of 
strikes which put considerable pressure on a coalition dependent on trade 
union support.
<P>
Cadmium production hit 232 tonnes in 1992, up from 194 tonnes in the 
previous year. Copper concentrate showed a similar rise, from 243,000 tonnes
in 1991 to 301,000 tonnes in 1992. Only small amounts of silver and gold are 
produced, reaching 1,303 kg and 559 kg respectively in 1992.

<P>
Agriculture has the greatest long term potential to act as a motor for 
economic growth in the Bulgarian economy; but only if it is radically 
restructured through privatisation, its export performance improved and its 
capital base strengthened through new fixed investment.
<P>
The political upheavals of recent years as well as a bad drought in 1993 
have had a severe dislocational effect on Bulgarian farm trade. In 1991 
Bulgarian exports to its erstwhile major trading partners in the former 
Soviet Union fell by 80 per cent, imports also fell by 84 per cent. With 
the smaller volume of traded produce, the countries of the EU took a larger 
share of total trade than the former Soviet Union. Dollar export earnings 
fell by 68 per cent between 1991 and 1992. The slump in trade was most 
marked in farm produce such as beef, lamb, eggs, grapes, pears and canned 
produce.
<P>
A key issue in agricultural policy has been what to do about land formerly 
owned by private farmers before the days of communism. It was expected that 
60 per cent of all lands subject to restitution would be returned by the 
end of 1993. The Ministry of Agriculture expected that up to 20 per cent of 
owners would receive title deeds in 1993. Land reform is a key political 
issue with the main opposition party putting land restitution as a priority 
area. There is a feeling that there was ill advised haste in the liquidation 
of the co operatives. By the end of 1992 although the co operatives had all 
but disappeared, only about a quarter of land had actually been reallocated 
the result was that much of the land was unworked. Further criticisms were 
levelled at the policy of dividing up land into small plots worked by 
townspeople with little experience of working the land. Fears were expressed 
about the ability of the agricultural sector to produce surpluses for 
markets at home or abroad. Outside the wheat growing area of Dobrudga the 
average pre communist smallholding was 5 hectares or less. Disputes over 
who exactly owns a piece of land led to further smaller divisions of farms. 
Financial problems have also prevented farmers from investing in machinery, 
seed or fertiliser. Loans were mostly prohibitive with base rates at more 
than 40 per cent.
<P>
In the agro business field there has been interest in Bulgaria's fruit and 
vegetable industry. The Austrian company IBG has invested in cold storage 
facilities costing 60 million schillings. The store will hold 1,500 tonnes 
of fruit destined for export and will include strawberries, cherries, 
raspberries and plums. Bulgaria already exports canned fruits, vegetables 
and juices.
<P>
Maize Products Combined Works based in north east Bulgaria was one of the 
first enterprises to be privatised. Operations started in June 1993 and 
Maize Products will produce starches, gum, glucose syrups, maize butter and 
ethanol. The company is to operate under a US licence and with investment 
funds coming from Creditanstalt Investment Bank, Vienna, the highly 
modernised production facility will aim at producing for export principally 
to western Europe.

<h2>Armed Forces</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
According to recent estimates the Bulgarian armed forces consists of 99,000 
active personnel including about 60,000 conscripts. There are 12,000 border 
guards in 12 regiments as well as 4,000 security police. The period of 
service is 18 months.
<P>
The army, which has 52,000 people, about 33,000 of whom are conscripts, has 
four tank brigades and three motor rifle divisions. It is equipped with 
1,277 T 55 tanks, as well as 599 T 34s and 333 T 72s. The army's total 
artillery is 2,081. It has 67 surface to air missiles and 72 surface to 
surface missile launchers (including 36 Scud).
<P>
The navy, with its main base at Varna, is made up of 3,000 personnel, 2,000 
of whom are conscripts. Other coastal bases are at Atiya, Sozopol and 
Balchik in addition to Vidin on the Danube. The fleet consists of one 
frigate and two submarines of the `Romeo' class. There are three small 
frigates, nine corvettes, six missile craft, four torpedo craft, five 
coastal patrol vessels, 10 minelayers, 18 minesweepers, seven patrol vessels 
and 10 armed helicopters.
<P>
The airforce has 21,800 personnel in two air divisions, one mixed air 
corps and 6 combat regiments. There are 16,000 conscripts. The airforce has 
275 combat aircraft and 44 attack helicopters. It has three fighter 
regiments with about 22 MiG 23, 108 MiG 21 fast patrol craft and 22 MiG 29 
aircraft. As well, there is one fighter ground attack regiment with 39 Su 25 
aircraft and one regiment with 37 MiG 23. There is one reconnaissance 
regiment with 47 aircraft (26 MiG 23 and 21 Su 22) and two helicopter 
regiments with 14 Mi 2, 25 Mi 17 and 44 Mi 24 helicopters. For transport, 
the airforce has one regiment with two Tu 134, three An 24, four An 26, 
five L 410 and three Yak 40 (VIP).
<P>
Bulgaria has a relatively sophisticated arms industry supplying most of the 
country's needs. There is emphasis on high tech developments such as the 
laser duel simulator surveillance device for tank crews, the latest aerial 
target equipment, barrage jammers (tested in the Gulf War) and radarproof 
steel bridges.
<P>
The arms industry was planning to switch the manufacture of AK 47 assault 
rifles of 5.45mm calibre to the NATO standard 5.56mm.
<P>
Despite these technological advances, large scale redundancies are imminent 
in the defence industry (once one of eastern Europe's largest).

<h2>Education, Health, & Welfare</h2>
</CENTER>
Education in Bulgaria is free and compulsory for all children between the 
ages of seven and 16. The standard of literacy is extremely high and many 
children go on to higher education.
<P>
There are three state universities, the oldest being the Kliment Ohrid in 
Sofia (it has over 15,000 students and 1,500 teachers). The other two state 
universities are the Kirill i Metodii in Veliko Turnovo and the Paisi 
Hilendarski in Plovdiv. In 1990 an independent university in Burgas was 
founded with 500 full time students, its aim was to specialise in law, 
management and political science.

<P>
Bulgaria's health care system is free although in 1991 the state allowed 
the development of private medicine. There are about 260 hospitals offering 
over 88,000 beds. There are about 28,500 doctors and just over 6,000 
dentists.
<P>
Retirement pensions are paid on the basis of previous wages and the 
percentage paid varies between occupations. Family allowances are paid for 
all children under 16.

<H2>Geography & Climate</H2>
</CENTER>
Bulgaria is situated on the western shores of the Black Sea bounded with 
Romania to the north, Turkey and Greece to the south and the republics of 
the former Yugoslavia to the west. The lower Danube forms most of the 
frontier with Romania. The country's topography ranges from lowland plains 
along the Danube to rugged mountains running from west to east across the 
centre.
<P>
Almost 70 per cent of the country consists of plains and hills. The highest 
mountain peak is Moussala in the Rila range at 2,925m.
<P>
Forests cover almost 30 per cent of the land area, most are deciduous 
consisting of oak and beech. Coniferous forests are more typical of the 
mountain areas. To the south are submediterranean flora.
<P>
The weather is influenced by continental and subtropical climates. The 
largest area of the country is influenced by a moderately continental 
climate with four clearly differentiated seasons. Annual temperatures fall 
within a range of  14 degrees centigrade (C) to 30 degrees C in the 
mountains. Average annual temperatures are around 10.5 degrees C. The 
coldest month is January when national average temperatures are  2 degrees 
C. The warmest month is July with averages around 25 degrees C. The Black 
Sea water temperature is around 26 degrees C in July and August. Annual 
rainfall is low at 698mm. Snow lasts for an average of 10 days on the Black 
Sea coast, 20 30 days in the lowlands and more than 200 days in the 
mountains.

In December 1992, Bulgaria signed a full Association Agreement with the 
European Union (EU). This will allow the country to gain greater access to 
European markets. Bulgaria was keen to sign as a step towards eventual full 
membership. Earlier agreements were signed with Poland, Czechoslovakia and 
Hungary, but political instability and lack of progress towards 
modernisation held Bulgaria's case back.

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</CENTER>
<P>
Five years after declaring an often nominal independence from the former Soviet Union in
1991, Ukraine's future political and economic prospects remain uncertain. The conflict
between parliament - dominated by left-wing parties opposed to socio-economic reform - and
President Leonid Kuchma continued unabated in 1995/96. One result of this has been a
failure to promulgate a new constitution for Ukraine. To further complicate matters, Kuchma
was in worsening conflict with his prime minister, Yevenhii Marchuk ending in the Prime
Minister's sacking in May 1996. On the economic front, Ukrainian GDP continued to decline
in 1995, albeit at a lesser rate than in 1994. No real GDP growth is now expected until 1997
at the earliest.
<P>
<b>Political challenges</b>
<P>
Elected to power on a reformist ticket in 1994, President Kuchma is confronted with the sort
of political deadlock that destroyed his precursor, Leonid Kravchuk. This ongoing political
instability has gravely weakened economic policy-making and other vitally important issues -
particularly the final status of the disputed Crimea. In 1995, parliament failed to promulgate a
new constitution for the Crimea.<br>
Parliamentary obstruction has delayed the approval of a new constitution based on strong
presidential powers. Pending the promulgation of such a constitution, which will almost
certainly have to be a compromise between presidential and parliamentary forms of
governance if it is to get through the present Ukrainian parliament, Ukraine will continue to
rely on the interim constitutional agreement of June 1995 for the uncertain divisions of
powers between its president and legislature. Based on a so-called Law on Powers proposed
by Kuchma in early 1995, this rather unsatisfactory compromise gives temporary increased
powers to the president, but also leaves many key parliamentary prerogatives.
<P>
<b>Kuchma vs Marchuk</b>
<P>
President Kuchma's relations with Prime Minister Marchuk collapsed in 1995. Originally
appointed to advance local economic reform, Marchuk later turned against Kuchma, his
mentor, mainly by building himself an independent political base in parliament for the
purposes of challenging Kuchma for the presidency in 1998. During the course of 1995, it
emerged that Marchuk and not Kuchma was the most popular politician in Ukraine. At that
time, Marchuk repeatedly charged that Kuchma had an inconsistent and ineffective approach
to the key issue of economic reform. Within Cabinet, two major reshuffles worsened the
political confusion in Ukraine, with Kuchma then alternately promoting and demoting
reformers.<br>
In May 1996, this culminated in his sacking of Marchuk. His replacement as prime minister,
Pavlo Lazarenko, a former deputy premier, is a close associate of Kuchma and is not
regarded as any sort of economic reformer in Ukraine. Kuchma's flagging popularity in 1995-
96 then led him to promote anti-reform industrial and agricultural lobbies in government. The
main adverse effect of this erosion of government credibility and authority was a major strike
wave over unpaid wages in 1995-96 - thus raising the possibility of a general strike in Ukraine
sometime in 1996.
<P>
<b>The independence question</b>
<P>
Russian influence over Ukraine remains strong, notably in the area of energy supplies.
Ukraine may not be able to avoid closer ties with Russia in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), where a new Commonwealth of Sovereign States (SSR) was
created in April 1996. One of its founding members was nearby Belarus but Ukraine has so-
far refused to join. The final division of the Black Sea Fleet (BSF) was agreed in 1995, but
disputes still continue over the status of the Sevastapol naval base.<br>
Although still relatively strong, western support for Ukrainian independence is by no means
unconditional. The continued absence of real economic reform is a factor in this. IMF and
other foreign economic support for 1996 is thus uncertain, making ominous implications for
the country's balance of payments. The US is now the strongest supporter of Ukrainian
independence and wider political considerations could bring about a more accommodating
stance by the IMF and the EU in 1996.<br>
In the eastern region of Ukraine, declining popular support for Ukrainian independence has
been caused primarily by the ongoing economic decline there. The growing political deadlock
in Kiev has also inevitably revived latent secessionist sentiments in the pro-Russian Crimea.
Earlier partly checked by Kuchma's rapprochement with Russia in 1995, this trend could
become more pronounced in 1996. Further serious political instability in the Crimea cannot
be discounted entirely in the future. In the nationalist western Ukraine, adverse political
developments are also now highly probable. At worst, these mutually contradictory
centrifugal tendencies could seriously split Ukraine asunder.<br>
After improving slightly in 1995, Ukrainian-Russian relations became more uncertain in 1996,
mainly because of the presidential election campaign in Russia. This is because President
Boris Yeltsin cannot be seen conceding anything of substance to Ukraine or any other CIS
republic at a time when his communist opponents are demanding the restoration of another
Russian empire in the former Soviet Union. In the event of Yeltsin's removal from power in
1996, Ukrainian independence could be threatened by a more assertive Russia.
Russia is now also actively discriminating against Ukrainian goods, thereby further
aggravating Ukraine's foreign trade difficulties. Despite closer ties with the EU in 1995-96,
Ukraine's dependence on Russia for most of its foreign trade is expected to continue well
past 2000.<br>
In 1995, a major territorial dispute broke out with nearby Romania over Serpent Island in the
Black Sea and this is a development that could abort an earlier Ukrainian-Romanian
rapprochement over other issues in the region, notably the situation in Moldova.
<P>
<b>Economy</b>
<P>
Down by 23 per cent in 1994 (over 1993), Ukrainian GDP declined by less than half that, or
11.8 per cent, in 1995. In 1996, GDP is expected to fall by only 2 per cent, followed by the
first economic growth of the post-Soviet period in 1997. In 1995, nominal GDP and GDP per
capita were thus US$30 billion and US$600 respectively. Real wages also rose for the first
time since independence was declared in 1995.<br>
Because of the large size of the unofficial or black economy in Ukraine, actual GDP and
GDP per capita were almost certainly larger than official figures suggested in 1995. The
black economy may have accounted for anywhere between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of
officially declared GDP. Local living standards remain relatively low even when compared to
the rest of the CIS, let alone Europe more generally. Real incomes remain way below those
of nearby Russia, with high wage arrears.
<P>
<h3>Industry</h3>
<P>
Accounting for 40 per cent of GDP in 1995 and still highly dependent on foreign trade with
Russia, the Ukrainian industrial sector continues to decline, with total output down by a
further 11.5 per cent. As in 1994, particularly heavy output falls were registered in light
manufacturing (34 per cent) and engineering (28 per cent), or relatively higher added value
sectors. Primary production and semi-manufactured goods registered lower output falls in
1995. One result of this has been a shift towards primary production in the Ukrainian
industrial sector in recent years. Consisting of electricity, oil, gas, coal and steel, primary
production thus accounted for 53 per cent of total industrial output in 1995, compared to 38
per cent in 1990.<br>
Earlier mainly exported to Russia, Ukrainian manufactured goods have suffered greatly
through the loss of former Soviet markets. At home, their generally low quality has made
them vulnerable to imports from the EU, where such goods are also uncompetitive.
Structurally, the Ukrainian industrial sector is in urgent need of radical reform, particularly as
regards moving away from primary production towards more modern light manufacturing,
food-processing and consumer goods.<br>
The domestic industrial sector suffers from chronic energy shortages and energy supply
payment arrears totalling Krb144 trillion (US$792 million) at the end of 1995. Last formally
rescheduled in March 1995, Ukrainian energy supply debts to Russia are now in serious and
growing arrears. Totalling over US$3 billion at the end of 1995, these may have to be
renegotiated in 1996.
<P>
<b>Energy</b>
<P>
In January 1996, Ukraine and Russia came to terms for the transit of Russian gas through
local pipelines in 1996. Under the terms of this deal, Russia will supply US$800 million worth
of gas to Ukraine and pay up to US$2 billion in transit fees for its own gas exports bound for
western Europe, but this will not be enough to cover even half the US$6 billion worth of
Russian oil and gas that Ukraine will require in 1996 alone. Domestically, the government
increased the price of gas to 60 per cent of its cost price in January 1996, with a further price
hike expected in July of that year. Given the extent of outstanding energy payment arrears, it
is unclear how these increased prices will be met by domestic customers.<br>
In 1996, Ukraine hopes to renegotiate its outstanding energy supply debts to Russia, but it is
not clear whether the Russian government will agree to this without major concessions from
the Ukrainian government in other areas of mutual interest. Foremost amongst these are
debt for equity swaps, gas transit charges and possibly even Ukrainian membership of the
new SSR grouping in the CIS. The Crimea is another area where Russia is now looking for
further concessions from Ukraine.<br>
The government remains committed to doubling the country's nuclear power generation
capacity by 2000 as a way of overcoming difficulties with Russia over oil and gas supplies. In
1995, five nuclear power stations produced 36 per cent of the country's electricity output.
Western governments are opposed to nuclear power in Ukraine and, so far, the EU and G7
governments have only been willing to finance its replacement by safer electricity generation
methods, beginning with Chernobyl.<br>
Services<br>
Accounting for around 30 per cent of GDP in 1995, mainly privately-owned services remain
the most dynamic component of the Ukrainian economy. Virtually all new job creation is now
in private-sector services, where retail and wholesale trade registered particularly high growth
in 1995, mainly due to rising real wages in that year. Because of the slow pace of economic
restructuring in Ukraine, unemployment remains very low at 1 per cent of the employed
workforce at the end of 1995. Politically, fears of increased unemployment continue to inhibit
real economic reform in Ukraine.
<P>
<b>Financial stabilisation</b>
<P>
Relative to the hyper-inflation of 1993, Ukrainian inflation continues to fall substantially,
although it still remains high in absolute terms. In 1995, inflation was 380 per cent, compared
to 891 per cent in 1994. Based on a restrictive monetary-credit policy by the National Bank of
the Ukraine (NBU) dating back to September 1994, when a financial stabilisation programme
was first agreed with the IMF, this declining inflation may fall to below 100 per cent year-end
for the first time since 1991 in 1996.<br>
Continued NBU off-budget outlays, fiscal imbalances and energy price rises meant that
inflation did not fall as much as was earlier expected in 1995. A year-end monthly inflation
target of 2 per cent was not achieved by the end of 1995, when monthly inflation was just
under 5 per cent. Something similar is expected throughout 1996, mainly because of
continued wage growth in the state sector.<br>
The threat of a general strike in 1996 makes it difficult for a weak government to resist
inflationary pay awards, notably in the uneconomic coal-mining sector. Last increased in
January 1996, pensions and other welfare payments are also rising in real terms in Ukraine,
where any cuts in public spending have proved very difficult politically in recent years.
<P>
<b>Budget deficit</b>
<P>
In 1995, the government budget deficit reached Krb331 trillion (US$2.1 billion), or 8.1 per
cent of GDP. Continued fiscal expansionism and lower than expected tax revenues meant
that the budget deficit target of 7.3 per cent earlier agreed with the IMF was exceeded.
Overall, government expenditures (Krb1,772 trillion) and revenues (Krb1,441 trillion)
remained at a very high 50 per cent of GDP in 1995.<br>
Much of the government budget deficit in 1995 was covered by non-inflationary financing,
notably foreign loans and treasury bonds. During the first half of 1995, the government
budget deficit was only 6.4 per cent of GDP. The main positive outcome of this was a new
US$1.5 billion stand-by loan facility with the IMF in June 1995. Disbursable in five tranches,
this was indefinitely suspended by the IMF in January 1996, when three tranches of US$350
million each remained unpaid. The main reason for this was a higher than expected
government budget deficit during the second half of 1995. Another problem at that time was
the government's failure to set a credible budget for 1996.<br>
With projected expenditures of Krb3,916 trillion and revenues of Krb2,558 trillion, this
envisages a deficit of Krb427 trillion, or 6 per cent of expected GDP in 1996. Preceded by
intense political wrangling, the budget's targets may not be achieved in 1996, mainly because
of escalating wage and welfare costs in the state sector.<br>
Even more than was the case in 1994-95, the 1996 budget deficit is to be financed by new
foreign loans (US$1 billion), followed by government bonds (US$800 million) and NBU
credits (US$600 million). The main problem here is that continued foreign borrowing for 1996
is now conditional on a new agreement worth around US$900 million in undisbursed credits.
Without such an agreement, greater NBU monetary emission is inevitable, thereby making
higher inflation almost certain in the future. Among other things, this would further delay the
already long overdue introduction of a new national currency, the Hryvnia, which may not
replace the interim Karbovanets until well past 1996 or even 1997.<br>
Another bout of local inflation would further weaken the already precarious exchange rate of
the Karbovanets. Only partly stabilised at around Krb130,000-140,000 per US$1 by late
1994, this exchange rate continued to slightly depreciate in 1995, when its annual average
was around Krb160,000 per US$1.
<P>
<b>Banking</b>
<P>
Following increased instability in the local commercial banking sector in 1995, the NBU plans
to strengthen banking regulations in 1996. At the end of 1995, only 50 per cent of the
country's 200 or so commercial banks had raised their capitalisation ratios to the minimum
level set by the NBU in that year (US$1.3 million). Other troublesome areas include the high
levels of non-performing assets in the indebted state industrial sector, bank illiquidity and a
reluctance on the part of smaller banks to consolidate into larger and more viable units.
Popular confidence in the integrity of local banks remains very low.<br>
Following increased pressure from the IMF, restricted hard currency trading and foreign trade
regulations were partly liberalised in 1995. This could bring with it the repatriation of illegally
exported capital from foreign banks in 1996-97. Although up on 1994, local hard currency
reserves remained relatively precarious at around US$1 billion at the end of 1995. Low NBU
hard currency reserves are another major reason why Ukraine still lacks a proper national
currency.
<P>
<b>Privatisation</b>
<P>
Earlier envisaged to run in tandem with macro-economic stabilisation, more radical structural
reform of the local economy continued to be avoided for essentially political reasons in 1995.
Earlier imposed by parliament and then rescinded by the new Kuchma government in late
1994, a wholesale moratorium on any sort of large-scale privatisation remained in effect in
practice in 1995. During 1995, the government and the State Property Fund (SPF) agreed
the disposal of 8,000 enterprises, but in the event only 2,700 were nominally privatised
through insider-orientated manager-employee buyouts at a discount. Strong opposition in the
Council of Peoples' Deputies (CPD) and the left-wing parties in the national parliament
helped to slash these privatisation plans.<br>
In November 1995, the parliament voted to shift control of privatisation from the SPF to the
CPD, although this contradicted earlier presidential decrees on the subject and the 1992
Privatisation Law. Concomitantly, the parliament also voted against any further privatisation
of the valuable energy sector, where the state oil company, Ukrnafta, had been partly
privatised earlier in 1995.<br>
By the end of 1995 the SPF had privatised 13,000 enterprises. Totalling around 60,000
businesses and mainly located in the service sector, Ukraine's small enterprises should have
been privatised by the end of 1994. In 1995, the SPT envisaged the disposal of 23,000 such
enterprises, but only managed to sell-off 58 per cent of this target figure. Among other things,
this has limited the extent of the official private-sector in Ukraine.<br>
Political factors aside, Ukrainian privatisation has also been hindered by an inadequate legal
framework in the country. Popular apathy is also another major problem. As in other CIS
republics, the lack of proper privatisation has created endless opportunities for insider
corruption that has had the effect of discrediting the whole notion of privatisation among a
jaded and indifferent populace.<br>
Ukraine's poor privatisation record to date has been a major cause of concern for the IMF
and the World Bank. In December 1995, when the government announced its economic
programme for 1996, accelerated privatisation was said to be a key priority, but this claim
had little credibility externally.<br>
To further complicate matters, SPF privatisation is intimately bound up with relations with
Russia. Agreed under IMF auspices in March 1995, when Ukraine rescheduled US$2.5 billion
worth of energy supply debts to Russia, Russian debt for equity swaps have proved to be
highly politically controversial in practice. One reason for this is that Russian interest in
Ukrainian assets has been focused on the country's valuable energy sector. One casualty of
this in 1996 could be the Ukrainian-Russian joint venture, Gaztranzit, an entity created in
1995 using privatised local assets as part of its start-up capital. Politically, any reimposition
of direct Russian control over Ukrainian pipeline networks, gas reserves and other valuable
assets is strongly opposed by nationalists in the western Ukraine.
<P>
<b>Agriculture</b>
<P>
Accounting for 30 per cent of GDP in 1995, agriculture-food processing remains of vital
economic importance in Ukraine. However, agricultural output continues to decline, with
agricultural output falling by an estimated 30 per cent, compared to a fall of 17 per cent in
1994. One result of this has been a rapid rise in imports of foodstuffs. Apart from the adverse
weather conditions of 1995, the major structural causes of this decline in agricultural output
are slow land reform, low investment and energy shortages. Externally, continued state
subsidies to the agricultural and industrial sectors were one of the major causes of Ukraine's
problems with the IMF in 1995-96.<br>
Land reform remains seriously incomplete in Ukraine. Introduced in 1995, a new government
land code designed to speed up rural privatisation was finally rejected in a key parliamentary
vote in November 1995. No real progress is expected on this issue in 1996.<br>
The government is increasingly trying to keep the favour of the country's powerful agricultural
lobby, particularly by waiving all tax on rural incomes paid in kind in 1995. Direct and indirect
state subsidies for the agricultural sector are substantial in Ukraine and, in 1996, the
government may reimpose tariffs on foodstuff imports. In January 1996, administrative
controls for certain foodstuffs were reimposed. In 1996, the government plans to create a
new State Committee for Land Resources, but it remains unclear how this will help matters
locally.
<P>
<b>Foreign trade</b>
<P>
Although official figures continue to be contradictory on this question, Ukraine's foreign trade
performance seems set to remain in difficulties for many years to come. In 1995 total
nominal foreign trade turnover was around US$20 billion, or around two-thirds of officially
declared GDP in that year. Amounting to around US$10.2 billion in both 1994 and 1995,
exports are stagnant.<br>
More exports were sold for hard currency outside the CIS in 1995 than in 1994. Exports to
Russia in particular continue to decline. In 1995, exports to Russia accounted for 45 per cent
of the total, compared to 55 per cent in 1994. Barter trade with the rest of the CIS remained
substantial at around 35 per cent of the total value of goods exported in 1995. Unofficially,
large-scale cross-border barter trade is almost certainly far higher than that suggested by
official figures, notably in relation to imports from Russia.<br>
On the imports side, payments difficulties led to a fall in imports in 1995, down to around
US$9.8 billion, compared to US$10.1 billion in 1994. Even more than was the case in 1994,
Ukrainian imports of energy supplies from Russia continued to decline in 1995. In 1995,
imports from Russia and the rest of the CIS accounted for 52 per cent of the total, compared
to around two-thirds of the total in 1994. Concomitantly, imports from the EU continued to
rise.<br>
Exports continue to shift from higher added value manufactured goods in favour of lower
value primary production, semi-manufactures and raw materials, notably in relation to the
EU. Non-energy imports, on the other hand, continue to be dominated by higher value
manufactures from the EU. Another negative trend is higher foodstuff and consumer goods
imports in recent years.<br>
Following on from lower imports in 1995, Ukraine's foreign trade balance was officially
US$400 million. Unofficially, in fact, it may then have been in growing deficit. In relation to
the rest of the CIS, the total trade deficit was US$1.1 billion in 1995. Although an
improvement over 1994, when this deficit with the rest of the CIS was US$1.7 billion, this
large foreign trade imbalance with Russia in particular is Ukraine's main foreign trade
problem.<br>
Earlier mainly covered by barter transfers, more of this deficit has had to be financed with
hard currency in recent years. Payments difficulties and mutually non-convertible national
currencies have hurt Ukrainian trade with the rest of the CIS.<br>
Outside the CIS, where Ukraine now runs a surplus in its trade with the EU, the country's
terms of trade continued to improve in 1995, mainly because of lower imports. So far,
however, Ukraine has made relatively little progress in decisively shifting its foreign trade
away from the CIS and towards the EU.<br>
On the current account, high foreign debt servicing outlays, including those payable to
Russia for past energy supplies, resulted in a record deficit of US$1.7 billion in 1995. In 1995,
service income was also less than expected, notably for gas transit fees from Russia. For
1996, Ukraine has demanded higher gas transit fees, but may not get them because of
continued Russian leverage over energy supplies and debts.<br>
Difficulties with the IMF led to lower than expected capital inflows from abroad in 1995-96.
Local direct foreign investment (DFI) also remained relatively low at around US$600 million
at the end of 1995. On a more positive note, the US$2.7 billion pledged by the EU and the
G7 for the replacement of the nuclear power facilities at Chernobyl will help to strengthen
Ukraine's capital account over the next five years.
<P>
<b>Foreign debt and payments</b>
<P>
Including outstanding and more recent energy supply debts to Russia, Ukraine's total foreign
debt at the end of 1995 was around US$9 billion, or 50 per cent higher than its level of US$6
billion at the end of 1994. Totalling US$3.5 billion at the end of 1994, energy supply debts to
Russia and other CIS states reached nearly US$5 billion at the end of 1995. Despite
rescheduling US$2.5 billion worth of energy supply debts to Russia under IMF auspices in
March 1995, Ukraine has been unable to meet many of its debt servicing obligations to
Russia.<br>
Because of its difficulties with the IMF in 1995-96, Ukraine's new foreign borrowings outside
the CIS have been less than expected over the last year or so. As of January 1996, less than
half of the US$1.5 billion provided by the IMF in June 1995 had actually been disbursed.
Similar problems then attended the disbursement of a related US$500 million loan package
from the World Bank. Worth up to US$2 billion in total, the complete disbursement of these
loans in 1996 is now dependent on another agreement with the IMF.<br>
Other than the IMF and the World Bank, a number of other official creditors have also
recently agreed to increase their lending to Ukraine in 1996. These include a US$130 million
loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD); a US$230
million trade credit from Japan's Export-Import Bank; and US$225 million worth of foreign aid
credits from the US government.<br>
The political importance of Ukraine to the US is reflected in the fact that it is now the largest
single recipient of US foreign aid in the CIS. Having recently entered into closer relations with
the EU, Ukraine may also be eligible for increased loans from the European Investment Bank
in due course. Of the US$2.3 billion recently provided for the replacement of the Chernobyl
nuclear facilities over the next five years, the EU is by far the largest contributor in the G7.
Within the EU, the largest single official creditor of the EU is Germany, followed by France
and the UK.
<P>
<b>DFI</b>
<P>
Direct foreign investment in Ukraine remains relatively limited. Over 1994, however, 1995
was the best year yet for new DFI. Totalling US$350 million at the end of 1994, DFI
increased to US$783 million by the end of 1995.<br>
In 1996, the government is hoping to see new DFI of up to US$350 million, mainly through
more generous tax incentives for foreign investors. In order to improve the co-ordination of
DFI inflows the government established the Ukrainian Credit and Investment Company. By
countries of origin, most DFI in Ukraine has been from the US, followed by Germany and
France in the EU. Sectorally, DFI has so far been concentrated in food-processing, services
and light manufacturing. Other promising areas for increased DFI include energy, notably
offshore in the Black Sea. The Ukrainian energy sector is also of interest to Russian
investors at the present time.
<P>
<b>Outlook</b>
<P>
Despite increased hopes of more radical political and economic reform in the Ukraine in
1995, this did not happen in practice. As a result, considerable uncertainty continues to
surround the future political and economic prospects of the Ukraine.
The old conflict between the parliament and Kuchma continues, with matters further
complicated by a divided Cabinet. The result of this has been inconsistent and ineffective
policy making. At worst, all this could lead the Ukraine back to the political paralysis of the
early 1990s.<br>
Regionally, the Crimean problem and the east-west division of the Ukraine remain
unresolved and the future course of Ukrainian-Russian relations is becoming more uncertain.
Closer Ukrainian relations with Russia may be unavoidable in the longer-term.
Beyond the CIS, western support for the Ukraine is not unconditional, and is being
compromised by its economic failings; the IMF will be wanting to see some substantial
improvements before it will continue to support the country - 1996 is likely to prove a key
year in this respect. In the longer-term, radical economic reform is as unavoidable in Ukraine
as in the rest of the CIS, but much now remains unclear and uncertain as to how this will be
done, when and with what consequences.

<h2>Political Structure</h2>
</CENTER>
A nationally elected presidency was instituted on 1 December 1991. The 450 member
Supreme Rada (Council) is the highest legislative body, with the president holding executive
power. The president is elected for a five year term and appoints the prime minister and the
cabinet, which the Supreme Rada have to approve.
The Ukrainian political system still operates on the basis of the old Soviet constitution.
Numerous amendments and alterations have left the division of power unclear and confused,
with neither parliament nor the president willing to accept alternative constitutional proposals
from each other.<br>
Local government is based on 24 regional divisions (oblasts) and one autonomous republic
(Crimea). The oblasts are further divided into rayons.

<h2>Political Situation</h2>
</CENTER>
<P>
Head of state: President Leonid Kuchma (from 10 July 1994).<br>Head of government: Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko (from 28 May 1996).<br>At the end of the First World War Ukraine disintegrated - six separate factions fought for control with Kiev changing hands five times in one year. Western Ukraine was ceded to Poland as an international protectorate, with the eastern half eventually falling to the Bolsheviks, supported by Russia. Ukraine became a founding member of the USSR in 1922 and was rewarded by Stalin with an engineered famine in 1932 and 1933, killing between five and seven million people.<br>The Ukrainian steppes were one of the bloodiest of the Second World War battlefields with an estimated six million Ukrainians dying during the conflict. At the end of the war the USSR retained the Polish area of Ukraine it had invaded in 1939. Guerrilla resistance to the Soviet regime, particularly in the nationalist western areas continued into the 1950s as millions of Ukrainians were sent to Siberia on suspicion of `disloyalty'. The combination of war, famine and purges are thought to have cost the lives of half the male population and one quarter of the female population between 1900 and 1950.<br>Although Ukraine's history is characterised by domination and subjugation, the Ukrainian nationalist movement, although rigorously suppressed never died (the national anthem is `Ukraine has not died yet').<br>The explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in April 1986 marked a turning point for Ukraine. The failure of a Soviet showpiece and the subsequent delay in admitting the disaster released pent up nationalist feelings. By 1990 the Ukrainian People's Movement for Restructuring (Rukh), an independence movement, won local elections across the republic, with the greatest gains in the west where control of the Lvov city council was won. Protest marches organised by students in Kiev during October 1990 forced the resignation of the communist prime minister.<br>Following the failed Moscow coup attempt in August 1991 the Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU) was banned and in December 1991 90 per cent of the population voted for independence in a national referendum. The former chairman of the CPU, Leonid Kravchuk, was elected president. However a second vote of no confidence forced the government to resign in September 1992, as their inexperience, tension with the west and Russia and economic collapse caught up with them.<br>Differences between western and eastern Ukraine grew following independence, with those in the west looking to create a strong national identity and close links with western Europe, while the more Russified east wanted to retain close ties with Russia. The adoption of Ukrainian as the official national language in 1990 caused controversy, with the majority of eastern Ukrainians speaking only Russian while those in the west demanded that Ukrainian should be enforced as the only language. The severe economic crisis experienced during the first five years of independence exacerbated regional differences and held back much needed structural reforms.<br>Ukraine's first free parliamentary elections in March 1994, which centred around the disintegrating economy and the east-west split, saw the recovery of the CPU which won 86 seats, the largest single block, followed by Rukh with 20.<br>The presidential election in July 1994 was also fought over these differences, with the pro-Russian Leonid Kuchma (a former prime minister) beating the nationalist Kravchuk. The voting pattern mirrored the geographical split between east and west. Kuchma has championed the strong reformist policies his predecessor was unwilling to introduce and (slightly surprisingly) reasserted Ukraine's independence from Russia. However, vocal opposition from hard-line communist deputies have slowed the reform process and prevented the president from implementing the widespread reforms desperately needed.Prime Minister Vitaly Masol, originally appointed by Leonid Kravchuk, was forced to resigned in March 1995 after his anti-reform stance finally proved too much for President Kuchma. His replacement, Yevhenii Marchuk (a former head of the Ukrainian secret service), lasted only slightly longer. He was sacked in May 1996 after criticism from the president that he was pursuing his own political career rather than managing the economy. Kuchma's third prime minister, Pavlo Lazarenko, is a close ally of the president and a former collective farm manager. Lazarenko, whose reformist credentials are limited, was promoted from first deputy prime minister.<br>In May 1995 parliament approved a bill increasing the power of the president and enabling him to select his cabinet without parliamentary scrutiny. The legislation also gives the president the right to issue decrees guiding the economic reform process and overrule recalcitrant local authorities.<br>By June 1996 Ukraine still had no official constitution, with a draft proposal rejected by parliament in April 1996. Apart from a few modifications Ukraine has continued to use the constitution of the former Soviet Union, which has left the division of power between the president and parliament hopelessly confused. Frequent clashes between the president and parliament have hindered the reform process. Adoption of a constitution clearly defining presidential and parliamentary powers is essential; progress in this direction has been prevented because of disputes between the two sides.<br>Ukrainian control over the separatist Crimean peninsular, a predominantly Russian populated area ceded to Ukraine by Russia in 1954, increased in 1995. Direct rule was imposed in March 1995, although the region's autonomy was not revoked. The Russian experience in Chechnya and a more conciliatory tone from Kiev reduced the possibility of Russian intervention in the Crimea, and a constitutional rather than a violent secessionist solution remains the long-term likelihood. Pro-Russian groups were well beaten in local elections in June 1995 leading to the election of a Crimean leadership favouring closer links with Kiev.The cancellation by the Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, of a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart in April 1996 for the sixth time was blamed on continuing differences over the status of the Sevastopol port on the Crimean peninsular, with both nations demanding that their navies be stationed there. The fate of the 300 strong Black Sea Fleet was agreed in June 1995, when Ukraine gave most of its share to Russia. Although any threat to Ukraine's sovereignty is remote, relations between the two states are highly sensitive with the nationalistic posturing of Russian politicians in the run up to the June 1996 Russian presidential elections not helping the situation.<br>Ukraine joined NATO's Partnership for Peace Programme in September 1995, however full membership is unlikely, with strong Russian opposition to NATO expansion into the former communist bloc in central Europe, let alone the former USSR.<P>

<b>Summary</b>
<P>
Ukraine has suffered a severe economic crisis since independence; GDP fell by 11.8 per
cent in 1995 following a decline of about 50 per cent between 1990 and 1994. Although the
1995 economic performance was an improvement, the continued intransigence of the left-
wing dominated parliament has prevented significant progress with the privatisation
programme, with only 39 per cent of 8,000 medium and large-scale enterprise and 51 per
cent of small enterprises privatised during 1995. The government had planned to privatise
them all. The 1996 privatisation programme is as ambitious as in previous years, with the
sale of small enterprises due for completion by July.<br>
From a high of 4,735 per cent in 1993 inflation fell to 380 per cent in 1995, with the monthly
rate down to 2.4 per cent by April 1996 as the central bank's tight monetary policy hit home.
Until a structural reform programme capable of cultivating and encouraging a genuine private
sector (rather than partly restructured state enterprises) is undertaken, the `bread-basket' of
the USSR will be left wallowing in economic decline.
<P>
<b>Background</b>
<P>
Leonid Kravchuk's spell as president saw little progress in introducing the reforms necessary
to create the stable and liberal environment essential to the establishment of a market
economy. The communist dominated parliament elected in 1994 has made life difficult for
his successor Leonid Kuchma. No significant progress has been made in creating a dynamic
private sector capable of dragging the Ukrainian economy out of Soviet, state-owned mode
and into a free market system. Large state enterprises have continued to receive subsidies
as the government proves incapable of consigning the central planning system to history,
while attempting a few half-way reform measures. Political connections (the ability to obtain
subsidies) are the measure of success at the enterprise level, rather than quality and
efficiency.<br>
Ukraine contributed 20 per cent to the USSR's economy, but the decline has been rapid
since independence. Disagreements with Russia combined with total dependence on Russian
energy supplies (which were raised to world price levels after the collapse of the USSR) have
exacerbated Ukraine's foreign trade problem. The guaranteed supplies and markets of the
Soviet era are a thing of the past, with Ukraine's industrial enterprises struggling to survive
against the backdrop of domestic decline and increased competition.<br>
Government subsidies have avoided mass unemployment but slowed the reform process
and the creation of a private sector. By 1994 a mere 10 per cent of Ukrainian enterprises
were in the private sector, producing 20 per cent of GDP compared to 40 per cent in Russia.
The introduction of competitive forces and world prices caused inflation to soar to a
staggering 4,735 per cent in 1993. Not surprisingly wages have failed to keep up with the
price rises, leading to falling purchasing power and living standards.<br>
The worst of the recession has been weathered, with the five year decline bottoming out
slightly in 1995 with GDP `only' falling by 11.8 per cent compared to 23 per cent in 1994. The
1995 budget deficit was greater than expected as the government granted subsidies in order
to prevent mass unemployment, despite estimated `hidden' unemployment of 3.6 million, 13
per cent of the workforce.<br>
Almost the entire formal economy remains monopolised with a high degree of integration and
concentration. Regional leaders, particularly in the agricultural sector, have retained the
power and influence they enjoyed in the communist era. When combined with the communist
deputies in parliament they have prevented the widespread structural reforms essential for
the creation of a functioning market economy.
<P>
<b>Macro-economic performance</b>
<P>
The Ukrainian economy shrank by 11.8 per cent in 1995. Although an improvement on 1994
when GDP fell by 23 per cent, five years of declining output are a strong indication of the
failure of the economic reform programme.<br>
The reduction of inflation from 21 per cent a month in January 1995 to 2.4 per cent by April
1996 helped to give the karbovanets (the `temporary' currency introduced in November
1992) some real value and also kept the international financial institutions happy. The
government's tight monetary policy has been one of its few successes, however further price
liberalisation due in 1996 will increase inflationary pressures.<br>
Ukraine's external debt grew from US$6 billion in 1994 to US$8 billion by 1 January 1996.
Approximately US$4.6 billion is owed to other former Soviet Republics, principally Russia
and Turkmenistan for energy supplies. Western financial institutions were owed US$2.1
billion. Ukraine reached an agreement in March 1995 to restructure US$2.5 billion of its debt
to Russia.<br>
By the beginning of June 1996 only 60 per cent of housing and utility costs were met by
charges to the population. The government plans to remove all subsidies by the end of 1996.
<P>
<b>Monetary policy</b>
<P>
The central bank's tight monetary policy has provided the government with its one economic
success story, reducing inflation to 2.4 per cent a month by April 1996.<br>
Hyper-inflation in 1993 forced the government and the central bank to increase the
refinancing rate to 300 per cent by the end of 1994. The policy proved successful as inflation
fell from 891 per cent in 1994 to 380 per cent in 1995.<br>
By mid-1995 the rate had fallen to 60 per cent, however it was forced up again as inflation
increased to 5.2 per cent a month in May 1995. Since the beginning of 1996 the central bank
has again reduced the refinancing rate as inflation fell. By May 1996 it stood at 70 per cent.
<P>
<b>External aid</b>
<P>
Support from the international financial organisations is vital, with hard currency loans
essential to pay for Russian oil and gas and other imports. With loans and credits to Ukraine
dependent on the government's reform programme President Kuchma is faced with a stark
choice: give in to the communist dominated parliament and reign in the reform programme
and therefore lose the support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, or
attempt to follow the recommendations of the financial institutions and further alienate
parliament and the subsidy hungry industrial and agricultural enterprises.<br>
The pressures facing the president caused the IMF to refuse the release of the second half of
a US$1.5 billion stand-by loan in January 1996 after a larger than expected budget deficit
and the central bank had been forced to print more money by parliament. The loan was
renegotiated with an extra US$200 million added, however the IMF froze it again in April
1996 after the government overshot its first quarter spending target. The adoption of a
revised 1996 state budget enabled the IMF to resume its programme of stand-by loans in
May 1996. A budget deficit equivalent to 6.2 per cent of GDP was agreed by both sides, an
increase from the initial 6 per cent. The extra deficit will be covered by National Bank credits
worth about US$200 million. The US$900 million loan will be granted in US$100 million
tranches over a nine month period. Ukraine received US$760 million in stand-by credits from
the IMF during 1995.<br>
The importance of external financing and aid to Ukraine is clearly demonstrated when
compared with foreign direct investment. By the end of 1995 foreign investment totalled
US$783 million; external aid equalled US$1.65 billion.<br>
The major loans granted to Ukraine include: a US$160 million credit facility from the
European Union (EU), the first US$50 million of which was released in June 1996 with a
second US$50 million instalment due in September 1996 and the remainder before the end
of the year; the Japanese Eximbank agreed to grant Ukraine an economic stabilisation loan
of US$235 million in January 1996; and the USA agreed commercial credits and grants worth
US$119 million for the 1996 fiscal year in February 1996.<br>
Balance of payment loans include Ecu220 million from the EU in 1995 and US$250 million
from the USA in direct support for the 1995 balance of payment.<br>
About half of the US$1.65 billion in aid received by the beginning of 1996 had gone on
technical assistance (consultancy fees).
<P>
<b>Budget</b>
<P>
In 1992 the budget deficit was equivalent to a massive 30.4 per cent of GDP. This was
reduced to 11.6 per cent in 1993 and 8.6 per cent in 1994. Although the deficit fell again in
1995 to 4.1 per cent (according to IMF rather than government figures which put the deficit at
about 8.1 per cent of GDP), this was still above the 3 per cent target of the IMF as the
government continued to release subsidies to industrial enterprises.<br>
The 1996 deficit was initially predicted at 6 per cent, however this was increased to 6.2 per
cent in May 1996 following an agreement with the IMF. The deficit will be financed by foreign
loans (US$1 billion), government bonds (US$800 million) and National Bank credits (US$600
million).
<P>
<b>Economic outlook</b>
<P>
GDP is expected to fall by only 1.8 per cent in 1996, with the first post-Soviet growth
predicted for 1997. The government is also predicting small increases in industrial output (up
0.8 per cent) and agriculture (up 0.2 per cent). Inflation in 1996 is expected to be between 50
and 55 per cent.<br>
With vast agricultural potential and the second largest market in the region, after Russia, the
longer-term future of Ukraine is more encouraging. However, until real structural reforms
take place, particularly privatisation in the industrial sector, the Ukrainian economy will
continue to stagnate. The first, small, signs of macro-economic stability were experienced in
1995, however such stabilisation remains fragile, particularly with the anti-reform left-wing
parties dominating parliament and powerful local forces remaining opposed to change.

<h3>Overview of State Sector</h3>
Background and government policy<br>
<P>
The political intransigence of Ukraine's first democratically elected government meant that by
the end of 1992, 96 per cent of the economy remained in state hands. By 1994 a mere 10
per cent of enterprise were in the private sector, producing 20 per cent of GDP.
Private sector companies face numerous daunting challenges attempting to survive in the
face of state sector monopolies and restricted practices. Wholesale, state-owned, trade
organisations prevent private companies gaining access to the supply and distribution
networks vital to their success.<br>
Parliament is determined to retain control and prevent the privatisation of as many areas of
the economy as possible. Gas and oil enterprises have been removed from the privatisation
programme and communist deputies have attempted to renationalise agricultural enterprises.

<h3>Manufacturing and Service Industry</h3>
<b>Summary</b><br>
<P>
Seen as a strength upon independence, Ukraine's vast industrial complex (much of it military
orientated) has proved anything but. Highly concentrated and integrated it has proved almost
immune to the weak restructuring efforts of the government. Production has collapsed as
subsidy dependent enterprises found themselves ill-equipped and prepared to cope with the
advent of market forces. Saddled with outdated, inefficient and poorly maintained equipment
the dire financial state of most enterprises, with many unable to pay their workers, has
prevented any investment in new equipment or techniques.<br>
Industrial output fell a disastrous 28 per cent in 1994, and although the 9 per cent fall in 1995
was not as bad, chronic energy shortages and huge inter-enterprise arrears prevented any
recovery in output.
<P>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
The Ukrainian industrial sector is concentrated around the heavy industries of the
metallurgical, mining and mechanical engineering sectors. However, raw material shortages,
the disappearance of guaranteed markets in the former Soviet Union, obsolete equipment
and the complete lack of the finance required to improve production methods and quality has
left the sector struggling for survival.<br>
Ukraine inherited a vast industrial complex from the USSR. In 1989 Ukraine produced 34 per
cent of the Soviet Union's steel, 46 per cent of iron ore, 53 per cent of sugar and 36 per cent
of all television sets. However the industrialised legacy of the former USSR has proved more
of a handicap than a help, with massive industrial dinosaurs sucking up state credits while
contributing less and less to the economy.<br>
State subsidies, particularly for energy, have prevented any major reforms. No large state-
owned enterprises have been closed down, as weak factories survive on cheap credits and
inter-enterprise debt. Bankruptcy is a taboo subject and with President Kuchma's supporters
concentrated in the industrialised eastern half of Ukraine, it is likely to remain so.
Ukraine's enterprises are mired in a massive debt trap; by 1 March 1996 the country's
enterprises owed a total of Krb3,949.7 trillion and were themselves owed Krb2,946.1 trillion.
Confusion over taxation (particularly value added tax on exports), a tax system that favours
imports, incomplete bankruptcy legislation, lengthy delays in the restructuring process and
the high proportion of barter trade are the principle problems.
<P>
<b>Recent output</b>
<P>
Industrial output fell by 11.5 per cent in 1995 according to the government, a significant
improvement on the disastrous fall of 28 per cent in 1994. Chronic energy shortages were the
main cause of falling output, with the removal of state energy subsidies for local enterprises
in December 1994 a further blow.<br>
Industrial output fell 2.5 per cent in the first four months of 1996, compared to a fall of 12.7
per cent on the corresponding period in 1995. The worst performing sector was light industry,
particularly textiles, while output from the metallurgy sector began to stabilise.

<b>Defence industry</b>
<P>
Ukraine had the most advanced rocket industry in the former Soviet Union and was also a
major producer of tanks and aircraft.<br>
Since independence the arms sector has remained a substantial export earner. In 1995
earnings from the industry were estimated at Krb2.93 billion, with prices often 20 per cent
cheaper than other international manufacturers. Weapons on offer from Ukraine include the
T-84 and T-90 tanks, Grad missile launchers and equipment, Tu-160 and Tu-95 MS strategic
bombers and missile carriers. Russia, India, Pakistan and several Latin American states are
among the largest customers. The defence industry has been excluded from the privatisation
programme. The industry has survived mainly because of the high standard of product, with
the majority of specialists in the sector remaining in Ukraine. The production of NATO
standard weapons is planned.<br>
Three projects totalling US$64 million were agreed in October 1995 to convert military
production facilities to commercial joint ventures. The United States Department of Defense
contributed US$47 million in contract awards, with the American companies involved
contributing US$17 million in cash, technology and licensing. The contracts include the
conversion of Monolit, a manufacturer of aircraft, spacecraft and missile systems, into a
manufacturer of digital instrumentation and control systems for nuclear power stations; the
creation of a joint venture with Meridian of Kiev to convert an electronic and radar equipment
facility into a factory manufacturing die cast consumer products; and a joint venture between
the American Industrial Development Corporation and Orizon.<br>
The conversion of naval shipbuilding yards into commercial yards began in 1992 when a joint
venture at the Zaliv shipyard in Kerch on the Crimean coast was established by Pepsi-Cola
and Fram Shipping, a Bermuda based shipping company. The first three ships of an order for
six product tankers were delivered in mid-1995. A well trained and low wage labour force also
attracted a British joint venture in 1995. British Ukrainian Shipbuilders was formed by the
London based Ukrainian Development Corporation and the Ukrainian ministry responsible for
military production and developing commercial activities. The venture plans to construct hulls
at Ukrainian yards using local steel with the remaining equipment and services supplied by
UK companies. British Ukrainian Shipbuilders will construct 70,000 tonne bulk carriers for
between US$25 and US$26 million, compared to US$34 million in Japan or US$30 million in
South Korea.<br>
The once important satellite rocket industry received a boost in December 1995 with the
signing of the Sea Launch Project in Norway. The US$600 million programme involves 60
commercial satellite launches using Ukrainian rockets, with the first launch due in 1998. The
project includes Norway (which will provide a disused oil platform from which to launch the
rockets in the Pacific Ocean), the USA (principally through the Boeing aircraft company) and
Russia (which will provide the engines for the Ukrainian Zenit booster rockets). The NPO-
Yuzhmash plant in central Ukraine, the largest rocket nuclear missile plant in the world during
the Soviet era, has re-orientated production to commercial rockets and now manufactures
the Zenit rockets. The plant was formerly run by President Kuchma. Zenit boosters will also
be used to launch 20 American Government backed satellites, 11 within the Sea Launch
programme. Ukraine has also won a tender to launch 36 satellites for the US
communications company Global Star.
<P>
<b>Automobile industry</b>
<P>
Ukraine was a major manufacturer of buses, trucks and cars in the Soviet Union, however
demand from the other republics has collapsed. As with other sectors dependent on the
markets of the USSR the automobile industry has struggled to compete internationally, and
with domestic demand slumping as living standards decline the sector is in desperate need of
investment and rationalisation.<br>
Ukraine's largest car manufacturer, AO AvtoZAZ, requires investment of US$800 million in
order to modernise and replace existing machinery and equipment. The plant produced
59,000 cars in 1995, down from 150,000 during the 1970s and 1980s. The government is
trying to attract a foreign investor willing to commit the finance necessary to increase output
to 300,000 units a year. The plant, in the eastern city of Zaporizha, employs about 29,000,
with a further 130 firms dependent on its survival.<br>
The Italian truck manufacturer Iveco set up a joint venture with the Ukrainian truck company
Kremenchug Automobile Plant (KrAZ) in 1995. Iveco-KrAZ plan to produce 2,000 trucks in
1996 and 30,000 a year by 2000. Iveco, a subsidiary of Fiat, invested US$60 million for a 35
per cent stake in the joint venture with a further US$40 million to be invested in new
equipment and upgraded production facilities. The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) took a 30 per cent stake for US$18 million with KrAZ (Ukraine's largest
commercial vehicle manufacturer) holding the remaining 35 per cent.
<P>
<b>Metallurgical industry</b>
<P>
Ukraine is the fourth largest steel producer in the world (after Japan, Russia and the USA).
There are 10 integrated steel plants, the largest three at Krivoy Roj, Azovstal and Iliyich. In
the international markets Ukrainian products can only compete at the lower quality end of the
market.<br>
Ukraine steel exports to the EU are regulated by a two year quota agreement which expires
at the end of 1996. If subsidies to the industry are cut and EU style regulations limiting future
state subsidies are adopted, a free trade agreement with the EU on steel exports is possible.
Ukraine's sole alumina refinery at Nykolayev produced 996,000 tonnes of alumina in 1995.
Output is predicted to reach 1.03 million tonnes in 1996, with production increasing to 1.5
million tonnes by 2000. Total capacity of the plant is over one million tonnes a year.
Aluminium smelters in Russia and Tajikistan received 90 per cent of the plant's output, with
the majority of ore coming from Guyana in west African. Aluminium output fell to 95,100
tonnes in 1995, down 2.7 per cent on 1994. Ukraine's only aluminium smelter is in Zaporizha.
<P>
<b>Light industry</b>
<P>
Ukraine's largest textile factories are centred around Kherson, Kiev, Ternapol and Donetsk
(cotton); Zhytomyr and Rivne (linen); Lugansk, Odessa and Chernihiv (woollen fabrics); and
Kiev and Cherkasy (silk). Although well developed the textile, leather and footwear industries
do not satisfy domestic demand.<br>
The Swedish-Swiss engineering group Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) formed a joint venture with
the Ukrainian Rovno High-Voltage Equipment Plant in April 1996. ABB will invest US$19
million over a five year period in return for a 51 per cent stake in the ABB REVA venture
which will manufacture high and mid-voltage switches.
<P>
<b>Services</b>
<P>
The service sector is one of the most underdeveloped areas of the economy and therefore
one with great potential. Tourism in particular offers possibilities, although large-scale
investment is required to upgrade existing facilities and develop new resorts.<br>
The Crimean Black Sea resorts, centred around Yalta, were the traditional summer retreats
of the Tsarist courts and Soviet Politburo. However Ukrainian independence and tension
between the region's Russian population and the Kiev Government has deterred Russian and
Ukrainian holidaymakers. Those with the disposable income now jet off to the south of
France, Italy and Turkey leaving the tourist industry struggling. Yalta's hotels operated at
about 70 per cent capacity during the 1995 summer, compared to a decade earlier when
demand exceeded supply. The number of tourists visiting the Crimea was two million in
1994, falling from a peak of between eight and 10 million during the 1980s. Tourism is the
main industry in the Crimea, with 635 resorts and hotels with 142,000 rooms. The Black Sea
coast has enormous tourism potential, with a good climate and excellent beaches and
coastline.<br>
The first foreign involvement in Crimea's tourist industry was announced in October 1995. A
Canadian consortium of Smith Carter and Hemisphere Engineering announced a US$6.6
million plan to renovate and operate the Hotel Tavrida in Yalta.<br>
Kiev is due to receive its first five-star hotel by 1999. Central European Investments (UK)
agreed to refurbish and operate the Moscow Hotel in April 1996. Previous attempts to open a
western style and quality hotel were blocked by the city council which owns the Intourist
hotels where western prices were charged for Soviet style and standard rooms and service.

<a href="#List"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Labour Market</h3>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
Employers in Ukraine are required to comply with one of three types of labour agreements: agreements of unrestricted duration; agreements for a specified duration; or agreements for the duration of a specific project. Employment contracts also include agreements on working hours (usually a maximum of 41 hours a week), wages, frequency of payment (minimum once a fortnight), holidays etc. Every foreign enterprise employing local workers must have a work register detailing the full information on employment contracts. The register also forms the basis for deducting social contributions and pension claims.<br>
The average wage in October 1995 was US$55.07, an increase from US$30.59 at the end of 1994. In 1995 real wages increased for the first time since independence. A survey at the end of 1995 found that Ukrainians earn on average US$15.90 a month in their official job and a further US$29.30 through secondary activities (private vegetable lots, taxi driving etc).
The proportion of the workforce employed in the service sector had grown to an estimated 41 per cent by 1994, overtaking the traditionally largest employer, industry, which employed 37 per cent. Agriculture employs 19 per cent and mining 3 per cent of the labourforce. The retirement age for men is 60 and for women 55.
<P>
<b>Unemployment situation</b>
<p>
Hidden unemployment of up to 3.6 million by the beginning of 1996 (about 13 per cent of the workforce) is on the rise as workers are left unpaid and part-time employment increases. At the same time the number of officially registered unemployed increased to 139,200 in February 1996, 0.5 per cent of the workforce of 27.6 million.
<P>
<b>Trade unions</b>
<P>
The power and influence of trade unions, traditionally little more than a subservient branch of the communist party, has grown since independence. Their increased strength has been felt particularly in the coal mining sector. A series of strikes in the first few months of 1996 over non-payment of wages put the government under pressure and forced them to water down closure and restructuring plans.

<h3>External Trade</h3>
<b>Summary</b>
<P>
The collapse of the COMECON trading bloc had a detrimental effect on Ukraine's foreign trade as the allocated and free markets of the Soviet period closed almost overnight. Payment problems for Russian oil and gas, now priced at world market levels, has reduced the supply of imported energy, which has contracted industrial output and limited exports.
Trade with the west has declined since independence, with a deficit of US$1.9 billion in 1994 compared to US$1.6 billion in 1993. The demand for imports, centred around energy but including machinery and consumer goods, has increased Ukraine's foreign borrowing. Increasing imports can only be sustained if the country's export performance in western markets improves significantly.
<P>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
The government liberalised the trading environment following independence, with numerous enterprises authorised to undertake external trade. Businesses wishing to carry out foreign trade require must register with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. State sector enterprises remain the dominant force in foreign trade transactions, principally because they have maintained their contacts from the Soviet era.<br>
An interim trading agreement with the EU came into force at the beginning of February 1996. A free trade agreement with Estonia was ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament in February 1996, lifting all trade barriers between the two countries.<br>
Excise duties range from 10 to 200 per cent. Customs duties range from five to 10 per cent on most goods, with luxury goods levied at between 20 and 50 per cent.<br>
Barter trade remains commonplace, especially with the states of the former Soviet Union. Energy imports from Russia, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan dominate Ukraine's foreign trade. The imposition of world market prices forced the government to reduce energy raw material imports and increase the amount of barter deals involving agricultural products in particular.
<P>
<b>Imports</b>
<P>
Import licences are only required for goods which pose a danger to health or the environment. Trade samples of no value are exempt from import duties, as are presentation samples. Samples with a trade value are exempt from duty as long as they are re-exported within 12 months, although that period may be extended.<br>
From 1 July 1995 the government imposed a 15 per cent tax on imported light fuel products and a 15 per cent retail tax on imported petrol and diesel fuel.<br>
Imports in 1995 totalled US$9.8 billion, a fall of US$300 million compared to 1994. States of the former USSR accounted for about 53 per cent of all trade.<br>
Imports from Russia fell by more than US$500 million to about US$5.8 million in 1995, from 59.1 to 51.2 per cent of total imports. Although the economy continued to shrink in 1995 trade with non-Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries increased, with imports growing by 48 per cent an exports by 21 per cent.<br>
Ukrainian imports are centred around energy (from Russia), timber and industrial equipment and machinery.
<P>
<b>Exports</b>
<P>
An October 1994 decree liberalised export operations, with licences only required for grain, scrap metal, pig iron, ferrous and non-ferrous metals. A licence is not required for other goods exported from Ukraine.<br>
Export quotas are applicable to certain goods which are of essential significance to the Ukrainian economy. Legislation preventing the dumping of Ukrainian goods abroad was introduced in 1994. Quota regulations are subject to frequent change.<br>
In 1995 exports were US$10.2 billion. Exports to Russia increased by nearly US$1 billion to over US$5 billion in 1995. Russia's share of Ukrainian exports grew from 39.6 to 43.5 per cent of total exports.<br>
Principle exports include coal, iron ore machinery and manganese ore.

<b>Balance of trade</b>
<P>
The trade deficit in the first quarter of 1996 was US$553.3 million, almost double the US$280 million on the corresponding period in 1995. In 1995 there was a trade surplus of US$400 million, due to lower imports. However government figures are notoriously unreliable. If the black market and unrecorded trade was taken into account it is likely that Ukraine recorded a trade deficit in 1995.<br>
Ukraine's trade deficit with Russia fell from US$42 billion in 1994 to US$1.2 billion in 1995, with Ukrainian exports, particularly of agricultural products, increasing. Ukraine's total trade deficit with the former Soviet Republics was US$1.126 billion in 1995

<a name="Privatisation"></a>
<hr>
<a href="#List"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Privatisation</h3>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
The 1994 privatisation programme succeeded in offering only 700 companies for sale from a planned 1,300 medium and large scale enterprises and about 9,000 small-scale enterprises. A moratorium placed on the privatisation process by parliament in July 1994 halted the programme.<br>
In January 1995 the cabinet attempted to revive the privatisation process by approving an ambitious programme to privatise 22,700 large, medium and small enterprises and 1,200 unfinished construction sites by the end of 1995. However Parliament again blocked the proposals as insufficient (a stalling measure) while adopting a list of objects not subject to privatisation. President Kuchma eventually got his way in June 1995 when he passed a decree `On measures for Providing for Privatisation in 1995'. However privatisation in the first half of the year was minimal: only 2,166 small scale enterprises were privatised from a target of 9,647, and 1,087 large enterprises from a targeted 3,971. The majority of privatisation between 1992 and mid-1995 had taken place through worker buy-outs or leasing association buy-outs on a non-competitive basis.<br>
In July 1995 President Kuchma signed a decree permitting the privatisation and leasing of non-agricultural land for business purposes. The decree increases access to greenfield sites for foreign investors by providing clear ownership rights. Although the decree grants Ukrainian citizens and legal entities the right to privatise land, these rights are not extended to non-residents. However a Ukrainian registered company (subsidiary or joint venture) can participate in the land privatisation process. The sale of the land is carried out by local councils on a competitive bidding basis where more than one party is interested. The decree also resolves the question of ownership of land on which buildings have already been privatised. The purchasers of buildings have the right to buy or lease the land on which their buildings are on. Industrial property can be leased for a maximum 50 years, after which the leasee has the priority right to extend the lease for another 50 years.<br>
The State Property Fund (SPF) is responsible for privatising state enterprises. As state enterprises become desperate for investment the government's attitude to foreign involvement is relaxing, particularly as domestic privatisation does not involve any injection of capital or management experience.<br>
The direct sale of stock to a single strategic investor on the basis of an individual business plan aims to ease the transfer of enterprises on the brink of bankruptcy. To participate in the privatisation process a foreign investor must formally apply through the SPF, whereupon the percentage available to the investor is determined after negotiation. In July 1995 the SPF revealed a list of 15 large enterprises to undergo preparation for privatisation and a further 86 in which foreign participation would be sought - the first time the SPF has made a concerted effort to attract foreign investment.<br>
Reform of the energy sector was planned for 1995, with the monopoly electricity producer broken up into autonomous suppliers competing on the national market and bidding for contracts with local distribution companies. Although most energy prices were liberalised, Kuchma and his cabinet lost their nerve and had put the programme on indefinite hold by the end of 1995. Parliament has removed all energy sector enterprise from the privatisation process.<br>
Residential privatisation has been more successful, with 8.5 million flats privatised between 1993 and mid-1995. There has been no land restitution in Ukraine.<br>
By 1 April 1996, 32.64 million Ukrainian citizens had received privatisation certificates, which have to be used by 31 December 1996 when the mass privatisation of medium and large enterprise is due for completion. The certificates have a nominal value of Krb1 or Krb2 million, with a total value of Krb3,910 billion. A network of regional centres has been established where auctions are held in which Ukrainian citizens can purchase shares with their certificates. Because the certificates are `named' investors cannot obtain, either through sale or gift, certificates which are not in their name, making it extremely difficult to gain a majority holding in an Ukrainian enterprise. Certificates can be acquired through financial intermediaries - trust companies, investment funds and companies. However investors should be very cautious and careful when dealing with financial intermediaries.<br>
The so called `trust companies' are estimated to have defrauded the Ukrainian population of about US$18 million during 1994 after collecting money and privatisation certificates and then disappearing. The first decree on trust companies permitted anybody to register a trust company with a minimum capital of Krb1 million. No licence was required from the national bank. The government was finally forced into action in 1995, suspending 17 companies in April and revoking the licences of 34 in June 1995. Revised accounting and operating regulations were introduced at the end of 1995.<br>
By the beginning of 1996 there were about 600 registered trust companies, 315 of which had licences to operate with privatisation certificates. Violations of tax and operating regulations are common.
<P>
<b>Current programme</b>
<P>
In February 1996 President Kuchma pledged that privatisation would be one of the government's top priorities during 1996 following the limited programme in 1995.
Also in February 1996 the president vetoed a communist backed plant to give a free 51 per cent stake in Ukraine's food industries to collective farm directors, including those enterprises already privatised. Under the proposals the vertical monopoly in the agricultural sector would have been retained, as well as removing about half of the companies due to be sold in the mass privatisation programme. Kuchma vetoed a similar plan in 1995.<br>
The small-scale privatisation programme (including agricultural enterprises) is due to be complete by 1 July 1996.<br> 
The privatisation of Ukraine's most attractive sectors, oil, gas, defence production and agribusinesses has been blocked by parliament. Parliament also banned the privatisation of the gas transit sector in January 1996 due to fears that Russia would gain control of pipelines and storage areas. A gas debt for ownership swop had been proposed.
<P>
<b>Major privatisations</b>
<P>
The purchase of an 88.4 per cent stake for US$25 million in the leading confectionery company Ukraina in February 1995 by Swiss based Kraft Jacob Suchard (a subsidiary of Philip Morris) is exceptional by its rarity. The first large-scale involvement of a foreign investor in Ukraine's privatisation process, the deal was unusual in that Ukrainian citizens were excluded from bidding for shares in the company with their privatisation certificates (the remaining 11.6 per cent was allocated to the workers). The purchase of a majority stake giving absolute operational control, without which Kraft would not have gone ahead, set a precedent whereby the mandatory allocation of shares to the Ukrainian population can be bypassed in order to attract foreign investment.
<P>
<b>Extent of success/failure</b>
<P>
The Ukrainian privatisation programme has failed to attract the investment, and therefore modern equipment, technology and management techniques Ukraine desperately needs. Although the investment environment is improving, the communist dominated parliament is proving a serious obstacle to the privatisation efforts of the president. The drastic restructuring essential to the Ukrainian economy, especially the large state-owned enterprises, is ultimately dependent on a resolution of the conflict between parliament and president.<br>
In 1995 only 39 per cent of about 8,000 medium and large enterprises and 51 per cent of small enterprises were privatised; the government had planned to privatise them all. A combination of the communist controlled parliament, ineffective privatisation bodies and obstructive local authorities left the privatisation process in turmoil.<br>
Privatisation targets were exceeded in the first quarter of 1996. According to the SPF the privatisation of 6,097 enterprises was launched or completed between January and the end of March 1996, including 5,104 small businesses and 941 medium and large businesses. Since 1992 the total number of small firms privatised is 27,297, with over 3,800 medium and large enterprises privatised.

<h3>Banking</h3>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
A two-tier banking structure was created in 1991, with the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) taking the role of the central bank. The five successor banks of the former Soviet state-owned specialist banks dominate the private sector, with a further 220 smaller private banks. Two of the former specialist banks remain directly state-owned with the other three majority owned by state enterprises.
<P>
<b>Role of the central bank</b>
<P>
The central bank is responsible for monetary policy including setting interests rates, regulating and supervising commercial banks and currency regulations.<br>
From January 1995 the minimum capital requirement for new banks was increased to Ecu3 million, to Ecu5 million for minority owned foreign banks and Ecu10 million for majority owned foreign banks. Existing banks were required to increase their capital to Ecu0.5 million by January 1996. Also from January 1995 banks were required to make provisions for possible credit losses. The provision amounts are zero for a standard credit, 5 per cent for satisfactory credits, 30 per cent for marginal credits, 80 per cent for doubtful credits and 100 per cent for irretrievable credits. The upper limit for credit to a single borrower is 40 per cent of the capital.
<P>
<b>Commercial banks</b>
<P>
The Ukrainian banking sector is highly concentrated, with the top five banks holding about 70 per cent of the total banking assets (compared to 33 per cent in Russia).<br>
There were over 220 banks in Ukraine by mid-1995, all but two owned by non-government entities, however the majority of larger banks remain under indirect state control. The State Savings Bank and Foreign Trade Bank are state-owned, while the former state banks Prominvest, Ukraina and Ukrosotsbank have retained their links with industry, agriculture and housing and co-operatives respectively and are owned by state enterprises.<br>
The state-owned banks are the largest and have the most experience, however they continue to make loans to uncreditworthy enterprises which has left them with outstanding debts. The sector has too many small commercial banks and a period of rationalisation is inevitable, with the high levels of inter-enterprise debt exacerbating the situation.<br>
In February 1996 the EBRD announced it was setting up the Kiev International Investment Bank in association with Bank Ukraina and the Ukrainskaya Finansovaya Gruppa. The bank, with a starting capital of Ecu5 million, will be 49 per cent owned by the EBRD with the two Ukrainian banks taking the remaining share.

<h3>Investment and Trading (regulations and policy)</h3>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
A law passed in March 1996 and coming into effect on 1 July 1996 requires all retail trade outlets, currency exchange bureaux and gambling businesses to obtain licences. The licences cost Ecu160 a month for retail traders and between Ecu350 and Ecu8,000 a month for gambling businesses. Trading activities by enterprises and organisations of the Ukrainian co-operative union or domestic producers selling their own products do not require licences.
The Agency for Insurance Protection of Private Entrepreneurship and Small Business was created on 26 July 1995, as was the Fund for Support of Private Entrepreneurship and Small Business Support.<br>
A Law on Bankruptcy was adopted in May 1992, although enforcement has been minimal.
<P>
<b>Foreign investment (regulations and restrictions)</b>
<P>
Foreigners may wholly own and manage limited responsibility partnerships or joint-stock companies with the free repatriation of profits. Approval of the central bank is usually required to transfer convertible currencies abroad. Government approval for foreign investment proposals is only required in joint ventures with state enterprises or in key sectors. Full compensation is payable if private property is expropriated.<br>
All foreign investments must be registered with the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. The registration period for limited liability and joint-stock companies is usually about two months. Licences are required for specific activities including the production and sale of alcohol and tobacco and the exploitation of mineral resources. Applications to establish an enterprise in Ukraine must be submitted to the district or local authority of the area where the business is to be established. Following approval from the local authorities the company will be registered with the Ministry of Finance in order to receive a tax registration number and be eligible for tax exemptions. A karbovanets bank account must also be opened.<br>
Investment options available to foreign investors include acquiring stock through the privatisation process. In February 1996 the government listed over 100 joint stock companies and state-owned enterprises to be privatised with foreign investment. Investors will be chosen on a competitive basis through the sale of blocks of shares. The acquisition of private enterprises (made easier since the beginning of 1996 as the privatisation of small enterprises has speeded up), the creation of joint ventures or developing greenfield sites are also possible.<br>
The Ukrainian foreign investment environment had improved by mid-1996, with the potential rewards of the huge market no longer justifying the inactivity of western companies. With Ukrainians starved of quality goods and services there is little competition to satisfy their growing demand.
<P>
<b>Currency</b>
<P>
Ukraine left the Russian rouble zone in November 1992, introducing the karbovanets (Krb), a `temporary' currency. In January 1993 there were Krb700 to US$1; by December 1994 spiralling inflation sent the exchange rate soaring to around Krb130,000 and in May 1996 the exchange rate was Krb184,200 to the US$1. Hard currency can be changed in hotels or at the numerous street kiosks. Changing money on the black market is illegal and with little difference in the rates not worth it. The sight of illegal money exchangers carrying plastic bags stuffed with notes is a common one in hotel foyers.<br>
The multiple exchange rates were unified in October 1994, with the official rate determined at the Ukrainian Interbank Currency Exchange.<br>
The karbovanets was due to be replaced by a permanent currency, the hryvnia, in October 1995. However, the new currency, printed in 1993 and stored in national bank vaults since then, had not been introduced by June 1996. Failure to stabilise the karbovanets at the end of 1995 led to the postponement of the hryvnia until 1996.<br>
The karbovanets is not convertible and can therefore not be used in international payment transfers, bids and invoices, all of which must be issued in convertible currencies.<br> Businesses registered with the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations can purchase hard currencies to pay for import transactions.<br>
A December 1995 National Bank resolution requires Ukrainian citizens to obtain a licence before receiving hard currency from foreign lenders.<br>
Hard currency transactions were prohibited in mid-1995, affecting the 1,200 businesses permitted to trade in dollars rather than the karbovanets.

<h3>Financial Markets</h3>
<b>Background</b>
<P>
The Ukraine Stock Exchange, founded in 1991, is the most regulated and centralised trading system in Ukraine. The average trading volume in mid-1995 was US$3,000 a day. No independent and transparent share registration and share custody exists and the rights of minority shareholders are not protected. The creation of a state committee to regulate the securities market was decreed in June 1995. The stock exchange also trades investment certificates of investment funds.<br>
At the beginning of 1995 there were 91 exchanges operating in Ukraine, 14 trading in stocks, four in real estate and the remainder in commodities, with trading concentrated in Kiev. The majority of trade took place through an unregulated over-the-counter market.<br>
Ukraine's main currency exchange, the Interbank Currency Exchange, announced it would conduct secondary trading in government securities three times a week from March 1996. The exchange plans to hold daily trading in treasury bills eventually.

<h3>Foreign Investment Activity</h3>
<P>
By the end of 1995 Ukraine had attracted US$783 million in direct foreign investment since independence. Confused and inconsistent taxation laws, slow privatisation and an absence of investment security have hampered government attempts to attract substantial investment. The largest investors in Ukraine are the USA (US$171.4 million), Germany (US$129.6 million) and the UK (US$46.3 million).<br>
During the same period Ukraine has received around US$1.65 billion in aid from the USA and the EU, half of which was spent on `technical assistance' (consultancy fees).

<P>
The level of foreign investment in Ukraine is disproportionately low considering its size and population, only US$11.4 per person compared to US$700 per person in Hungary. The Ukrainian State Credit and Investment Corporation estimates that Ukraine needs about US$5 billion in foreign investment (including US$1.7 billion for oil processing, US$2 billion for metallurgy, US$500 million for machine production and US$250 million for the energy sector).<br>
The enormous potential of Ukraine - an untapped market of 52 million people with a well educated workforce and rich farmland - presents an exciting opportunity, but only once the investment environment is clear and stable. The consumer goods market remains particularly under-developed, and although foreign brands are beginning to enter the market the sector has huge potential in the medium to long-term.<br>
As the financial climate has begun to stabilise (with help from the IMF) interest in Ukraine has picked up. By May 1996 companies reported to be interested in Ukraine included Cargill of the USA (construction of a sunflower processing plant); Philips of the Netherlands (lamp factory); McDonalds; Coca-Cola; Daewoo of South Korea (joint venture with the AvtoZaz auto manufacturer); and Hughes Network and Boeing Aircraft (a joint venture involving satellite launch rockets). However several multi-nationals, including General Motors, have made it clear they will not invest in Ukraine until the taxation environment becomes more attractive.

<h3>Taxation</h3>
<b>Corporate taxation system</b>
<P>
From 1 January 1995 the basic rate of profit tax is 30 per cent. Gambling enterprises are taxed at 60 per cent and agricultural enterprises providing services for agricultural production at 15 per cent. The law abolished five-year tax holidays for enterprises with foreign investment registered after 1 January 1995. Certain activities (agricultural production and processing, fishing and fish processing, rural construction) are exempt from profit tax.
<P>
Enterprises meeting the following criteria are also exempt from tax:
obtain all their revenue from outside Ukraine<br>
have a management and administration of entirely Ukrainian citizens
make their settlements only through Ukrainian banks.<br>
The standard rate of value added tax (VAT) is 20 per cent, payable on the majority of goods and services except insurance, reinsurance and education.<br>
A 37 per cent payroll tax payable by employers finances the social and pension funds. An additional 12 per cent tax on wages finances the Chernobyl and unemployment funds.<br> Employees are liable for 1 per cent of their wages for the pension fund and 3 per cent for the Chernobyl fund.
<P>
<b>Personal taxation</b>
<P>
The maximum personal rate of income tax is 30 per cent.
In February 1996 agricultural workers were exempted from paying income tax on payments in kind. The resolution passed by parliament will raise real wages in the sector which are lower than any other sector.

<b>Summary</b>
<P>
Ukraine is heavily dependent on imports of Russian gas and oil to satisfy domestic energy requirements. The increase of energy supplies to world levels led to non-payment and the reduction of Russian exports to Ukraine in 1993. The Ukrainian state energy sector is on the verge of bankruptcy due to the large number of defaulting customers. Continued disputes between the two countries led to oil supplies to the Drogobych refinery being cut off in February 1996 and widespread energy shortages have prevented any recovery in industrial output.
<p>
Ukraine produced 25 per cent of the coal used in the former Soviet Union. The country's seven oil refineries have a total capacity of 1.24 million barrels per day (bpd). Ukraine's proven oil and gas reserves were not exploited during the Soviet era, when other regions (Siberia and central Asia) could be developed more cheaply.
Background and government policy<br>
Privatisation of the oil and gas sector was planned in 1995, however parliament threw out the proposals as oil and gas enterprises were excluded from the privatisation process. Without structural reform of the sector the investment required to repair and renew ageing pipelines and develop oil and gas fields will not be made available. Hardline deputies were primarily concerned with preventing Ukrhazprom, the company responsible for operating Ukraine's gas pipelines and exploiting the country's gas fields, from floating its shares. The parliamentary vote also prevented the Russian gas giant Gazprom from converting US$1.4 billion in Ukrainian bonds into equity in Ukrainian enterprises, including gas reserves and pipelines. Gazprom was given the bonds in 1993 and 1994 in a debt rescheduling deal over Ukrainian payment for Russian gas.<br>
Ukraine's coal mining sector, once a Soviet showpiece, is saddled with antiquated machinery and technology and exhausted pits. The sector began a restructuring process in January 1996 when the Coal Industry Ministry incorporated all state-owned enterprises subordinate to it. Twenty-six state-owned joint-stock coal mining and ore-enrichment companies were also created. The state will retain a minimum 51 per cent stake, under the control of the Coal Industry Ministry.<br>
In May 1995 the cabinet cut off state subsidies to loss making pits (worth US$50 million a month in 1994) and announced it would close 15 mines. However the closures were postponed in the face of strong parliamentary opposition. With whole towns dependent on the coal mining industry any closures would have considerable social consequences. In early 1996 the government again announced that it planned to close down at least 28 loss making pits over the next few years, with the possibility of up to 70 mines facing closure in the long-term. The number of miners at Ukraine's 257 pits had fallen from 529,000 to 426,017 by the end of 1995 as unpaid wages forced many workers to look for employment elsewhere.Two thousand coal miners at 16 pits in the Donetsk region resumed strikes over wage arrears in April 1996 after the government reneged on its promise to clear all debts to the coal industry. The original strike was suspended in February 1996 after assurances were reached that arrears would be paid.<br>
The World Bank agreed a US$15.8 million loan to the coal sector in May 1996 to assist in restructuring the industry. The money will principally be used to ease the social and environmental consequences of pit closures. Three mines in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine have been selected for the project.
<P>
<b>Reserves</b>
<P>
The Black Sea shelf has estimated gas reserves of 70 billion cubic metres. However the legal clarification of the Russian-Ukrainian border is required in order to legalise the ownership of planned drilling sites. The Crimean Peninsular is also estimated to have reserves of 1.3 billion barrels of oil-equivalent. Once (or if) the reserves are fully exploited Ukraine would become a net exporter of energy.<br>
Ukraine also has oilfields in the north and east in the Pridniprovsky, Prykarpatia, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkov and Sumy regions.<br>
The Donetsk region has estimated coal reserves of 56 billion tonnes, with smaller reserves in the Lvov-Volyn region (one billion tonnes).
<P>
<b>Exploration</b>
<P>
Until independence Ukraine had not been explored for oil since the early 1970s.<br>
A licensing agreement was signed between the Ukrainian Government and Epic Energy Incorporated (USA) in March 1996 covering the exploration and development of the shallow oil fields in the Kerch peninsular area. The agreement also provides for the future development of deeper oil and gas fields in the same region. Epic Energy and its Ukrainian partner Kyrmgeologia, already had a production sharing agreement to explore and exploit an 11,000 square km area around the Crimean Peninsular for the huge oil-equivalent reserves.
<P>
<b>Production</b>
<P>
Oil and gas production is expected to increase in 1996 for the first time in 20 years. Gas output is expected to rise from an estimated 17.44 billion cubic metres in 1995 to 18.2 billion cubic metres in 1996. Ukrhazprom accounted for 14.59 billion cubic metres of gas production and the oil company Ukrnafta 2.85 billion cubic metres. Crude oil production is expected to increase by 20,000 tonnes in 1996 from 4.2 million tonnes in 1995.<br>
Coal production in 1995 was estimated at 83.97 million tonnes, lower than expected and a fall of over 10 million tonnes on 1994 production. In 1990 coal output was 179 million tonnes. The industry has the highest worker casualty rate in the world, with five miners dying for every one million tonnes of coal mined.

<P>
The EBRD's first private sector loan to Ukraine was granted in April 1995. The US$8 million deal provided support to the Poltava Petroleum Company, a joint venture involving JKX Oil and Gas of the UK which holds a 49 per cent stake. The project, at the Nova-Nikolaevskoye field near Poltava, intends to increase daily production of oil to 1,700 tonnes of oil and 1.3 million cubic metres of gas by the second half of 1996. The field contains proven reserves of 1,100 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 60 million barrels of oil and oil condensate.
<P>
<b>Refining</b>
<P>
Ukraine's seven oil refineries, Lischansk (supplied with oil from western Siberia), Kremenchug, Kherson, Odessa, Drogobych, Nadvornaya and Lvov, have a capacity of 1.24 million bpd, the second largest in the region after Russia. The domestic market consumes the majority of output.<br>
The Drogobych refinery in western Ukraine had its oil supplies from Russia temporarily suspended in February 1996 due to a disagreement between the Ukrainian and Russian Governments over oil transit tariffs for the Druzhba pipeline. Ukraine increased the transit tariff from US$4.73 to US$5.20 per tonne on Russian oil going to eastern and central Europe on 1 January 1996. Hungary receives 22,000 tonnes a day and Slovakia and the Czech Republic a combined 28,000 tonnes. The pipeline, 715 km of which runs through Ukraine, has an annual flow of 18 million tonnes.<br>
The SPF proposed selling a 45 per cent stake in the Lisichansk oil refinery in a competitive tender between its Russian suppliers in May 1996. The winner would pay off some of the refinery's debts to the Italian company Tecnimont which constructed a polypropene manufacturing complex at the plant in 1994. The most likely contenders for the stake are Yukos, Rosneft, the Eastern Oil Company and the Tyumen Oil Company.
<P>
<b>Consumption</b>
<P>
Natural gas accounts for about 40 per cent of energy consumption in Ukraine, making it one of the most gas intensive economies in Europe.<br>
Gas supplies were cut to 86 large factories in March 1996 due to unpaid bills. Total arrears are estimated at US$840 million.
<P>
<b>Imports</b>
<P>
The high level of industrialisation and energy consumption means that Ukraine has been a net importer of energy since the 1970s. Compared with industry in western Europe Ukraine uses about 40 per cent more energy per capita.<br>
Ukraine imports 87 per cent of its oil and 83 per cent of natural gas requirements, principally from Russia and Turkmenistan. About US$6 billion of natural gas is bought from Russia annually. Other suppliers are being sought, however the limited unloading capacity of the Black Sea ports makes importing large quantities of oil impractical.<br>
Over 3,500 trading companies import fuel products into Ukraine. The largest are Nordex (Swiss/Austrian), Slavutitch (Ukraine), Roskontract (Russia) and the Russian Ukrainian Oil Company. Ukraine imports between seven and eight million tonnes of petrol a year, between nine and 10 million tonnes of diesel fuel, nine million tonnes of fuel oil and between one and 1.5 million tonnes of different oils and lubricants.<br>
Once a massive exporter of coal Ukraine is expected to import 20 million tonnes in 1996 as output has fallen to nearly half 1990 levels. Russia and Poland will supply the bulk of the coal at a cost of about US$500 million. Import payments will be through barter and countertrade deals.

<b>Exports</b>
<P>
Although required to import ever growing amounts of coal Ukraine is predicted to export three million tonnes to the west in 1996 in return for desperately needed hard currency
<P>
<b>Transport</b>
<P>
A Russian-Ukrainian joint venture, AO Gaztransit, created to transport Russian gas through Ukraine to western Europe, was established at the end of 1995. Ukraine's gas transit network stretches for 35,000 km and is capable of handling over 120 billion cubic metres of gas annually from Russia to western Europe. However, with a third of the pipeline system over 25 years old it is in desperate need of repair or replacement.<br>
A reconstruction project to boost the capacity at the Odessa oil terminal from 16 to 20 billion tonnes annually should be complete by the end of 1996. The terminal, built in 1985, handled 12.005 million tonnes in 1995, down from 12.397 million tonnes in 1994. The US$24 million project included deepening the harbour to 235 metres to allow 60,000 tonne tankers and a new loading-unloading system. The terminal will eventually handle 40 million tonnes a year.<br> 
The construction of a new terminal in the Crimea was agreed in January 1995, however by May 1996 little progress had been made. The US$790 million project was due for completion by the end of 1996, but this is extremely unlikely. The terminal, near the deep water port of Yuzhny, will have an annual capacity of around 40 million tonnes of crude, with the oil refined at the Odessa and Kherson refineries. With a refining capacity of nearly 62 million tonnes a year Ukraine's refineries could develop an export market in northern Europe once the project is complete.<br>
Ukraine's other oil terminals are at Reni on the Danube and Kerch and Feodosia in the Crimea.

<h3>Electricity</h3>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
The consequences of the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986 continue to affect Ukraine. The
remaining two reactors still produce electricity for Ukrainian homes and factories, and
although the Ukrainian Government has pledged to shut them down by the year 2000, until
the finance is made available to replace their generating capacity this could prove optimistic.
A total of US$2.7 billion has been promised by the EU and the G7 industrialised nations,
however little of the promised funds have yet been made available. A fire in 1991 caused the
shutdown of a second reactor at Chernobyl.<br>
The 1986 explosion affected about 3.5 million people, including 350,000 who lived and
worked in the Chernobyl area, 120,000 who were resettled and a further 90,000 children
exposed to high levels of radiation. Annual payments to the Chernobyl Fund, which
accounted for 15 per cent of the state budget in 1993, were reduced to 5.2 per cent in the
1996 budget. An estimated 7 per cent of Ukraine (equivalent to the size of the Netherlands)
was contaminated to varying degrees by the explosion and is now unusable, with 40 per cent
of forests contaminated. The nuclear fallout from the disaster is estimated at 200 times that
of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs combined.<br>
The list of `incidents' in the Ukrainian nuclear sector is endless: in November 1995 an
employee was accidentally exposed to high levels of radiation; there were 68 fires at
Ukraine's nuclear reactors between 1990 and 1995; and with an estimated 70 per cent of
equipment at nuclear power stations obsolete and insufficient funds to maintain safety
standards the potential for a serious accident or disaster is great.<br>
An EU funded early warning system to detect increased radioactive levels in Ukraine is due
to be in operation by mid-1996. A network of radiation monitors around nuclear stations are
linked by radio to local response centres where the information is collected and analysed.
The system monitors the Rivne and Zaporizhya nuclear power plants.<br>
In April 1995 a presidential decree created a national electricity pool, authorised the
denationalisation of four power plants and established 27 local electricity distribution
companies.
<P>
<b>New projects</b>
<P>
A nuclear fuel plant supplying Ukraine's nuclear power stations is due for completion by
2000. The Russian energy company TVEL beat off competition from Westinghouse of the
USA and Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering giant. The plant will cost about
US$100 million. Once complete the plant will provide Ukraine's 11 VVER-1000 nuclear
reactors.<br>
The G7 group of industrial nations agreed to assist in financing the completion of two nuclear
reactors, Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4, at a cost of US$1 billion in 1995. In January 1996
Switzerland agreed to assist upgrading Ukraine's hydroelectric power stations and improve
safety measures with a US$34 million loan.<br>
The World Bank granted a loan of US$114 million as part of a US$190 million project to
shore up Ukraine's hydro-electric plants on the Dnepr river in April 1995. The five year
project will rehabilitate eight plants.
<P>
<b>Production</b>
<P>
Ukraine has the 10th largest power generation capacity in the world, 56 million kilowatts.
However the sector was designed as an integral part of the Soviet electricity production
system, not for Ukraine as a separate state. Imported fossil fuels are vital to the sector, and
although nuclear stations contribute about 36 per cent of output Ukraine is totally dependent
on imported raw materials.<br>
Electricity is supplied from 48 thermal power stations, hydro-electric plants on the Dnepr
River and five nuclear power stations (from 15 reactors). In March 1996 Ukraine agreed to
pay for imported electricity from Kyrghyzstan by building a hydroelectric power plant in the
central Asian state.<br>
Total electricity output in 1995 fell 1.5 per cent short of the government's target. With the
exception of the Zaporozhye power station, Ukraine's nuclear facilities exceeded production
expectations. In 1996 output is expected to increase at the Rovno and Zaporozhye plants,
while the Chernobyl, South Ukrainian and Khmelnitskiy plants are set to reduce production.
The nuclear industry is owed about US$500 million in unpaid bills, which in turn means that
the sector is falling behind in payments for deliveries of Russian nuclear fuel.
<P>
<b>Consumption</b>
<P>
Electricity supplies were cut to about 7,000 enterprises in March 1996; outstanding electricity
bills are thought to be about US$980 million.<br>
Russia disconnected Ukraine from a joint power grid in February 1996, causing widespread
power cuts. Combined with the coal miners strike many major industrial enterprises were
forced to stop production, while domestic and agricultural consumers were also left without
power during the particularly cold spell.

<h2>NATURAL RESOURCES</h2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<b>Summary</b>
<P>
Ukraine is rich in mineral deposits including iron ore (of which it produced 50 per cent of the
entire Soviet output), manganese ore (of which it produced 40 per cent of world output during
the Soviet era), mercury, titanium and nickel.
<P>
<b>Production</b>
<P>
The largest iron ore deposits are in the Krivoy Roj area, with estimated reserves of 18 billion
tonnes, Kremenchuk with 4.5 billion tonnes, Kerch and Belozerskie in the Donetsk region with
210 million tonnes.<br>
The manganese deposits around Nikopol are estimated to be the largest in the world.
Gold deposits in the Trans-Carpathian region containing an average of between five and six
grammes of gold per tonne of ore are due to be developed by the end of 1996. The site also
contains deposits of zinc and lead. Although Ukraine had no active gold mines in mid-1996,
the government predicts that 15 tonnes could be mined annually within eight to 10 years.
Total investment required to reach full capacity is estimated at US$250 million over 12 years.
Ukraine consumes about 400 tonnes of iodine a year, importing about 80 tonnes from other
former Soviet Republics and Chile.<br>
Other natural resources present in Ukraine include salt (in the Donbas, Prykarpatia and
Zarkarpattia region), lime (in the Crimea and Donbas areas), limestone (in Elenovskoye),
china clay (in Hluhovestie and Turbovske), sulphur (around Lvov) and granite (in the
Zhytomyr region). Phosphorus deposits of about 20 billion tonnes are also present.

<b>Summary</b>
<P>
The dormant potential of the Ukrainian agricultural sector has yet to be fully realised, as half-
hearted reforms, disintegrating infrastructure and the abandonment of cheap credits for
agricultural enterprises led to output falling by a disastrous 16 per cent in 1994. The general
inefficiency of the sector, late payments and a lack of finance for fuel, machinery and
fertilisers have exacerbated the problem. With the world's biggest sugar beet crops,
extensive grain, potatoes and fruit harvests together with large livestock herds, Ukraine has
the potential to become a significant exporter of agricultural products. However the
agricultural sector is traditionally the hardest to reform in the former communist states, with
slow land reform and state controls hampering the development of the private sector and
discouraging foreign investment.

<h3>FARMING</h3>
Background and government policy<br>
<P>
The agricultural policies of the Stalin era crippled Ukraine as farms were collectivised and
grain was confiscated to meet impossible quotas. Peasants working the land were prohibited
from keeping any grain until the official quotas were met, leading to the engineered famine of
1932 and 1933 when between five and seven million people died.<br>
The humus-rich steppes of Ukraine make it one of the most fertile areas of the world, with
agriculture a deeply rooted part of Ukrainian culture. Every house in a rural village has its
own garden where fruit and vegetables are grown. The `bread basket' of the Soviet Union,
half the country is covered with crops of wheat, barley, rye, oats and sugar beet, with large
areas for livestock. In 1991 Ukraine produced 1,033kg of grain per head compared to 445kg
in Germany.<br>
Ukraine has huge potential: the world's largest sugar-beet crops and extensive grain, potato
and fruit resources. However the infrastructure to take advantage of this potential is woefully
inadequate, with an estimated 40 per cent of the grain harvest lost every year due to poor
storage, distribution and theft. Ukrainians rely on their gardens for food rather than the
national agricultural industry.<br>
The slow pace of land reform is principally due to political opposition, but also a deep
aversion to private ownership - a completely alien concept to the vast majority of Ukrainians.
Comprehensive land reform is one of the most sensitive issues in Ukraine, with the powerful
conservative agricultural lobby in parliament against any major change while demanding
greater subsidies. Legislation passed by parliament in February 1996 giving Ukraine's
collective farm directors free 51 per cent stakes in the country's 4,270 agro-industry
companies was vetoed by the president for a second time.<br>
Every Ukrainian citizen has the legal right to become a farmer and may have land allocated
to them, however the maximum amount of agricultural land may not exceed 50 hectares
(ha). The plot may not be sold for a period of six years and workers are not allowed to be
employed on that land. Despite these restrictions, by the beginning of 1996 there were
34,687 private farms. However with an average size of only 23 ha their contribution to total
agricultural output was low. Production from these farms was principally used for private
consumption.<br>
By August 1995 about 75 per cent of all agricultural land was still managed by collective
farms, 12 per cent by families with plots of less than 0.5 ha, 2 per cent by private farmers of
less than 20 ha. The first public distribution of a collective farm's land and equipment was
held at Minkivka in March 1996, with the 640 members of the collective splitting the assets
and 4,500 ha between them.<br>
Some progress has been made in the supply sector, with about 40 per cent of farms
receiving seeds, fertilisers and equipment from private suppliers. Farmers can also sell their
produce on the commodities exchange or to western exporters. Although land reform has
been extremely sluggish, an estimated 40 per cent of all agricultural output comes from the
private sector, principally individual garden plots which have become a lifeline for many
families.<br>
However the development of private sector farms is being hampered by the inability of many
small private farmers to obtain working capital to buy fertilisers, seeds and machinery. The
monopolistic structure of the sector has yet to be broken, particularly in the storage,
distribution and food processing areas. Price controls and state orders have also hindered the
development of a free market.<br>
Ukraine received conditional approval for a US$700 million World Bank loan to support the
agricultural sector in April 1996. The loan depends on land reform measures including the
lifting of the moratorium on the sale of land for six years and the removal of the pre-emptive
right of collective farms to buy their land.<br>
Ukraine's first commodity exchange opened in January 1995 in Kiev. Farmers are permitted
to sell their produce freely on the commodity exchange or to trading houses, but only after
state quotas have been met. The exchange concentrated almost solely on grain, sugar and a
few other items, sold on spot contracts with delivery guaranteed within five days. The
agriculture ministry sets a minimum price, which may or may not be at that day's world level,
below which trading stops. The development of a fully liberalised and functional exchange is
a vital element of the agricultural reform programme, but with the majority of trade done by
barter this will be a lengthy process.<br>
<P>
<b>Production</b>
<P>
The 1996 grain harvest is predicted to reach 38 million tonnes, an improvement on the
disappointing 1995 harvest of 36.5 million tonnes which was held back by slow land reforms
and a summer drought. The 1994 grain harvest of 35.5 million tonnes was the lowest in over
a decade.<br>
The government estimates that the 1996 wheat harvest will be about 18 million tonnes,
compared to 16.4 million tonnes in 1995. The sugar beet harvest is also expected to increase
to 33 million tonnes from 30 million tonnes in 1995, while the sunflower seed crop is
predicted to increase from 2.8 to three million tonnes in 1996. However independent analysts
expect a harvest of 35 million tonnes at best, with the limited reform process hampering
improved production. Bad debts run up by collective farms mean many cannot get the funds
they require for fertilisers, new equipment and fuel. Although the state purchased over half
the 1995 grain harvest the government has pledged to buy just five million tonnes in 1996.
The 1989 grain harvest of 47.7 million tonnes has not been matched since.<br>
The production of tractors in Ukraine meant that the agricultural sector is relatively well
mechanised by Soviet standards. However a lack of specialist harvesting machinery and light
tractors has held productivity levels back, as has the lack of finance to replace and repair
existing machinery. The quality of Ukrainian built machinery is low however, and when
combined with a shortage of spare parts many farms are left struggling to maintain
production levels. Fuel shortages have also prevented harvesting of some crops - 100,000
ha of the 1994 sugar beet harvest went uncollected.

<b>Food and tobacco industry</b>
<P>
Ukraine is a large producer of high quality sugar, wine, alcohol, salt, jam, oil and butter, flour,
fruit and vegetables and fresh and canned meat.<br>
The sugar industry, based in the south and south-west, involves about 200 enterprises. Many
factories are operating below full capacity as the government has paid for Russian gas and
oil with a large proportion of the sugar beet harvest. The sugar group Tate & Lyle invested
US$15 million in the Odessa Sugar Company in June 1995. The British company purchased
a 60 per cent stake in the enterprise which imports and refines raw cane before re-exporting
the finished product.<br>
Good quality wine is produced in the Crimean region, although the Gorbachev anti-alcohol
campaign of the mid-1980s caused considerable damage to the sector.<br>
The processed meat industry is spread throughout the country, however output has declined
since 1991 as livestock numbers have fallen. All food processing enterprises suffer from
outdated technology and equipment, with spare parts at a premium. With the state retaining
almost complete control over the agricultural sector, allocating harvests and animal products,
the food processing industry remains completely dependent on state organisations for raw
materials.<br>
Philip Morris of the USA announced plans to invest US$16 million to upgrade the Kharkov
Tobacco Factory in June 1996. Capacity at the plant will be boosted to 6.6 billion cigarettes a
year by the beginning of 1997.
<P>
<b>External trade</b>
<P>
Grain exports were heavily restricted by licences in 1995, with only a few privileged
companies permitted to export sunflower seeds. The low grain harvest in 1995 meant there
were negligible exports in an area that has the potential to be a major export earner.<br>
The US agricultural machinery manufacturer John Deere agreed a US$187 million contract
to supply Ukraine with 1,049 combine harvesters, with the first instalment due in June 1996.
The Ukrainian Ukragroprombirzha company (77 per cent state-owned) has purchased the
equipment which it will lease or sell.

<b>Summary</b>
<P>
The Ukrainian transport system was one of the most developed in the former USSR,
however a lack of maintenance and investment since 1991 has taken its toll as standards
have declined. The majority of components and spare parts were manufactured in the former
eastern bloc states and other Soviet Republics. With manufacturers demanding payment in
hard currency and prices not fully liberalised Ukrainian transport enterprises have
experienced great difficulty in maintaining, let alone modernising the system.<br>
Although separate business organisations have been established for each of the transport
sectors, there is still a long way to go before anything approaching a competitive free market
is established. Privatisation of the railways, the most extensive in the former Soviet Union,
has been ruled out by the government.
<P>
<a name="Road"></a>
<hr>
<a href="#List"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Road</h3>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
Ukraine's road network extends for about 430,000km, approximately one-third of which is
metalled. The two most important routes, north-south and east-west, intersect at Kiev. There
are a large number of transport businesses operating services between Ukraine and western
Europe, however transport within Ukraine is unreliable with corruption widespread.<br>
Road maintenance and construction is the responsibility of Ukrdorstroi (Ukrainian State
Committee for Road Construction), a conglomerate of separate enterprises. Ukravtotrans
(Ukrainian State Committee for Auto Transport) controls the road transport system and is
responsible for about 21 per cent of all freight transport. Agricultural and industrial
enterprises have their own transport equipment. Ukravtotrans also provides about 65 per
cent of all passenger road transport, operating 52,000 buses. An increasing shortage of
buses due to a lack of spare parts is causing severe problems in most areas, particularly as
80 per cent of passenger transport is by bus.
<P>
<a name="Rail"></a>
<hr>
<a href="#List"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>RailL</h3>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
During the Soviet era Ukraine's extensive 22,800km rail network transported 75 per cent of
exports and 65 per cent of all imports. However the collapse of the USSR led to an
immediate decline in rail transport between the republics and has caused severe financial
problems.<br>
Infrastructure, reliability and viability<br>
The different gauge track used in the former Soviet Union makes transporting goods by train
from western Europe a complicated process.<br>
Rail transport prices were increased by 10 per cent in January 1996. The government hopes
the increase will end the loss-making ways of the passenger and freight services.

<a href="#List"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Inland Waterways and Ocean-Going</h3>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
There are over 3,000 km of navigable inland waterways in Ukraine. The river Dnepr,
navigable for 1,000 km in Ukraine from the north to south through Kiev, is the most important
waterway. Principal cargoes carried on the river include sand, coal and iron ore. There are
ports at Kherson, Zaporozhya, Dnepropetrovsk and Kiev on the Dnepr.<br>
The effects of the five year war in the former Yugoslavia and the UN trade embargo on
Serbia virtually stopped all traffic on the Danube, hitting the Ukrainian port of Izmail
particularly hard. Trade with the former Yugoslavia and transit cargo going north from the
Black Sea to Hungary, Austria and Germany stopped between 1991 and 1995. However the
lifting of the embargo in November 1995 should kick-start operations at Izmail. The Ukrainian
Danube Shipping Company lost an estimated US$450 million in revenue during the embargo
as its fleet was left idle. Cargo handling at the port fell from 10 million tonnes in 1989 to four
million in 1995. The government estimates that the value of trade with Serbia should
increase from US$2 million in 1995 to US$2 billion in 1996.
<P>
<b>Infrastructure, reliability and viability</b>
<P>
Ukraine also has well developed sea ports on the Black Sea at Odessa, Izmayil, Kherson,
Yalta, Sevastopol, Kerch, Berdiansk and Mariupol (formerly Zhdanov).<br>
The state-owned company Ukrmorflot (Ukrainian State Committee for the Sea Fleet) was
created in 1992 to manage sea transport. Ukrmorflot owns three shipping lines, the Black
Sea Shipping Company (Blasco), the Azov Sea Shipping Company and the Danube Shipping
Company.<br>
Blasco has the largest fleet in the former Soviet Union, however its 250 rusting ships are in
desperate need of replacement. The company has experienced a series of scandals and
setbacks during 1995 and 1996. The company's president was charged with corruption and
the government cancelled plans to privatise the fleet during 1995. In May 1996, 26 of the
company's most modern vessels were impounded in foreign ports due to the company's
debts. About 200 hundred creditors are demanding the payment of maintenance fees worth
over US$207 million. The company had already been banned from several western ports due
to unpaid bills. Blasco also owes its employees US$5 million in outstanding wages.
The integrated Soviet transport system which established close links between road and rail
transport and the loading and unloading of ships has broken down, with cargoes often waiting
for days to be unloaded.

<a href="#List"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Air</h3>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
The portion of the Aeroflot fleet inherited by Ukraine was turned into a national carrier, Air
Ukraine.
<P>
<b>Infrastructure, reliability and viability</b>
<P>
Kiev airport has been totally refurbished with a grant from the EBRD and is now up to
western standards. Fuel and spare parts shortages mean that flights can be cancelled or
delayed at the last minute.<br>
Air Ukraine employs 40,000 people and has services to the USA and major western and
eastern European cities. In the long-term Air Ukraine aims to replace its Soviet made fleet
with western equipment and aircraft which consume about 20 per cent less fuel than the
Ilyushin and Tupolev planes.

<h2>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</h2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<b>Summary</b>
<P>
In 1991 when Ukraine gained independence the country's telecommunications network was
antiquated, inefficient and unreliable. However, by the beginning of 1996 the majority of
Ukrainian telephones had direct dial international access, ending the practice of booking
international calls days in advance.
<P>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
The telecommunications market was deregulated in February 1995 when the government
issued a second long-distance carrier licence. Utel, established in 1992 by 13 state-owned
local phone companies, was Ukraine's first long-distance carrier. The local phone companies
hold a 51 per cent stake, AT&T of America and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom of Germany
19.5 per cent and PPT Telecom Netherlands 10 per cent. The western partners had invested
US$60 million by mid-1995, principally in digital gateway switches. Utel plans to invest over
US$43 million in upgrading local networks during 1996, with digital exchanges planned for
the Kherson, Ternopol, Lutsk and Rovno areas.<br>
In the first quarter of 1996, 41,800 new telephone numbers were installed. The second stage
of a 896km fibre-optic cable linking Kiev and Odessa was also 80 per cent complete by the
end of March 1996. The cable is part of a US$53 million line linking Italy, Turkey, Ukraine
and Russia. By the end of 1996 about 224,000 new numbers should have been installed.
The French telecommunications company Alcatel opened a 30,000 line telephone exchange
in Kiev in April 1996. The exchange was the first of several deals with local telecomms
providers in Ukraine. A second 30,000 line exchange is due to open in November and a
23,000 line exchange early in 1997. A consortium of Canada's Northern Telecom and Italy's
Pirelli won a US$12 million EBRD funded contract to install a fibre-optic network in February
1995. The American company, Global Telesystems Group, agreed to invest an initial US$10
million in the Ukrainian telecommunications firm Bankomsvyaz in March 1996, and a further
US$25 million over the next five years. Bankomsvyaz plans to modernise its network and
install a new network in Kiev.<br>
In December 1995 Poland and Ukraine agreed to extend the existing telecommunications
highway between Lvov and Rzeszow in southern Poland. Once complete the US$100 million
link will reach from Kiev to Krakow in Poland.

<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
The armed forces have had their combined strength reduced by around 65,000 since
independence. Equipment levels have also been reduced, with 600 tanks, one bomber
division and six fighter regiments eliminated.<br>
The Ukrainian Parliament signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in November 1994.
The removal of nuclear weapons began early in 1994, with over 400 warheads returned to
Russia and 40 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) destroyed. The final outstanding
element in the removal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine was cleared up in May 1996.
Russia agreed to write off US$450 million of Ukrainian debt to compensate for the transfer of
short-range tactical nuclear weapons to Russia in 1992. The last nuclear warhead was
removed to Russia on 31 May 1996.<br>
The EU TACIS programme granted Ukraine Ecu7.36 million to assist in the retraining of
former servicemen in October 1995.

<h3>Army</h3>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
Ground forces have been reduced by approximately 96,000 since independence, with the
majority of the attack helicopter force redistributed from the airforce to the army. Most army
corps now include an attack helicopter regiment. The Conventional Armed Forces in Europe
(CFE) treaty has reduced equipment levels, including 600 tanks and 400 armoured personnel
carriers.

<h3>Navy</h3>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
The fate of the naval fleet based in the Crimea has caused tension between Russia and
Ukraine since 1991. The dispute has centred around the allocation of naval bases on the
Crimean peninsular and the length of leases offered to the Russian navy. Agreement was
finally reached between the two governments in June 1995 to split the fleet's assets equally.
However Ukraine is selling 63 per cent of its share of the fleet's ships to Russia.
The principle naval bases are at Sevastopol and Odessa.

<b>Education</b>
<P>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
The reversal of the Russian dominated education system is the primary aim of the
government. Ukrainian is taught in all schools, although the choice to learn it is individual. An
increased emphasis has also been placed on Ukrainian history, culture and literature. The
Kiev-Mohyla Academy, Ukraine's first higher education institute founded in 1615, has been
reopened since independence.<br>
Education is compulsory for eight years after which students can enter the workforce, begin a
two-year trade-school course or continue in school before entering a technical college, a
speciality institute or a university.
<P>
<a name="Health"></a>
<hr>
<a href="#List"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Health</h3>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
Extensive pollution is one of the most lingering legacies of the Soviet regime. Massive
industrialisation was pursued at any cost. The Chernobyl explosion is the most obvious
example with increased rates of thyroid cancer, leukaemia and birth defects, but all cities
suffer from pollution, both in the air as well as rivers and agricultural land. The Lvov region
has the most polluted water in the country.<br>
The health sector has experienced considerable pressure since independence, with
government funding insufficient to cover even basic building repairs. Preventive care is also
negligible, for example abortion is the principle means of birth control. Although there are
twice as many doctors as in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) states, they have not had the funding, technology and training since 1991 to
maintain the levels of care pre-1991.<br>
Ukraine is more dependent on imported medicines and medical equipment than any other
European country, producing only 160 of the 3,000 different medicines required.
<P>
<a name="Welfare"></a>
<hr>
<a href="#List"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Welfare</h3>
<b>Background and government policy</b>
<P>
Following independence three separate extra-budgetary funds were established - the pension
fund, the social insurance fund and the employment fund. They are funded by employer and
employee contributions.<br>
The economic collapse, particularly hyper-inflation, experienced since 1991 has left many
Ukrainians struggling to survive as living standards have plummeted. Without the numerous
individual vegetable plots most Ukrainians cultivate the level of poverty and hunger would
have been disastrous.

<h2>GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<b>Geography</b>
<P>
The largest country wholly within Europe (just ahead of France) Ukraine covers 603,700
square km, stretching 2,000 km from east to west and 1,000 km from north to south.
Bordered by Russia to the east and north, Belarus to the north, and Poland in the west there
are also short borders with Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova in the south-west. The
Black Sea is to the south.<br>
The average height above sea level in Ukraine is only 175m, due to the rolling steppes and
wooded plains. About two-thirds of the country is covered by a thick layer of humus rich soil,
making it one of the most fertile regions in the world. The only mountains are in the south on
the Crimean peninsular (maximum height 1,545 m) and the Carpathians in the west
(maximum height 2,061 m).<br>
Ukraine has four different types of state nature reserves, totalling around 92,340 ha.
<P>
<b>Climate</b>
<P>
The moderate continental climate varies little across the country. July is the hottest month,
averaging 23 degrees C, while January is the coldest, averaging around zero degrees C. The
Black Sea resorts around Odessa and Yalta are usually warmer and drier than the rest of
Ukraine. The average rainfall per year is 144 cm, with the Crimea only receiving 40 cm.

US dollars and German Deutsche Marks are the easiest hard currencies to exchange, but
avoid taking old or torn notes as they won't be accepted. Only change a small amount of
hard currency at a time as the exchange rate can fluctuate wildly.

<h3>Dress Codes</h3>
Business clothes are appropriate for meetings - a suit or jacket with a tie for men and smart
business clothing for women.
<P>
<a name="Social"></a>
<hr>
<a href="#List"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Social Niceties, Traditions and Taboos</h3>
<P>
Tips are not expected at most caf,s, although at more expensive restaurants a tip of between
five and 10 per cent is appropriate.<br>
Small gifts for your host (or as bribes) are appreciated.<br>
Handshaking is customary on meeting and on leaving. The formal form of address, Mr (Pan)
or Mrs (Pani) is usual even after several meetings. The use of business cards is widespread.
It is important to be on time for meetings and appointments.<br>
Referring to Ukraine as part of the Soviet Union, or even worse as part of Russia, is a
downright insult. Decades of Russification have led to strong nationalistic feelings,
particularly in the west, and unless you know your Ukrainian host well avoid talking about the
more sensitive issues.
<P>
<a name="Eating"></a>
<hr>
<a href="#List"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Eating Habits</h3>
<P>
Ukrainian food is similar to Russian, with most dishes based around grains, vegetables
(potatoes, cabbage etc), beef, pork, poultry and fish seasoned with garlic, dill or vinegar.
Puddings are usually based on a combination of honey and fruits and often baked into sweet
breads.<br>
Restaurants leave much to be desired, with poor service and limited menus (often useless
anyway). The best Ukrainian cooking is found in the home, with eating out an unaccustomed
luxury for most Ukrainians. Yidalnya, stolova, kafe and bufet are caf,terias where drinks and
hot food are readily available, although the quality can vary.<br>
Traditional Ukrainian dishes include: varenyky (small dumplings filled with a variety of
ingredients, usually cheese or meat and a sour cream sauce), borscht (a beet and vegetable
soup in numerous forms, the best borscht is the thickest with the most vegetables), holubtsi
(cabbage leaves stuffed with rice, meat or buckwheat) and kotleta po-kyivsky (the original
chicken Kiev, although it can be difficult to find) and kasha (grain based gruel).<br>
Drinking is one of the few pastimes most Ukrainians can still afford. Vodka (neat of course) is
the favourite tipple of most people, downed in one, usually with the sole aim of getting drunk.
The recommended `morning after' cure is a swift bottle of beer. Once spotted, visiting
foreigners can soon become involved in a serious drinking session as the hospitable
Ukrainians welcome you to their country. Beer is not pasteurised which means it goes off
within a few days of production; check the date on the bottle. The Crimean and
Transcarpathian regions produce very good wine.

<h3>Unusual/Strict Laws</h3>

Driving having consumed any amount of alcohol is illegal.
<P>
<a name="Security"></a>
<hr>
<a href="#List"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Security</h3>
<P>
Anybody carrying hard currency becomes a walking goldmine in Ukrainian terms. Care
should be taken not to reveal large amounts of cash or expensive personal belongings,
especially on the street. Avoid travelling alone at night in Kiev, particularly on the metro or in
the city's parks.
<P>
<a name="Health"></a>
<hr>
<a href="#List"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Health for Visitors</h3>
<P>
Vaccination certificates are mandatory if you are travelling from a cholera or yellow fever
infected area. An HIV (AIDS) test is required for long-stay visitors only. Water precautions
are advisable, with water purification tablets useful. Visitors should be `in date' for the
following immunisations: polio (within 10 years), tetanus (within 10 years), typhoid fever,
cholera (within six months) and hepatitis `A' (moderate risk only). There have been a growing
and significant number of diphtheria cases. While the low dose adult booster is unavailable,
travellers are advised to be boosted with a reduced dose (0.1ml) of the paediatric single
antigen vaccine. If never immunised use a three dose course of the vaccine. Any medicines
required by the traveller should be taken by the visitor, and it is wise to have precautionary
antibiotics if going outside the major urban areas. A travel kit including a disposable syringe
is a reasonable precaution.

<h3>Getting About</h3>
<P>
National transport<br>
Air: The main airports at Kiev, Odessa, Lvov and Ivano-Frankivsk all handle domestic traffic,
as do 19 other regional airports. However several regional airports were closed down due to
a combination of fuel shortages and lack of money.<br>
Kiev's international airport, Borispol, is 27 km from the city centre. It is advisable to be met at
the airport as the few taxi drivers there rarely speak English or German.<br>
Road: Ukrainian's drive on the right, with speed limits of 60kmph in built up areas and
110kmph elsewhere. Have your car documentation papers ready for the enthusiastic traffic
police. Unleaded petrol is extremely rare, with only low-octane fuel available in most areas.
Ukraine has an extensive bus network, with routes to every city and most smaller towns.
Most buses are overcrowded, overheated and dirty, but are a good way to get to know the
locals.<br>
Rail: The Ukrainian rail networks links the major cities, most of which are at least one night's
travel apart. There are three types of sleeper carriage: the spalny vahon is the first class
compartment for two people; the kupe or kupeyny is the second class compartment for four
people; and the platskart is the third class open carriage with groups of six bunks in each
alcove, with more beds along the aisles - avoid them unless absolutely necessary.<br>
Remember to take your own food and drink, although the carriage attendants usually provide
cups of tea at the start and finish of the journey. Guard your belongings carefully; putting
them in the compartments under the bed is the safest option.<br>
Buying tickets for bus and rail travel can be awkward at the very least. The most effective
method is to write down your destination on a piece of paper and show it to the ticket clerk.
Foreigners can usually buy rail tickets from separate offices, although the price will be
slightly higher.<br>
Water: Passenger transport is available on Ukraine's rivers, but price increases, lack of spare
parts and cheaper land-based transport has seen a sharp decline in passenger services on
inland waterways.<br>
City transport: Kiev and Kharkov have metro systems; tickets can be bought at the stations.
Taxis: Payment is usually requested in hard currency. Agree a price before setting off.
Buses: In every city and town the buses, trams and trolleybuses are extremely crowded
where manners take a distant last place. If you are willing to take the consequences tickets
are very cheap and available from kiosks at most bus stops or from the driver.
Car hire: Cars can rented, but hiring a taxi for the day is often a cheaper and easier option.

<h3>Little Known Facts</h3>
<P>
The original cossacks came from the Ukrainian steppes in the late fifteenth century.
Cossacks, a Turkish word meaning outlaw, were runaway serfs, criminals, Orthodox refugees
and other outcasts from the Polish and Lithuanian areas to the north, together with a few
Tartar bands. At the height of their power in the seventeenth century they launched assaults
on Constantinople during campaigns against the Turks.

<h3>ARMENIA</h3>

Parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held in Armenia on 5 July 1995.<p> 

London's <b>Financial Times</b> published a four page special report on Armenia on 7 June 1995. <p>

Sixty-four per cent of shares in Armenia's 10 largest enterprises are to be sold for a mixture of 
privatisation certificates and cash, according to the Armenian <b>Privatisation Commission</b>. The 
companies include the country's only car plant, an electrical equipment plant and a pastry producer. The 
enterprises are to be converted into joint stock companies open to foreign investment.<p>

Armenia has a new telephone/fax dialling code. Since 1 May the old Soviet prefix of 7 has been dropped, 
to be replaced with 374.

<h3>AZERBAIJAN</h3> 

The oil consortium led by <b>British Petroleum</b> (UK) and Statoil (Norway) expects to start 
production in mid 1996 and exports by the end of 1996. Before then a decision has to be taken as to the 
route of the pipeline to export the crude. The choice appears to lie between a northerly route developed in 
association with Transneft of Russia or an alternative route to the Black Sea in association with Georgia. 
Plans for the exports to pass through Iran have been quashed by the project's US shareholders, as has the 
possibility of Iran taking a 5 per cent stake in the project.<p>

<b>British Airways</b> has introduced a twice-weekly London (Gatwick) - Baku service, via Bucharest. 
The service is operated by Boeing 737-400s with a return fare of US$1,400.

<h3>CROATIA</h3>

The <b>International Monetary Fund</b> (IMF) has approved a loan of US$103 million to Croatia. <p>

Croatia's industrial production increased by 5.1 per cent in the first three months of 1995. Production of 
raw materials increased by 6.6 per cent, equipment by 4.2 per cent and of consumer goods by 3.6 per cent 
according to the <b>State Institute for Statistics</b>.<p> 

The sale of 24.9 per cent of the equity of the <b>Pliva</b> pharmaceutical company, due to take place on 
May 8th was postponed indefinitely due to the shelling of Zagreb by Serbian forces. <p>

<h3>CZECH REPUBLIC</h3>

Czech GDP grew by 2.6 per cent in 1994, with an impressive 4.8 per cent growth posted in the fourth 
quarter. Real GDP amounted to US$15.76 billion (Kc 411.2 billion) in 1994. <p> 

On 7 June the Czech government cancelled its Ecu-denominated trade clearing agreement with the Slovak 
Republic. The arrangement, introduced shortly after the partition of the two republics, required only the 
deficit amount to be settled in hard currency, not the total value of goods traded. Trade relations had been 
soured by the unilateral Slovak imposition of a 10 per cent import surcharge. In 1994 there was a US$750 
million surplus in favour of Slovakia. <p> 

<b>Skoda Turbiny</b> a subsidiary of <b>Skoda Plzen</b> has signed a US$1.5 million contract for the 
supply of turbines to <b>General Motors</b> in Cadiz, Spain. <p> 

The Czech Republic ranked fifth in total foreign direct investment (FDI) in the region at the end of 1994, 
with 8 per cent of the total US$17.2 billion, behind Hungary (27 per cent), Poland (24 per cent), Russia 
(15 per cent), and Kazakhstan (14 per cent) according to figures published by the <b>UN Economic 
Commission for Europe</b>. Foreign investment in the Czech Republic was US$117.2 million in the first 
quarter of 1995.<p>  

Bids for the 27 per cent stake in <b>SPT Telecom</b> to be sold off closed on 6 June. <b>Telis</b>, a 
Czech telecommunications company, had appealed against the sale on the grounds that it had been 
excluded. The SPT sale is one of the largest to date in central Europe, estimated at US$1 billion. The 
bidders are <b>Telfar</b> (a consortium of <b>France Telecom</b>, and <b>Bell Atlantic</b>), 
<b>CeTel</b> (<b>Deutsche Telekom</b> and <b>Ameritech</b>), <b>Telsource</b> (<b>PTT Telecom 
Netherlands</b> and <b>Swiss Telecom</b>), <b>TeleDanmark</b> and <b>Stet International</b> (Italy). 
Twenty-six per cent of SPT has already been privatised through the vouchers system. <p>

<b>Welsh Water International</b> is to buy a 35.6 per cent share in <b>Severoceske vodovody a 
kanalizace</b> (SCVK) for US$11.53 million. In 1994 SCVK had a turnover of US$58 million and 
declared profits of US$6 million. <p>

German electricity companies <b>RWE Energie</b> and <b>OBAG</b> are taking minority stakes in 
joint ventures <b>Sko-Energo-Fin</b> and <b>Sko-Energo</b>. The Czech partner is <b>STE Stredoceska 
Energeticka</b> to provide and operate power and ancillary services for the Mlada Boleslav 
<b>Volkswagen</b> subsidiary, as well as providing heating for the inhabitants of Mlada Boleslav.  

<b>US West</b> has paid US$18.8 million (KC500 million) for a 28.6 per cent stake in Ostrava-based 
cable television operator <b>Kabel Plus</b>.<p> 

The <b>European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</b> (EBRD), in association with the 
<b>European Investment Bank</b> and the <b>Exim Bank</b> of Japan, is providing a 20 year, Ecu44.1 
million loan to Czech railways for the modernization of the Decin-Prague-Brno-Breclav line. The cash 
strapped railways have been unable to pay <b>Moravskosleszka vagonka</b> (MSV) the US$56.2 million 
(KC 1.46 billion) owing for 42 diesel rail carriages delivered in 1994.<p> 

The <b>Prague Stock Exchange</b> plans to move to real time trading in late 1995. 1995 has not been a 
good year for the exchange. The <b>HN-Wood 30 Index</b> has lost more than two thirds of its value 
since February 1994. The official <b>PX-50</b> index hit a record low in mid-March. Since 1 March 
shares in 674 enterprises issued under the second wave of privatisations can be traded on the exchange. 
The price at which they were first traded was allowed to vary 30 per cent from their indicative price, 
thereafter they were subject to the usual maximum of 5 per cent per day. During the course of March 613 
of the second wave issues were traded. Second wave shares accounted for around 30 per cent of the 
turnover in the 30 most traded shares in March.<p>   

<b>Skoda Plzen</b> Ghuangzhou subsidiary <b>Skoda Yinn</b> has started the production of electrical 
turbines. 1995 turnover is forecast at US$3.7 million. <p>

<b>Ministry of Trade and Industry</b> figures confirm 288 corporate bankruptcies (receiverships) in 1994, a 
dramatic increase over the 1993 figure of 68.<p> 

National airline <b>CSA</b> (now officially known as Czech Airlines) made a loss, by western auditing 
standards, of Kc740 million in 1994. <p>

<b>Jan Becher Karlovarska Becherovka</b>, producer of the famous liqueur, made a 1994 profit of 
Kc190 million on a turnover of Kc1.4 billion. Rumours of an investment by a west European distiller have 
circulated for some time. <p> 

The Czech Republic is the least expensive of the major central and eastern European capitals in which to 
employ managers, according to a survey published by consultants <b>Watson Wyatt</b>. When expressed in 
US dollar terms, a sales manager's basic salary in Russia would be US$20,035, in Hungary US$19,671, in 
Poland US$19,668 and in the Czech Republic US$17,726. The Czech Republic also compared well on 
basic pay to employees. The Czech respondents in the poll anticipated salary increases across the board of 
around 16 per cent on average, but those from neighbouring states foresaw much higher rises. Figures 
supplied by the <b>Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development</b> (OECD) suggest that 
average Czech salary levels are now only 10 per cent below those in Greece. More information from 
Watson Wyatt Data Services, tel: +44 171 222 8033 fax: +44 171 222 9182. <p>

<h3>HUNGARY</h3>

On 9 May the Hungarian parliament passed the long awaited <b>Privatisation Act</b>. The act is designed 
to rationalise the procedures relating to privatisation and make them more transparent. Privatisation has 
ground to a halt since the socialist government took office in July 1994. The government's target of 
raising Huf150 billion (US$1,200 million) in 1995 looks optimistic in the extreme. By the beginning of 
June not one major privatisation had been completed. Further information on the act, expected to come 
into force in late June or early July, can be obtained from the government's <b>Privatisation Information 
Services</b> tel: +361 269 8990, fax: +361 269 8991. 
<p>
UK supermarket chain <b>Tesco</b> plans to open 20 supermarkets in Hungary over the next five years, 
making it the first large UK retailer to open stores in eastern Europe.  
<p>
The 3 May AGM of the <b>Budapest Bank</b> provided the bank's 600 private shareholders and the 
city's banking community with a few surprises. It transpired that in December 1994 the government had 
clandestinely injected a further Huf12.3 billion into the bank. The news was particularly sensitive since 
the bank's CEO at the time was current `if it isn't hurting, it isn't working' Finance Minister Lajos Bokros. 
The capital injection was seen by many as an attempt to boost the bank's balance sheet before potential 
purchaser <b>Crédit Suisse</b> (who subsequently cried off) started its due diligence investigations. 
After the withdrawal of Crédit Suisse, Dutch bank <b>ING</b> said it was no longer interested.  
<p>
<b>Beslutsmodeller AB</b> creators <b>Scala International</b>, one of Hungary's leading suppliers of 
financial and management software, has merged with <b>Oracle Corporation</b>. 
<p>
Seven hundred members of the <b>International Advertising Association</b> gathered in Budapest for 
their annual global conference in May. The theme of the conference was, appropriately enough, 
`Globalisation'. 
<p>
Ailing <b>Agrobank Rt</b> was closed down by the State Bank Supervisory Office (SBSO) in mid-May. 
Bank president Mihaily Kovacs and Chief executive officer Peter Kunos were accused of corruption. Both 
men had been arrested at the end of 1994 on similar charges. SBSO officials claimed that the bank had 
managed to loan several times the amount of its declared assets. 
<p>
Budapest's <b>Gerbeaud Palace</b> home of the city's legendary patisserie has been put on sale for Ft1.5 
billion (US$12 million.) The sale is open to foreign purchasers.  
<p>
The newly created <b>State Privatization and Holding Rt</b> which combines the activities of the former 
<b>State Property Agency</b> (SPA) and the <b>State Holding Company</b> (AV Rt) looks likely to be 
headed by Imre Szokai, former diplomat and AV Rt board member. Under the arrangement, the new 
company will be responsible for all state disposals. Formerly the SPA handled non strategic companies, 
AV Rt those considered to be of vital national interest. 
<p>
Worrying news for the already unpopular Finance Minister Lajos Bokros. At the end of April the national 
deficit reached Ft147.1 billion, up Ft779 million in one month. The April figure already exceeded half the 
Ft282 billion forecast for the year. Not much cheer in the industrial production figures, for Bokros, either. 
This was down 54 per cent over the preceding month and 20.6 per cent below the February 1985 figure. 
<p>
An 8 per cent customs duty on all imports, except capital equipment and energy, was introduced as part of 
the overall austerity programme on 14 March. The former corporate tax rate was replaced by a two-tier 
structure under which declared profits are subject to an 18 per cent rate, while supplementary tax at the 
rate of 23 per cent is levied when profits are distributed. Tax holidays only apply to the 18 per cent rate on 
declared profits. Companies benefitting from tax holidays are still liable to pay the 23 per cent when due. 
<p>
The government has raised the consumption tax on new vehicles by 10 per cent to 20 per cent in an effort 
to control car imports, estimated at over US$1 billion each year. 
<p>
<b>Suzuki</b> <b>Hungary</b> is to expand the range of cars produced at its Esztergom plant. The 
expansion will see the plant manufacturing a hatchback version of its swift model, and beginning the 
assembly of four-wheel drive passenger cars for the <b>Subaru</b> group. Suzuki's Hungary operation 
posted sales of Ft15.5 billion in 1994 but made undisclosed losses. The company also plans to produce and 
sell 40,000 cars in 1995, half for Hungary, half for export, principally to the <b>EU</b>.  
<p>
<b>General Motors</b> subsidiary <b>Opel</b> is to double output of engines at its Szentgotthard plant. 
The new plant will have a capacity of 460,000 16-valve engines. 
<p>
<b>SEMA Group</b> of the UK has won a contract to provide the toll system for Hungary's first paying 
motorway link, a 60 kilometre stretch linking the city of Gyor (see Business Europa Issue 12) with the 
Austrian border. The contract was awarded by the <b>Transroute International Company</b> responsible 
for their equipment and the exploitation of the toll. 
<p>
<b>Pepsico Hungary</b> is to invest US$10 million in snack production in Hungary. Pepsico increased 
its soft drink sales by 40 per cent in Hungary in 1994, establishing itself as the country's market leader in 
colas, citrus drinks and mineral water. 
<p>
<b>Nutricia</b> the Dutch foods group has acquired a 22.5 per cent stake in <b>Hajdutej Tejipari</b> 
Hungary's largest regional dairy. Nutricia which already owns a distribution joint venture in Hungary, 
owns two dairy companies in Poland and two in the Czech Republic. The UK's <b>Unigate</b> holds a 
32 per cent stake in Nutricia. 
<p>
A consortium of <b>CS First Boston</b> and <b>Deutsche Bank</b> has won the mandate for the partial 
privatisation of <b>Matav</b>, likely to be central Europe's largest equity offering. The sale of up to 40 
per cent of Matav is expected to generate up to US$1 billion for the Hungarian state. The banks' fees for 
the privatisation are likely to be over US$60 million. The sale will complete the privatisation process 
begun with the sale of 30.3 per cent of Matav to <b>Deutsche Telekom</b> and <b>Ameritech</b> in 
December 1993. 
<p>
The Hungarian government has passed new laws to encourage greater price competition for public sector 
contracts, bringing the country closer into line with <b>EU</b> policy. Hungarian registered companies 
will still be allowed to win work even if their prices are 10 per cent higher than the lowest non-Hungarian 
bidder, as long as 50 per cent of goods and services are provided locally. 
<p>
<b>Sumitomo Bank</b> has arranged a US$60 million, five year syndicated loan for <b>Mol</b>, 
Hungary's oil and gas monopoly. The loan is to be used for the reconstruction of a gas field. <p>

<h3>LATVIA</h3>

Financial crisis and panic hit Latvia as, on 23 May, the central bank suspended operations at <b>Baltija 
Banka</b> the largest commercial bank in any of the Baltic States. The collapsed bank held accounts for 
400,000 depositors (Latvia's total population is 2.7 million) and 20,000 companies. The bank's collapse 
forced the resignation of Finance Minister Andris Piebalgs; his replacement, Ms Indra Samite announced 
that the government would be putting together a rescue package to reopen the bank quickly. The cost of 
the rescue plan was estimated at between Lats20-160 million (US$38-300 million). In June two more 
banks <b>Polarzvaigzne</b> and <b>Latintrade</b> were also declared insolvent. The governor of the 
<b>Central Bank</b>, Einars Repse, has gone on record that only 12-13 banks are commercially viable 
and capable of survival. This became a self fulfilling prophecy on June 12th when the <b>Deposit 
Bank</b> was declared insolvent. Accountants <b>Arthur Anderson</b> have been appointed as the 
bank's administrators. 
<p>
The newly appointed president of the failed <b>Banka Baltija</b>, Uldis Klauss, announced on 5 June 
that the bank had concluded an agreement with the <b>Latvian Shipping Company</b> whereby all the 
bank's real estate and intellectual `property' would belong to the company, which had a US$45 million 
deposit with the bank. US law firm <b>Baker Mackenzie</b> is to advise the Latvian government on the 
Banka Baltija case. 
<p>
Only one foreign bank, <b>Société Generale</b> of France has a branch in Riga. The <b>Dresdner 
Bank</b> has a representative office. 
<p>
A 9 June cabinet meeting agreed to decrease budget expenditures by 5 per cent across the board and to 
reduce the number of civil servants by 10 per cent in order to contain the budget deficit. May 1995 
(monthly) inflation was 1.4 per cent, unemployment 6.3 per cent, down 0.2 per cent from April. (Half the 
87,000 unemployed are female.) Industrial production declined by 2.1 per cent in April. 
<p>
Total direct foreign investment in Latvia reached US$371 million at the end-March 1995. 73 per cent of 
investment in Latvia is in the trading sector, 21 per cent in finance and 2 per cent in manufacturing. 
<p>
<b>Riga Airlines</b> is to increase its scheduled flights between London's Gatwick and Riga to six times 
a week, and will now offer a same plane connection to Moscow in association with Moscow based carrier 
<b>Transaero</b>. It has been rumoured that Transaero is a shareholder in Riga Airlines. 
<p>
<b>Ruhrgas</b> of Germany is involved in negotiations with <b>Latvijas Gaze</b> for the purchase of 
an equity stake in the Latvian utility. <b>Preussen Elektra</b> also of Germany, has expressed an interest 
in taking an equity stake in <b>Latvenergo</b>.  
<p>
Riga based <b>Tele Media</b> has issued a directory <b>Visa Latvija</b> with alphabetical listings of 
all major Latvian companies and enterprises. The volume covers all the major cities in Latvia - Riga, 
Daugavpils, Ventspils and Liepaja. 
<p>
Daily newspaper <i>Labrit</i> (Good Morning) with a circulation of 24,000 copies and a 6,000 
circulation Russian language edition, suspended printing on 17 April. It was reported that the paper's 
financial problems were due to the failure of certain shareholders to fulfil their obligations. 
<p>
The Latvian <b>Lat</b> is now included in the <b>Reuters 2000</b> foreign exchange dealing system.  
<b>Three Latvian banks -  Saules Bank, Riga Commercial Bank</b> and the <b>Latvian Capital 
Bank</b> are linked to the system. 
<p>
An <b>International Monetary Fund</b> (IMF) mission, lead by IMF Baltic department head Emanuel 
van der Mennsbrugghe visit Riga in early June. The mission may well decide to amend the Latvian-IMF 
memorandum which stipulates that Latvia hold its 1995 inflation rate below 15 per cent. This figure is 
seen as unrealistic by <b>Central Bank</b> President Einars Repse, who has said that inflation could 
remain above 25 per cent in 1995. The IMF mission held talks with newly appointed Finance Minister 
Indra Samite. 
<p>
Five Latvian commercial banks have applied to service a US$13 million line of credit. The five banks are 
the <b>Latvian Universal Bank Unibanka</b>, the <b>Commercial Bank of Riga</b>, <b>Latvian 
Investment Bank, Latvian Land and Mortgage Bank</b> and the <b>Bank of Latvia</b>. 
<p>
<b>Amoco/OPAB (Amoco Overseas Exploration Company/ Oljeprospektering AB</b> have held 
discussions with representatives of the Ministry of Economy to co-ordinate the text of an agreement 
relating to oil extraction in the Baltic. Neighbouring Lithuania has expressed its disapproval of the talks, 
although in early June Lithuania and Latvia reached a provisional - and still secret - agreement on 
extraction rights for a four kilometre wide area of the Baltic. 
<p>
<b>Shell Latvia</b> opened its first Latvian service station in Riga on 21 April. 
<p>
The <b><a href="http://www.lda.gov.lv">Latvian Development Agency</a></b> has published its annual <b>Latvian Export Directory 1995</b>. 
Copies can be obtained from the agency (Perses iela 2, Riga LV1442). 
<p>
The <b>Radisson SAS Daugava Hotel</b> in Riga opens on 1 July, with rates for the 365 rooms starting 
at US$135.00. 
<p>
Debt-ridden carrier <b>Latavio</b> looked in danger of closure at the end of May. <b>Latvian 
Privatisation Agency (LPA)</b> director Talis Linkaits announced that the LPA had assumed responsibility 
for all the airline's affairs. Earlier, LPA general director Janis Naglis had announced that the privatisation 
scheme for the airline was complete subject to agreement being reached over the airline's debts, estimates 
of which range from US$15 million to a mind boggling US$600 million. The airline's future has been 
further clouded by the collapse of its largest creditor, <b>Baltija Banka</b> and the intervention of 
Turkish `aviation consultancy' <b>INCOS</b>, thought by some to be a front operation for `Russian 
interests'.

<h3>LITHUANIA</h3>

Lithuania reported a 0.6 per cent growth in GDP in 1994. The GDP figure for 1994 was US$650 million 
(Litas 2.6 billion). The government expects a 5-6 per cent growth rate for 1995. Prices increased by 2.2 
per cent in May, while unemployment was 5.8 per cent. Industrial production increased by 30 per cent in 
March, but fell by 5.8 per cent in April.
<p>

<h3>MACEDONIA</h3>

Macedonia and the <b>World Bank</b> reached agreement in April for a US$99 million credit for the 
<b>Bank of Macedonia</b>. The credit comes in two tranches, one of US$85 million is to support 
Macedonia's current structural reforms, the other US$14 million is for expenditure on social projects. 
<p>
The German parliament has approved a DM5 million grant for construction works on the Beljakovce-
Deve Bair railway. 
<p>
Retail prices increased by 1.6 per cent in March as compared to February. The rise was alleviated by lower 
prices in the agricultural sector according to the <b>State Statistics Bureau</b>. Services rose by 5.3 per 
cent. 
<p>
The <b>European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</b> (EBRD) has approved a US$22 million 
credit for a 113.5 km power-line to link the Bitola power station with Skopje. 
<p>
A <b>Special Agricultural Corridor '95</b> has been opened to facilitate exports and mitigate losses in 
the transportation of agricultural products to European markets. Officially designated border-crossings 
under the corridor scheme will be: Deve Bair - Gueshevo on the Macedonian/ Bulgarian border, Ruse - 
Ghurghu between Bulgaria and Romania and Barash - Artand on the border between Romania and 
Hungary. 
<p>
The <b>Macedonian Privatisation Agency (MPA)</b> announced in July that 130 companies have so far 
been privatised. A further 462 have received MPA approval. Government revenue to date is DM13.5 in 
cash while a further DM12.62m has been released from frozen foreign currency deposits. DM52m has 
been paid into the <b>National Pension Fund</b> (15% of each company's social, or community owned, 
capital).
<p>
The government has set a target of privatising 791 companies by the end of 1995. Larger companies are 
beginning to join the process, as are those seeking foreign investment participation. These companies 
include <b>Oteks</b> (textiles, DM35.4m turnover), <b>GP Beton</b> (construction engineering, 
DM35.7m turnover) and <b>Ineks Drim</b> (hotels, DM3.2m turnover). 
<p>
The <b>European Court of Justice</b>, in a preliminary opinion, took the view that the trade embargo 
imposed by Greece on Macedonia did not breach the <b>Treaty of Rome</b>. Advocate-general Francis 
Jacobs took the view that were it not for a safeguard clause in the treaty relating to internal disturbances, 
times of serious international tension or the need to carry out obligations to maintain peace and internal 
security, then the embargo would clearly have been in breach of the <b>EU</b>'s common commercial 
policy.

The Russian Defence Ministry accepted the resignation and has promised Moldova that the 14th army 
troops will be withdrawn over a three-year period.

<h3>POLAND</h3>

President <b>Walesa's</b> main rival for the presidency, Alexander Kwasniewski leader of the main 
group of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) formally declared his candidacy in mid-May having won the 
backing of 296 out of 300 delegates at the annual convention of the Social Democracy of the Polish 
Republic party. Opinion polls show Mr Kwasnieski leading the presidential contenders with 20 per cent of 
the vote, followed by  Jacek Kuron of the Union for Freedom party and the ombudsman Tadeusz Zielinski, 
both with 15 per cent. Mr Walesa's share is put at 8 per cent.
<p>
<b>Moody's</b>, the international credit agency, accorded Poland an investment grade credit rating in 
May. The move coincided with Poland's first Eurobond issue for US$200 million. The improved rating 
will enable Polish authorities to seek investment from new sources of private capital. Apart from Poland, 
Moody's has now granted its investment grade rating to two other countries in the region - the Czech and 
Slovak republics. 
<p>
<b>Coca-Cola</b> has ordered four <b>Asquith Shire</b> vans, at a cost of US$50,000 each for its 
operations in Poland and Croatia.  
<p>
A Polish banking consortium led by <b>Bank Handlowy</b> made history in May by providing a US$260 
million loan, the biggest financial package yet arranged by domestic banks, to <b>Plock</b> refinery. 
Bank Handlowy also lead the consortium that granted a US$250 million loan for the modernisation of the 
<b>Turow</b> power station by <b>Asea Brown Boveri</b> (ABB) and <b>Pyropower Corp</b> of 
California. 
<p>
<b>Grolsch</b> the Dutch brewer plans to take a minority stake in <b>Brewpole</b> which owns 51 per 
cent of market leader <b>Elbrewery</b> and <b>Hevelius</b> a smaller brewery. 
<p>
Agriculture Ministry Under-Secretary Ryzsard Smolarek criticised the protective stance of the 
<b>European Union</b> over food imports. Polish farm exports, US$2.1 billion in 1994, (1993 US$1.6 
billion) account for 12 per cent of total exports. 
<p>
UK estate agents <b>Healey & Baker</b> have been appointed to market the <b>Ilmet Complex</b> a 
32,500 sq.m. development of offices, shops, restaurants and a banking hall situated on the ONZ 
roundabout in Warsaw. The first phase of the scheme is scheduled for occupation in autumn 1996. The 
company has also been appointed by <b>Mahler Project International</b> to market the <b>Ochota 
Office Park</b> to the west of Warsaw. 
<p>
Cellular concrete manufacturer <b>Prefabet-Ostroleka</b> has been rescued from bankruptcy by the 
improbably named <b>Ytong Holding Gmbh</b>. Under the arrangement, Ytong assumes responsibilities 
for all of Prefabet's liabilities (estimated at DM1.6 million) and will invest DM10 million in the plant. 
Ytong paid DM4 million for an undisclosed shareholding in Prefabet. 
<p>
<b>Pol-Float Saint Gobain</b> the Polish subsidiary of French glass manufacturer <b>Saint Gobain</b> 
is to spend DM170 million on an environment friendly glassworks at Dabrowa Gornicza. The company 
has signed a DM16 million contract with <b>Mostostal Zabrze</b> for the building structure. The 
glassworks will produce 500 tons of glass per 24 hour shift, and employ 250 people. Meanwhile, in 
Sandomierz UK glassmaker <b>Pilkington's</b> subsidiary <b>Pilkington Sandomierz</b> is investing 
Zl400 million in a factory to produce 140,000 tons of float glass per year for the domestic market, as well 
as windows for the <b>Fiat</b> and <b>FSO</b> auto plants. 
<p>
<b>Armstrong World Industries</b> new plant for the manufacture of thermal insulation products is to be 
located in Sroda Slaska. (<b>Coca-Cola</b> was the first US company to set up in Sroda Slaska). The 
new factory will open in early 1996 employing 117. 
<p>
<b>DSS Holding</b> of the UK plans to invest US$10 million in Kielce-based <b>Kieleckie Zaklady 
Wyborow Papierowych</b>. Some secrecy surrounds the investment pending negotiations with trades unions 
over employment levels, social security and wages. 
<p>
<b>Grundig SA</b> of Germany is proceeding with plans to construct a factory, in Kalisz, to produce 
between 60,000 and 200,000 14-inch television sets per year. 
<p>
<b>Motorola</b> has purchased a 38 per cent stake in <b>Uni-Net</b> whose principal shareholder is 
<b>RP Telekom</b>. The joint venture, backed by a US$5 million investment from each partner, will 
develop a radio-telegraphic trunking network called <b>Radio-Net</b>. 
<p>
US fast food specialist <b>McDonald's</b> plans to open 15 new restaurants in Poland by the end of 1995 
creating some 1,500 jobs. Average investment per outlet is about US$1 million. McDonald's has already 
invested US$30 million in Poland. 
<p>
Finance minister <b>Grzegorz Kolodko</b> threatened to resign in May in protest at the coalition 
government's failure to cut social security spending and other anti-inflationary measures. Annual inflation 
in April 1995 reached a worrying 32.4, worse than the 31.2 per cent registered in 1994. The government's 
inflation target for the end of 1995 is 20 per cent. 
<p>
Minister Kolodko also considers it unlikely that the end 1996 deadline for the privatisation of nine major 
banks will be met. Two banks <b>Bank Gdanski</b> and  <b>Powszechny Bank Kredytowy</b> are 
scheduled to be sold in 1995. Kolodko is pessimistic about the prospects for privatising the remaining four 
banks <b>Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy, Bank Zachodni, Pomorski Bank Kredytowy</b> and <b>Bank 
Depozytowo-Kredytowy</b> in 1996. The 1996 deadline was put forward by the Polish authorities as a 
precondition for a US$700 million loan from western governments to support the bank privatisation 
scheme. Bank privatisations have become unfashionable with Polish investors: bank stocks now account 
for over 40 per cent of the Warsaw Stock Exchange's total capitalization.
<p>
Any similarities between Polish Prime Minister Jozef Olesky and <b>Uncle Fester</b> of the <b>Addams 
Family</b> have been strongly denied.
<p>
<b>General Motors</b> (GM) plans to expand its co-operation with <b>Fabryka Samochodow 
Osobowych</b> (FSO) and is considering taking a stake in FSO. GM and FSO are already joint venture 
partners in <b>GM Poland</b> where GM holds 70 per cent, the balance held by FSO. Under the 
arrangements being considered by GM, the FSO facility would be upgraded to produce GM models from 
CKD kits. Meanwhile <b>Ford</b> will start assembling its <b>Escort</b> model in Plonsk at the end of 
September 1995, followed by the assembly of <b>Transit</b> vans a month later. 
<p>
New car sales in Poland grew by 3.4 per cent in 1994 to a total of 250,000. Market leader is the 
<b>Fiat</b> group with 52 per cent (130,000 units, followed by <b>FSO</b> with 84,000. Other 
manufacturers come in well behind, lead by <b>General Motors</b> with 3.9 per cent and 5,869 units. 
<p>
National carrier <b>LOT</b> has expressed a preference for banks, rather than another carrier, to acquire 
a strategic 29 per cent stake in the airline. 51 per cent of LOT is to be retained by the state, 20 per cent 
sold to the employees and the balance to a third party investor(s). LOT has a code sharing agreement with 
<b>American Airlines</b>. The national airline has also banned smoking in business class on all its Boeing 
767 flights, including those on the London-Warsaw route.

production line. 
<p>
Poland accounts for 24 per cent of total foreign investment in the region (US$17.2 billion at the end of 
1994), putting it in second place behind Hungary, with 27 per cent.

<h3>ROMANIA</h3>

At the end of May Romania marked its return to international capital markets with the signing of a 
US$150 million one-year syndicated loan for the <b>National Bank of Romania</b>. The loan,  arranged by 
<b>Citibank</b>, was increased from US$75 million to US$150 million after being heavily over-
subscribed. The loan is designed to improve the country's foreign currency reserves. 
Romania's first stock exchange <b>Bursa de Valori Bucuresti</b> is due to open in the summer of 1995, 
two years behind schedule. Mr Ioan Mihaila, president of <b>Intertrust SA</b> is to chair the nine man 
committee running the exchange pending the appointment of a general manager. The stock exchange will 
have a budget of Lei1 billion (US$530,500) and will be housed in a section of the <b>National Bank of 
Romania</b>. 
<p>
Romania was rebuffed by the <b>International Monetary Fund</b> (IMF) following the one-week visit of 
an IMF mission in May. The IMF decided not to release a US$265 million loan originally due in March 
because the Romanian government had delayed privatisation and restructuring the public sector.
The government has also failed to meet the conditions for a US$250 million <b>World Bank</b> 
<b>Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan</b> (FESAL). 
<p>
In May Parliament finally approved the <b>Mass Privatisation Programme</b> (MPP). The MPP aims to 
sell off shares in around 2,500 small- and medium-sized enterprises over a 12 month period, for a 
combination of cash and free privatisation vouchers. The MPP will give each Romanian vouchers worth 
Lei875,000 (US$464) to be exchanged for up to 60 per cent of the companies' equity. Since 1990, about 
1,000 companies have been privatised. 
<p>
Romania's industrial production stood at Lei3.8 trillion in February, up 9.2 per cent from January and up 
11.1 per cent on the preceding year. Industrial output rose by 7.5 per cent in the first two months of 1995 
as against the same period in 1994. 
<p>
The <b>European Investment Bank</b> is granting Romania US$100 million for the modernisation and 
development of the national telecommunications system. The loan will cover the installation, over a three 
year period, of between 20 and 30 new telephone exchanges and the expansion of existing exchanges.
<p>
<b>Romanian Development Agency</b> (RDA) figures for the first three months of 1995 show an 8.4 per 
cent increase in foreign investments since the end of 1994, from a total US$1.23 billion up to US$1.33 
billion. There are now 169 joint ventures with foreign equity participation in excess of US$1 million. 
<p>
Romania's unemployment rate dropped to 10.5 per cent in April, from 10.9 per cent in March. 
<p>
<b>Crédit Commercial de France</b> has been retained to advise on the sale of <b>Banca Romana 
Pentru Dezvoltare</b> the Romanian development bank, which will be the first state owned bank to be 
privatised. While the Romanian authorities want to privatise by the end of 1995, the general expectation is 
that it will take at least a year. 
<p>
The private sector accounted for 35 per cent of GDP in 1994, a 5 per cent increase over 1993. In the 
agricultural sector, private production averaged 80 per cent. The <b>National Commission for 
Statistics</b> estimates that 40 per cent of the labour force is now in the private sector.  
<p>
<b>Shell Romania SRL</b> opened its first petrol station in April at Otopeni on the outskirts of 
Bucharest. 
<p>
Korean industrial group <b>Daewoo</b> have taken a 51 per cent stake in <b>Rodae Automobile</b> 
the joint venture created from <b>Oltcit</b> the former state-owned manufacturer. Daewoo is to pay 
US$156 million in three staged payments for its stake in the company. The remaining 49 per cent is to be 
held by <b>Automobile Craiova</b>, which will assume responsibility for the debts and liabilities of the 
old company. The plant will manufacture the <b>Cielo</b> family saloon, initially from CKD kits, but 
eventually building up to 80 per cent local content. Annual production is expected to reach 120,000 units 
by 1998 with a targeted 50 per cent for export. 
<p>
Romania's long and medium term external debt at the end of 1994 totalled US$4.4 billion dollars, an 
increase of US$1.06 billion over 1993. Principal creditors are international financial organisations 
(US$2.71 billion), the <b>European Union</b> (EU) (S$550 million), the <b>International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development</b> (IBRD) (US$666 million) and the  <b>European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development</b> (EBRD) (US$138 million). Short term commitments at the end of 
1994 were US$889.1 million, with US$500.9 owed to Romania. 
<p>
Anglo-Dutch multinational <b>Unilever</b> is to take an additional 5 per cent stake in Ploiesti based 
<b>Dero SA</b>, its Romanian subsidiary. Unilever already holds 70 per cent of Dero's stock.

<h3>RUSSIA</h3>

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a US$6.8 billion loan for Russia, its second largest 
ever. The 12-month stand-by loan is designed to back up the economic reform programme aimed at 
reducing inflation to 1 per cent per month in the second half of 1995.
<p>
Monthly inflation fell to 7.9 per cent in May, a drop of 0.6 per cent over the April figure of 8.5 per cent. 
<p>
Russia accounted for 15 per cent of total foreign direct investment in the region at the end of 1994, behind 
Hungary (27 per cent) and Poland (24 per cent). If investments of less than US$10 million are excluded, 
Russia comes second with 31 per cent, behind Khazakhstan (39 per cent). 
<p>
Shares in a number of large enterprises are to be opened to bidding to both foreign and domestic 
institutions according to the <b>State Property Committee</b>. The decision reverses an earlier proposal 
whereby US$1.8 billion was to be loaned to the enterprises by a group of Russian banks using the 
companies' assets as collateral. The contentious bank proposal had aroused alarm among western banking 
circles as it risked concentrating enormous economic power in a very small group. Among those opposed 
to the deal was Finance Minister Vladimir Panskov, whose objections centred more on the terms and 
conditions of the loan proposal. 
<p>
Real GDP for the first four months of 1995 was down 4 per cent over the same period last year, suggesting 
that the recession was bottoming out. In 1994 GDP contracted by 4 per cent. 
<p>
The <b>Moscow Financial and Futures Exchange</b> is to begin trading on 17 July. The exchange will 
trade currency futures and equities in competition with the Moscow <b>Interbank</b> currency exchange. 
<p>
<b>General Alexander Lebed</b>, presidential wannabee, threatened to resign once too often at the end 
of May over Defence Ministry policy towards Moldova. This time his resignation was accepted by defence 
minister, <b>Pavel Grachev</b>. 
<p>
<b>Nearmedic</b>, a new pharmaceutical company, is to sell US$3 million worth of shares to fund its 
expansion. The company was originally established as a Soviet-British joint venture. The share issue is 
being handled by London based broker <b>Ice Securities</b>. 
<p>
<b>Lukoil</b> plans to convert shares in its subsidiaries into a single unified stock on the basis of one 
share in the main <b>Kogalymneftegaz</b> crude oil production unit. The company, which accounts for 
15 per cent of Russia's output, is also taking a controlling interest in six more enterprises, strengthening 
its grip on the industry. The six enterprises to be acquired include three oil producers - 
<b>Nizhnevolskneft, Permneft</b> and <b>Kaliningradmorneftegaz</b>, two distribution companies 
based in Kaliningrad and Astrakhan and the <b>Perm</b> lubricants factory. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <b>Rosneft</b> the oil company that accounts for more than a third of the country's output, 
is to be transformed into a joint stock company. The government will retain a 51 per cent share. 
<p>
<b>Association of Commercial Banks</b> sources estimate that only 10 per cent of Russia's 2,500 banks 
are adequately capitalised to meet the central bank's new reserve requirements and capital adequacy ratios, 
which came into force on 1 May. The reforms, spearheaded by `Iron Lady' <b>Tatiana Paramonova</b> 
acting chairwoman of the central bank have brought the authorities into conflict with the commercial 
banking sector. 
<p>
UK confectionery group <b>Cadbury Schweppes</b>, with its Russian partner <b>Rostel</b>, is to build 
a US$125 million chocolate factory at Chudovo near St Petersburg. With a 5 per cent share of the market, 
Cadbury is in second place behind the US <b>Mars</b> group. 
<p>
<b>AO Mosenergo</b>, the Moscow electricity and heat utility has retained <b>Salomon Brothers</b> as 
its international financial advisers. Salomon Brothers will advise Mosenergo on a long-term programme 
to increase its share value and make its debut in the international capital markets. 
<p>
Ex-boxer, and recently bankrupted UK entrepreneur <b>George Walker</b> through his company 
<b>SIS Telesport</b> is providing coverage of British dog and horse races to betting outlets in Russia. 
Over 700 outlets have applied for the service, which costs the proprietor between US$5,000 and 
US$25,000 per year. 
<p>
Russian nickel production is expected to reach 185,000 tonnes in 1995, an increase of 5,000 tonnes over 
the 1994 figure. Increased domestic consumption suggests that exports are likely to drop from their 1994 
level of 142,600 tonnes to around 110,000 tonnes.
<p>
Aluminium output for 1995 is forecast at 2.7 million tonnes, 25,000 tonnes up on 1994. 
<p>
<b>Irkutskenergo</b> of Siberia has appointed US citizen Mr James Rogers, Chief Operating Officer of 
<b>Cinergy</b> of Cincinnati to its board of directors. Mr Rogers does not speak any Russian. 
<p>
The <b>US Pentagon</b> is about to take delivery of a US$60 million <b>S-300 V</b> Russian built 
surface to air missile system. 
<p>
<b>Agrarian Party</b> Chairman Mikhail Lapshin forecasts a drop in agricultural production of some 
40-50 per cent in 1995. 
<p>
The <b>European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</b> (EBRD) is to grant US$1.5 million for 
the development of a Russian share registry. The registry will be set up with the technical assistance of the 
<b>Bank of New York</b>. The French <b>Commission des Operations de Bourse</b> is to sign an 
agreement to develop the equity market. 
<p>
A consortium of <b>Boeing</b>, Norwegian shipbuilder <b>Kvaerner</b>, <b>RSC Energia</b> and 
Ukrainian rocket builder <b>NPO-Yuzhoye</b> is to build a sea-based rocket launching centre for 
commercial satellites at a cost of between US$100-US$150 million. 
<p>
Moscow's <b>National Hotel</b> has reopened after refurbishment. The hotel  has 231 air conditioned 
rooms. Now managed by the UK's <b>Forte</b> group, room rates start at a US$310 per night. The price 
includes the bath-plug. 
<p>
Private Russian carrier, <b>Transaero</b>, has started regular daily flights between Moscow and St 
Petersburg. The service ends the 20 year monopoly of <b>Pulkovo Airlines</b>. 
<p>
The <b>Central Bank of Russia</b> has revoked the licences of 20 Moscow banks. In 1993 the total 
figure for the whole year was 26. Latest to go was that of the <b>Credit-Consensus</b> bank. 
<p>
`No plane, no gain' is the word as the private plane overtakes the mobile 'phone as <u>the</u> status 
symbol among Russia's business elite. <b>Raytheon Aircraft</b> has just sold the ninth <b>Hawker 
800</b> (secondhand, admittedly) to be operated in Russia. The aircraft are mostly operated by 
<b>Avcom</b> in Moscow, and serviced in Chester, UK. 
<p>
<b>Columbia-Presbyterian Health Services Inc.,</b> the <b>Fund for Large Enterprises in Russia</b> 
(FLER), and <b>Pepsico World Trading Inc</b> are operating the <b>Columbia-Presbyterian 
Moscow</b> medical clinic in Moscow. For an annual fee of US$475.00 Moscow residents have access to 
quality medical attention. Business travellers are eligible for a US$90.00 annual membership valid for 30 
days. (For more information: Sherrie Dulworth +1 914 767 7130). 
<p>
Office rents in Moscow are now the second highest in Europe. Only London is more expensive according 
to property consultants <b>Healey and Baker</b>. Moscow office rents average US$60 per square foot 
(US$600 per square metre), more expensive than Paris, Frankfurt or Brussels. Healey and Baker estimate 
a current shortfall of 75 million square feet (seven million square metres) with 1.9 million square feet 
(180,000 square metres) of office space coming on to the market in 1995. Since office development began 
in 1988-89, the take-up rate has been 100 per cent. Demand is set to outstrip supply for some time; Healey 
& Baker expect office rental levels to remain at current levels for at least three years. 
<p>
Expansive (and reputedly expensive) US lawyers <b>Squire, Sanders and Dempsey</b> have opened an 
office in Moscow in co-operation with the Moscow firm of <b>Kheifets, Binetsky & Kheifets</b>. The firm's 
Moscow office is to be headed up by Mr Mobbs - ( no connection, we're sure). 
<p>
The name <b>Smirnoff</b> is synonymous with vodka - and Russia. Once sole purveyors of vodka to the 
Imperial Russian Court with an annual turnover before 1917 of US$20 million, the Smirnoffs had to leave 
Russia - taking the recipe with them. 1994 saw Smirnoff vodka being distilled in Russia again for the first 
time since the revolution - using a pot still in the traditional way - to produce a new brew called Smirnoff 
Black, passed through Siberian Silver Birch charcoal. The Smirnoff company proposes to launch its 
Russian-produced Smirnoff Black in upmarket outlets in 1995. 
Vienna based <b>Carlton Partners</b> is suing its former partner, the <b>Nizhnevatovskneftegaz</b> oil 
company for breach of contract. Carlton claims that the Russian company refused to pay US$1.6 million 
in costs incurred by the partnership. 
<p>
Russian telecommunications provider <b>Central Telegraph</b> is to introduce a new radio-based data 
network using the <b>Widanet</b> system developed by the UK's <b>Racal Messenger</b>. With an initial 
order of some US$5 million, Racal is to supply Central Telegraph with 3,000 Radio pads - pocket sized 
modems, a number of base stations and a radio network management centre.

<h3>SLOVAKIA</h3>

The Slovak crown (Koruna) was revalued by 4 per cent in late May.
<p>
Peter Hrinko, President of Kosice based metal industry giant <b>VSZ</b> was fired in April after 14 
months in the job, along with two other members of the VSZ board, Ferdinand Petrak, VP Finance and 
Vladimir Balanik, VP sales. Hrinko was replaced by his deputy Jan Smerek. The dismissals sent shock 
waves through the Slovakian business community. VSZ employs 25,000 and has some 100 subsidiaries. 
The official reason for the dismissals was `big differences in opinion on major issues and inability to 
communicate well'. VSZ declared an Sk695 million profit in 1994. There is a sense of `deja vu' about the 
dismissals. In December 1993 four of the company's five-man supervisory board were dismissed, 
including then President Zoltan Berghauer. The company has had five different presidents since 1989.  
<p>
Investment funds <b>First Slovak Investment Privatization Company</b> (PSIPS) and <b>First Slovak 
Investment Company</b> (PSIS) (no connection) have had their licenses withdrawn by the Ministry of 
Finance. PSIPS' closure was caused by the fund's failure, and apparent inability, to pay out the Sk20,000 
due to each of its investors in respect of each coupon book. The fund's administration was first entrusted 
by the Ministry to <b>Tatra Invest</b> a subsidiary of <b>Tatra Bank</b> and later to <b>VUB 
Invest</b> the parent company of <b>VUB Kupon</b>. Matters were further complicated when VUB Kupon 
trading was suspended for a period of three months, following moves by dominant shareholder 
<b>Nomura International</b> to break up the fund. The suspension was eventually lifted on 27 April. 
Ladislav Vaskovic, VUB Invest's general director revealed that the PSIPS fund's reserves meant that 
shareholders would only receive SK14,000 per book, and not the SK20,000 originally promised. The case 
of PSIS raised more eyebrows as the company appeared to have an exemplary record of service for its 
700,000 clients. The company managed four investment and three cash funds.
The background to the government's position is the Meciar administration's determination to keep control 
of major industries after the next privatisation round scheduled for July 1995. Finance Ministry officials 
have indicated a wish to cut from 20 to 10 per cent the maximum stake that an investment fund can hold 
in companies to be privatised. There are also reports of moves to reduce to 5 per cent the voting rights 
funds can exercise in a privatised company, regardless of the size of their stake. 
<p>
Slovakia's budget deficit dropped at the end of March to Sk4.1 billion (US$140 million), Sk1.2 billion less 
than at the end of February. 
<p>
The <b>Hungarian Bank for Foreign Trade, Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank MKB</b> opened a branch 
in Bratislava on 1 April. 
<p>
<b>Vasa Televizia (VTV)</b> the private television station started by Zarnovica based <b>VTV Cable 
TV Ltd</b> began broadcasting on 22 April. The station will initially transmit via a cable network, 
although it has been granted a satellite licence.  
<p>
<b>Creditanstalt Bratislava</b> a subsidiary of Austrian <b>Creditanstalt Bankverein</b> opened with a 
capital of Sk315.5 million (US$10.9 million). The bank is the first wholly owned subsidiary of a foreign 
bank to be granted a licence in Slovakia.
<p>
Despite its obvious success - for the past year the <b>Bratislava Options Exchange</b> (BOB) has been 
the most popular trading exchange by volume - the exchange's future appeared to be in the balance as 
deputy finance minister Jozef Magula prepared plans to rationalise the securities market by concentrating 
spot and forward trading activities on the <b>Bratislava Stock Exchange</b> (BCPB). To date there have 
been four accepted ways of trading shares in Slovakia: through the BCPB, through one day forwards on 
the BOB, through the <b>RM Slovakia</b> (RM-S) continuous daily auctions `priebezna' and through 
the RM-S fortnightly auctions. 
At the heart of the problem is the BOB `one day forward' trade, which has allowed the BOB to trade 
shares in a more sophisticated fashion than the cumbersome procedures of the BCPB, and grab the lion's 
share of the market - to the irritation of the BCPB.
Igor Junas, BOB chairman, claimed that the uncertain position had placed BOB `in crisis.' The BOB has 
been losing money since it was first created in 1993 and has reportedly used its start-up capital. The 
consensus in Bratislava's financial circles at the end of May was that the BOB would find it difficult to 
overcome the opposition not only of the Finance Ministry, but also of the BCPB, which has formed an 
alliance with RM-S. 
<p>
The <b>International Monetary Fund</b> (IMF) has approved an advance loan of Special Drawing 
Rights (SDR) 128.7 million for Slovakia, 45 per cent of the country's quota. The Slovak debt to the fund at 
the end of october 1994 was SDR428.5 million. 
<p>
<b>Philip Morris</b> the US tobacco and foods group is being threatened with legal action over the 
treatment of minority shareholders in its Slovakian chocolate subsidiary <b>Figaro</b>. Minority 
shareholders have accused <b>Kraft Jacobs Suchard</b>, the Philip Morris subsidiary that manages 
Figaro, of depressing profits by channelling sales through sister companies and raising exorbitant 
management charges. 
<p>
Slovakia's constitutional court has blocked a move by Parliament in November 1994 to overturn the 
privatisation of 50 state companies approved by the state government. The court ruled that the proposed 
legislation `breached the right of private ownership, the principle of the division of power and the 
principle that a law cannot be retroactive'. Parliament has six months in which to redraft the law, 
`Otherwise it will be annulled.' President Kovacs refused to sign the law and returned it to the legislators. 
A group of 40 opposition deputies submitted the law to the constitutional court for review. 
<p>
Consumer price inflation fell from an annual 11.5 per cent in February to 11.3 per cent in March. 
<p>
The future of the <b>Mochovce</b> nuclear power station remained unclear as the Slovak government 
expressed doubts about its ability to meet the financial conditions attached to the US$292 million loan for 
the project from the <b>European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</b> (EBRD). The 
government asked the EBRD to postpone a decision while it considered an offer from <b>Skoda 
Praha</b> of the Czech Republic to complete the plant for DM800 million, about one third less than the 
price quoted by <b>Electricité de France</b> (EdF). The Skoda Praha offer would not qualify for EBRD 
assistance.

<h3>SLOVENIA</h3>

<b>SKK Banka</b> has launched the region's first hostile take-over bid - for Gorenje based 
<b>Gorenjska Banka</b>. The bid of St11,000 (US$99.00) per share compares with Gorensjka Banka's book 
value of St15,000 per share. 
<p>
Figures produced by <b>GiroCredit Research</b> the research arm of the Austrian bank, put Slovenia's 
economic growth at 5 per cent for 1994. GiroCredit attributes the upturn to high educational standards, a 
well qualified labour force and increased private consumption. The bank anticipates a growing budget 
deficit and fears that, despite the liberal investment regime, foreign investment is unlikely to pick up. Low 
levels of foreign investment are attributed to the introduction of a new company takeover law in July 1995, 
which is designed to place foreign and domestic investors on an equal footing. Under the provisions of the 
law, share purchases that add up to a greater than 25 per cent interest in a company will be subject to 
investigation. 
<p>
<b>Nova Ljubljanska banka d.d.</b> Deputy President stated, in an interview with <b>Reuters</b>, that 
the bank is likely to be privatised and quoted on the stock exchange `within two years'. 
<p>
Italy appears to have dropped its objections to granting Slovenia an association agreement with the 
<b>European Union</b> (EU). The EU has agreed to allow Italy to establish a financial centre in Trieste, 
offering generous tax breaks to banks, insurance companies and financial intermediaries for business 
carried out in the former communist bloc. The EU Commission hopes that the concessions granted will 
diffuse Italian concerns over property rights in Slovenia, around which objections to Slovenian EU 
association have focused. 
<p>
Adolf Zupan, Director General of <b>Telekom Slovenije</b>, the new company formed after the split of 
<b>PTT Slovenije</b>, in an interview with Ljubljana <b>Busines$</b> magazine, has set out the 
company's development plans. With 30 lines per 1,000 inhabitants, Slovenia is well above the regional 
average of 14 per 1000, but still has a waiting list of 51,000 and more than 30 per cent of subscribers 
sharing party-lines.

<h3>UKRAINE</h3>

A constitutional deadlock over the division of powers between the president and parliament was ended at 
the beginning of June when the two sides signed a `constitutional treaty' under which President Kuchma's 
authority to appoint ministers and issue decrees is enhanced. The deal is for a one-year period pending the 
introduction of a new constitution. 
<p>
The <b>European Union</b> has agreed to grant the Ukraine a balance of payments loan of up to Ecu22 
million. The loan will be subject to the same conditions as the Ukraine's stand-by agreement with the 
<b>IMF</b> and to the eventual closure of the <b>Chernobyl</b> nuclear plant. The loan adds up to one 
third of Ukraine's net borrowing requirement of US$900 million in 1995. 
<p>
Deputy coal industry minister Dmitry Peresenyuk announced in May the closure of 19 unprofitable coal 
mines by 1 July. Production for 1995 is forecast at 100 million tonnes, up from the 1994 figure of 94.4 
million tonnes. 
<p>
A 17 company consortium lead by Swiss-Swedish engineering group <b>Asea Brown Boveri</b> (ABB) 
has submitted proposals costing US$3.7 billion for the closure of the <b>Chernobyl</b> nuclear plant 
reactors and their replacement with gas turbines. 
<p>
New currency legislation introduced in April states that `non-resident employers must pay their Ukrainian 
resident employees only in Ukrainian currency'. The move looks likely to fuel dissatisfaction among 
locally recruited staff hitherto paid in foreign currency. And that's not all. New tax legislation means that 
employees of non-resident companies will also cease to benefit from a 50 per cent tax concession. 
<p>
<b>Ukraine International</b> airlines is reintroducing its (summer) seasonal Manchester-Kiev service. 
<p>
Ukraine has a new telephone dialling code. The former Soviet prefix is dropped, to be replaced with 380. 
Kiev is now 44 instead of 044.

<h3>Basic Structure</h3>
<P>
Bulgaria has a two tier banking system with around 72 commercial banks. 
In July 1991 the National Bank Law was passed which set out the central 
bank functions of the Bulgarian National Bank. During 1992 some private 
banks began to compete with the state commercial banks.
<P>
In August 1992, the Bulgarian National Bank approved the establishment of 
the Bulgarian Credit Commercial Bank formed from the merger of 22 joint 
stock banks. The new bank's portfolio of more than Lev11 million accounted 
for just over 10 per cent of the total credit in the banking system. This 
was the first significant example of bank consolidation which will 
eventually affect all 80 plus commercial banks in the country. Such a move 
was supported by the World Bank and the IMF who wanted to encourage greater 
international competitiveness and a more solid credit base.
<P>
The country's first private bank was the appropriately named First Private 
Bank which by the end of 1992 had more than 70 branches and 650 employees. 
The bank was formed by a group of entrepreneurs who formed the Union of 
Private Economic Enterprises (UPEE). 1992 was the first year in which 
Bulgarian banks' financial statements were checked by independent auditors.
<P>
Economic reform began in earnest in February 1991. By that time GDP had fall
en by 13.6 per cent from 1989, prices had risen by 53 per cent and some 
50,000 were newly unemployed. The state still owned 95 per cent of fixed 
productive assets. Bulgaria's infrastructure was in a parlous state and no 
legal framework existed for a market economy. Foreign debt servicing had 
been suspended, there was no access to finance markets abroad and creditors 
of the Bulgarian government had little faith that things could improve. One 
year later very little had been achieved - the state was still paramount, 
GDP had fallen by 21.3 per cent from 1990, consumer prices had risen by 
640 per cent, unemployment had risen to 450,000. Reform was stimulated by 
an IMF inspired stabilisation programme involving a restrictive fiscal and 
monetary policy, income and credit austerity. The budget deficit became a 
key target with emphasis on cuts in expenditure and revenue enhancement. 
Such measures had a predictably deflationary short term effect. Yet while
the budget deficit came under some control, imported inflation and the 
rapid fall in the industrial base continued well into 1992. Supply 
bottlenecks were commonplace and the currency fell in foreign exchange 
markets. Price liberalisation led to speculative hoarding and further 
shortages. Incomes were indexed to the rapid rise in inflation thus causing 
further long term effects on prices. In terms of real change, the 
privatisation programme up to 1992, had made little impact. Substantial 
reform was hampered by unstable government and lack of political will.
<P>
An International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission to Sofia in July 1994 approved 
Bulgaria's reform performance and said it would ask the IMF Board for 
additional funds to support its debt reduction deal. In principle, US$100 
million would be released upon approval by the IMF Board later in 1994. A 
further US$200 million is expected to become available after the next IMF 
Review mission in October 1994. IMF loans to Bulgaria in the first half of 
1994 include US$97 million in standby credits and Systematic Transformation 
Facility, totalling US$320 million.
<P>
After the freezing of foreign debts in 1990, Bulgaria began paying off 
overdue interest on its US$13 billion of foreign debts (mostly owed to more 
than 300 commercial banks around the world.) The 1992 budget deficit was 
raised in order to help finance this debt. Support came from the OECD who 
urged creditors to allow Bulgaria to continue what it saw as praiseworthy 
economic reform. At the end of June 1994 Bulgaria was due to sign a debt 
reduction agreement with the London Club of commercial bank creditors. The 
deal will cut by 47.1 per cent Bulgaria's US$8.16 billion debt to more than 
300 commercial creditor banks, led by Deutsche Bank. The World Bank has been 
approached for funding to cover initial payments under the deal.

<h3>Top Insurance Companies</h3>
The Bulgarian insurance industry is dominated by the State Insurance 
Institute (SII) founded in 1946. It has 110 branches and covers most of 
the country. With an annual income of Lev1,600 million, SII deals with all 
types of insurance. In 1989, a new division of SII - the International 
Insurance Division - was set up to deal with foreign insurance and 
reinsurance in the areas such as cargo insurance, property, shipping, 
aviation, all risks cover, and hotel liability. Bulstrad, founded in 1961, 
deals with foreign insurance matters.

<h3>Currency Regulations</H3>
In 1992 the lev remained as an non fully convertible currency and full 
convertibility was not expected in the short term. Banks and exchange 
bureaux are permitted to trade in convertible currency. To finance imports, 
foreign exchange can be purchased from the banks on presentation of 
certifying documents. Internal payments are made in levs although companies 
can keep hard currency accounts outside the country.

<h3>Foreign Investment Regulations</h3>
<P>
Foreign companies doing business in Bulgaria are regulated by the Law on 
Commerce (Commercial Code) and the Business of Foreign Persons and Foreign 
Investment Protection Act. The laws abolish the minimum investment 
requirement of US$50,000. Foreign companies can carry on business activities
in exactly the same way as Bulgarian citizens. Executive orders will no 
longer apply to foreign businesses (this was formerly a source of 
instability as government decree could change at any time in the old system).
<P>
Foreign companies may carry on any business which is not prohibited by law 
and which conforms to local legislation. Licences are required for the 
production and trade in armaments, banking and insurance activities, the 
exploration and exploitation of natural resources. Such licences that are 
required are issued by the government, banking permits are granted by the 
National Bank of Bulgaria. Foreigners are not permitted to own land, and 
joint ventures with foreign participation exceeding 50 per cent may not 
own agricultural land.
<P>
Foreign persons are permitted to carry on business in any legal form: sole 
trader, partnerships, limited liability companies and joint stock companies 
limited by shares. The size of a foreign interest in a partnership is not 
prescribed. Foreigners under the new laws are able to buy foreign currency 
from Bulgarian banks and transfer it abroad. Foreign persons are obliged to 
register with the local tax authorities within 14 days from the date on 
which the decision on their registration had been published in the Official 
Gazette. Foreigners must also register any investment made within 30 days.
<P>
Companies with foreign participation where the share exceeds 49 per cent 
and where investments equal US$100,000, are subject to a tax rate of 30 
per cent. Where there is a lower share of foreign participation, the ruling 
tax rate is 40 per cent (this also applies to firms where annual profits 
exceed Lev1 million.
<P>
Tax holidays apply to mixed companies operating in a designated free trade 
zone. For such companies, the first five years after registration are tax 
free, after this the rate is 20 per cent.
<P>
There are six free trade zones including the towns of Vidin, Rousse, 
Bourgas, Dragoman, Plovdiv and Svilengrad. Besides liberal profits tax 
treatment, these free trade zones offer duty free trading of all goods 
whether imported or exported, goods and services traded between the free 
trade zones and other areas of the country. Activities allowed within the 
zones include: manufacture of goods for export, loading and unloading or 
handling of duty free imported goods earmarked for export, commercial 
services, transport for international trade, banking, crediting and other 
financial operations. Labour relations and social insurance of Bulgarian 
citizens employed within the zones are the same as in the rest of the 
country.
<P>
Goods and services are subject to VAT which ranges from 10 to 60 per cent. 
Companies pay a 40 per cent profits tax regardless of the level of profit. 
Local authorities also charge a 10 per cent levy on taxable profit.

<h3>Stock Exchange</h3>
The Sofia Stock Exchange began operations in the first months of 1992. In 
the first year of operation most of the securities traded were shares issued
by the banks with a majority state holding. By the end of 1992 no debentures
of either Bulgarian or foreign companies had been traded. Growth was 
expected in the market for government bonds which were first released in 
December 1992. Growth of the stock market was hampered by the absence of any
Securities and Exchange legislation which is usually necessary to establish 
legal framework for trading.
<P>
There are several commodity exchanges which have developed fairly quickly. 
In January 1992, 13 commodity exchanges across the country formed an 
association to establish a standard information system, closer contacts 
between brokers, and formal rules for fair and open operations. One of these 
exchanges deals in fish trading and is based in Varna. There were plans to 
hold regular sessions with a daily bulletin of contractual information. 
Other commodity exchanges are limited mainly to staples such as sugar and 
salt.
<P>
The Plovdiv Commodity Exchange specialises in farm products: fruit and 
vegetables, seeds, saplings, farm machinery, foods, oils and metals.

<h3>Roads</h3>
Bulgaria has 36,935 km roads of which 33,766 are hard surfaced. There are 
240 km of motorways. In 1992 little progress was made with the much needed 
development of the road network. However, the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has granted a US$43 million loan for 
construction and repair on the country's roads and motorways. This is to be 
part of a US$105 million project. Monies would be directed to the completion 
of a 32 km stretch of international motorway between Plovdiv and Orizovo. 
These funds would also be used for upgrading some 800 km of primary roads 
serving regional and long distance transit traffic. The project was also 
designed to support a toll road operation on the existing motorway network. 
This was considered to be a first stage in promoting longer term private 
sector participation in the motorway construction.
<P>
Freight traffic between January and September 1992 stood at 106 million 
tonnes (down 28 per cent on the same period in the previous year) passenger 
traffic 1,336 million people (down by 2 per cent). Rail and air transport 
actually carried more people in 1992 than 1991.

<h3>Railways</h3>
6,597 km of track include 4,055 standard gauge, 2,609 km of which is 
electrified. There is a programme of rapid electrification and one of the 
government's transport development priorities is the modernisation of the 
main Dragoman Svilengrad Vidin Sofia Koulata line. The aim is to bring this 
and other routes up to modern European standards and help Bulgaria qualify 
for joining the European High speed System (TER). The first stage in the 
restructuring of the railways was completed in mid 1993. The project 
contract was awarded by the EBRD to CIE Consult (Eire), KMG Peat Marwick 
(UK office) and Kennedy & Donkin (UK). A five year strategic plan is to be 
drawn up to define the relationship between the state and the railways as 
an autonomous body.

<h3>Ports & Shipping</h3>
The state owned Bulgarian United Shipping and Shipbuilding Corporation 
controlled the country's ports and shipping. The two most important ports 
are Burgas with a loading capacity for tankers of 20,000 tons; the other 
main port is Varna.
<P>
The Bulgarian Marine Fleet which carries around 80 per cent of Bulgaria's 
trade has been transformed into a joint stock company. In 1992, however, 
the fleet was on the edge of financial collapse. With the average age of its
 tankers at 18 years, its coal freighters in need of overhaul and falling 
wages which did little to encourage skilled people to stay, the merchant 
marine was facing a severe crisis of confidence. On the positive side, a new
21,000 tonne vessel was on order from the country's Varna shipyard.
<P>
In September 1992, the Rhine Main Danube Canal opened to traffic to help 
relieve congested east west road and rail routes. Ships using the canal 
can reach the Black Sea from ports such as Rotterdam and Duisberg. Bulgaria 
will take some time to take full advantage from this new freight artery as 
it had no ships of the right size apart from three push tug boats and some 
barges. Pressure will grow on local ports to increase capacity and enhance 
transport links with the rest of the country's infrastructure.

<h3>Air Transport</h3>
One of three government priorities for transport development announced in 
1991, was the development of Sofia International Airport. Tenders were 
subsequently received from 67 foreign companies, 12 of which offered to 
handle the whole construction project. Halcrow (UK) is currently preparing 
the master plan for the extension.
<P>
Bulgaria's national carrier, Balkan Airlines, employs 4,000 people and had 
a sales turnover of US$210 million in 1991. Targeted for early privatisation, 
the merchant bankers S.G. Warburg were appointed advisors in 1992 to help 
expedite the transformation. Potential partners are yet to be identified 
one possible backer may be the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development. One problem has been valuing the carrier. In July 1993 the 
Bulgarian Economic Review announced that a price of US$80m had been 
established by the Privatisation Agency. Foreign shareholding is limited to 
49 per cent with 20 per cent set aside for staff. The state reserves the 
right to own at least 40 per cent of the stock. Balkan was granted a 15 year 
franchise to act as sole airline to 53 destinations worldwide. Warburg 
pointed to the potential profitability of developing charter flights to 
Bulgaria's Black Sea coast.

<h3>Production</H3>
Current oil production in Bulgaria is virtually negligible, despite 
considerable investment over the years, given the country's lack of modern 
technological equipment, especially in seismic interpretation and offshore 
drilling. Under the Communist régime, Bulgaria lacked investment funds 
necessary to purchase the technology or invest in research. The post 
communist government has brought in foreign companies.
<P>
At least eight agreements have been signed for exploration offshore in the 
Black Sea and on the Black Sea coast. These joint venture arrangements or 
concessions - which could be extended to cover other parts of the country 
include those with:

British Gas: to explore in the Kamchia and Burgas blocks.Exploration is 
expected to continue for five years.
<P>
Texaco Exploration Offshore Bulgaria Ltd: an exploration and production 
licence covering Block 3 together with Enterprise Oil (UK) and OMV.

The nuclear power station at Kozloduy consists of six units, the last of 
which was brought into commission in 1991. Until the end of 1990 the oldest 
four units at Kozloduy had one of the best load factors in the world. 
Recent international concern about the station's safety record, however, has
led to calls for its complete closure. Although two of the six units at 
Kozloduy were shut down for safety and maintenance reasons, it was accepted 
that the complete closure of Kozloduy was seen as impractical, given the 
dependence on nuclear power.  Instead the government increased tariffs to 
reduce demand and increased the salaries to attract the best engineers. 
Independent observers have noted a marked improvement in safety at 
Kozloduy; this has been due to training, new investment and a marked 
increase in employee morale.
<P>
The French company Sofregas planned to set up a joint venture with 
Gasstroymontazh to design and build gas distribution networks in medium 
sized Bulgarian towns. Finance from the EU PHARE Programme helped to launch 
the venture which will provide gas lines to around 100 centres around the 
country.
<P>
Plans have been announced to close all 11 uranium mines by 1995. Government 
figures say that one kg of uranium costs US$61 to produce while the maximum 
sale price is US$43. State funds were used to help in the closing down 
process. Non payment of wages caused by falling orders led to industrial 
action.

<h3>Production</h3>
Accounting for 26 per cent of employment and 16 per cent of GDP in 1993, the 
agricultural sector has declined less sharply than the country's industrial 
base. In 1993 agricultural output declined by  1.9 per cent, an improvement 
on 1992's figure of  7.7 per cent.
<P>
Due to lack of funds and disruption caused by the dismantling of the state 
co operatives, the areas sown for wheat and barley were already 10 to 15 per 
cent lower in 1992. The reduction in the sugar beet crop has meant that only 
10 per cent of domestic demand can be met. The cereal harvest in 1992 was 
estimated to be 6.8 million tonnes (it had been 10.2 million tonnes in 1980).
<P>
The state bought over one million tonnes of wheat for bread in the non 
producing regions. Drought led to the maize crop being about 750,000 tonnes 
lower than expected. There was a bumper harvest for sunflowers in 1992. Lack
of funds for fertilisers and other necessary chemicals brought the 1993 
crop level sharply downwards. The drought in 1993 has not helped matters. 
Farm animals have had to go without the required amounts of food as a result 
of the poor crop production. Many animals have died of starvation and the 
outlook for meat/poultry production does not look favourable.
<P>
Ninety per cent of Bulgaria's rice fields will be left uncultivated in 1994. 
Rice yields dropped to 10,000 tonnes in 1993, from a peak of 50,000 tonnes. 
In 1994 only 2,300 hectares are expected to be put under rice, meaning that 
Bulgaria will have to import rice to meet demand. The domestic cultivation 
of rice is no longer profitable.

Bulgaria's fishing industry was given a boost by the opening of a fish 
exchange in Varna. Catches range from Black Sea sprat, mackerel and turbot 
to fresh water fish such as carp and trout. There is a growing market for 
mussels and shrimps.

<H3>Telecoms Network</H3>
Bulgaria has the highest telephone density of any east European country. 
About one in three Bulgarians has access to a telephone, a rate comparable 
to that of Spain and Ireland. There are about 2.7 million telephone 
subscribers. These ostensibly attractive statistics disguise the severe 
problems of Bulgaria's antiquated telecommunications system. The waiting 
list is over half a million, most users are unable to dial long distance 
directly, and only 25 per cent of calls get through.
<P>
The government plans to spend US$339.8m on improvements to the system. In 
April 1993 the World Bank approved a US$30m loan in support of the project, 
which is also financed by the EIB and the EBRD. The project will install 
123,500 new digital lines and some 1,700 km of long distance optical fibre 
cables.
<P>
The telephone system is operated by the National Automatic Telephone Network
(NATN). In 1991 NATN had an annual income of US$117 million. Independent 
consultants have estimated a 7 per cent growth rate over the 10 years to 
2001. Total investment required has been estimated at US$1 billion.
<P>
In 1992 93 the communications network was reformed in three ways: a 
Telecommunications Bill, a Mail Bill and ordinances relating to private 
radio stations and cable television. The first licences for cable television
were granted in early 1993. Reform of the system began in 1991 when the 
Mail and Telecommunications Committee assumed regulatory functions for 
postal services, broadcasting and space communications. In 1992, supervisory 
functions were transferred to the State Communications Inspectorate. From 
1 January 1993, the operation of the telecommunications system fell to two 
new bodies, Bulgarian Telecommunications and Bulgarian Mail. It was 
envisaged that some form of state monopoly would continue for several years 
although privatisation of part of the industry can be expected in the near 
future.
<P>
In cellular telephony, a joint venture between Cable and Wireless (UK) and 
Bulgarian Telecommunications was established to install a mobile radio 
telephone system in Sofia, Bourgas, Varna and along the Sofia Plovdiv 
motorway. The expected total cost of the project was US$50 million.

Since the overthrow of communism, there has been a revival in the newspaper 
industry and the press in general. Censorship laws were liberalised in 1990 
and journals formerly banned were freely circulated. These included the main
organs of the large political parties: Demokratsiya of the UDF (circulation 
190,000), Druma - the BSP daily (300,000) and Trud - the union newspaper
(125,000).

Whilst television is still in the hands of the state organisations 
Bulgarska Televiziya and Bulgarsko Radio there are (end 1993) many private 
radio stations. There are two television channels (Channels 1 & 2), with 81 
and 45.2 per cent penetration respectively, and three radio stations on 
medium and short wave bands. There is a growing interest in satellite and 
cable television with foreign stations such as TV5 from France.

Bulgarians are naturally ebullient and hospitable people. It is usual to 
offer your hosts some hospitality at a good restaurant or club. It is not 
always expected that spouses would join the party. Shaking hands is the 
traditional form of greeting.

<H3>Eating Habits</H3>
<P>
Although western food is commonly available, there is much to be said for 
trying the local cuisine.
<P>
Breakfast in Bulgaria is a hearty affair with hamniks (a hot egg dish), a 
cold platter of eggs, meats, yoghurt (of which Bulgarians are proud), honey, 
jam and bread. The most important meal of the day is often lunch with 
salads, soup, a meat dish (or occasionally fish or chicken), and very sweet 
desserts such as baklava. Bulgarians have a sweet tooth. Coffee is usually 
served Turkish style - very thick, black and in small cups.
<P>
Bulgarian cuisine is centred around pork and lamb dishes using a wide 
variety of fresh vegetables. Specialist dishes include: shopska salad 
(diced tomatoes, cucumber and peppers) with sheep's milk cheese. Another 
famous dish is tarator, a cold soup of yoghurt, cucumber and walnuts. Street
snacks abound in Bulgaria with a strong Turkish influence: kebabcheta 
(grilled meats); kavarma (a meat and vegetable casserole); drob sarma 
(chopped lamb liver baked with rice and eggs); sarmi (stuffed vine leaves); 
banitsa (baked cheese and spinach).
<P>
Bulgaria produces its own full bodied wines. The national drink is the fiery 
slivova which is a plum, or sometimes grape, brandy. Typical of this part 
of the world, coffee is taken very strong and black, tea is usually served 
with lemon. In Sofia there are many high quality restaurants, some with 
nightclub or folksong entertainments. Food can also be enjoyed in the 
taverns or mehana, where the service is more informal (and often quicker).

<H3>Air</H3>
Balkan Bulgarian Airlines operate eight domestic lines connecting Sofia with 
all main towns. Shuttle service to Varna and Bourgas. Fares are generally 
inexpensive.
<P>
<a name="Road"></a>
<hr>
<a href="#Top"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Road</h3>
Good road network. For those arriving by car, the main routes are the E80 
coming from former Yugoslavia - the crossing point is at Kalotina; the E870 
crossing from former Yugoslavia at Gyuesevo; the E79 from Greece or the E80 
from Turkey.
<P>
<a name="Rail"></a>
<hr>
<a href="#Top"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Rail</h3>
Approximately 4,500 km of track connecting all main towns. First class 
travel recommended. Trains from the rest of Europe arrive at the Central 
Station which is in the north of Sofia. Travelling by train in Bulgaria can 
be frustrating unless tickets are bought in advance (avoid the stations and 
buy them at the reservation offices to be found in all major towns). The 
main routes from Sofia are to Varna, Burgas, Plovdiv, Dragoman, and Kulata. 
Trains are usually very busy and reservations are obligatory on express 
services. First class services are available on longer journeys and there 
are sleeping carriages on the Sofia Black Sea routes. Buffet car services 
are limited. A railway restructuring study was commissioned in February 1993 
and the Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ) announced plans to privatise all 
operations which are not central to its main activities.
<P>
<a name="Water"></a>
<hr>
<a href="#Top"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Water</h3>
Some towns along the Black Sea coast and the Danube are linked by hydrofoil 
and there is a regular ferry linking Bulgaria with Romania over the river 
Danube.
<P>
<a name="City"></a>
<hr>
<a href="#Top"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>City Transport</h3>
Efficient and cheap tram and bus service. Buses and trolleys in Sofia run 
fairly regularly, tickets are purchased in advance from a stand near the 
bus stop. A ticket is punched into the machine on boarding the bus. Inter 
city buses are often very crowded and are not recommended. All flights from 
abroad arrive at Sofia International Airport. There are several ways to 
travel the six mile ride into town; the cheapest method is by bus. There is 
an express service (number 284) and the slower number 84.
<P>
<a name="Taxis"></a>
<hr>
<a href="#Top"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Taxis</h3>
Available and cheap. Official taxis have meters. A 5 10 per cent tip in 
local currency is usual. Telephone number (Sofia) 597108. Taxis can be 
picked up at the stand and can be hailed anywhere in the city.
<P>
<a name="Car"></a>
<hr>
<a href="#Top"><img src="images/arrowup.gif" alt="Top" align=right border=0></a>
<h3>Car Hire</h3>
Service available from Balkantourist, large hotels and at Sofia 
International Airport. International driving licence not necessary. Most 
car hire accounts transacted in hard currency (between $0.40 and $0.60 per 
km). Drivers normally given special petrol coupons, which can be used 
throughout the country. Most of the main highways are good although often 
very busy. There are motorways linking Sofia with Plovdiv and the former 
Yugoslav border. Speed limits: out of town 80 kph and 120 kph on motorways, 
in town 60 kph. Drinking and driving strictly prohibited.

							Welcome to the <b>Worth OnLine Solution Series</b> -- the solution to your financial planning. Worth editors have formulated concise, well-researched responses to your 50 most frequently asked questions about investment strategies, taxes, estate pl
anning, and more.<p>
			
							Check out our formula for determining if you can afford a second home. 	An investment-portfolio work sheet for short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons enables you to calculate the appropriate assets for your income level and investment objecti
ves. You can also determine your risk tolerance by filling out a simple questionnaire.<p>
							
							We realize that you might have questions we have not touched upon in the Solution Series. There are other areas of the Worth OnLine site you can consult. Look in <a href="departments.html">Departments</a>, our virtual file cabinet, for investor res
ources. Also, try our archives. They form the most complete reference source for articles that have appeared in Worth magazine. The Bulletin Boards offer forums for investors to talk to one another about their money questions. <p>
							
							Soon we'll be bringing you a brand new version of the Solution Series, with interactive tools that enable you to customize the formulas to figure out your financial needs down to the dime.

					<center>
						<font size=4><b><i>Momentum players are flocking to oil drilling stocks, which is why you should avoid them.</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						Scott Satterwhite, manager of the $75 million Biltmore Special Values Fund, shops for bargain stocks where few investors dare to tread: among unknown companies, in turnaround industries, and wherever there's a business experiencing upheaval. He commonly tip toes around land mines like poor earnings, lack of liquidity, and perplexing balance sheets.<p>
But Satterwhite has an eye for overachievers dressed in underdog clothing--such stocks helped him bring investors in the Special Values Fund returns in excess of 30 percent last year.<p>
As bad as things may be for these down-and-seemingly-out stocks, Satterwhite does have his limits. "I don't want to come out with one leg and an arm," he says. "I look for companies with the staying power to get them through the rough times."<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Momentum players are flocking to the oil drilling sector.</font></b><p><p>
In 1994 the oil drilling sector was experiencing a dry spell. Rigs were docked and companies weren't making any money. Most money managers avoided the sector. But Satterwhite hit black crude with <a name="NASD:CLDR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13005"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cliff's Drilling Co.</b></a> (NASDAQ: CLDR). He was attracted to the company's low valuation and strong management. "It was debt-free and had a fair amount of cash," he says. The Special Values Fund bought the stock for $13.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Historical Stock Price Chart</font></b><p><p>
<img src="/imgs/Cliffs.gif" width=160 height=164>
<br><p>
In early 1996, the company borrowed $100 million to acquire a number of assets--including jack-up drilling rigs, land drilling rigs, and mobile off-shore production units. <p>
By all accounts, the move was an effective way to create value within the company. Too effective for Satterwhite. "In '94 you couldn't give the stock away," he says. "But then the stock price, earnings, and cash flow rose dramatically. Now the momentum players are here in a big way."<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Oil drilling insiders have started selling.</font></b><p><p>
When Cliff's hit $40 last summer, Satterwhite sold, feeling that the built--in-discount was gone. "Now in the $60s, there is little margin of safety. The environment in this volatile industry can turn so quickly," he says. "At these levels, Cliff's looks like a speculative investment to me."<p>
Apparently insiders feel the same--they have been selling off shares since last spring, and have continued to sell. According to Insider's Research Wire, company CEO Douglas Swanson has reduced his actionable holdings 88 percent. Others in the company have done similarly. "I think they know what they are doing," he says. Satterwhite puts the company's Fair Value at $40.<p>
[Post your questions and comments about Cliff's Drilling Co. on the <a href="/forums/talkstocks/stock1/worthboard.html">"Pan of the Week"</a> message board. Worth OnLine will forward your questions to Satterwhite and post his response in a few days.]

				<font size=6><b>A Penny Saved</b></font><br>
				<font size=4><br>By Jim Rogers</font><p>

				<blockquote>
					<center>
						<font size=4><b><i>Investors know how to save -- which is why they should only invest in nations that do, too.</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						My last column focused on what I believe is the single most important ingredient to success for global investors: the ability to identify nations that have unfettered economies and free markets -- in other words, those that foster economic freedom. Countries that move toward economic openness invariably beat out nations that move in the opposite direction -- and by wide margins. This month, I will explore how countries get the most benefit from economic freedom: namely, through savings and investment. <p>
Investors often fail to realize just how often the deck gets shuffled in the global economy. Nations that lead the pack rarely stay on top for long, and countries can come seemingly from out of nowhere to grab the lead. In an average lifetime, three or four major upheavals can occur in the world economic order. In the 20th century, global economic leadership has shifted from England to the United States to Japan.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Historically, wealth has shifted around the globe.</font></b><p><p>
This is the way of the world. People accumulate massive amounts of wealth and continually fail to hold on to it. It's a truism that it is easier to make a lot of money than to keep it -- and it's as true for nations as it is for individuals. Examples from history abound. In the 15th century, the Portuguese were rich. In the 16th century, conquistadors discovered gold and silver mines in Latin America and bailed out Spain, thereby giving it wealth for the next couple of centuries. Peru and Mexico profited as enormously from their precious-metal mines in the 16th and 17th centuries as the Kuwaitis and Arabs have from oil in the 20th century. Burma was the richest country in Asia in 1962, but now it's among the poorest -- far, far behind Japan and others.<p>
As countries accumulate wealth, their politicians all too often submit to the temptation to tax that wealth and redistribute it one way or another -- which makes them popular at the same time they are corroding the vigor of the body economic, a proclivity we've seen in this century in Europe and North America.<p>

<center><font size=+1><i><b>
A savvy investor can tell which countries are saving their pennies and which are not.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
I find it unfortunate that so many people still believe in the zero-sum notion that profit in one area necessarily creates a loss somewhere else -- or that the haves can succeed only at the expense of the have-nots. This is simply not the case. The science of economics -- dismal as it otherwise may be -- has shown it is possible for everyone to win at the same time.<p>
Savings and investment make this possible. <p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Business operators with the best ideas attract the most capital. Economies that promote this type of environment benefit everyone.</font></b><p><p>
When people save by setting aside a portion of their earnings, a pool of capital is created. This money, in turn, attracts folks with ideas about how to put it to use. If the capital is held by a bank, these entrepreneurs will try to persuade the bankers to lend them some of it. If the capital is directed into the stock market, the folks with the bright business ideas will compete for it in that arena.<p>
Over time, the business operators who have the best ideas (and can therefore offer the best returns) generally attract the most capital. In this way, the smartest and most efficient producers in each field receive the money they need to exploit their ideas, skills, and resources most effectively. <p>
Economies that promote this type of environment -- high savings rates along with a market-driven system for putting the accumulated funds to the best use -- benefit everyone. Consumers get the best products at the best possible prices. Workers go to jobs at enterprises that are healthy and expanding. Businesses get the capital they need to put their good ideas to work.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>A nation's savings rate is a good way to determine if a country is a good investment.</font></b><p><p>
But it all starts with savings -- the fuel an economy needs to grow. This is why, in addition to examining a nation's economic climate (capital gets distributed efficiently only if markets are free), I advise global investors to take a close look at a nation's savings rate.<p>
Just as economic performance can vary widely from country to country, so can savings rates. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Washington, D.C., Japan's gross savings rate in 1995, measured as a percentage of disposable household income, was 13.4 percent. Germany's savings rate was 11.6 percent, and France's was 14.3 percent. In contrast, the savings rate in the U.S. was equal to only 4.7 percent of disposable household income (down from 9 percent in 1982). Canada's rate was 7.4 percent, and Finland's was 5 percent.<p>
These numbers alone do not tell the whole story, however, because governments can foul up the picture by managing their finances poorly. When a government runs a budget deficit, it must go into the market and compete with business for a share of the nation's savings pool. When this happens, a nation's hard-earned savings can end up getting diverted from investments in industrial production and business expansion toward such things as military spending, social welfare, and -- when a government runs deficits year after year -- interest payments on government borrowings that are many years old.<p>
<p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>In addition to checking out a country's savings rate, look into its national balance sheet.</font></b><p><p>
So another way to look at how well a country is doing on the savings front is to check out its national balance sheet: its assets minus its debt. In doing so, an investor can figure out which countries are net debtors and which are net creditors. Even though a country's coffers may be overflowing, you have to be sure the country doesn't owe so much that its assets are offset by its debt.<p>
The International Monetary Fund publishes the International Financial Statistics Yearbook, which offers pages of fascinating data on the balance sheets of most countries. With this information, a savvy investor can examine which countries are doing a good job of saving their pennies and which are not.<p>
Which countries stand out? Singapore and Japan all have huge net-asset positions on a per capita basis. In 1995, Singapore's 3 million people had $20,376 per capita and Japan's 125 million people had $3,574. Even Korea was a creditor, with a per capita position of $644. Thirty years ago, most of these Asian countries were struggling to break even. Compare those amounts with that of the U.S., which had a net debtor position of negative $628 per person in 1995.<p>
<p><a name="SUB5"><b><font size=+1>Another good indicator? A country's total reserve figures.</font></b><p><p>
A country's total reserves, including its holdings of gold, are another good number to look at. According to the IMF yearbook, total reserves grew 773 percent for all industrialized countries from 1965 to 1995. Of these countries, the total reserves of the U.S. grew a meager 285 percent while Switzerland's total reserves grew 696 percent and Japan's a whopping 5,668 percent. <p>
These figures provide a strong indication of which countries not only enjoy wealth today but are managing themselves in a way that will enable them to have even more wealth in the future. The knowledgeable investor who's done well only in the U.S. over the past decades needs to realize that he or she is long on the dollar, which weakens every month as the U.S. national debt grows.<p>
<p><a name="SUB6"><b><font size=+1>"It's not just knowing who has the money now but figuring out who's going to use it the right way."</font></b><p><p>
Ultimately, these history lessons don't mean much unless you understand the real point: It's not just knowing who has the money now but figuring out who's going to use it the right way. In 1975, the United States was in decent financial shape but was headed down a rocky path. Asian countries today are the ones that have the formula right: Their governments' policies produce high savings rates. They also tax lightly in an atmosphere of economic openness. The result is one all investors recognize: Asian Tigers. Chile is the tiger of Latin America; it's at the top of the heap in terms of promoting savings and investment and letting the market have a free hand -- measures that pulled it out of one of the most severe economic slumps ever seen in our hemisphere. Chile's per capita net assets have risen from a frightening negative $21,267 in 1965 to a positive $757 in 1995. This economic miracle took more than the legislature's passing a few laws -- it also required a people's sustained effort over two decades to put their house in order.<p>
As Charles Dickens is often incorrectly quoted as saying (it's actually from the musical Oliver!): "In this world, one thing counts: in the bank, large amounts." Just as a large savings account gives an individual tremendous power over his own life and others, it does the same thing for nations and peoples: A country has to have the discipline not only to make money but to save it and then put it to good use. That means spending it on things that contribute to a nation's wealth-generating capacity, such as plants and equipment, and not on luxury palaces (Saudi Arabia) or on interest payments on ever increasing old debt (the United States).<p>
The job for the global investor is to identify the nations that understand that a penny saved is a penny that can produce returns.<p>

						<font size=4><b><i>Wine lovers can't get enough of the Napa Valley auction.</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						Here's the first rule for wine auctions held in fabulous settings: Don't expect bargains. Not that celebrations of the grape staged in such bucolic locations as Sonoma Valley and Napa Valley aren't terrific fun. The dinner parties, the vineyard tours, and the entertainment are all top-drawer. But when it comes to actually bidding on wine, that's more about charity and showmanship than about snaring a case of the grape below retail. <p>
Would you pay $28,000 for a six-liter bottle of the second release of Colgin-Schrader cabernet sauvignon? Or $42,000 for three three-liter bottles of the 1991, 1992, and 1993 Araujo Estate cabernet sauvignon? Those were winning bids last summer at the granddaddy of all the oh-so-social wine events, the Napa Valley Wine Auction, a fund-raiser held in Saint Helena, California. <p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
Saturday is auction day, and with 300 lots up for bid, the event can last seven hours.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
"The charity auctions have built up such a momentum now, people go to them not even concerning themselves about cost or price -- they've become events," says Jack Daniels, co-owner of Wilson Daniels Ltd., a prestigious wine-importing firm in Napa Valley. "The charities are the purpose behind them all, and that's why people are there. They have a tremendous time and do tend to get caught up in it."<p>
Since its inception 16 years ago, the big Napa auction has raised more than $11 million for local health-care organizations. And this four-day event (involving about 1,600 guests, who pay around $1,250 per couple) is so much fun that getting a ticket has become difficult. Invitations for this year's auction, scheduled for June 5 to 8, will be mailed in February, so now is the time to call for one (800-982-1371 or 707-942-9783, extension 901).<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>What will your $1,250 ticket get you? Plenty.</font></b><p><p>
The first day of the Napa auction, Thursday, is devoted to tasting unbottled wine from barrels (you may bid on cases during the weekend's silent auction). That evening, attendees dine in small groups (averaging 25 guests) at about 50 participating wineries, many of which hire celebrity chefs. Last summer, for example, Paul Bertolli of Oliveto in Oakland drove the stove for Robert Mondavi and his guests, while the chef and pastry chef from Manhattan's Les Celebrites did the honors at Beringer Vineyards.<p>
On day two, Napa wineries and restaurants offer special luncheon menus for auction guests as a prelude to the weekend's largest social event, the vintners' dinner at the sprawling Meadowood resort in Saint Helena. Always themed, the dinner is a raucous affair held under an enormous tent, with dancing till midnight. And the Napa crowd is big on dancing.<p>
Saturday is auction day, and with as many as 300 lots up for bid, the event can last seven hours. Local restaurants provide outdoor booths that offer house specialties. Staff circulate through the auction tent, liberally pouring from bottles of Napa wine carried in wire baskets. <p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Want Julia Childs and Wolfgang Puck to cook dinner for you? Last year that cost $100,000.</font></b><p><p>
Casual and social as the auction is, the bidding reaches serious heights. Last summer's top lot fetched $150,000 from one of Napa's own, Vine Cliff owner Chuck Sweeney. What did he get for his winning bid? Four dinner parties -- one for each season -- anywhere in the U.S., hosted by groups of Napa vintners, plus an astounding 90 magnums of wine, one from each member of the wine growers' association. <p>
The second-highest winning bid bought a re-creation for six people of the historic 1976 Paris Tasting, a two-night event: Julia Child and Thomas Keller (of the Napa restaurant the French Laundry) prepared the first dinner at Stag's Leap; Wolfgang Puck cooked the next night at Chateau Montelena. Throw in a couple of nine-liter bottles of 1993 wines, and you've got the package that fetched the $100,000 winning bid from Dan Lynch, who got seriously rich seven years ago when he sold his computer trade-show company to publishing giant Ziff-Davis.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Is Napa a little pricey for you? There are other options in the region.</font></b><p><p>
You don't have to be Mr. or Ms. Gotrocks to enjoy the lovely June weather in Napa Valley or the festivities that surround the auction. But along with your ticket, you'll probably need a rental car and lodging. Meadowood resort and Auberge du Soleil are the two most coveted addresses; Accommodations Referral (800-240-8466), a local agency, can help you with a range of options. <p>
If Napa sounds a bit over the top, Sonoma Valley hosts a much more informal auction weekend over Labor Day for about half the cost of the Napa package. And with visits to Sonoma vineyards, wine seminars, and an auction with buffet dinner and dancing, it's just as much fun -- you get to see winemaker and comedian Tom Smothers do tricks with his yo-yo (for details, call 707-935-0803). "If Napa is a Mercedes, Sonoma is a pickup truck with a half-breed dog in the back," says Anthony Dias Blue, chairman of the Sonoma Valley event and a regular at the Napa auction. "But everybody likes it that way."<p>

				<font size=6><b>The Case Against Microsoft</b></font><br>
				<font size=4><br>By Jim Jubak</font><p>
				</center>
				
				<blockquote>
					<center>
						<font size=4><b><i>Why a great company is no longer a good investment</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						It's almost hard to believe that a company so large (nearly $9 billion in annual revenue) and so well established (22 years old) can still be performing this well. True, <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> (NASD: MSFT) has made a habit of success. But even by its standards, 1996 was an extraordinary year.<p>
It was a year in which the company defied the skeptics and mobilized its resources to meet the competitive challenge posed by <a name="NASD:NSCP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Netscape Communications</b></a> (NASD: NSCP). In which sales rose an estimated 40 percent while earnings grew even faster. And in which the price of Microsoft's stock doubled, propelling chairman Bill Gates's personal wealth even further into the ionosphere.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Wall Street loves Microsoft. Why should you?</font></b><p><p>
Wall Street deeply believes in Microsoft. The market has priced the company's stock at 46 times annual earnings per share. Figures compiled by Zacks Investment Research show that 23 of the 30 analysts who follow Microsoft still recommend it as a buy even at its recent price. Collectively, these analysts expect the company's earnings to rise at least 23 percent annually for the next five years.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
Gates disclosed plans to send out waves of products and near-products to battle Netscape.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Microsoft, in other words, has now achieved one more noteworthy feat: It has become a sure thing. <p>
Which is exactly why I think there's good reason to be concerned about the stock. By bidding the price up to 46 times earnings, investors have given themselves almost no leeway for bad news, let alone room for improvement. Most of the good news is already baked into the price of the stock, so how much more upside reward can there be? <p>
By my calculations, even if Microsoft's earnings growth keeps pace with analysts' estimates, from this price the stock should deliver no better than an 11 percent annual return in the next few years. Basically, Microsoft would match the long-term performance of the market as a whole. If growth slows even slightly, investors would make more money by buying a 30-year Treasury bond and clipping coupons.<p>
I probably wouldn't be such a skeptic if one other person hadn't also recently expressed concern about Microsoft's future: Bill Gates. At the annual shareholders' meeting this past November, he said: "We have a number of competitors that are working in concert...that pose a major challenge to us -- perhaps the largest challenge that's faced us in a long, long time."<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>We're on the verge of big changes in the industry, which could affect Microsoft's monopoly.</font></b><p><p>
Microsoft is a great company -- the world's best-managed software outfit. But it still has its work cut out for it. It's not the sure bet Wall Street believes it is.<p>
A fair appraisal of Microsoft has to take into account that many of its products hold dominant positions in mature markets. This means there's little or no room left to grow at the expense of competitors or to increase overall sales at previous rates. Moreover, regardless of who wins the browser wars between Microsoft and Netscape, the Internet almost certainly is going to pose a continued serious threat to Microsoft's entire lineup of software products, including its most important offering: the operating system that runs 90 percent of the world's personal computers.<p>
By the end of this year, the familiar files-and-folders format of the Windows operating system will begin its slow trek into computer oblivion -- both Microsoft and Netscape will make their browsers the first thing a user sees when a computer gets turned on. Also headed for extinction, as consumers get accustomed to downloading whatever tools they need over the Internet: the $499 shrink-wrapped PC-software program. Say good-bye, too, to the market for the expensive biannual upgrade package. Upgrades will be easily accessible over the Net.<p>
Bill Gates is right: Microsoft is moving toward its biggest challenge since it first crawled out of the entrepreneurial ooze in 1981 -- the year the company purchased the DOS operating system from Seattle Computer for, according to legend, $75,000. <p>
I don't doubt that Microsoft will survive all of these challenges and remain a force to be reckoned with for years to come. The folks at Microsoft are too aware of what they did to <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> (NYSE: IBM) to let the same thing happen to them. <p>
But will Microsoft be able to preserve its near monopoly and juicy profit margins? Infatuated as it is with Microsoft at the moment, Wall Street certainly appears to think so. I'm less sanguine.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Microsoft's stock stalled in 1995 -- while up-and-comer Netscape's stock soared.</font></b><p><p>
Wall Street's current love affair with Microsoft stands in sharp contrast to the rocky relationship between the two as recently as 1995. Perhaps you remember: The development of Microsoft's new operating system, originally slated to launch in December 1994, was running horribly behind schedule. With the company's credibility at stake, Gates drew a line in the sand by naming the product Windows 95. The birth finally took place in August of that year with a multimillion-dollar marketing blitz and a mountain of publicity.<p>
While all of this was going on, though, a previously unknown (to Wall Street) company called Netscape stole the limelight. Netscape's innovation was a browser that enabled computer users to easily download the graphics-heavy information on the World Wide Web, the fastest-growing part of the Internet. On August 9, 1995, Netscape rocked the market with a red-hot initial public offering. That day, Netscape shares soared from $28 to a high of $75 before settling back to close at $58.<p>
Microsoft's stock, on the other hand, had stalled out. After rising from $31 a share in early February to $52 on July 14, its trading price drifted downward just as the arrival of the long-delayed Windows 95 product and the company's huge marketing and press campaigns should have been driving it higher. <p>
Analysts concluded that Microsoft had missed the boat. Although it had rushed its own Web browser to market, its Internet Explorer was clearly inferior to Netscape's product -- and the gap just seemed to get larger when Netscape launched its second-generation Navigator on September 18.<p>
By then, the word was out: Microsoft didn't have a credible Internet strategy. All anyone needed to do to confirm this suspicion was check out the Microsoft Network, a lame new online service that adopted the outdated membership structure of <a name="NYSE:AOL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15558"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>America Online</b></a> (NYSE: AOL) -- a company itself challenged by the Web. On November 16, 1995, Goldman Sachs removed Microsoft's stock from its recommended list, citing the company's lack of an Internet strategy. Others on Wall Street quickly followed.<p>
<p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>The company's December 7 announcement indicated that Microsoft will not lose due to the Internet.</font></b><p><p>
The Street was right about one thing: The Internet poses a serious challenge to Microsoft and its monopolistic grip on the market for computer operating systems. Windows not only generates an estimated $35 in revenue for each program installed by a computer maker, but its ubiquity gives Microsoft enormous clout in its other software lines. Microsoft programmers working on a spreadsheet or word-processing product simply know more about the underlying operating system than do independent software producers. They also have the inside track on updates. (Microsoft shares all this information with independent companies. The speed and extent of its sharing is a matter of industry debate.) Finally, Microsoft leverages its relationships with computer makers to ensure that its spreadsheets, games, and word-processing software come already installed on new machines.<p>
Netscape's Internet browser seemed like it could end Microsoft's lock on the operating system and, in turn, weaken its hold on the software market. How come? Because Navigator, linked with the Java software language from <a name="NASD:SUNW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14833"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sun Microsystems</b></a> (NASD: SUNW), is platform neutral. That means it will run on a Windows machine, a Macintosh, or in Unix. Java enables programmers to write applications that can be understood by any platform. Operating systems cease to matter.<p>
But on December 7, the anniversary of Pearl Harbor, Gates launched a counterattack that, at least in the opinion of Wall Street analysts, would successfully blunt the Netscape challenge. At a news conference, the software magnate pointedly quoted Japanese admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's 1941 fears that Japan's sneak attack had awoken a sleeping giant. Gates then disclosed plans to send wave after wave of products and near-products out to battle Netscape. The assault, Gates said, would include the next generations of Windows and Microsoft Office, both of which would be linked to the Internet. Windows NT, a new operating system for corporate networks, would provide easy access to the Net as well. And he promised that a revamped Microsoft Network would make its proprietary content accessible to all users of the Net.<p>
Some of the products and initiatives Gates trumpeted on December 7 turned out to be vaporware -- a standard Microsoft tactic that sets out to freeze the opposition in place simply by announcing a product that doesn't yet exist. But an impressively high percentage of the new offerings Gates listed that day are already on the market. MSN was relaunched as a full-service Internet gateway last November. Office 97 added the ability to communicate and publish information on the Net to old standby programs such as Excel. Internet Explorer 3.0, meanwhile, closed the technology gap with Netscape's Navigator.<p>
Microsoft's performance was so impressive that Wall Street couldn't help but kick itself for losing faith. <p>
"I thought that Microsoft was about to get smoked. It looked to me like they simply didn't get it," recalls Roger McNamee, general partner at Integral Capital Partners, an investment partnership in Menlo Park, California. But somehow, he marvels, within nine months the company got its act together. "I'm amazed at the religious zeal they've applied to reinventing themselves."<p>
"Gates did a remarkable thing," adds Michael Murphy, editor of California Technology Stock Letter. "The cliché about big oil tankers is that the captain decides to change course and 12 miles later the ship begins to turn. But Gates managed to turn a $9 billion company virtually on a dime."<p>
As far as Wall Street is concerned, December 1995 marked the high-water mark for Netscape and its threat to Microsoft: Netscape's stock peaked at a pre-split-adjusted $171 a share just days before Gates's speech. No one on Wall Street now wonders if Microsoft will survive. Now Netscape is seen as the company with the questionable future.<p>
<p><a name="SUB5"><b><font size=+1>Microsoft's cyclical upgrades might reach a saturation point.</font></b><p><p>
The problem with this version of events -- the story as Wall Street now sees it -- is that it radically simplifies the challenge facing Microsoft (just as the Street's fears about the company may have been overblown in the first place). And it overestimates the kinds of returns an investor can expect from Microsoft.<p>
In some ways, the account doesn't give Bill Gates and his team enough credit. The task wasn't simply to galvanize a 20,000-employee company to squash an 1,500-employee upstart like Netscape. The true challenge cut much closer to the company's core.<p>
Microsoft is an incredibly complex enterprise, but it earns its money in a straightforward manner. It sells new software -- $499 (retail) for Office 97, for example. It also charges current users to upgrade to the newest version -- $209 (retail) to upgrade Office. Both parts of this revenue stream are showing disquieting signs of maturity.<p>
Since Microsoft already has about as large a share of the market for existing users as it's likely to get, growth in first-time sales of programs is pretty much limited to the increase in sales of new personal computers -- which was about 15.5 percent in 1996 and is expected to slow to 14.5 percent in 1997.<p>
The upgrade business, meanwhile, traditionally works on a two-year cycle. Every other year, Microsoft rolls out new versions of Windows and Office. Users plunk down $60 for Windows and $210 for Office. This revenue stream, however, depends heavily on the consumer's appetite for newer, faster, and more -- an appetite that is showing signs of satiety (partly because software upgrades force users to make costly hardware upgrades). The incremental improvements that Microsoft made in Windows 95, for instance, did not send every Windows 3.1 user racing to the store. Dataquest, a market-research firm in San Jose, California, estimates that when all the figures are in Microsoft will have sold 46 million copies of Windows 95 by the end of 1996, 27 percent fewer than Dataquest originally projected. <p>
<p><a name="SUB6"><b><font size=+1>Through Office 97 and Web-enabling its software, Microsoft hopes to capture the Internet market.</font></b><p><p>
Office 97, which is expected to account for more than $3 billion in annual sales, may be facing an even bigger upgrade problem. The very complexity of the package, which is about 20 percent larger than Office 95, gives many users a reason not to risk overtaxing their machines to gain marginal improvement. Only 25 percent of users made the jump to Office 95 when the program was last upgraded.<p>
The Internet offers Microsoft a way to keep users upgrading and a potential source of new growth. Microsoft is "Web-enabling" all its software to make it easier to move directly from a program to the Web then back to the program. Work is under way to seamlessly link the next generation of such programs as Excel with the Internet so that a user can download information from the Web into a spreadsheet. Adding the Internet to the next upgrade, Microsoft's marketers have decided, provides the kind of improvement that will help drive sales. "The thinking is," says McNamee, "that people aren't paying for the functionality we've been adding so we'll Web-enable everything and people will pay us for that."<p>
The Internet also offers Microsoft opportunity for growth. Most Internet users now pay about $20 a month for Internet access. MSN is Microsoft's attempt to capture some of those dollars. Computer users who want MSN to be their gateway to the Internet can put the entire $20 into Microsoft's pocket.<p>
Microsoft also wants to get paid for content it creates, the primary reason for its investment ($220 million up front and $70 million a year) in MSNBC, a combined cable-TV news channel and Web page. Other Microsoft content either already on the Internet or under development includes Mungo Park, an adventure travel show that transmits video of its explorers to the Net, and Slate, a magazine of politics and culture edited by Michael Kinsley, formerly of The New Republic. Microsoft has said it plans to spend $300 million to $400 million annually to develop such content for at least the next three years.<p>
Microsoft's current course, while probably the best one the company could have adopted, should be seen for what it is -- a risky transition strategy whose success rests on proper timing and an unproven Internet business model. Web-enabling the newest generation of Office and the one thereafter gives the company a chance to preserve its revenue stream from upgrades of that product. "If Microsoft can maintain the value of the Office franchise, then it will keep growing at 25 percent a year," says McNamee. He also notes, however, that upgrading to a Web-enabled Office 97 makes no sense for much of the market. McNamee rates the company's chances of convincing a bare majority of users to upgrade to Ofce 97 as no better than 60-40. <p>
But Web-enabling its software is also risky: Microsoft may succeed in fending off Netscape, but its strategy will also accelerate the growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web.<p>
That has far-reaching effects on Microsoft's business model. Java makes it possible to embed programs in information. As a result, computer users won't need to activate a program like Excel to read or interpret data downloaded from the Internet. Instead, the data will arrive with their own spreadsheet or word-processing application -- an applet, in Java-speak -- already attached. <p>
Such downloads won't be free, of course. Data providers and software companies aim to collect fees for these transactions. Microsoft wants to sit "at the center of this huge array of transactions and collect a few cents every time someone uses their software in an application," says Murphy.<p>
<p><a name="SUB7"><b><font size=+1>What do these changes mean for Microsoft shareholders?</font></b><p><p>
This strategy could potentially channel a lot of revenue in Microsoft's direction but almost certainly at lower margins than Microsoft now enjoys. This won't be catastrophic for the company, but it could have big consequences for investors. As the table on page 67 shows, Microsoft's huge market capitalization hinges on its immense profitability. The company's 24.8 percent net profit margin humbles even such earnings machines as <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> (NYSE: KO) and <a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a> (NYSE: MRK). Put those high margins together with the company's extraordinary growth rate, and it's clear why Wall Street believes Microsoft is worth three <a name="NYSE:BA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10221"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Boeing</b></a>s (NYSE: BA) -- even though Boeing's annual sales exceed $21 billion.<p>
But now consider what even a slight drop in margins does to the growth rate in Microsoft's earnings. If margins stay steady, sales growth of 35 percent a year translates into earnings growth of 35 percent. But if margins drop from their current 25 percent to just 22 percent -- still above the levels at Coke and Merck -- profit growth falls to 18 percent. (Microsoft's margin was 22 percent in the mid- to late 1980s, a period when the company still faced significant competition in the software market; it makes sense to expect the company to earn similar margins in the competitive Internet environment of the future.)<p>
If Microsoft can do no better than increase its earnings at an 18 percent annual clip -- still an impressive performance by virtually any measure -- investors should count on earning about 5 percent a year on the stock through the year 2001. Take a look at the chart below to see the troubling details.<p>
<img src="/imgs/page68Feb.GIF" width=352 height=240><p>
<center><font size=-.5>Investors who believe Microsoft's earnings will grow by 35 percent in 1997 and 30 or 25 precnet annually thereafter should snap up shares. Growth that tapers to 20 to 18 percent (after 35 percent in 1997) will produce mediocre returns.</font><center><p>
That chart, in fact, clearly lays out the choices facing an investor. If you believe this analysis is wrong and Microsoft will increase earnings at 25 percent a year or better, you should buy the stock. If earnings grow at 30 percent for the next five years, an investor in Microsoft should earn about 27 percent a year. Earnings growth of 25 percent annually should produce a 19 percent yearly gain.<p>
It's hard for me to imagine Microsoft increasing sales and earnings -- while keeping margins intact -- at those rates for that long. Microsoft's mature businesses won't produce those rates of growth and revenues from the new Internet business, which, though it's growing quickly, is pegged by Microsoft at no more than $2 billion a year at the end of this period. That doesn't make it another Office.<p>
No, the other growth scenarios in this chart are much more likely, and they result in annual returns to investors of just 11 percent and 5 percent. That's certainly not good enough to make me want to buy Microsoft at current price levels. I can find other software and technology stocks that are earlier in their growth cycles or had their prices knocked down in 1996 and are likely to give me higher returns than I can earn with Microsoft.<p>
Would I sell the stock at its recent price if I owned it? Not yet. Wall Street typically overvalues a stock by assuming current growth will continue forever. Microsoft is headed for such a banner 1997 that the market could well give the stock a more excessive valuation than it has now. Knockout December and March quarters could put even more of the company's future performance into the stock price. Which would, of course, give an investor even less reason to hang on for the long term.<p>
<img src="/imgs/page66Feb.GIF" width=352 height=240><p>
<center><font size=-.5>Investors have built a lot of Microsoft's future success into the current stock price. From January 1996 through December 13, Microsoft's share price climbed 85 percent.</font><center><p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="/imgs/page67Feb.GIF" width=352 height=240><p>
<center><font size=-.5>Microsoft has a market value--the price per share multiplied by the number of shares outstanding--far higher than that of companies like Ford and Compaq, though they have far greater sales. Look no further than Microsoft's profit margin for a reason.</font><center>

						There's a lot of hype about how the Web is "empowering" individual investors. But it may sometimes seem as if the Web is deluging infoseekers rather than providing them with useful tools to manage and make more money.<p>
To help you navigate the maze and malstrom of online investing data, we've compiled a guide to online resources so you can spend less time clicking and keystroking and more time enhancing your portfolio.<p>

Welcome to the Worth OnLine Investor Help Desk. In this drawer you'll find a host of resources to help you avoid or resolve problems with financial-services providers.  <p>
 *Have you ever found an unexplained service charge on your bank statement that the institution would not rescind or explain to your satisfaction? Check out the <a href="/articles/I01.html">"Banking"</a> folder for some helpful Web sites, addresses, and phone numbers.  <p>
 *If you've been victimized by an investment adviser or telemarketer, take your complaint to the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. Click on <a href="/articles/I02.html">"NASAA"</a> for a list of the organization's offices in all 50 states.  <p>
 *In Worth magazine's monthly <a href="/articles/PZMS25.html">"Advocate"</a> column, we assist readers in getting action on their complaints against brokers, banks, mutual funds, and the like. The Advocate archive appears here. <p>
 *In 1995, more than $2 billion in abandoned property was reported across the U.S. Only one-third of it was claimed by legal claimants. You may be owed money that you've forgotten about (like a utility deposit) or don't even know about (perhaps money in a deceased relative's safe-deposit box). Worth OnLine shows you how to retrieve it in the <a href="/articles/I03.html">"Unclaimed Property"</a> folder.

					Peter Lynch is probably the best-known stock picker of our time and certainly among the most successful. He was portfolio manager of Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund for 13 years, starting out in 1977 with $20 million in assets and winding up his tenure in 1990, with more than 1 million shareholders and assets in excess of $14 billion. During that period, Lynch delivered an average annual return of just over 29 percent. 
<p>
Lynch has served as executive vice president and director of Fidelity Management & Research Company and managing director of FMR Corp. He has also written three bestselling books on investing: "One Up on Wall Street," "Beating the Street," and his latest, "Learn to Earn: A Beginner's Guide to the Basics of Investing and Business," (Simon & Schuster).
<p>
Since 1992, Peter Lynch has written exclusively for Worth magazine, and a complete archive of his work is available only on Worth Online. The stories are listed in chronological order.

				<blockquote>
					<center>
						<font size=4><b><i>Need technical support for your tax software? Don't come calling on the Internet.</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						Tax preparation software programs are very popular, and this year's versions are better than ever. The top three tax preparation software programs include, Intuit's <a href="http://www.intuit.com/turbotax/">"TurboTax"</a>, Block Financial Corp.'s <a href="http://www.conductor.com/software/techsupp.htm>"Kiplinger TaxCut"</a>, and Parsons Technology's <a href="http://www.parsonstech.com/">"Personal Tax Edge"</a>. <p>
Each has a Web site offering product information and tax advice. But if you need technical support, don't come calling on the Internet.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Intuit's site is complex, but its product search function is spotty.</font></b><p><p>
Intuit's site covers all of its products and offers seemingly good tech support search capabilities. However, since there are so many Intuit programs, simple searches become complex, and several of them did not even work. <p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
Block's site, although simpler to navigate than Intuit's, does not offer much in technical support.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
The "Top Questions" search asked me to select a product and then "Go." Nothing happened. And when I looked for another way to reach these Qs and As, I couldn't find one. The next search required me to select a product (or the "all products" option) and type in a keyword. This search worked well and found a lengthy list of forms and information about my keyword. Lastly, I tried to browse topics after selecting a product. But alas, the feature was inoperable. <p>
The tax advice on Intuit's site--including guides on "How To Survive an Audit" and "How To Avoid an Audit"--is useful. It also offers plain English descriptions of the 1996 tax changes and a calendar of important filing dates for 1997.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Block provides a list of tech support phone numbers.</font></b><p><p>
Block's site is simpler to navigate than Intuit's, but it's not very deep in its technical support offerings. For instance, the "Commonly Asked Questions" link lists less than 20 questions. <p>
The site does address "Known Problems & Updates," as well as offer users the opportunity to E-mail their questions to the company. They also supply a list of tech support telephone numbers. <p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Parson's programmers offer useful tips on using their software.</font></b><p><p>
Parsons Technology has a site full of information and heavy-duty graphics. But I had to wait forever to find anything worth reading. However, when the pages finally loaded I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of information I got. <p>
The best stuff was the <a href="http://204.42.80.117/ref/ptetips.html">program tips</a>, written by the software's programmers and developers. It is a long road to get there but the tips go on forever. These can be useful if you are confused about the field colors, certain keystrokes, and other software features.<p>
The tax advice includes 1996 tax legislation and links to separate pages for information on topics such as car expense, home used as business, and IRS audit selection criteria. Again, be prepared to wait a while before you arrive at the final page of information. <p>

						<font size=4><b><i>We begin our Peter Lynch-style series with a quantitative filter.</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						The best way to find good investment ideas is to look around you. If you're a butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker, or a cocktail shaker you have a vast reservoir of specialized knowledge that makes you a true expert.  <p>
You know knives, flour, home decorating, and glassware. You know meat, sugar, wax, and leisure. You know countermakers, industrial ovens, metals, and bars. Whatever your business or trade, you know what you need and what companies serve you best--so you know a lot of what you need to know about investing.  <p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>We're hoping the market has overlooked some beautiful things.</font></b><p><p>
But we can't put that kind of knowledge into a series of screens. Instead, we begin this series with a quantitative filter, the only kind our computer understands. <p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
We're hoping the market has overlooked some beautiful things about these companies.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
In this installment we screened for companies whose P/E ratios are below the median for their industry. We're hoping they're below the median because the market has overlooked some beautiful things about them. In most cases, that's not the case. The market is generally pretty good about pricing companies where they ought to be priced.<p>
So of the 1700-+ companies here that look cheap on a P/E basis, only a few are real bargains. Our Sangreal [Editor's note: post on the message board if you can't find this word in Webster's] is a neglected niche company, controlling a market segment, in an unglamorous industry that would be difficult and time-consuming for a competitor to break into. Stick with us for the quest.<p>

						<font size=4><b><i>What if the Social Security system bought marketable securities?</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						Social Security chatter leaves me in a gray daze. Too many people retiring all at the same time can't all spend the same money. A recent note concentrated my attention wonderfully. Here are the stripped down essentials:<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Social security taxes are already high. But since the money hasn't actually been invested, we'll have to pay them again.</font></b><p><p>
1) Social Security collects more than it spends and now has $549 billion in investments. (Good news!)<p>
2) Well, the $549 billion isn't really invested, it's been spent by the Treasury Department. (That's bad.)<p>
3) No problem, the Treasury Department gave the Social Security system IOUs! (Oh, good news!)<p>
4) Guess who pays the IOUs? (Heh, heh, heh.)<p>
</wam-subhead>The Social Security system lends money to the Treasury Department which in turn give the system back nonmarketable IOUs.</wam-subhead><p>
Social security taxes are already high. But since the money hasn't actually been invested, we'll have to pay them again. That's the short-short of a brief and clear note on Social Security by Jack Lavery and Nancy Vanden Houten of Merrill Lynch. By the way, paying off the IOUs won't do anything to help the long term Social Security deficit.  <p>
Quickly now--the Social Security system runs a surplus as long as it collects more in taxes than it pays out. As of the end of 1996, the surplus was $549 billion and by the year 2018 it's expected to be $2.87 trillion. <p>
Where is the money invested? It's lent to the Treasury Department.  The IOUs that the Treasury Department gives the Social Security system aren't bonds. They can't be sold--they're nonmarketable. By the way, the military and federal employee pension systems also "invest" in the same kind of non-marketable Treasury securities.<p>
</wam-subhead>There are three neat alternatives to the current system.</wam-subhead><p>
Say that Social Security is a piggy bank. We put money into our piggy bank today when we pay social security taxes. Tomorrow, we take the money out to buy candy--all the things that make up the expense side of the budget deficit. We put IOUs in the piggy bank to cover our candy bill. How can we get cash out again? We have to put cash in again first--through some more tax. So we end up paying the Social Security tax twice.<p>
What if the Social Security system didn't buy non-marketable IOUs--what if it bought marketable securities instead? Now we're getting somewhere. But where?<p>
Prudential Security's Charles Gabriel has a neat breakdown of the alternatives in the current issue of Strategy Weekly. A White House Advisory Council on Social Security split around three reform proposals. The first basically retains the current system, allows a little investing in marketable securities, and still plans for a tax increase to replenish the piggy bank. The second plan would scale back benefits, and force people to save in government-managed Individual Accounts through a new tax. The third plan, the Personal Savings Account, would basically let people manage their own investment accounts by kicking back a share of the taxes they and their employers pay.<p>
By the way, when the Advisory Council talks investing, it usually means investing in index funds.<p>
The details do get a big mind-numbing, but Social Security reform has huge potential to impact the markets, your personal savings plans, your tax bills, etc. Well, what do you think?

						<b>W. RANDALL JONES</b><br>
Chief Executive Officer<br>
Capital Publishing Company Inc.<br><p>
W. Randall Jones was named chief executive officer of Capital Publishing Inc., the parent company of Worth magazine and Worth OnLine, in April 1991. His goal was to "revolutionize personal-finance journalism with a publication that is intelligent, enterta
ining, and dynamic." If anyone was up to the task, it was Jones. An industry maverick, at 30 he became the youngest publisher of a major American magazine when he took the helm at Esquire. In 1987, he was recognized by Folio magazine as one of 20 under-35
 "fast trackers" in magazine publishing. A graduate of the University of Georgia, Jones holds a bachelor of arts degree in journalism.<p>
<b>JOHN KOTEN</b><br>
Editor<br>
Worth<br><p>
John Koten became editor of Worth magazine in January 1993, following a distinguished 15-year career at The Wall Street Journal. A senior editor at the Journal, Koten served as chief of the newspaper's Chicago bureau. During his tenure, the bureau gained 
a strong reputation for innovative coverage and storytelling and won such prizes as the Robert F. Kennedy Award, the American Heart Association's Blakesly Award, the Associated Press Award for feature writing, and the grand prize of the Aviation and Space
 Writers Association. The Chicago bureau's stories were also nominated for three Pulitzer Prizes.<p>
<b>LEWIS SCHIFF</b><br>
Executive Producer<br>
Worth OnLine<br><p>
In September 1995, Lewis Schiff was named the executive producer of Worth OnLine. Charged with revitalizing the magazine's online edition, Schiff overhauled the site's design and content and introduced daily, online-exclusive stories to the formerly month
ly site. "The financial markets are constantly changing. Wall Street professionals have long relied on the electronic medium for their livelihood," Schiff says. "Now we're able to bring Wall Street to Main Street by giving online readers Worth's unique pe
rspective on money--every day." Schiff began his career in magazine publishing with the launch of City Family/La Familia de la Ciudad, a two-language magazine for inner-city families, when he was 21. He is still involved in its nationwide growth. In 1992,
 he was hired at Roger Black Inc., a design firm that is internationally known for magazine makeovers, where he oversaw the digital production of new magazines. Prior to accepting his current position, Schiff was Worth's art production manager, a position
 he held since 1994. Schiff, a native New Yorker, attended Hunter College, City University of New York.<p>
<b>DAYANA YOCHIM</b><br>
Staff Editor<br>
Worth OnLine<br><p>
As staff editor, Dayana Yochim helped develop the daily content and permanent areas of the revamped site, and continues to look for ways to use the online medium to enhance Worth magazine. Before joining Worth OnLine, Yochim spent five years as associate 
editor at a business trade magazine, writing everything from in-depth corporate profiles to fanciful fashion pieces. Her story assignments took her around the world--everywhere from Italy to Taiwan. Although her new position has grounded her in New York, 
Yochim is enthusiastic about the assignment: "At least when I travel in cyberspace, I never lose my luggage," she says. Yochim grew up in Lawrence, Kansas, and graduated with a degree in newspaper and magazine journalism from the University of Kansas.<p>

<b>JESSICA ROBINSON</b><br>
Associate Producer<br>
Worth OnLine<br><p>
Setting the pace as associate producer is Jessica Robinson, who manages the hour-to-hour deadlines required to put out Worth OnLine every day. She also organizes the troops to take on the site's major projects. Before joining the publication, Robinson wor
ked for a non-profit group concerned with environmental/conservation issues and for which she organized conferences, and managed the organization's grants and budget. Robinson grew up in Boston and New York, and graduated from New York University with a d
egree in economics.<p>
<b>MATTHEW SHARFF</b><br>
Production Manager<br>
Worth OnLine<br><p>
Matt Sharff, Worth OnLine's production manager, lives and works in southern Vermont. He started out in New York as a technology consultant to many of the city's top design studios. He was instrumental in developing the creative-services department at one 
of the world's largest advertising agencies, Ogilvy & Mather New York. At Ogilvy, Sharff helped create campaigns for such notable companies as AT&T and American Express. In addition to his work for Worth OnLine, Sharff takes on various projects, from book
 and magazine production to multimedia design. Sharff graduated from Columbia University, New York, with a degree in history.<p>
<b>AMANDA MEFFERT</b><br>
Production Associate<br>
Worth OnLine<br><p>
As production associate, Amanda Meffert helps the Worth OnLine staff execute new projects and maintain the continually updated site. Meffert moved to New York and began working for Worth OnLine just prior to the site's February 1996 re-launch. A native of
 Ocala, Florida, Meffert graduated from the University of Georgia with degrees in journalism and Spanish.<p>

						PURPOSE OF THE MESSAGE BOARD: Worth OnLine's message board is an open forum to talk about matters of money and finance. It's also a place to discuss Worth stories, or post questions or comments to other Worth OnLine users. If you're looking for info
rmation on something, post a message; chances are someone at Worth or another user may have some helpful thoughts.<p>
THE RIGHT WAY TO POST A MESSAGE: Before you post a message, please look over all the forums and choose the most appropriate one. This helps keep ongoing discussions on track, and it usually brings the speediest response to your message. (If we happen upon
 a posting that's off a folder's topic, we may move or delete it to keep things organized.) Also, please keep in mind that the message board is intended to serve as an open forum, not just another way of E-mailing someone at Worth. Other users will be rea
ding your posting, so whenever you refer to a specific company, stock, or even a story from Worth, please provide enough information in your posting so that other users reading it will understand what you're talking about.<p>
PROBLEMATIC POSTINGS: Messages posted by subscribers are not reviewed, investigated, confirmed or endorsed by Worth; they reflect only the views of subscribers, who are solely responsible for their content. If you have a problem with a posting, we suggest
 that you respond to it. We invite you to bring any posting you believe to be inaccurate to the attention of the Worth OnLine staff. Please forward a copy of the posting and an explanation of your objection to <a href="mailto:WorthOnLne@aol.com">WorthOnLn
e</a>.<p>
THE ROLE OF <a href="/articles/H03.html">WORTH ONLINE EDITORS</a>: The message board also offers a way to tap the expertise of Worth's staff. Worth editors can help you track down additional details related to stories published in the magazine. And if we 
don't have the information you're looking for, we can also tell you about resources that can help you find your own answers. Keep in mind, though, that the primary role of Worth's staff is to serve as moderators for the public discussion online. While we'
re happy to chat about the market or the financial world in general, we're not going to advise you to choose a particular course of action regarding your finances. Neither will we recommend a specific security.<p>
Neither Worth magazine nor Worth OnLine is intended to replace the services of professional investment advisors. Even the information provided by representatives of Worth should not be relied on in lieu of professional investment advice. There is no subst
itute for healthy skepticism and your own good judgment. <p>
If you're having a problem with a financial-service provider, consider taking it to the Worth Advocate for help. To contact the Advocate, send E-mail to <a href="mailto:WAdvocate@aol.com">WAdvocate@aol.com</a>.<p>
ADVERTISING: The message board is intended for people to share ideas freely. It is not a place for advertisements or purely promotional postings. Messages including solicitations that are brought to our attention will be deleted.<p>
AND ANOTHER THING: A final note, please be respectful of other users. Though we hope that all who post messages to the board will do so responsibly, we can't guarantee the quality of the information provided by contributors, nor the wisdom of the opinions
 they express. We can't vouch for the motives of those who post messages to the board, nor can we routinely review or investigate their factual claims. In fact, you may well read a given posting to the message board before anyone at Worth does. *Take what
 you find here with a grain of salt.*<p>

						Worth is a different kind of personal finance magazine. We believe that intelligent investors need more than just a series of commands to buy this or that financial product. We think it's important to understand the trends, the institutions, the mar

keting ploys, and the inside economics of individual companies so that you'll know why a course of action makes sense.<p>
Times have changed. Twenty years ago, investors had to struggle to find any financial information beyond the stock tables. Today most investors are faced with too much information. Our task at Worth is to help you sort through it all. <p>
We also believe that it's important to take a wider view of personal finance than do most of the other magazines covering this field. Too often, financial advisors speak to us as if we were just cold-bloodedly rational financial machines. It's easy to sug

gest a portfolio full of risk to a 45-year-old, but another thing to execute that plan.<p>
As much as Worth readers are concerned with making and keeping and investing money, they are concerned with their families, their jobs, their relationships, and their communities. In other words, at Worth we believe that personal finance must include the 

personal as well as the financial.

It's easy! Simply enter a word or phrase relating to your area of interest. This can be a proper name or a fragment of a proper name (e.g., "Motor" or "Motorola" or "Eisner"), or a regular noun (e.g., "biotech" or "biotechnology"). (Quotation marks DO NOT need to be entered into the search fields.)
<p>
Here are some tips on searching using words and phrases.
<p>
<b><a name="single">SINGLE WORDS OR PHRASES</a></b>
<p>
Begin your search by entering a single word or phrase. This is approach works best when you have a specific term in mind. Let's say you want to find out about DreamWorks SKG, the entertainment company founded by Steven Spielberg, Jefferey Katzenberg, and David Geffen. Since "DreamWorks" is not a very common word, simply enter the company name to begin your search. If the first attempt doesn't work, do not despair! Try some of the other tips listed below.
<p>
<b><a name="frag">FRAGMENTS OF SINGLE WORDS OR PHRASES</a></b>
<p>
Let's say that you're not sure how to spell DreamWorks. In that case, you can search by fragment -- that is, by entering AS MUCH OF THE SEARCH TERM AS YOU KNOW. For example, entering "Dream" or "Dreamw" will produce a list of all articles which contain the word fragment you have designated. A search for "Dream" will probably return some articles that are not relevant--they simply mention the word "dream" somewhere. In this case, you should use the feature which brings up the list of articles with sample paragraphs. This will help you weed out articles that are unrelated to your area of interest. <p>
<b><a name="and">LINKING SINGLE WORDS OR PHRASES USING AND</a></b>
<p>
Example: Entering "Flat AND Tax" instead of just "Tax" will return a list of articles that contain both the words "Flat" and "Tax."
<p>
More on linking search terms using the word AND...
<p>
In general, the AND command is useful for helping you narrow down a broad search. Let's say you know that Steven Spielberg and David Geffen founded a company, but you don't remember what it's called. By entering "Spielberg AND Geffen" you'd get all articles that mention BOTH Spielberg AND Geffen. Or, let's say you're only interested in finding about a recent deal between DreamWorks and Microsoft, rather than pulling up all articles on DreamWorks. Entering the search words "DreamWorks AND Microsoft" would bring up only those articles that contain both company names. <p>

<b><a name="or">LINKING SINGLE WORDS OR PHRASES USING OR</a></b>
<p>
Example: Entering "Estates OR Trusts" instead of just "Trusts" will return a list of the articles that contain EITHER the word "Estate" OR the word "Trust" as well articles that contain BOTH words.
<p>
More on linking search terms using the word OR...
<p>
When you want to broaden your search you can look for articles that contain one of a number of words. For example, to find out as much about the founders of DreamWorks as you can, simply enter "Spielberg OR Geffen OR Katzenberg." This will return a list of all articles which contain any one of the three names as well as articles that contain two or all three of the names. (Entering "Spielberg AND Geffen AND Katzenberg" will give you *only* articles that mention all three, not stories about the individuals.) In general, the OR command is useful for making sure you don't miss an article which might be of interest to you.

					<font size=4>
						<br>There are quite a few one-stop-shopping-style sites for the investors on the Web. Almost all of these sites provide 15-to-20 -minute-delayed stock and mutual fund quotes or link you to other sites that do. They also typically give business news, some kind of company profiles, links to corporate Web sites, and other minutiae.  
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.stockmaster.com/">Stock Master</a href> is one of the better known and more useful comprehensive investing locales on the Web. Here you can retrieve quotes, examine short investing snapshots of companies, and check out investor sentiment survey data all with relative ease. The best part: "All our services are free to individual investors," say the folks at StockMaster. StockMaster is also relatively easy to navigate. To get data on, say, the La-Z-Boy Chair Co., including colorful charts showing how the company's doing compared to the S&P 500, just enter the ticker symbol or click through to search by company name. You can also send in your opinion on the stock.<br><p>
<a href="http://www.stocksmart.com/">Stock Smart</a href> bills itself as "an independent advocate for truth on Wall Street" that has "no conflicts of interest" and comprises "the new paradigm for the brokerage industry." Phew. What the folks at StockSmart mean is that in addition to industry reports, SEC filings, and business news, you can also click through to a specific mutual fund or stock, sifting by industry, market cap, P/E, and/or valuation. While StockSmart's company snapshots don't bring up the same eye-grabbing charts and graphs as can be found in StockMaster, they do make it easy to find out who the major institutional holders are for a particular issue.<br>  <p>
<a href="http://www.hoovers.com/">Hoover's Online</a href> is the electronic offspring of Hoover's, Inc., a "business information company" located in Austin, Texas. Here you can search out company data by name or ticker symbol, get quotes, find out about IPOs, and get stock tips from various knowledgeable parties. In order to get more than a bare-bones profile of a particular company, you must be a subscriber ($9.95 a month). The "Business Tools to Build Your Bottom Line" icon brings you to a catalog and price list of Hoover's publications, including global company directories, career advice guides, and electronic resource locators.<br>  <p>
If <a href="http://www.investorama.com/">invest-o-rama!</a href> sounds like a bit of a free-for-all, it is. The site bills itself as "the hippest directory of the best sites on the 'net for individual investors." With about 2,800 links at last count, invest-o-rama! delivers a lot. You'll probably want to start at "The Directory," comprised of 53 categories of investing links, with a short summary of what you'll find on each site. Aside from the usual melange of quotes and company profiles, you can also check out job listings at major companies and take online seminars with titles like "Investing 101" (look under "education"). Also, have a peek at "ask doug!," a handy FAQ column written by the site's inventor, Douglas Gerlach. <br><p>
<a href="http://www.investools.com/">INVESTools</a href>, another general investing site, offers about half a dozen pull-down menus which permit you to sift through quotes, profiles, research sources (like Morningstar and Zacks), and investment newsletter titles. (If you're interested in finding out more about newsletters, you should visit the <a href="http://www.margin.com/">Newsletter Network</a href>.) As with other sites of this type, you may eagerly link through to another resource only to find it's subscribers-only. INVESTools is free, but you are encouraged to register.<p>
Other heftily be-linked hubs include <a href="http://www.wsrn.com/">Wall Street Research Net (WSRN)</a href>, <a href="http://www.infomanage.com/investment/">Infomanage International</a href>, <a href="http://www.networth.galt.com/">NETworth</a href>, and <a href="http://www.briefing.com/">Briefing.com</a href>. <p>
At <a href="http://www.wsrn.com/home/index.html/">WSRN</a href>, you can access some 16,000 company homepages but caveat emptor--parts of most corporate sites are created by companies themselves and are as much PR and advertising as real financial information. WSRN also links to more than 75 investment management, brokerage, and research firm Web sites, all of which is great for the electronic window shopper.<p>
<a href="http://www.infomanage.com/investment/">Infomanage International</a href> has the requisite links for a general interest investing site, but is noteworthy in that it pays special attention to tech stocks.  <a href="http://www.networth.galt.com/">NETworth</a href>, part of the Quicken Financial Network, is well laid-out, but beware the mutual fund "atlas": some parts of the financial globe appear to be missing. <a href="http://www.briefing.com/">Briefing.com</a href> offers sophisticated tools for real-time analysis for $6.95 per month or $70 per year; click on their "tour site" link to see if you want to subscribe. For $7.95 per moth you can subscribe to <a href="http://www.marketedge.com/">Thomson MarketEdge</a href>, a service that allows you to create and automatically track your own portfolio. Check out the site to see what "members only" can get through MarketEdge.

						<br>If your focus is a bit narrower, there are a number of specialized investing sites. The <a href="http://www.techstocks.com/">Silicon Investor</a href> for example, focuses on computer, software, communications, and semiconductor stocks. It's "opening letter" gives an overview of the site. You also may want to check out the similar <a href="http://www.techweb.com/investor/investor.html">TechInvestor</a href> home page. <p>
<a href="http://www.optionscentral.com/">OIC</a> is the Web site of the Options Industry Council. The Council, formed in 1992, seeks to "educate brokers and investors on listed equity options" and includes five exchanges: Amex, NYSE, CBOE, Pacific Stock Exchange, and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The options world can be a confusing one so the OIC page is a useful place for newcomers to learn more.
<br><p>
If you're looking for a more rarified approach, you might want to check out <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~vp/">Dogs of the Dow</a href>. The Dogs page tells investors how to select underperforming securities based on a relatively simple approach involving dividend yield. The Dogfolk claim their approach has outperformed the DJIA by close to six percentage points annually since 1973. The <a href="http://www.HHconductor.com/">Conductor</a href> outlines a more complex form of investing wizardry consisting of four "unique but complementary technologies which shift the trading odds in your favor: neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and knowledge-based systems." Cost: $39.95 per month. Go to the site to learn more.<p>
Futures traders should call up <a href="http://apollo.netservers.com/~waldemar/wl.html">Waldemar's List</a href>, a gathering of links to other Internet sites of use to the futures investor. The Waldemar site is the brainchild of Waldemar Puszkarz, a Ph.D. student in physics at the University of South Carolina who hails from Poland. Accessing Waldemar's resume reveal that "futures and options markets" are one of his "activities/interests," along with chess, ancient civilizations and "really good beer." Download Waldemar's photo and you might think you're looking at NYPD Blue star Dennis Franz's home page.<p>
Investors following Canadian companies should hook into the <a href="http://www.visions.com/">Canada Net Pages</a href>, which contains end-of-day quotes from the Toronto, Vancouver, Alberta, and Montreal stock exchanges (click on "Stocks & Bonds").<p>
The <a href="http://www.growthstockinvestor.com/">Growth Stock Investor</a href>, is affiliated with TKO International, a PR and financial relations firm that, among other things, acts as an intermediary between companies and broker/dealers. Growth Stock's relatively slender "featured companies" list probably reflects TKO's own client base.<p>
If you're interested in media companies, even smaller ones, you might want to check out the "Company Profile Index" at <a href="http://www.herring.com/">herring.com</a href>, a Web site produced by the publishers of The Red Herring, a magazine which reports on the info-tainment industries. <p>
The <a href="http://www.xe.net/currency/">Universal Currency Converter</a href> is an extremely easy-to-use site that permits you to do... guess what? Want to convert 20 Algerian Dinars into Finnish Markka? No problem: just key in the request and bingo!  (Twenty Algerian Dinar, by the way, will buy you some 1.65 Finnish Markka.)
