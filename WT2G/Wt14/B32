<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-45-104.</H1>
1-45-104.  Filing - where to file - timeliness. (1)  For the purpose of
meeting the filing requirements of this article, candidates for statewide
election, the general assembly, district attorney, district court judge, or any
office representing more than one county, except candidates for school district
director, and political committees in support of or in opposition to such
candidates or in support of or in opposition to statewide issues shall file
with the secretary of state. Candidates and political committees in support of
or in opposition to such candidates or in support of or in opposition to
municipal issues in municipal elections shall file with the municipal clerk.
All other candidates, including candidates for school district director, and
political committees shall file with the county clerk and recorder of the
county of their residence, and, if the school districts contain more than one
county of this state, candidates for school district director shall file with
the county clerk and recorder of the county of their residence.
<P>(2)  Reports required to be filed by this article are timely filed if
received by the appropriate officer not later than the close of the business
day on the designated day.  Reports may be filed by fax and are timely filed if
received by the appropriate officer not later than the close of the business
day on the designated day and if an original of the report is received by the
appropriate officer within seven days of the designated day.
<P>(3)  Any political committee in support of or in opposition to any issue
which receives during any calendar year contributions or contributions in kind
not exceeding, in the aggregate, two hundred fifty dollars or which makes
expenditures which do not exceed, in the aggregate, two hundred fifty dollars
shall not be subject to the reporting provisions of this article.  The
provisions of this subsection (3) shall not exempt any political committee from
the requirements of section 1-45-106.
<P>(4)  For the purpose of meeting the filing requirements of this article,
political committees in support of or in opposition to issues which are not
statewide issues but are issues in a political subdivision of this state which
contains territory in more than one county of this state shall file with the
county clerk and recorder of each such county.
<P>(5)  No later than January 1, 1996, the secretary of state shall
establish, operate, and maintain such computer services as are necessary to
maintain a telecommunications network that allows electronic read-only access
to persons who wish to review the reports filed with the secretary of state's
office pursuant to sections 1-45-108 and 1-45-110.  The rates to be charged and
procedures for such access shall be determined by the secretary of state.  The
rates to be charged shall be set at a level which offsets the costs to the
secretary of state.
<P>(6) (a)  No later than January 1, 1996, the secretary of state shall
establish, operate, and maintain a telecommunications network that enables
electronic filing of the reports described in sections 1-45-108 and 1-45-110.
The secretary of state shall make computer software available to utilize the
electronic filing system.  The procedures for use of the electronic filing
system shall be determined by the secretary of state.
<P>(b)  In addition to any other method of filing, any person may utilize the
electronic filing system described in paragraph (a) of this subsection (6) in
order to meet the filing requirements of this article.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 2-1-100.5.</H1>
2-1-100.5.  Legislative declaration. The general assembly hereby finds and
declares that the state of Colorado shall be divided into districts pursuant to
the official figures of the most recent decennial census of the United States.
The general assembly further finds and declares that such figures are the most
reliable data that the state has available and that the use of any other data
or of any data adjustments may create a serious risk of inaccuracy and
injustice in establishing congressional districts to represent the citizens of
Colorado.

120.83, 120.85, 120.86, and 120.87.
<P>(2)  For the purposes of this section, the definition of areas to be
included in each congressional district is by reference to counties and to
official census tracts, census block groups, and census blocks created by the
United States bureau of the census to which fixed population counts have been
assigned as of the year 1990.
<P>(3)  If any area of this state is omitted from the provisions of this
section, inadvertently or by virtue of the complexities of the information
supplied to the general assembly, the secretary of state, upon discovery of
such omission, shall attach such area to the appropriate congressional district
as follows:
<P>(a)  If the area is surrounded by a congressional district, the area shall
be attached to such district;
<P>(b)  If the area is contiguous to two or more congressional districts, the
area shall be attached to the district that has the least population according
to the last preceding national census of the United States bureau of the
census.
<P>(4)  If any area of this state is included in two or more congressional
districts established by this section, inadvertently or by virtue of the
complexities of the information supplied to the general assembly, the secretary
of state, upon discovery of such inclusion, shall detach such area from the
congressional district or districts having the largest population and shall
designate such area as being included in the congressional district having the
least population; except that, if such area is wholly surrounded by a district
and by inadvertence is also included in another congressional district, the
secretary of state shall designate such area as included in the district wholly
surrounding such area, regardless of population.
<P>(5) (a)  (Deleted by amendment, L. 92, p. 603,  3, effective March 24,
1992.)
<P>(b)  If any annexation occurring on or after March 24, 1992, changes a
county boundary which constitutes any portion of the boundary of a
congressional district defined by this article, no adjustment in the boundaries
of congressional districts shall be made, but the area annexed shall constitute
a separate general election precinct.
<P>(6)  Any attachment or detachment made pursuant to the provisions of
subsection (3) or (4) of this section shall be certified in writing by and kept
on file with the secretary of state.  No change may be made in any such
attachment or detachment until the congressional districts are again
reapportioned.
<P>(7)  The legislative council shall prepare and file with the secretary of
state copies of maps showing thereon each congressional district and the
population of each district according to the official census lines, maps, and
statistics as described in this section.  In the event that there is a conflict
between the descriptions contained in subsection (1) of this section and the
boundaries shown on the maps filed with the secretary of state, the
descriptions contained in subsection (1) of this section shall prevail.  The
legislative council shall retain on file in its office copies of official
census maps and population statistics.
<P>(8)  The provisions of this section shall apply to the general election in
1992 and subsequent years until the congressional districts are again
reapportioned.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 2-2-310.</H1>
2-2-310.  Senate and house journals published. The speaker of the house of
representatives and the president of the senate shall have copies of each of
the journals of their respective houses published as soon as practicable after
the adjournment of each session of the general assembly.  The journals covering
regular sessions and special sessions may be combined in a single volume for
this purpose.  The chief clerk of the house of representatives and the
secretary of the senate shall, as soon as possible after adjournment of any
session of the general assembly, deliver to the secretary of state the original
journals of their respective houses.  They shall also deliver to the printer a
complete and accurate copy of the same, indexed and ready for printing, and
also a brief index of all bills, resolutions, and memorials introduced in each
of their respective houses during the session. The speaker of the house of
representatives and the president of the senate shall certify the correctness
of the published copies of said journals, which certificates shall be included
in and made a part of such publications.  Said journals, when printed and
certified, together with all former printed volumes of house and senate
journals of preceding sessions of general assemblies of the state of Colorado,
published by authority of the state of Colorado, shall be taken and held as
prima facie evidence of the originals thereof.

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
I.  General Consideration.
<P>II.  Journals used as Evidence.
<P>III.  Journals Showing Failure to Follow
<P>Constitution.
<P>I.  GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>Cross references. As to bills being presented to the governor, see  11 of
art. IV, Colo. Const.  As to reading and passage of bills, see  22 of art. V,
Colo. Const.  As to the general provisions relating to and specifications for
printing journals, see   24-70-201 through 24-70-222.
<P>Am. Jur.2d. See 49 Am. Jur., States, Territories, and Dependencies,  37.
<P>C.J.S. See 81 C.J.S., States,  81.
<P>II.  JOURNALS USED AS EVIDENCE.
<P>Courts will not take judicial notice of contents of legislative journals
when not pleaded.  People v. Bristol, 92 Colo. 325, 20 P.2d 309 (1933).  See
Marean v. Stanley, 21 Colo. 43, 39 P. 1086 (1895); Peckham v. People, 32 Colo.
140, 75 P. 422 (1904); Anderson v. Grand Valley Irrigation Dist., 35 Colo. 525,
85 P. 313 (1906); Rio Grande Sampling Co. v. Catlin, 40 Colo. 450, 94 P. 323
(1907); People ex rel. Kiefer v. Ramer, 61 Colo. 422, 158 P. 146 (1916).
<P>The reason for this is that the resort to legislative journals for proof
as to observance of constitutional requirements in passage of bill involves
finding of fact.  People v. Bristol, 92 Colo. 325, 20 P.2d 309 (1933).  See
Marean v. Stanley, 21 Colo. 43, 39 P. 1086 (1895) (decided under former law);
Peckham v. People, 32 Colo. 140, 75 P. 422 (1904); Anderson v. Grand Valley
Irrigation Dist., 35 Colo. 525, 85 P. 313 (1906); Rio Grande Sampling Co. v.
Catlin, 40 Colo. 450, 94 P. 323 (1907); People ex rel. Kiefer v. Ramer, 61
Colo. 422, 158 P. 146 (1916).
<P>And the party seeking to raise such question must, by pleading, present
issue and evidence on which he relies.People v. Bristol, 92 Colo. 325, 20 P.2d
309 (1933).  See Marean v. Stanley, 21 Colo. 43, 39 P. 1086 (1895) (decided
under former law); Peckham v. People, 32 Colo. 140, 75 P. 422 (1904); Anderson
v. Grand Valley Irrigation Dist.,  35 Colo. 525, 85 P. 313 (1906); Rio Grande
Sampling Co. v. Catlin, 40 Colo. 450, 94 P. 323 (1907); People ex rel. Kiefer
v. Ramer, 61 Colo. 422, 158 P. 146 (1916).
<P>Also, whatever the legislative body treats and accepts as its journal, is
so, and is not to be aided, supplemented or contradicted by reference to loose
papers and memoranda kept by the clerk, and which require parol testimony to
explain and identify them.  People ex rel.  Manville v. Leddy, 53 Colo. 109,
123 P. 824 (1912).
<P>And the courts have no authority to receive such evidence and so amend the
journal by importing into it something which was never there.  People ex rel.
Manville v. Leddy, 53 Colo. 109, 123 P. 824 (1912).
<P>But evidence aliunde the journal may be received to show that something,
once part thereof, has been abstracted or lost.  People ex rel.  Manville v.
Leddy, 53 Colo. 109, 123 P. 824 (1912).
<P>Also, the copy of the journals of either house of the general assembly,
printed under authority of this section, is prima facie evidence of the action
of the house.  People ex rel. Manville v. Leddy, 53 Colo. 109, 123 P. 824
(1912).
<P>But such copy is liable to be overcome by the original journal.  People ex
rel. Manville v. Leddy, 53 Colo. 109, 123 P. 824 (1912).
<P>III.  JOURNALS SHOWING FAILURE TO FOLLOW CONSTITUTION.
<P>Where the constitution is silent as to whether a particular act or
formality required in the passage of a bill shall be entered upon the journal,
the matter is in the discretion of the house.  People ex rel.  Manville v.
Leddy, 53 Colo. 109, 123 P. 824 (1912).
<P>However in such case the presumption arising from the enrolled bill lodged
with the secretary of state, is not overcome by the silence of the journal.
People ex rel. Manville v. Leddy, 53 Colo. 109, 123 P. 824 (1912).
<P>Otherwise, as to those matters which by the express command of the
constitution are required to be recorded, such as the names of those voting on
the final passage.  People ex rel. Manville v. Leddy, 53 Colo. 109, 123 P. 824
(1912).
<P>But whether the requirement respecting the entry of the vote on final
passage is directory or mandatory, and whether a failure to comply with it, if
shown by the legislative journals, prevents the act from becoming a law, are
questions relating to the construction and application of the state
constitution, upon which the decision of the supreme court of the state is
controlling.  Rio Grande Sampling Co. v. Catlin, 40 Colo. 450, 94 P. 323
(1907); Portland Gold Mining Co. v. Duke, 164 F. 180 (8th Cir. 1908); Portland
Gold Mining Co. v. Duke, 191 F. 692 (8th Cir. 1911).
<P>And it was held that this requirement was mandatory.  Rio Grande Sampling
Co. v. Catlin, 40 Colo. 450, 94 P. 323 (1907); Portland Gold Mining Co. v.
Duke, 164 F. 180 (8th Cir. 1908); Portland Gold Mining Co. v. Duke, 191 F. 692
(8th Cir. 1911).
<P>A failure to comply with it, if shown by the legislative journals, is
fatal.  Rio Grande Sampling Co. v. Catlin, 40 Colo. 450, 94 P. 323 (1907);
Portland Gold Mining Co. v. Duke, 164 F. 180 (8th Cir. 1908); Portland Gold
Mining Co. v. Duke, 191 F. 692 (8th Cir. 1911).
<P>And if therefrom it appears that the requirements of the constitution were
not observed the attempted enactment is without effect.  City of Denver v.
Rubidge, 51 Colo. 224, 116 P. 1130 (1911).
<P>Also where it appeared from the published journals that it was not
complied with in respect to an act, an attempt made by a succeeding session of
the general assembly to correct the error was ineffectual.  Rio Grande Sampling
Co. v. Catlin, 40 Colo. 450, 94 P. 323 (1907); Portland Gold Mining Co. v.
Duke, 164 F. 180 (8th Cir. 1908); Portland Gold Mining Co. v. Duke, 191 F. 692
(8th Cir. 1911).
<P>But where the complaint is that in one house the provisions of  22 of art.
V, Colo. Const., were not complied with, mere excerpts from the journal of that
house, not assuming to state in what manner the bill passed on final reading
will not suffice.  City of Denver v. Rubidge, 51 Colo. 224, 116 P. 1130 (1911).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-40-111.</H1>
1-40-111.  Signatures - affidavits. (1)  Any initiative or referendum
petition shall be signed only by registered electors who are eligible to vote
on the measure.  Each registered elector shall sign his or her own signature
and shall print his or her name, the address at which he or she resides,
including the street number and name, the city and town, the county, and the
date of signing.  Each registered elector signing a petition shall be
encouraged by the circulator of the petition to sign the petition in ink. In
the event a registered elector is physically disabled or is illiterate and
wishes to sign the petition, the elector shall sign or make his or her mark in
the space so provided.  Any person, but not a circulator, may assist the
disabled or illiterate elector in completing the remaining information required
by this subsection (1).  The person providing assistance shall sign his or her
name and address and shall state that such assistance was given to the disabled
or illiterate elector.
<P>(2)  To each petition section shall be attached a signed, notarized, and
dated affidavit executed by the registered elector who circulated the petition
section, which shall include his or her printed name, the address at which he
or she resides, including the street name and number, the city or town, the
county, and the date he or she signed the affidavit; that he or she has read
and understands the laws governing the circulation of petitions; that he or she
was a registered elector at the time the section of the petition was circulated
and signed by the listed electors; that he or she circulated the section of the
petition; that each signature thereon was affixed in the circulator's presence;
that each signature thereon is the signature of the person whose name it
purports to be; that to the best of the circulator's knowledge and belief each
of the persons signing the petition section was, at the time of signing, a
registered elector; and that he or she has not paid or will not in the future
pay and that he or she believes that no other person has paid or will pay,
directly or indirectly, any money or other thing of value to any signer for the
purpose of inducing or causing such signer to affix his or her signature to the
petition.  The secretary of state shall not accept for filing any section of a
petition that does not have attached thereto the notarized affidavit required
by this section.  Any signature added to a section of a petition after the
affidavit has been executed shall be invalid.

whether a sufficient number of valid signatures appears to have been submitted
to certify the petition to the ballot.
<P>(2)  If the petition was verified by random sample, the statement shall
contain the total number of signatures submitted and whether the number of
signatures presumed valid was ninety percent of the required total or less or
one hundred ten percent of the required total or more.
<P>(3) (a)  If the secretary declares that the petition appears not to have a
sufficient number of valid signatures, the statement issued by the secretary
shall specify the number of sufficient and insufficient signatures.  The
secretary shall identify by section number and line number within the section
those signatures found to be insufficient and the grounds for the
insufficiency.  Such information shall be kept on file for public inspection in
accordance with section 1-40-118.
<P>(b)  In the event the secretary of state issues a statement declaring that
a petition, having first been submitted with the required number of signatures,
appears not to have a sufficient number of valid signatures, the
representatives designated by the proponents pursuant to section 1-40-104 may
cure the insufficiency by filing an addendum to the original petition for the
purpose of offering such number of additional signatures as will cure the
insufficiency.  No addendum offered as a cure shall be considered unless the
addendum conforms to requirements for petitions outlined in sections 1-40-110,
1-40-111, and 1-40-113, and unless the addendum is filed with the secretary of
state within the fifteen-day period after the insufficiency is declared and
unless filed with the secretary of state within the time required by the state
constitution before the election at which the initiative petition is to be
voted on.  All filings under this paragraph (b) shall be made by 3 p.m. on the
day of filing.  Upon submission of a timely filed addendum, the secretary of
state shall order the examination and verification of each signature on the
addendum.  The addendum shall not be available to the public for a period of up
to ten calendar days for such examination.  After examining the petition, the
secretary of state shall, within ten calendar days, issue a statement as to
whether the addendum cures the insufficiency found in the original petition.

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
Source: L. 93:  Entire article amended with relocations, p. 687,  1,
effective May 4.
<P>Annotator's note. Since  1-40-117 is similar to  1-40-109 as it existed
prior to the 1993 amendment of title 1, article 40, which resulted in the
relocation of provisions, relevant cases construing that provision have been
included in the annotations to this section.  For additional cases see the
annotations under former  1-40-109 in the 1980 replacement volume.
<P>V.   Amendment and Withdrawal of Petition.
<P>VII.   Protests Before Secretary of State.
<P>V.  AMENDMENT AND WITHDRAWAL OF PETITION.
<P>The provision that a rejected petition, etc.
<P>Former subsection (2), which provided that a rejected petition may be
amended and refiled as an original, did not subject a cured petition to the
deadline set forth in Colo. Const. art. V,  11 (2).  Montero v. Meyer, 795 P.2d
242 (Colo. 1990) (decided under law in effect prior 1989 amendment).
<P>VII.  PROTESTS BEFORE SECRETARY OF STATE.
<P>Amended protest was properly dismissed by the secretary of state pursuant
to former version of this section, despite the secretary's incorrect
notification to the protestor that a protest could be filed by a specified
date.  The secretary of state lacked the authority to enlarge the protest
period provided in former version of this section and protestor cannot state
claim for relief under theory of estoppel against a state entity on the basis
of an unauthorized action or promise.  Montero v. Meyer, 795 P.2d 242 (Colo.
1990) (decided under law in effect prior to 1989 amendment).
