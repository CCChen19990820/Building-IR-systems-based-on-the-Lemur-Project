<H2>Clean Air Act Reform</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>  State and local governments should be afforded more flexibility in the
  determination of air pollution control methods and goals.  At present, areas not meeting
  federal clean air standards are forced to implement costly and inefficient air pollution
  control strategies and are discouraged from using more cost-effective and equitable
  approaches.
  
     <P>The 1990 Clean Air Act is the most expensive single piece of environmental
  legislation ever enacted.  It amended the clean air laws passed in the 1970s.  In addition to
  industrial emissions, the 1990 law regulates automobile design, gasoline content, energy
  production and emissions from dry cleaners, bakeries and other small businesses.  Air
  quality is steadily improving in most major cities, yet the federal government insists upon
  imposing layer-upon-layer of additional regulatory controls.
  
  <P>   A significant portion of federal clean air law is aimed at controlling emissions
  associated with motor vehicles.  It imposes broad "drift-net" strategies that impact all
  vehicles and car owners irrespective of their relative contributions to pollution levels.  It is
  well-established that only a small fraction of motor vehicles generate the lion's share of
  emissions.  Ten percent of the vehicles on the road are responsible for approximately half
  of automobile-related emissions.  This means that for every ten vehicles on the road, the
  dirtiest car emits as much as the remaining nine.  By failing to focus emission-reduction
  efforts on the dirtiest of vehicles, federal air pollution control strategies are both inefficient
  and inequitable.
  
  <P>   Under federal law, those areas that do not meet federal air quality standards are
  required to implement particular pollution control measures, even if better options are
  available.  Some of these include:
  <UL>
<LI>    The imposition of expensive, centralized vehicle inspection and maintenance programs
       that impose significant costs and inconvenience upon car owners without providing
       corresponding benefits as opposed to less-expensive, decentralized testing methods.
     <LI>    Requirements that state and local agencies implement case-specific, interim emission
       limits for industrial facilities, even though the EPA is in the process of developing its
       own national standards.
     <LI>   Potential requirements that certain states impose low-emission vehicle standards on all
       new cars sold within the state, and include sales mandates for electric vehicles.
       </UL>
<P>  Additional measures impose burdensome regulatory programs on businesses and local
  government agencies.  For instance, Title V, which requires over 30,000 industrial jobsites
  to obtain a new class of operating permit.  This will require tremendous amounts of
  paperwork and significant financial cost at no environmental gain.
  
  <P>      There are few parts of the country that would voluntarily adopt these methods to
  achieve the federal government's stringent air quality standards.  Air pollution strategies that
  are effective in one area, may be less so somewhere else.  Moreover, most air pollution
  concerns are local or regional in nature.  States need to be given greater flexibility to meet
  federal clean air standards, if not the authority to evaluate proper regional standards for
  themselves.
  <P><BR>
  
  <I>Q: Are existing federal clean air standards stringent enough to protect human health?
  </I>
<P>  A: Yes, and for some pollutants they may even be too stringent.  Non-attainment status for
  ozone is triggered by surpassing the federal standard for an hour more than three times
  over a three year period.  Thus, four bad hours on four bad days over three years are
  sufficient to classify a city as a nonattainment area by federal standards.  Residents in some
  areas may prefer such stringent standards, but it would be better if communities had that
  choice, rather than having these standards imposed upon them by the federal government.
  
  
<P>  <I>Q: Aren't most of the costs of the Clean Air Act paid for by big business, and not the
  public?</I>
  
  <P>A: The cost and inconvenience of the Clean Air Act is increasingly being shouldered by
  consumers.  Higher new car prices, costlier maintenance, mandatory inspections and
  repairs, and higher gas prices directly affect all drivers.  The costs of hundreds of everyday
  goods and services, from a loaf of bread to one's dry cleaning, have increased because of
  the Act.
  
  <P><I>Q: Why shouldn't automakers be forced to manufacture cleaner cars and the oil
  companies forced to make cleaner fuels?</I>
  
  <P>A: New cars produced today are already over 90 percent cleaner than those produced prior
  to 1970.  There simply is not much to be gained from tightening vehicle emission standards
  yet again.  If further emission reductions are necessary, it is better to focus on the greatest
  source of emissions -- older and poorly maintained vehicles.  Targeting the most polluting
  vehicles for emission reductions will be fairer and more effective than imposing another
  round of fuel or vehicle standards.
  
  <P><I>Q: Are electric cars a viable way to reduce auto-related air pollution?</I>
  
  <P>A: While electric cars sound wonderful on paper, they are less so in practice.  Electric cars
  have many drawbacks that make them insufficient for the needs of most car owners,
  including high costs, limited range, recharge requirements and a lack of amenities (air
  conditioning, heater, etc.).  Moreover, electric cars are not without their environmental
  impacts.  The electricity to charge the batteries must come from some source, often
  resulting in air emissions, and due to their chemical composition replacing batteries every
  few years raises disposal questions.
  
  <P><I>Q: Is the air getting cleaner?
 </I> 
<P>  A: Yes. The quality of the air we breathe has improved markedly over the last three
  decades.  The number of localities exceeding federal standards for regulated pollutants has
  substantially declined since 1970.  Even without the enactment of the 1990 Clean Air Act
  Amendments, there is reason to believe that these trends would continue, just as some air
  quality trends were improving before the imposition of federal clean air laws.

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
     In the current debate over the re-authorization of the Clean Water Act,
environmentalists, in their zeal to condemn big business as the source of
America&#146;s &#147;dirty&#148; water, have overlooked a simple fact.
Agricultural runoff is now the number one source of pollution in the nations
rivers, streams, and lakes.  As many other sources of pollution have been
controlled agriculture has emerged as the largest source of water pollution in
the nation.<p>
<p>
     Although the last decade has seen an increased awareness of the environmental
effects of U.S. agriculture, the fundamental premises of U.S. agricultural
policy have remained intact since the Great Depression.  These farm programs
were designed in an era before commercial pesticides, fertilizers and modern
farming techniques.  In many instances they have had and continue to have
detrimental effects on the environment.<p>
<p>
     The U.S. sugar program is responsible for not only increased sugar production
in south Florida but also more intensive sugar cane production, contributing to
the increased phosphorus contamination of the Everglades which is disrupting
the unique nature of the ecosystem.  The elimination of the U.S. sugar program
would likely have a significant beneficial effect on the Everglades ecosystem.
<p>
     <p>
     Even the field crop programs can have detrimental environmental effects.
Wheat, corn and field grain programs contribute to the intensive use of land.
An analysis of data from six major farm states shows that a fifty percent
reduction in subsidies would decrease per acre chemical use by an estimated 17
percent and fertilizer use by and estimated 14 percent.  The complete
elimination of subsidies could result in a 35 percent reduction in chemical use
per acre and a 29 percent reduction in fertilizer use per acre. <p>
<p>
     Another example of government induced environmental damage is the USDA peanut
program.  By requiring peanuts to be grown in only a handful of counties in the
entire country, USDA indirectly increases the use of pesticides on peanuts.<p>
<p>
     Overall, consumers, taxpayers and the environment would be better off under a
free market agricultural policy.  Direct and indirect payments to farmers
should be eliminated and all supply control programs should be ended.<p>

<H2>Making the Polluter Pay</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Environmentalists often call for a world with zero pollution.  The
typical response from economists and business leaders is disbelief.  Who is
right?  That depends on how one defines pollution.  Assuming that pollution is
properly defined, government <i>should</i> seek to reduce pollution as much as
is possible.  However, if pollution is improperly defined, &#147;pollution
control&#148; can become a pretext for the federal government to regulate the
minutiae of each and every industrial process and economic transaction.<p>
	Emissions, per se, are not pollution.  Properly understood, pollution is the
coercive imposition of a harmful waste product or emission onto another person
or their property; it is a &#147;trespass&#148; under the principles of common
law.  If the trespass is so minor that it creates no harm or inconvenience for
the property owner, it will normally be tolerated.  Today&#146;s pollution
dilemma is often the result of what is essentially a universal
&#147;easement&#148; granted by the state to polluters, even to producers of
significant and damaging pollution.<p>
	Because the first duty of government should always be to protect people and
their properties from harm, pollution control is a proper role for government
to play.  Pollution, like vandalism or theft, deprives other people of what is
theirs.  The proper role for government in this area is to ensure that
polluters pay for the damage they cause and are enjoined from causing harm in
the future.  While this may seem like common sense, this approach &#151; the
&#147;polluter pays principle&#148; &#151; is rarely embodied in American
environmental laws.<p>
	  Environmental policy too rarely focuses on harm and too often focuses on
compliance with Byzantine rules and requirements.  Fines are levied not when
the property of another is contaminated, but when a permit is improperly filed,
or a waste-transport manifest is not completed in line with the demands of
regulatory officials.  As the Environmental Protection Agency has observed,
&#147;a regulated hazardous waste handler must do hundreds of things correctly
to fully comply with the regulations, yet doing only one thing wrong makes the
handler a violator.&#148;<A HREF="#1"><sup>1</sup></A>  Environmental rules are now so complex
that only 30 percent of corporate counsels believe that full compliance with
environmental laws is actually possible, according to a survey conducted by
the<i> National Law Journal</i>.<A HREF="#2"><sup>2 </sup></A> This is astonishing evidence that many pollution-control efforts are misdirected.  The proper focus of
government officials should be identifying and prosecuting those firms that
threaten people and their  properties, instead of monitoring compliance with
overly complex and time-consuming permitting and paperwork requirements.<p>
	We are all familiar with the case of the Exxon <i>Valdez</i>.  An oil tanker
ran aground, spilling barrels upon barrels of crude into the water of Prince
William Sound, causing significant (if not permanent) environmental
disruption.<A HREF="#3"><sup>3</sup></A>  What few are aware of, however, is that the crime for
which Exxon was punished was hunting migratory birds without a
permit.<A HREF="#4"><sup>4</sup></A>  Extensive shorelines were covered in oil, and the
government prosecuted Exxon for not having permssion to go hunting.<p>
	Under existing institutional arrangements, there was no means for affected
citizens to hold Exxon directly responsible for actual damage caused.  The
Alaskan coast had no private owners, stewards, or protectors that could seek
redress as if that oil had spilled into someone&#146;s backyard.  If we truly
want polluters to pay, we must extend private stewardship arrangements to
beaches, lakes, rivers, and other resources that are now in the public domain.
Polluters such as Exxon should be held responsible, but they should be held
responsible not because they violated a bureaucratic rule concerning the
hunting of birds, but because they caused harm to the property of another
&#151; something they have no right to do.<p>
	A fishing club, the Pride of Derby, demonstrates how property rights can
prevent stream pollution.  In England, clubs own the right to fish along some
rivers and thus are quick to respond to pollution threats.  An upstream
municipal polluter argued that its interests outweighed those of the club.
Since the fishery was threatened, the club went to court and
prevailed.<A HREF="#5"><sup>5</sup></A> This ability of private parties to restrain municipal
polluters is rarely available in the United States.  <p>
	Under the <A HREF="/ebb/cleanh2o.html">Clean Water Act</A>, politically-preferred polluters are treated
preferentially.  First, their clean up goals are often less stringent and,
sec-ond, they face far more lenient clean up schedules.  To politicians, the
source of the pollution is as significant as the pollution itself.
Politically-preferred polluters are treated more leniently than are pariah
polluters.  Yet, to the river and the fish, pollution is pollution.  <p>
	If we accept the general principle that the polluter should pay, then we
recognize that broad, drift-net emission-control strategies are ill-conceived.
One-size does not fit all.  Forcing hundreds of small businesses to file
extensive environmental reports makes little sense if the actions of only a few
are causing environmental problems.  Such drift-net approaches achieve
pollution reductions more through their scope than their efficiency.  As a
result they tend to produce environmental improvements at the expense of
innocent individuals who have not contributed to environmental harm.
Environmental protection and simple justice are better served when pollution
reduction efforts focus on the true sources of pollution.<p>
	Consider the case of air pollution.  It is well-established that a small
fraction of automobiles are responsible for the vast preponderance of
auto-related emissions.  Indeed, over half of the emissions are generated by
only ten percent of the cars on the road.<A HREF="#6"><sup>6</sup></A>  This means that for
every ten cars, the dirtiest one pollutes as much as the other nine.  In areas
where air pollution is a concern, targetting emission reductions on the
dirtiest portion of the automobile fleet will not only reduce pollution more
efficiently, it will do so more equitably as well.  The majority of car owners
whose vehicles are in clean-running condition should not be forced to pay for
the pollution that is caused by the irresponsible minority.<p>
	Pollution is a problem.  Where pollution occurs, it should be stopped, and the
damage caused should be addressed.  However, not every emission, waste,
discharge, or industrial by-product is pollution.  Waste is not pollution until
it infringes upon another person or her property.<p>
	Making the polluter pay should not entail trying to eliminate the generation
of wastes and all of the other by-products of a modern, industrial society. Nor
does it mean regulating every emission, every industrial process, indeed every
aspect of economic life. Rather it means focusing environmental protection
efforts on the greatest sources of pollution and ensuring that polluters pay
for the harms they inflict upon others.  This is the essence of true
environmental protection, and it should be the essence of American
environmental policy.<p>

<H2>Chapter 10: Richer is Cleaner--Long Term Trends in Global Air Quality</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>

<P>Richer is cleaner.  Anything that retards economic growth also retards
ultimate environmental cleanup.<p>
<p>
Traditional pollutants like smoke and particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and
fecal coliform bacteria begin to decline when per capita incomes reach $3,280,
$3,670, and $1,375, respectively.<p>
<p>
Empirical evidence indicates that projections using the famous I = PAT
equation, widely publicized by biologist Paul Ehrlich, are dead wrong.  I
represents the cumulative impact on the environment; P, the population; A,
affluence; and T, technology.  Greater economic and technological progress are
necessary preconditions for the solution, rather than the causes, of
environmental degradation.  They make cleaner environments more affordable,
reduce the impacts per unit of production, and help moderate population
growth.<p>
<p>
In the United States, sulfur dioxide emissions per capita are down 60 percent
from the peak in 1920.  Both particulates and carbon monoxide emissions per
capita have declined more or less continuously since World War II-inhalable
particulates down 79 percent since 1940 and carbon monoxide down 53 percent
since 1945.  Volatile organic compounds emissions per capita (contributors to
smog) stayed roughly constant between 1925 and 1970, before they declined; in
1992 they were down 36 percent from the peak. Nitrogen oxide per capita peaked
in 1980.  It is now down about 10 percent from its peak.<p>
<p>
Ambient sulfur dioxide and particulate matter have been declining for at least
the last two decades in most developed countries.<p>
<p>
Ambient sulfur dioxide levels in many world megacities have already declined
significantly from the 1970s.  Cities in the developed world have relatively
low levels. Cities in the developing world have the highest levels.<p>
<p>
Ambient particulate matter is still a problem in most megacities.  Among a
sample of twenty world megacities, the three having low levels were all located
in the developed world (New York, London, and Tokyo).<p>
<p>
The gravest air quality problem in the world is indoor air pollution due to
heating and cooking with coal, wood, and dung or other biofuels in developing
countries.  Indoor particulate levels in poor countries rival those of the
worst acute industrial episodes of the past.<p>

<H2>Secondhand Smoke</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Fueled by alleged public health concerns, numerous measures have been
introduced by federal, state, and local governments to ban smoking in
restaurants and workplaces.  These measures are unjustified.  Scientific
evidence does not support the claim that secondhand smoke is a serious health
threat to non-smokers.  More importantly, there is no need for government
involvement in this issue.  Workplaces and restaurants are private spaces,
operated and voluntarily utilized by individuals who are capable of making
their own mutual arrangements regarding smoking policies.<p>
	Some individuals undeniably dislike being in smoke-filled restaurants and
other public places.  Secondhand smoke may even cause physical discomfort to
some people.  On the other hand, other people like to smoke, or are not
bothered by secondhand smoke.  The proper way to resolve this conflict is to
allow independent establishments to individually determine their own smoking
rules.  Consumers will then vote with their wallets, frequenting those
establishments that cater to their preferences with regard to the amount of
smoke, as they do with food preparation, quality of service, ambience, and so
on.  If some people object to eating in a smoke-filled restaurant, they are
free to eat somewhere else.  Restaurant owners should be equally free to choose
whether, and how, to accommodate smokers, non-smokers, or both.  The same
should be true of all privately owned establishments.<p>
	The impetus behind the movement to restrict exposure to secondhand smoke is a
1993 Environmental Protection Agency &#147;meta-analysis&#148; of several
secondhand smoke studies.  EPA&#146;s meta-analysis claimed to find a
statistical relationship between secondhand smoke exposure and lung cancer. But
almost all of the studies EPA looked at found no relationship between the two.
Unsatisfied with the results of these statistical analyses, the EPA engaged in
what <i>Science</i> magazine termed &#147;fancy statistical footwork,&#148;
violating scientific standards by modifying the results of the studies and
flouting conventional statistical methods.  <p>
	More recently, a 1995 Congressional Research Service study similarly concluded
that EPA&#146;s estimates of the effects of secondhand smoke exposure were
highly uncertain.  CRS&#146;s own position is that existing evidence does not
support the view that secondhand smoke has substantial health effects. 		While
smoking is itself an undeniable health risk, the case against secondhand smoke
rests on shaky ground.  If secondhand smoke were as dangerous as the EPA
claims, then there would be no need for the agency to ignore conventional
scientific methodologies.<p>
	Some people undeniably object to secondhand smoke.  However, there is no
grounds for the federal government to legislate how private establishments
address this concern.  It would be one thing for the federal government to
impose standards on federal properties, another for it to reach into every
small business, or even every home, and dictate smoking restrictions to each
and every American.<p>
<i>Q:  Don&#146;t I have the right to dine out in a smoke-free
restaurant?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  Yes, in the sense that, if someone wishes to operate such a restaurant,
then you should certainly be free to patronize it.  But government should not
mandate smoke-free restaurants, just as it should not force restaurants to be
disco-free, or vegetarian, or kosher.  People have an incredible range of
tastes when it comes to food and dining atmosphere, and the restaurant market
works pretty well to satisfy these tastes.  The notion that government must
step in to regulate this aspect of a field as competitive and fast-changing as
restaurants is ridiculous.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Why would the EPA manipulate scientific findings to exaggerate the
carcinogenicity of substances?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  The EPA has a strong incentive to label substances carcinogenic. With every
new environmental problem it &#147;discovers,&#148; the agency expands its
budget, influence, and prestige.  Given the disfavored status of smoking, the
secondhand smoke issue presented the EPA with an ideal situation in which to
discard the accepted standard for statistical significance.  The agency has
thus created for itself a precedent which will be extremely useful in the
future when it examines the carcinogenicity of other substances as well.  In
fact, the importance of statistical significance is already being downplayed in
EPA&#146;s newly-proposed risk assessment guidelines for carcinogenicity. <p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Since we know smoking is dangerous, shouldn&#146;t the EPA err on the
side of caution in the case of second-hand smoke? After all, EPA&#146;s job is
to protect us from environmental hazards.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  Erring on the side of caution may sound like a good policy, but quite often
it can be deadlier than lack of caution.  New technologies may pose risks, but
they can also save lives; technological stagnation is almost certainly more
dangerous than technological development. The EPA&#146;s proper function ought
to be to give the public accurate data about the risks that we encounter in
day-to-day living; it should attempt to mandate the avoidance of such risks.

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>


<p>
     The operating permits program under Title V is the most significant innovation
in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act.  Although it makes no changes to
the substantive provisions contained in the rest of the Act, Title V requires
&#147;major&#148; industrial sources of air pollution to incorporate all of
these requirements into a single document or &#147;permit.&#148;  These
permits, approved under state programs, will become the primary enforcement
vehicle of the Clean Air Act, similar to the operating permits under the Clean
Water Act.  <p>
<p>
     Although ostensibly run by the states, the EPA retains ultimate control over
the state permitting programs, giving the agency numerous opportunities to
meddle in the process and micromanage industry when it so chooses.
Environmental groups, exploiting the generous public participation and citizen
suit provisions, will also acquire unprecedented power over industry.  <p>
<p>
     Title V will impose substantial costs on industry.  EPA puts the cost of Title
V at $500 million annually, but others believe this estimate may be an order of
magnitude too low.  In addition to the high paperwork and compliance costs,
Title V&#146;s extensive procedural requirements can result in costly delays
lasting months or even years, both during the initial permitting process, and
in the required revisions to existing permits to incorporate changes at a
permitted facility.  The potential delays will be particularly troublesome for
fast moving industries where facility changes are frequent and it is necessary
to quickly bring products to market.<p>
     <p>
     Given the significant improvements in air quality since 1970, and the marked
declines in emissions from the large industrial facilities Title V targets, it
is difficult to justify the introduction of a new and expensive enforcement
scheme at this time.  EPA has not attempted to quantify the benefits, in terms
of cleaner air, it expects from Title V, but they are likely to be marginal.<p>
<p>
     While a few legislative changes could make Title V considerably more tolerable
than it currently is, there is no reason not to do more.  No matter how
modified, Title V will never achieve results at an acceptable cost.  There now
exists a unique window of opportunity to eliminate Title V before it becomes an
entrenched part of the regulatory landscape.  If all that is accomplished is
the softening of a few of Title V&#146;s more onerous aspects, the current
period may one day be looked back upon as a lost chance at getting rid of the
most dispensable title in the Clean Air Act.<p>

<H1>AUTONOMY AND AUTOMOBILITY</H1>
by Loren E. Lomasky<BR>
Professor of Philosophy, Bowling Green State University

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>



<P>As the automobile enters its second century, it is increasingly attacked as a
public malefactor.  The fact that automobiles cause deaths and pollution does
not seem sufficient to explain the intensity of the opposition to them.  These
are only its costs; what we still must account for are its benefits.<p>
<p>
	The focus of this paper will not be on the many and varied instrumental uses
to which the automobile is put, but on what is intrinsic to automobility &#151;
the capacity to move oneself from place to place.  Automobility directly
complements autonomy &#151; the distinctively human capacity to be
self-directing.  Automobiles enable us to extend the scope and magnitude of our
self-direction, and for that reason they are worthwhile.  <p>

<UL>

<LI>Automobiles allow us to choose where we will live, where we will work, and to
separate these two choices from each other.  <p>

<LI>Automobiles enhance knowledge.  From watching geese fly to Canada, to
visiting a battleground, to attending an opera, no form of transportation
combines local maneuverability with extended range to the degree that the
automobile does.<p>

<LI>Automobiles enhance privacy.  While public transportation is not always bad,
and sometimes is the only viable alternative, it necessarily encroaches on
privacy.  The automobile is for 20th century American society the
quintessential bastion of privacy.  The failure of diamond lanes and other
car-pooling inducements may be viewed as a failure of policy, but it can also
be seen as a result of the valid human desire for privacy.<p>

<LI>Automobiles allow control over one&#146;s immediate environment.  Surely one
reason for the fondness people hold for their cars is the scope of control over
this environment, which is not possible with any alternate transportation mode.
<p>
</UL>

	In short, what is conspicuously left off the balance sheet of automobility is
its intrinsic goodness of promoting autonomy.<p>
<p>
	When compared with alternate means of transportation, the automobile is the
prime vehicle of self-directedness.  Its most strident critics are well aware
of its relationship to autonomy, and that is precisely why they are so wary of
it. People who drive automobiles upset the patterns spun from the policy
intellectual&#146;s brain.  They wish to drive, and their exercises of choice
also have the effect of rendering the planners&#146; conceptions moot.  <p>
<p>
	In the end, highways are so heavily used because millions of people judge that
driving enhances their lives.  The striking feature of the critique of highway
building programs is that what should be taken as a sign of great success is
instead presented as a mark of failure.  But the only failure has been with the
critics&#146; attempts to talk people out of their cars and out of the
neighborhoods and workplaces that their cars have rendered accessible.  This
failure is well-deserved.  Automobile motoring is good because people wish to
engage in it, and they wish to engage in it because it is inherently good.<p>

<FONT SIZE=+2>New Air Bag Petition</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>From Those Wonderful Folks Who Brought You the First Air Bag Mandate</FONT>
</CENTER>
<P><BR><B>WASHINGTON, DC, November 20, 1996</B><BR>
<A HREF="/">The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI)</A> and <A HREF="http://www.his.com/~calert/">Consumer Alert</A> today denounced Public Citizen's new air bag petition as an elaborate attempt to cover-up that group's first-hand complicity in the current passive restraint fiasco.
 
<P>&quot;Public Citizen should realize that mandating air bags is
not like a shooting a movie, with Take I, Take II, Take III. 
In reality, it's an intrusion into people's lives that was unjustified
in 1977 and is even more unjustified now,&quot;  according to
<A HREF="/staff/kazman.html">Sam Kazman</A>, CEI General Counsel.
<P>
  
In 1977-83 Mr. Kazman represented Consumer Alert and Pacific
Legal Foundation in their unsuccessful court challenges to the
Transportation Department's passive restraint mandate.  He is
especially critical of Joan Claybrook's current claim that she
warned the public of air bag hazards when she headed the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and that these warnings
were somehow overwhelmed by the auto industry's air bag sales
campaign:  &quot;Rather than 'warn' of its hazards, Joan Claybrook
used every opportunity to portray the air bag as a technology
so marvelous that one didn't even need to buckle up.  Her current
spin on this issue puts a new meaning on the term 'revolving door' -- mandate a device while you're in government, and then blame it on industry
after you leave.  Consumers, meanwhile, are left to pick up the
tab, both in dollars and lives.&quot;
<P>
For example, an October 2nd, 1979, AP story quotes Claybrook as
accusing GM of &quot;delaying installation of air bags on the
basis of a 'hurry up style' finding that they hurt small children.&quot;
 
<P>In a November 21, 1983, CNN debate with Mr. Kazman, Claybrook
stated that air bags &quot;fit all different sizes and types
of people, from little children up to very large males. So they
really work beautifully.&quot;  In a July 9, 1985, ABA speech,
she dismissed questions about air bag child safety as an industry
attempt &quot;at undermining public confidence&quot;.
<P>
Public Citizen's claim that the air bag working well in other
respects is similarly false.  NHTSA's most recent estimate, that
air bags reduce fatality risk by 11 percent, is a far cry from
the agency's 1977 claim of 44-50 percent effectiveness.
<P>
Fran Smith, President of Consumer Alert, stated:  &quot;Forget
about fiddling with the details; the air bag mandate should be
scrapped, period.  The choice should be up to consumers, not to
flip-flopping regulators.&quot;

<H2>Chapter 7: Conserving Biodiversity: Resources for the Future</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>


<P>An estimated 8 to 10 million different species live on the planet.  Of
these, only about 1.5 million have been named.<p>
<p>
Documented animal extinctions peaked in the 1930s, and the number of
extinctions has been declining since then.<p>
<p>
Thirty-nine percent of the extinctions resulted from the introduction of
nonnative species, 36 percent from habitat destruction, and 23 percent from
hunting (for sport and products for sale) and deliberate elimination of a
species.  The remaining 2 percent became extinct for a variety of causes,
including pollution.<p>
<p>
More than 75 percent of the land on every continent except Europe is available
for wildlife.  It is this &#147;undeveloped&#148; land in developing countries
that is of greatest importance to conserving biodiversity over the long term.<p>
<p>
Well over a billion hectares of the earth&#146;s surface have been set aside as
protected areas, representing over 10 percent of the land area.<p>
<p>
Since 1973, only twenty-three species have been removed from the U.S.
Endangered Species list: eight were listed in error a court invalidated the
listing of one, seven recovered, and seven became extinct.  In other words,
there is an equal probability that a species listed on the Endangered species
Act will recover or become extinct.<p>
<p>
Governments and conservation organizations need to begin to promote harvesting
and using wild species rather than stopping such uses.<p>
<p>
Trade in wildlife products is of the same order of magnitude as trade in
forestry and fish products.  In 1986, international trade in primates, ivory,
orchids, reptile skins, fur-bearers, and tropical fish was worth $5 billion.<p>
<p>
To enhance the probability of sustaining the wild harvest or use, the rural
people living in developing countries with wildlife resources must have
sufficient incentives to conserve the resources, free from excessive government
interference.  Environmentalists need to recognize that rural people can be
allies in conservation, and not treat them as environmental criminals.<p>
<p>
Listing species to achieve legal protection is not working.  More land and
marine areas are being designated as protected; however, it is difficult to
assess how effective protected areas are at conserving biodiversity. <p>

<H2>Ecosystem Management</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Ecosystem management is the newest regulatory strategy advocated by
environmentalists to limit urban growth and preserve undeveloped land.  It
provides the most expansive scheme for national land-use planning yet devised.
Those who want to limit federal control over and regulation of private land
should adamantly oppose the implementation of ecosystem management.<p>
	<a href="/ebb/esa.html">The Endangered Species Act (ESA)</A> currently allows federal regulation only when
a species is listed as threatened or endangered.  Under the ESA, land-use
regulations are authorized only to protect members of listed species from
&#147;harm.&#148;  Harm, according to the Supreme Court, must result in
&#147;actual death or injury&#148; to the animal in question.  Advocates of
ecosystem management want to amend the ESA to enact a different approach. <p>
	&#147;Instead of focusing on individual species, we would do it on the basis
of a whole ecosystem,&#148; explains Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.  Yet
ecosystems, according to Babbitt, are &#147;in the eye of the beholder.&#148;
This means that ecosystem management would greatly expand federal land-use
regulation at the discretion of federal agencies.  The Yellowstone
&#147;ecosystem,&#148; for example, expanded from two million acres in 1980 to
18 million acres by 1991.<p>
	Consider the application of ecosystem management to the protection of the
coastal California gnatcatcher, a small songbird in southern California.  There
are approximately 250 pairs of gnatcatchers in Riverside County.  Because each
pair requires less than 20 acres of habitat, the most expansive regulations
authorized by the ESA would preserve approximately 5,000 acres of land.  Under
the Interior Department&#146;s ecosystem management plan, however, nearly
150,000 acres of land would be locked up.  Ecosystem management will lock up
almost 30 times more land.<p>
	The loss of the use of private property without compensation is the primary
problem with the current species-by-species approach; but the ecosystem
approach promises that property owners will lose even more of their land.  The
ESA requires that members of a listed species be present on the land in
question.  Ecosystem management only requires that the land exist, and that
federal agencies wish to &#147;protect&#148; it.<p>
	Ecosystem management will not solve the many conflicts over species
protection.  Rather it will exacerbate them.  Ecosystem management would mark
the beginning of the end for private property rights in America.  Ecosystems
are comprised of the constituent elements of land.  Every landowner owns a
part, if not the entirety, of some &#147;ecosystem.&#148;  If ecosystems become
&#147;public,&#148; as species have, then private property will suddenly become
&#147;public,&#148; too.  This is the goal of ecosystem management, and this is
the reason to oppose it.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Isn&#146;t the protection of ecosystems the purpose of the Endangered
Species Act?</i><p>
<p>
A:  No.  The ESA&#146;s stated goal is to &#147;provide a means whereby the
ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be
conserved.&#148;  To &#147;conserve,&#148; according to the ESA, &#147;means to
bring any endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the
measures provided pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary.&#148;  In other
words, to &#147;conserve&#148; an ecosystem is to &#147;recover&#148; a
species.<p>
	Only species can be listed under the ESA, and only species can trigger the
Act&#146;s regulations; ecosystems cannot.  This is why the Fish &amp; Wildlife
Service delists species, not ecosystems.  Implementing ecosystem management on
private land legally requires amending the ESA.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  How can the ESA&#146;s specific reference to ecosystems be
explained?</i><p>
<p>
A:  &#147;Species&#148; are mentioned more than 350 times in the ESA;
&#147;ecosystems&#148; are mentioned only twice.  In 1973, when the ESA was
enacted, few people thought the Act authorized regulation of private land use
to protect species, let alone to protect &#147;ecosystems.&#148;  The only
plausible rationale for even mentioning ecosystems in the ESA was to justify
the protection of species by referencing their importance, as integral parts,
to a larger, more important whole.  Losing one species was presumed to increase
the risk of losing other species, as &#147;everything is connected to
everything else.&#148;<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Even if current law does not authorize it, would it not be good to have
a law that protects rare or unique ecosystems?</i><p>
<p>
A:  No. Ecosystems are inherently subjective and infinitely elastic.  They are
mental constructs, designed for categorical convenience, not objective
realities in nature.  As such, there are no objective criteria to determine
where one ecosystem ends and another begins.  Like a fingerprint, every spot on
the surface of the earth is unique.  Thus, as a matter of law, regulating rare
or unique ecosystems is an open invitation to regulating anything or
everything.

<H2>Endangered Species Act</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is one of the most controversial of all
environmental laws.  Not only has the ESA failed to recover a single species
from the brink of extinction, it has pushed countless landowners to the point
of financial ruin.  By penalizing property owners for having threatened or
endangered species on their land, the ESA is turning landowners into enemies of
wildlife and wildlife assets into economic liabilities.  The ESA is in need of
fundamental reform.<p>
	Enacted in 1973, the ESA&#146;s stated objective is to &#147;conserve&#148;
listed species of animals and plants.  This means &#147;to bring any endangered
species or threatened species to the point at which [the Act&#146;s
protections] are no longer necessary.&#148;  Thus the goal of the ESA is
&#147;recover&#148; listed species.  Yet, after more than twenty years, the Act
has failed to recover a single one.<p>
	Since 1973, only 27 species have been removed from the endangered species
list.  Seven of those were &#147;delisted&#148; because they went extinct.
Nine of them (according to the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service) were &#147;data
errors,&#148; which means they never should have been listed in the first
place.  The FWS claims to have &#147;recovered&#148; the remaining eleven
species, but not one of them was saved by the ESA.  Eight of these purportedly
&#147;recovered&#148; species did not even merit listing in the first place,
for they were not in danger of extinction.  The three remaining species (the
Eastern population of the brown pelican, the arctic peregrine falcon and the
California gray whale) were indeed in trouble, but were helped by measures
other than the ESA.<p>
	The ESA has been a complete and utter failure.  Perhaps the single most
important reason for the Act&#146;s abysmal record is that it has imposed
draconian regulations on private landowners.  The ESA has stopped people from
building homes, constructing roads, plowing fields, felling trees, filling
ditches and even clearing firebreaks to protect their homes and family from
fire hazards.  The risk of being regulated out of business has driven some
landowners to &#147;shoot, shovel and shut up,&#148; while many others simply
destroy the animal&#146;s habitat so as to avoid the ESA&#146;s often onerous
land-use regulations.<p>
	If you want more of something you reward those who provide it, not punish
them.  But the ESA is all stick and no carrot.  A good law would make
landowners want to attract rare wildlife to their land &#151; not rid their
land of rare wildlife.  A good law would recover endangered species, not ruin
people.  But it is precisely because the ESA is harming people that it is also
harming wildlife.  The only way to turn this around is by removing the
law&#146;s authority to prevent landowners from using their own land.  In the
104th Congress, however, only one bill (HR 2364) embodied a non-regulatory
approach to endangered species conservation. <p>
	At the very least, landowners should be compensated for their losses from
land-use regulations.  If species protection benefits all of us, then the costs
of protecting species should be borne by all of us.  Under the ESA, those costs
are borne by the unlucky landowners who happen to own the wrong piece of land.
Reform is imperative, for both landowners and wildlife.<p>
<i>Q:  A recent Times-Mirror poll found that most Americans support the ESA.
Why should it be reformed?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Americans care about wildlife, and so they support government efforts to
protect  endangered species.  However, Americans also believe in property
rights.  That same <i>Times Mirror</i> poll found that 66 percent of Americans
believe that landowners should be compensated when their land is devalued by
the ESA.  For federal wildlife protection to truly reflect the will of the
American people, it must compensate landowners for their losses.  It is a
simple matter of fairness that most Americans understand and support.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Q:  According to the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, the ESA has
&#147;recovered&#148; 11 species.  Isn&#146;t this true?</i><p>
<p>
A:  No.  The government has effectively admitted that four of them (the Palau
dove, Palau owl, Palau fantail flycatcher and the Rydberg milk-vetch) were data
errors, and should never have been listed in the first place.  The National
Wildlife Federation has documented that a fifth species, the American
alligator, did not warrant listing either.  Equally unwarranted was the listing
of three species of Australian kangaroos.  <p>
	Only 3 of the 11 &#147;recovered&#148; species were helped by the federal
government.  The brown pelican and arctic peregrine falcon were by most
accounts saved by the 1972 ban on DDT and the remoteness of the Falcon&#146;s
habitat &#151; not the passage of the ESA in 1973.  Last, but not least, the
California gray whale was pushed to the brink of extinction by commercial
whaling in open access waters.  But hunting these whales was banned by
international treaties in 1937 and 1946.  The gray whale was well on its way to
recovery long before the ESA was enacted.  <p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Is not habitat protection vital to the conservation of most endangered
species?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Yes.  But punishing landowners through confiscatory regulations for having
such habitat is no way to save it.  In fact, the ESA&#146;s punitive approach
is more likely to ensure the destruction of habitat than its preservation.
Look at it this way: Habitat is also key to solving the homeless problem, yet
the government does not force urbanites to provide shelter for the homeless in
their backyards.  If it did, many urbanites would surely build over their
backyards and do away with such spaces altogether.  Many landowners would
proudly conserve habitat for endangered species on their own land were they not
penalized by government regulation.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Q:  Since less than one percent of all projects reviewed under the ESA have
been halted, isn&#146;t the Act much more flexible than its critics
claim?</i><p>
<p>
A:  The ESA&#146;s impact on private projects on private land (through Section
9) has never been reviewed; that statistic pertains only to federal projects
that received federal funding or authorization (through Section 7).  Moreover,
project approval does not demonstrate flexibility particularly when onerous
conditions are attached.  Just ask David Trotter of Austin, Texas, whose 1,100
acre development project conflicted with golden-cheeked warbler habitat.  The
Interior Department said the residential development could proceed because
there were &#147;reasonable and prudent alternatives.&#148;  The alternative
proposed by the FWS was for Trotter to give the government 765 acres, and buy
the government an additional 873 acres for a warbler preserve elsewhere &#151;
<i>in exchange for allowing the private landowners to develop less than 25%
of their own property</i>.  The FWS later modified its position only after
extensive legal wrangling.  Some flexibility.

<H2>HOW MUCH IS GOD WORTH?<BR>
The Problems --  Economic and Theological  --  
of Existence Value</H2>
by Robert H. Nelson

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>Economics has traditionally put a value only on goods and services that are directly consumed.  However, in 1967 John Krutilla proposed that economists
should also assign a value to the knowledge that a particular wilderness,
endangered species or other object in nature exists.  By the 1980s, the
concept of "existence value" was coming into use by a number of economists
for purposes such as estimating the benefits of government actions or
calculating damage assessments against corporations whose actions had harmed the environment.  In 1993, a panel of leading economists convened by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration declared that,
although great care must be exercised to prevent misuse, existence value
should be incorporated into the set of economic tools available to
government analysts.

<P>     Other leading economists have argued that the concept of existence value is
inconsistent with accepted economic theory and in practice will often yield
implausible results.  The number of features existing in the world about
which at least some people will have strong feelings is virtually limitless.
Yet, most estimates of existence value have addressed only a select few
objects in nature.  

<P>     The attitude of a person with respect to a state of the world will be
greatly influenced by the cultural lens applied.  In many cases, that lens
will be religious.  The values placed on wilderness and endangered species
reflect the important role these objects have in environmental religion.
The sources of environmental religion are found in figures such as David
Brower and John Muir and in New England transcendentalism.  The
transcendentalists in turn drew heavily on the faith of their Puritan
forbearers.

<P>     What inspires faith for one person may be regarded by another as a
diversion from the true faith.  Proponents of wilderness look to these areas
as a place of spiritual inspiration.  Others, however, see the preservation
of wilderness as a waste of good resources and a symbolic assault on the
value system of belief in economic progress.  The latter group will perceive
a "negative existence value" in the creation of a wilderness.  It is
misguided for society to apply formal methods of economic valuation to try
to resolve such claims of competing religious groups.

<P>     In summary, a fundamental problem with existence value is that in many
cases it attempts to answer a religious question with an economic method.
Making estimates of the existence value of an object in nature is then both
as silly and as meaningless as asking how much God is worth.  Economists
should abandon the use of existence value and concentrate their scarce
resources on more useful projects that are in fact suited to their
analytical tools.

<H3>Private Conservation Case Study<BR>
February  1996</H3>


<H1>The Karner Blue Butterfly</H1>
</CENTER>


<P><BR>	In 1992 the Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Karner blue butterfly as an endangered species.  Although now considered rare and declining in numbers, the butterfly was once common.  Habitat destruction due to development is commonly blamed for the decline of the butterfly.
Ironically, however, human intervention in the environment may also provide
the opportunity to save the Karner blue.

<P>	In 1861, William Saunders of Ontario caught the first Karner Blue specimen.
At the time there were scores of thriving populations from southern
Minnesota all the way to New Hampshire.  Saunders sent his specimen to
William Henry Edwards of Philadelphia, who assigned it to the species
Lycaena scuderii, Scudder's blue.  The butterfly was later called the Karner blue because of the area where it had first been collected and described.

<P>	The Karner blue is an inconspicuous butterfly.  The butterflies have a
wingspan of approximately one inch and with their wings folded they appear
to be a rather plain slate gray. Only when their wings unfold do the males
show the silvery blue markings on the backs of their wings that give them
their name.

<P>	Usually, the Karner blue butterfly has two broods each year.  Eggs that
have overwintered from the previous year hatch in April.  The larvae feed on
wild lupine leaves and mature rapidly.  Near the end of May, they pupate and
adult butterflies emerge.  The adults are in flight for the first two weeks
of June when the wild lupine is in bloom.  Females lay eggs on or near the
wild lupine plants, after which the females soon die.  The summer eggs hatch
in about a week.  The emergent larvae feed on the lupine for three weeks,
pupate and the second (summer) brood adults appear in the second or third
week of July.  This time eggs are laid among the plant litter, on or near
lupine plants.  By early August all adults have died and the eggs winter over.

<P>	In 1941, writer Vladimir Nabokov, who happened to be an amateur
lepidopterist of considerable stature, received a non-paying curatorial
position at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology.  Nabokov decided to
sort out the North American members of the genus Lycaeides, which had
previously been classified in several mutually contradictory schemes.  In
the course of his work Nabokov determined that the Karner blue was not of
the species L. scuderii, but was in fact a subspecies of Lycaeides melissa.
Nabokov renamed the butterfly Lycaeides melissa samuelis in honor of the
entomologist Samuel Scudder for whom the butterfly had previously been named. 

<P>	The habitat of the Karner blue is characterized by the presence of wild
lupine (Lupinus perennis), a member of the pea family.  Wild lupine is the
only known food source for larva of the butterfly.  Consequently, the
butterfly is wholly dependent on the presence of lupine for its survival.

<P>	Lupine is an early successional plant.  As fire or some other disturbance
sweeps across a forest landscape destroying vegetation, lupine moves in to
take advantage of the sunlight afforded by the burned or disturbed land.  It
will flourish for several years until bushes or trees provide too much shade
for it to grow and blossom.

<P>	Repeated burning by native Americans followed by land clearing by early
settlers historically insured an abundant lupine population.  Fire
suppression in recent decades combined with the return of higher
successional forests have depleted the lupine, and consequently the
butterfly as well.  The only places lupine is consistently found is in poor
soil conditions such as pine barrens where the soil is too poor to allow
dense undergrowth.

<P>	The range of lupine extends from Maine, south to Florida and as far west as
Louisiana and Minnesota.  The butterfly inhabits only a narrow band in the
Northern portion of the lupine's range.  Historically it ranged from New
England, through the Great Lakes region and into Minnesota.  

<P>	Because lupine is a transitory plant, conservation of the butterfly
necessitates a solution other than a conventional regulatory strategy.
Areas which have been disturbed and contain the butterfly, if left alone,
will slowly become non-butterfly habitat.  The most areas where lupine
currently exists, such as pine barrens, cannot indefinitely support a stable
population of butterflies.  In other words, without active human involvement
the butterfly is likely to face extinction in the long term.

<P>	The Karner blue is now found in only a handful of sites and has been
extirpated in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois and Ontario.
The remaining populations are highly scattered and colonies rarely exceed
1,000 individuals.  Such small and disperse colonies are highly vulnerable
to weather events.  The extinction of Karner blue butterflies in Ontario
exemplifies this.  In 1984, the population of butterflies in Ontario was
estimated to be approximately 1,000 adults.  The drought of 1988, followed
by unusually cold weather in May and June of 1989, killed off the Karner
blue butterflies.  None have been seen in Canada since 1989. 

<P>	The only colony in the world which has significantly more than 1,000 adult
butterflies is the population found at the Saratoga County Airport.  In
fact, half the world population of Karner blue butterflies is found in this
one location, with an estimated 14,000 adults.   Ironically, the habitat at
the airport is not considered natural.  The lupine likely invaded the area
when it was disturbed and has been maintained by constant human
intervention.  This single largest population and habitat for the butterfly
is a fake sand-prairie in a region where there have been no sand prairies
for tens of thousands of years, an irony which has been noted by some of the
butterfly's researchers.    Some researchers have even suggested that the
fake prairie is a better habitat for the Karner blue than many prairie
preserves. 

<P>	The occurrence of butterflies at the Saratoga airport is something of a
chance coincidence.  The airport was likely created out of previously
cultivated land.  As annual plowing and planting ceased, local wild flowers
exploited this new landscape, just as if this area had been burned by a
fire.  One of these wild flowers is lupine.  This keeps out trees and
enhances visibility.  It takes relatively little mowing to keep trees and
large bushes to a minimum, simply mowing once a year is usually sufficient.
This sort of annual mowing keeps the area in a state of perpetual early
succession.

<P>	This fake prairie may be a better for the Karner blue butterfly than
natural prairie preserves because of fire.  Fire historically created the
prairie and oak savanna habitat in which the lupine thrives.  Lupine has a
long tap-root which extends several feet into the earth.  In a fire the
lupine leaves and stems will burn but the root is protected by the
insulating soil.  Once the fire is over, the plant sends up new shoots from
it's tap root.  Although lupine is well adapted to coping with fire, the
butterfly is not.  Fire kills the butterfly.  Any eggs, larva, pupae or
adult butterflies in a fire's path will be destroyed.  

<P>	A large prairie preserve could be managed with fire without unduly
endangering the butterfly.  But in a small preserve, such as those
surrounding most of the butterfly populations, the butterflies will be
destroyed unless extreme care is taken.  Management by fire ultimately means
that the butterfly is constantly faced with population setbacks.

<P>	Mowing, however, does not have to kill the butterfly.  The eggs which
survive the winter are generally laid in the leaf litter or near the base of
lupine plants.  Mowing conducted after the butterflies have laid their eggs,
sometime in September would have little effect on next springs butterfly
population.  This is reflected in the mowing schedule followed by the
Saratoga county airport, which is surprisingly simple.  After September
every year, the area is mowed to a height of eight inches.   

<P>	Population studies of the Karner blue have shown that one of the critical
factors in its survival is the number of healthy lupine plants in the spring
when the over wintering eggs hatch.  A survey of thirty seven sites
conducted in 1980 in New York revealed that on average two plants of lupine
are required to support every caterpillar.


<P>	In addition to lupine, adult butterflies which emerge in July need nectar
bearing plants on which to feed.  Lupine blooms in June and nectar from the
flowers feeds the first brood of adults.  Lupine, however, is not flowering
in late July and the butterfly must use other plants as a source of nectar.
Literature suggests that butterfly weed is the preferred secondary nectar
source for Karner blue butterflies, however there are a number of other
flowers the butterfly can use as a nectar source. 

<P>	As with the airport in Saratoga county, there are certain human activities
which are constantly creating an early successional habitat.  For example,
utility companies keep the right-of-way around their power transmission
lines constantly mowed.  This effectively creates thousands of miles of
early succession habitat, albeit in narrow strips.  In addition, there are
thousands of airports in the former range of the butterfly.  In essence, any
patch of land from Maine to Minnesota which is mowed only to keep out trees
is potential butterfly habitat.

<P>	Wild lupine seed and plants are readily available from several seed
companies and nurseries and could easily be planted.  Such areas as
right-of-ways and airports could provide the ideal habitat for the
butterfly.  In fact lupine may already exist in some stretches of
right-of-way.  Planting lupine and adjusting mowing schedules could ensure a
continuous habitat of lupine for the butterfly.  Once the lupine has been
established, butterfly cocoons, lupine plants with butterfly eggs, or adult
butterflies could be introduced.  Normally private land owners would be
reluctant to allow an endangered species to be intentionally introduced onto
their land.  However, the existing statute contains exceptions for
experimental populations.  Experimental populations do not have the same
status under the act granted to wild populations.  The butterflies should
only be introduced if the Fish and Wildlife Service is willing to designate
them an experimental population and exempt them from the regulatory
provisions of the act.  

<P>	Once established it is quite possible that the lupine will not only thrive
but also spread.  Established experimental populations of butterfly should
also spread with the lupine.  

<P>	The ease with which a large population of Karner blue butterflies is
maintain at the Saratoga county airport suggests that private conservation
efforts if properly executed could be enormously successful in enhancing the
population of the butterfly.

<P><BR><I>Willapa is the cleanest bay in the country, and it is the oystermen who have kept it that way. </I><A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
</blockquote>

<P>The Willapa Bay estuary in the southwest corner of Washington state arguably
is the largest pristine estuary in the country. Amazingly, it also has a
history of resource exploitation that dates back to the earliest settlers in
the region. The long history of oystering, logging, cranberry farming, dairy
farming, and fishing for salmon and crab have all had their effect on the
local environment, and "Willapa today is a farmed ecosystem, its uplands,
tidelands, and fisheries cultivated according to human design."<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>  This
exploitation has introduced its share of environmental concerns, but because
of the efforts of local stakeholders, particularly the oystermen, it remains
a verdant, productive resource and an example of the remarkable potency of
private conservation. 

<P>The Willapa Bay watershed covers about 600,000 acres, including
approximately 150,000 acres of privately owned tidelands. Between 10,000 and
15,000 acres are currently used for oyster cultivation, out of about 40,000
acres that could be productive. Much of the tidelands are not productive
because of increases in a cordgrass called spartina and in burrowing shrimp
populations that prevent oysters from growing. 

<P>Local interests, particularly the oystermen, want to solve these problems,
but regulatory agencies have prevented them from taking action to prevent
the growth of these noxious species. Although the bay remains healthy, this
interference with the long standing history of private stewardship
increasingly threatens Willapa Bay. Fortunately an ever broadening coalition
in the region is realizing that local control offers the best opportunity
for real progress. If the Willapa Alliance is successful, the bay will
remain as healthy and productive as it ever was. 

<P>Oyster growers have had a profound effect on Willapa Bay and elsewhere in
Washington because they <I>own</I> the tidelands oysters are cultivated on.
Ownership ties oyster growers to a particular spot and gives them a vested
interest in protecting the local environment; their livelihood depends on
it. The extent of tidal ownership in Willapa Bay and elsewhere in
Washington, particularly Puget Sound, is unique, and it explains why oyster
growers have been so successful propagating oysters and protecting the
health and well-being of Washington's waters. 
<A NAME="oysters"></A>
<P><BR>
<H3>Oysters</H3>

<P>Oysters are filter feeders, siphoning water and digesting phytoplantkon
(minuscule marine algae) that pass through them. It is this method of
feeding that makes oysters especially sensitive to water quality. Oysters
can strain 20 to 30 quarts of water an hour, and any pollutants or pathogens
in the water quickly accumulate in oyster tissue. <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>

<P>Oysters typically harvested in the United States belong to the genera
<I>Crassostrea</I> and <I>Ostrea</I>, which have similar forms of larval development.
After fertilization free swimming larvae (called spat) search for hard
substrate (called cultch) to settle on, often other oyster shells. They
develop first as males, but thereafter can undergo sex changes (<I>Crassostrea</I>
seasonally and <I>Ostrea</I>  even more frequently). The spat settle permanently on
hard surfaces (a process called spatfall), after which they can take from as
little as one year to over five years to reach marketable size, depending on
the species and the local environment. 

<P>Temperature and salinity are especially important to an oyster for growth
and survival, as is a hard substrate from which to enjoy its position. The
best areas for spatfall are often not the best grow-out areas, which creates
a golden opportunity for oyster farmers to increase oyster growth rates by
moving oysters between seed beds and grow-out beds. 
<A NAME="willapa"></A>
<P><BR>
<H3>Oysters and Willapa Bay</H3>

<P>The interaction between people and oysters in Willapa Bay dates back to the
earliest settlers. The first city incorporated in the region was Oysterville
in 1852, a small town on the Long Beach peninsula and the center of the
burgeoning oyster industry. Schooners laden with oysters sailed from Willapa
(then called Shoalwater) Bay to San Francisco and its gold rush markets. The
trip was lucrative enough that in the 1850s and 60s a number of schooners
were involved exclusively in the "Shoalwater Bay trade," <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>  and for a time
Oysterville was the wealthiest town in Washington, earning it the nickname
"the Baltimore of the West." 

<P>This trade continued until around 1870, when both the numbers of oysters in
Willapa began to diminish and the first transcontinental railroad reached
San Francisco, bringing Eastern oysters withit. The original Baltimore soon
replaced its Washington counterpart and by the turn of the century 85
percent of the oysters sold in California were Easterns. <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> 

<P>Those first oysters taken from Willapa Bay were the native Washington
oyster, <I>Ostrea lurida</I>, also known as the Olympia oyster. The Olympia is a
slow growing mollusk, <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>  and as it was harvested with impunity for the
schooner trade, its population declined both in Willapa and then later in
Puget Sound. <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>  The decline of the Olympias led people to cultivate oysters
where they did not occur naturally, and the first oyster farms appeared in
Willapa Bay in the late 1800s. The areas they staked out formed the basis of
the private tidelands that exist today, and were the start of the long
history of private stewardship in Willapa Bay. 

<P>As the Olympias were declining, the logging industry was growing, and the
effluent from pulp mills put additional stress on the oysters. That combined
with a run of cold summers just after the turn of the century were too much
for the native Olympias, and despite the efforts of local oystermen, their
numbers continued to decline.  <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>

<P>The Pacific oyster (<I>Crassostrea gigas</I>, a Japanese import) was first brought
to Washington by Japanese entrepreneurs at the turn of the century. Willapa
oystermen did not begin importing Pacific seed until 1928, shortly after a
Washington law forbade any foreign ownership of land title, forcing the
Japanese to give up their interests in oyster tidelands. <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> Pacific oysters
quickly adapted to the Willapa environment because of their high tolerance
for exposure (tides in Willapa can be extreme) and cooler waters. As oyster
populations declined elsewhere (most notably in the Chesapeake), Pacifics in
Willapa thrived, and today one out of every six oysters produced in the
United States is a Pacific oyster from Willapa Bay.  <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>

<A NAME="tragedy"></A>
<P><BR>
<H3>Eliminating the Tragedy of the Commons</H3>

<P>The original oyster populations in Willapa Bay declined because of "the
tragedy of the commons." <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>  Simply put, the operators of the schooners
involved in the Shoalwater Bay oystr trade had no reason not to fill up
their holds with impunity because if they did not, someone else would. 

<P>When the Olympia oyster populations declined, Willapa oystermen responded by
cultivating areas that were not natural oyster beds. They marked off the
boundaries of these areas with stakes, beginning the process of creating
private property rights to intertidal and subtidal lands in Willapa Bay.
Thus Willapa oystermen averted the tragedy of the commons and set the
precedent for tidal ownership in Washington 40 years before statehood. 

<P>When Washington became a state in 1889, de facto ownership of these areas
was well established. Recognizing the importance of the oyster industry, in
1891 the state legislature passed the Callow Act, which allowed oyster
growers to purchase the lands they were farming. Subsequently, in 1895, the
Bush Act was passed, allowing anyone to purchase lands not already being
used for oyster production, as long as they did just that -- farm oysters or
other shellfish, and nothing else. 

<P>The legislature eventually ended the sale of tidelands, but not before
approximately 60 percent of available tidelands had been purchased. <A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> Legal
title gave oyster growers the impetus for private stewardship and resource
enhancement, and emboldened them to fight for clean water for their oysters. 

<A NAME="experimentation"></a>
<P><BR>

<H3>Experimentation and Innovation</H3>

<P>The innovation and experimentation undertaken by the oyster industry in
Washington has brought them unprecedented success. It is no coincidence that
nowhere else is tideland ownership so extensive, and nowhere else does the
industry work so hard to solve its own problems. 

<P>In an effort to save the declining Olympias, oyster growers invested huge
sums to maintain and enhance their tidelands. They were committed to a
particular spot, so that when adversity arose, there was nowhere else for
them to go. <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>  It was not uncommon in 1910 for an oyster grower in Puget Sound
to invest $5,000 in an acre of tideland worth $1,000. <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>  Much of this expense
consisted of building systems of dikes to keep tidelands flooded, as Olympia
oysters have to be underwater continuously. Unfortunately the Olympias
continued to decline, due in part to increases in water pollution; but
because of their investments, the oyster growers persevered. 

<P>Following a short experiment with Eastern oysters, the Pacific oyster was
introduced into Willapa Bay in 1928. These oysters did very well in Willapa
waters, but initially they did not spawn naturally and had to be imported
from Japan each year. In 1936 Pacific oysters suddenly began spawning
naturally in Willapa Bay. Oyster beds were still supplemented with imported
seed, but the large, fast growing Pacific oysters quickly became an integral
part of the Willapa Bay watershed. <A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>

<P>Where the ground was too muddy or hard for oysters to survive, oystermen
used off-bottom techniques to grow out oysters on artificial surfaces. These
culture methods include attaching oysters to wooden stakes driven into the
ground, on wires or lines suspended off the bottom, on floats or suspended
nets, or by seeding large bags of oyster cultch and suspending them on
racks. These methods tremendously increased oyster production and
demonstrated the ingenuity of the Washington oystermen.

<P>Oyster growers in Willapa and elsewhere also invested in their own
hatcheries, and were so successful that they eventually exported seed back
to Japan. These private hatcheries continue to support Pacific oyster
production and are also involved in extensive research. <A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>  Hatchery projects
include broodstock manipulations to produce hardier, tastier oysters, not
just Pacifics, but native Olympias, Kumamotos (<I>Crassostrea sikemea</I>, another
Japanese import), European Flat oysters (<I>Ostrea edulis</I>), and even the
beleaguered Eastern oyster. 

<P>Another hatchery project is the triploid oyster, an oyster with an extra
chromosome that prevents it from spawning in the summer months (spawning
oyster lose much of their plumpness and taste). Previously oysters were
rarely harvested over the summer, but now summer harvests of plump oysters
are commonplace. 

<A NAME="fighting"></A>
<P><BR>

<H3>Fighting for Water Quality</H3>

<P>Because they are filter feeders, oysters are hyper-sensitive to pollution.
Even small amounts of pollution can result in either mass die-offs or
contaminated oysters that are unsafe to eat. Oysters are are commonly
referred to as "canaries in the mineshaft" -- the earliest indicators of
declines in water quality. This has been a burden on the oyster industry,
but a blessing to the health of Washington's waters, as the oyster growers
have always fought diligently for clean water.  

<P>In 1930 oyster growers from Willapa and elsewhere formed the Pacific Coast
Oyster Grower's Association (PCOGA) to purchase seed from Japan and to
promote oyster sales. But as the pollution from pulp mills increased, the
PCOGA became one of the staunchest defenders of water quality in Washington
state. 

<P>Throughout the history of the Pacific oyster those engaged in the industry
have... been leaders in the development of laws and regulations governing
sanitary requirements relating to oyster beds. <A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>

<P>During World War II the timber industry in Washington was pervasive, and
sulfite liquor effluent from pulp mills around the state destroyed many
oyster beds. The oystermen responded by inciting legislators to create the
Washington Pollution Control Commission in 1945. The new laws set water
quality standards, made it unlawful to violate them, and created a control
board to enforce them. In 1955, the Washington legislature strengthened
these standards (only for industry, not municipalities), and as the oyster
growers brought more cases to the Commission, pulp mills changed their
behavior, and sulfite effluent declined.  <A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>

<P>In the 1940s and 50s pulp mills dumped sulfites directly into Willapa Bay
through a small number of outfalls (this kind of pollution is known as point
source pollution). The logging industry tried to prove that oysters thrived
in pulp mill effluent, <A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> but the PCOGA successfully refuted these claims, and
the newly created Washington Pollution Control Board compelled pulp mills to
reduce their emissions. As pollution from the mills declined, oyster
populations quickly recovered. 

<P>Ownership gave oystermen the impetus to fight pollution. They depended on
clean water and were committed to defending a particular piece of property.
Tim Smith, the current executive director of the PCOGA, believes that
Washington has avoided many of the pollution problems prevalent in other
states "because of the presence of private tidelands." <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> In Willapa Bay, the
waters are cleaner today than a generation ago.  <A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>

<P>The approach that oyster growers took to protecting water quality was a
statutory one. They participated in and relied on the passage and
enforcement of regulations to protect water quality. It is also possible to
address pollution problems privately, but given the situation, their choice
made sense. Oyster growers might have been able to contract with pulp mills
to solve their pollution problem or sued them under the common law for
damaging their property, but the regulatory approach involved much less
effort and expense, and addressed point source pollution successfully. The
oyster industry already depended on their statutory right to farm oysters
(the aforementioned Bush and Callow Acts), so it easily followed to protect
their oysters in the same way. 

<P>In England, the owners of salmon in rivers have used the common law to
prevent pollution.  Under the common law, damage to someone's property must
be compensated and the damaging activity must cease. The common law has been
evolving for centuries, and can be a powerful tool to protect environmental
health. <A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A> The Anglers Cooperative Association (formed from owners of rights
to salmon in rivers in England and Wales) won a landmark suit against a
polluter in the 1950s, and since then has filed over a thousand cases
against polluters, settling almost all of them out of court. 

<P>Regulations may have been an effective way to fight point source pollution,
but today most pollution problems come from nonpoint source pollution
(pollution from a large number of small sources, such as leaking septic
tanks or agricultural runoff). <A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> Regulations exist that address nonpoint
source pollution, but convincing state officials to actually enforce them is
a very difficult proposition, and oyster growers have yet to find an
effective solution to nonpoint source pollution. 

<P>In most cases oyster growers damaged by nonpoint source pollution know
exactly where it is coming from, but there is little that they can do. <A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
Nonpoint pollution can be proved by running dye tests, but only a state
agency can force people to perform them. Suing the county or the state is an
option, and the PCOGA has done so, but they simply do not have the resources
to take on the state of Washington. 

<P>The PCOGA has had some success working with local communities to reduce
nonpoint source pollution, but as the coastal population of Washington
continues to grow, nonpoint sources of pollution will increase and statutory
protections will continue to be ineffectual. The common law, which allows
for direct relief from damaging pollution, may be an attractive alternative
to the disappointing regulatory regimes that exist today. 
<A NAME="alliance"></A>
<P><BR>

<H3>The Willapa Alliance</H3>

<P>In 1992, declines in the health of the bay and frustration with regulatory
agencies combined to lead people from diverse backgrounds to form the
Willapa Alliance, to "build constituencies for local solutions to economic
and environmental issues." <A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>  The Alliance was formed with the belief that
"those individuals who live and work in a community are the ones who care
most about the environment which surrounds it -- not the government, not the
environmental groups whose offices are located in cities." <A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>  

<P>One impetus for the creation of the Alliance was the threat that oyster
growers faced from a non-native cordgrass called spartina and a burrowing
shrimp, both of which destroy oyster habitat. Remedies exist to control
these species, but state regulators have tied the hands of oyster growers,
leading one grower to comment that the greatest threat to the bay is not
pollution or invasive species, but it's so-called custodian -- the state of
Washington.  <A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>

<P>The Willapa Alliance has had some success at encouraging discussion and
finding compromise because people with local interests want to find
solutions as quickly as possible. They are demonstrating that "rural folks
can best manage their natural resources and protect the environment given
local empowerment and the proper tools." <A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> Their methods have not encouraged
completely private environmental protection, but they have recognized the
ineffectualness of the regulatory approach and taken a strong first step
toward promoting effective, local, private stewardship. 

<P>Oyster growers have been at the heart of this group since its inception.
Oyster growers have provided a model for private conservation, not out of
some vague notion of altruism, but because of their ownership of tidelands
and vested interest in protecting the health of the Willapa Bay. Their
industry is an ideal model of a business that both utilizes and protects the
Willapa environment. Oysters provide habitat for crabs, eelgrass, algae, and
other marine invertebrates. They filter water and improve habitat for young
fish. "Oystering suggests an ideal ... it profits while enhancing the
diversity and productivity of the [environment] as a whole." <A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>

<P><BR>
<P>Since 1970, conservationists have painted a dismal picture of an increasing
struggle for survival of wildlife, with one species after another being pushed
to the brink of extinction.  There is no doubt that many animal species that
have disappeared or have been drastically reduced were at one time found in
truly enormous numbers.<p>
	The passenger pigeon, which was native to North America, was once probably the
most numerous species of bird on earth.  At its peak, its population may have
numbered around 3 billion.  Its migrating flocks darkened the skies over towns
and cities and sounded like an approaching tornado, yet they were extinct by
1914, mainly because of massive market-hunting.  A similar fate befell the
great auk, a large, flightless seabird that nested in vast numbers on islands
in the North Atlantic.  It was exterminated by whalers and fishermen who
slaughtered it for food, eggs, feathers, and oil.<p>
	Why are some species disappearing and others thriving?  First, we can examine
what is disappearing and what is not.  Why was the American buffalo nearly
exterminated but not the Hereford, the Angus, or the Jersey cow?  Why do cattle
and sheep ranchers over-graze the public lands but maintain lush pastures on
their own property?  Why are rare birds and mammals taken from the wild in a
manner that often harms them and depletes the population, but carefully raised
and nurtured in aviaries, game ranches, and hunting preserves?  <p>
	In all of these cases, it is clear that the problem of overexploitation or
overharvesting is a result of the resources being under public rather than
private ownership.  The difference in their management is a direct result of
two totally different forms of property rights and ownership:  public,
communal, or open-access common property vs. private property.  Wherever we
have public ownership we find overuse, waste, and extinction; but private
ownership results in sustained-yield use and preservation.<p>
  	It is important to recognize that this distinction between the destructive
overuse of open-access commons [common property hereafter] and careful
sustained-yield use of private property resources does not merely apply to a
comparison of wild with domesticated populations of plants and animals. Common
property problems involving wildlife have been especially prevalent in America,
and they continue to be extremely vexing precisely because of American wildlife
law.<p>
  	In Europe, native wildlife often belongs to private landowners or is managed
under a combination of private and public property.  Some European countries
have fewer problems of overexploitation of wildlife, regardless of population
pressures and economic and political systems.  In other words, we find
precisely what economic analysis has predicted about the treatment of common
property and private property wildlife resources.<p>
	An especially illustrative example of private property rights in wildlife
appears in the Montagnais Indians of Quebec and Labrador.  The Montagnais
dwelled in the forests of the Labrador Peninsula, hunting such furbearing
animals as caribou, deer, and beaver.  They treated wildlife as a common
property resource, with  everyone sharing in the bounty of the hunt.  Because
game was  plentiful and the Indian population was relatively low, the common
property resource system was able to work. <p>
	However, with the arrival of the French fur traders in the 1600s, the demand
for beaver began to rise rapidly. As the value of the furs rose, there was a
corresponding increase in beaver exploitation.  But unlike the buffalo,
virtually condemned to extinction as an unowned resource, the beaver were
protected by the evolution of private property rights among the hunters.  By
the early to mid 18th century, the transition to private hunting grounds was
almost complete and the Montagnais were managing the beaver on a
sustained-yield basis.<p>
	It was a highly sophisticated system.  The Montagnais blazed trees with their
family crests to delineate their hunting grounds, practiced retaliation against
poachers and trespassers, developed a seasonal allotment system, and marked
beaver houses.  Animal resources were husbanded.  Each year the family hunted
in a different quarter in rotation, leaving a tract in the center as a sort of
bank, not to be hunted over unless forced to do so by a shortage in the regular
tract.<p>
	This remarkably advanced system lasted for over a century and  certainly
served to prevent the extinction of the beaver. Unfortunately, more whites
entered the region and began to treat the beaver as a common resource, trapping
beavers themselves rather than trading with the Indians, and the beaver began
to disappear. Finally, the Indians were forced to abandon their private
property system and joined the whites in a rapid overexploitation of the
beaver. <p>
	Another example of how private ownership can successfully preserve wildlife is
found on game ranches, hunting preserves, safari parks, and animal and bird
farms.  Many of these private ventures, especially the game ranches, were
established to generate profits from private hunting.  Consequently, there has
been a tremendous outcry from environmentalists and conservationists because
the animals are raised for profit and some of them are killed.  Yet, if
emotional responses can be put aside, it seems clear that these game ranches
produce many positive results.  Many of the animals they stock are rapidly
disappearing in their native countries because of pressures resulting from a
rapidly expanding human population.  Indeed, some of the more spectacular and
most sought-after big-game mammals may now have healthier and more stable
populations on game ranches than in their native countries. <p>
	If the profits gained by giving hunters access to exotic game can provide the
economic incentive for landowners to manage the animals on a sustained-yield
basis, some species will be saved.  The same holds for the profits to be
derived from visitors to game parks and preserves.  In fact, the protection
provided at some of the parks, preserves, and gardens has actually produced a
glut of some animals.  There have been well-publicized efforts by some
preserves to return their surplus animals to Africa. Lions from America have
even been taken to Africa to appear in movies that were filmed there.  <p>
	Perhaps we should judge all of these activities by their achievements rather
than by their motives, for it may turn out that in the future the developing
countries will be restocked with their native fauna from specimens now thriving
on game ranches and preserves. <p>
	Such a success story has been the preservation of the Hawaiian goose, or nene.
Once they numbered over 25,000 in the wild, but under common property
management the population had plummeted to 20 to 30 birds by 1949. Fortunately,
they had been bred by aviculturists as early as 1824.  A Hawaiian rancher had
many on his farm, and there was a flock at the Wildfowl Trust at Slimbridge,
England.  Through the combined efforts of many interested parties, an intensive
captive breeding program was begun in the United States and Europe, and
thousands of young nenes were produced.  Beginning in the 1960s, they were
reintroduced to the wild in Hawaii, and by the mid 1970s there were as many as
600 in their native habitat.<p>
	The problems of environmental degradation, overexploitation of natural
resources, and depletion of wildlife all derive from their existence as common
property resources.  Wherever we find an approach to the extension of private
property rights in these areas, we find superior results.  Wherever we have
exclusive private ownership, whether it is organized around a profit-seeking or
nonprofit undertaking, there are incentives for the private owners to preserve
the resource.  Self-interest drives private property owners to careful
management and protection of their resource. <p>
	Asking people to revere resources and wildlife won&#146;t bring about the
peaceable kingdom when the only way a person can survive is to use up the
resource before someone else does.  Adopting a property system that directs and
channels man&#146;s innate self-interest into behavior that preserves natural
resources and wildlife will cause people to act as if they were motivated by a
new conservationist ethic.  If we are to resolve the tragedy of the commons and
preserve our natural resources and wildlife, we must create a new paradigm for
the environmental movement:  Private property rights in natural resources and
wildlife.<p>

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>

</CENTER>


<P>During humanity's relatively brief existence on this planet, it has relied
on the bounty of its flora and fauna for his existence.  For most of
history, this exploitation had little impact on the earth's resources.  Only in recent centuries has man's exploitation of wildlife begun to have a
deleterious effect, even though there is increasing evidence that primitive
societies had a profound impact on many species.  Overexploitation of
wildlife is not a peculiar characteristic of Western civilization, nor is it a consequence of commerce.

<P>Many animal species that have disappeared or have been drastically reduced
were at one time found in truly enormous numbers.  Why are some species
disappearing and others thriving?  In those cases where human activity has
contributed to species declines, it is clear that the problem of
overexploitation or overharvesting is a result of the resources being under
public rather than private ownership.  Wherever we have public ownership we
find overuse, waste, and extinction; but private ownership results in
sustained-yield use and preservation.

<P>The salmon fishery provides a nearly perfect example of the differences
between private and common property management. As a common property
resource, they belong to everyone, can be caught by everyone, and
essentially belong to no one.  Because no one owns the salmon, each user is
pitted against all the other users, and the result has been a rapid
depletion of the stock.  Fortunately, salmon are a highly desirable fish,
and American entrepreneurs are attempting to remove them from the common
property trap.  Outside the United States we also find a different
situation.  In some European countries, salmon fisheries are in much
healthier shape because the rights to the salmon or the salmon rivers are
privately owned.

<P>Another example of how private ownership can successfully preserve wildlife is found on game ranches, hunting preserves, safari parks, and animal and bird farms.  Many of these private ventures, especially game ranches, were
established to generate profits from private hunting.  If emotional
objections to such arrangements can be put aside, it is clear that game
ranches produce many positive results, as many of the animals they stock are
disappearing in their native countries.  If the profits gained by giving
hunters access to exotic game can provide the economic incentive for
landowners to manage animals on a sustained-yield basis, some species will
be saved.

<P>Under private property ownership, others are prevented from exploiting
resources and there are incentives for the owner to preserve them.  This
protection is not solely motivated by the possibility of economic gain.
Many examples of successful private conservation were fostered for the
pleasure of owning and breeding attractive or rare wildlife or due to a
commitment to the preservation of vanishing species. 

<P>The disappearance of wildlife has nothing to do with commerce or a lack of
reverence for wildlife.  The more rapid disappearance of common property
wildlife during the past century is due to the fact that much larger human
populations are using it, more efficient means of capture and kill are
employed, and a larger number of uses has been found for some species.
Furthermore, many of the most populous species of wildlife had been reduced
to a severely depleted state long before the development of modern business
and commerce.  This is especially true regarding sea turtles.  

<P>The problems of overexploitation and extinction of wildlife appear to derive
consistently from their being treated as a common property resource.
Example after example bears this out.  It is also predicted by the economic
analysis of common property resources.  The proper path toward resolving the
vexing issues of wildlife conservation lies in removing wildlife from common
property resource treatment and creating private property rights.  This
poses a direct challenge to the basic philosophical beliefs of many
environmentalists.  But if we are to resolve the tragedy of the commons and
preserve our natural resources and wildlife, we must create a new paradigm
for the environmental movement: private property rights in natural resources
and wildlife.

<H2>The Unexplored Virtues of Private Conservation</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Whenever there is an environmental problem, environmental lobbyists call
for increased government regulation.  Whenever there is a valuable ecological
resource that needs protection, they call upon a government agency to do the
job.  This presumption in favor of government action does not serve the
environment well.  While government intervention has produced some
environmental benefits, it has also precluded more promising alternatives in
many areas of environmental protection.<p>
	It has often been observed that America is a nation where homes and yards are
beautiful, but public parks and streets are a mess.  Some suggest that the
&#147;solution&#148; is to spend more tax dollars on the public sector and
increase the stringency of government regulation.<p>
	A better approach is to find ways of generating the same level of care for
&#147;public&#148; resources as we do for private ones.  This requires that
individuals have a direct interest in protecting environmental resources, and
the ability to see that interest realized.  Rather than bureaucratize the
environment, we should privatize our efforts to protect it.  In other words, we
should seek to make more of planet Earth someone&#146;s backyard.  Trees cannot
have legal standing, but behind every tree &#151; every beach, every stream,
every lake, every spotted owl &#151; there could stand a private steward, a
private owner or association, willing and legally empowered to protect that
resource.  By creatively drawing upon the energies of America&#146;s private
sector, we can reinvigorate the protection of environmental resources.<p>
	Extending private ownership rights to the widest possible array of natural
resources will seem outlandish to those who believe that unregulated markets
are the cause of environmental problems.  Yet pollution, habitat destruction,
and resource depletion are not the result of too many private property rights
but of too few; not the results of market failures but of a <i>failure to allow
markets</i>.<p>
	Because the air, the water, public lands, and most species of mammals and fish
have no private owners, they have few effective defenders and protectors.
While there are exceptions, on the whole people have strong incentives to
conserve and protect only that in which they have a direct interest.  Whether
we consider elephants in Africa, salmon streams in England, or forests in the
United States, privately-owned resources have been better managed and protected
than their politically-controlled counterparts.<p>
	Of course, the environmental establishment would have us believe that
privatizing public lands and other common property resources would permit the
&#147;rape&#148; of the environment, or at the very least would promote
&#147;unsustainable&#148; development.  But this view does not survive
inspection.  It is precisely the <i>absence</i> of private property rights that
encourages people to use resources in a unsustainable manner and, more
generally, to ignore the environmental consequences of their actions.  This
does not mean that private stewardship, in all cases, is perfect; nor does it
mean that government protection, in all cases, will fail.  However, if the
first line of defense for environmental resources has to come from either the
private sector or the political process, the choice is clear.<p>
	Consider the case of timberlands.  A timber company operating on public land
has an incentive to cut down as many trees as it can, as fast as it can.  Under
the system of non-ownership, even the most conservation-minded company is
unlikely to stop overharvesting; if it doesn&#146;t cut down the trees, someone
else will.  It also has no incentive to protect wildlife habitat or provide
recreational amenities for campers, hikers, and fishermen, since it has no way
to obtain a return on such investments.<p>
	A private owner of forest land faces a very different set of incentives.  The
private owner knows that if trees are harvested as rapidly as possible,
revenues may increase in the short term, but the forest&#146;s long-term
capacity to generate income will be destroyed and the market value of the land
will immediately drop.  Private ownership thus creates economic incentives to
harvest timber in a sustainable manner, and to replant trees as an investment
for the future.  In addition, the private owner may well discover &#151; as
International Paper Company and several other firms already have &#151; that
investing in wildlife research and habitat protection provides profitable
recreational opportunities.<A HREF="#1"><sup>1</sup></A><p>
	Of course, private stewardship does not require that one always act in pursuit
of profit.  The principle of private ownership enables conservation groups to
purchase and protect vital habitat and ecologically important resources. <p>
	CEI&#146;s newly launched <A HREF="/cpc.html">Center for Private Conservation (CPC)</A> was created to
identify and document successful private conservation efforts, and explain how
property rights can overcome the tragedy of the commons in
wildlife.<A HREF="#2"><sup>2</sup></A>  The reality is that there is room for a greater reliance
upon non-governmental methods of environmental protection.  <p>
<UL>
<LI>	The Hawk Mountain Sanctuary is a 2,000-acre wildlife refuge located in
eastern Pennsylvania along the Appalachian Mountains. It was founded in 1934 by
Mrs. Rosalie Edge, a conservationist concerned about the local slaughter of
migrating hawks and other raptors.  While the Pennsylvania government was
paying bounties on certain birds of prey, Mrs. Edge was raising money to
purchase the land and protect these birds from decline.  The sanctuary soon
became an important raptor research site and a stopping-off point for many
migratory species.  Legislation to protect migratory birds was not forthcoming
for many years after Hawk Mountain was founded.<A HREF="#3"><sup>3 </sup></A><p>

<LI>	David Bamberger is a game rancher in Texas.  He has single-handedly preserved
29 of the 31 remaining bloodlines of the scimitar-horned oryx, a rare species
of antelope.  Bamberger&#146;s efforts have been so successful that there are
now more oryx in Texas than there are in its native North African range.
Similarly, there are now more blackbuck antelope on Texas&#146; Edwards Plateau
than remain in India.  Game ranching has benefitted many foreign species in
this country, but because private ownership of indigenous, non-domesticated
wildlife is generally illegal in this country, such success stories are less
widespread.<A HREF="#4"><sup>4</sup></A><p>

<LI>	Down in the heart of the Louisiana bayou lies the Paul J. Rainey Wildlife
Sanctuary.  Owned and operated by the National Audubon Society, this
26,800-acre refuge serves as the nesting and breeding grounds for many species
of migratory birds.  The sanctuary is off-limits to bird watchers, yet Audubon
has allowed oil drilling in Rainey for nearly 30 years.  Through careful
negotiations with oil companies and the encouragement of innovative extraction
techniques, Audubon&#146;s ownership and control of the refuge has enabled it
to protect its ecological resources while at the same time realizing the
economic benefits of oil development.  Such win-win situations have been
typically precluded on politically-controlled lands.<A HREF="#5"><sup>5</sup></A><p>
</UL>
	<P>In the name of air quality, clean water, biodiversity, wetlands, waste
disposal, and recycling, the federal government has amassed what amounts to
central planning authority over the U.S. economy.  At the same time, we have
turned our back on the power of individuals and voluntary institutions to make
a difference on behalf of those things that they care about.  The problem is
not that private efforts have failed.  All too often the problem is that
private efforts have been proscribed by government from the start.<p>
	Private stewardship is a powerful means of ensuring sustainability and
protecting environmental quality.  The vision of an America engaged in creative
ecological privatization offers great promise for accommodating the
ever-changing circumstances of human interaction with the natural world.
Ecological privatization would produce large environmental gains at reasonable
cost.  Equally important, it would strengthen the American tradition of limited
government, reliance on markets for economic decisions, and respect for
individual liberty.<p>

<H2>BREAKING THE FDA'S 
DRUG APPROVAL MONOPOLY<BR>
Implications for Tort Law 
and Consumer Welfare</H2>
by Michael I. Krauss

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>The Food and Drug Administration's monopoly over approving new medical
therapies is premised on the idea that information markets fail.  In fact,
competitive forces produce information much more readily than is commonly
believed through advertising, testing publications, and companies'
reputations for quality.  This holds important implications for FDA reform.  

<P>The common law inspires confidence in information produced without the need for heavy-handed regulations.  Tort and product-liability law can and do
result in increased informational output from manufacturer to physician and
consumer precisely in those instances where such output might otherwise be
insufficient.

<P>     The market failure argument supposes that private corporations have
insufficient incentives to produce information, but that government
incentives to inform consumers are somehow not distorted.  But FDA is
subject to its own set of perverse incentives.  For the agency, the
political consequences of mistakenly approving a bad drug or device are far
worse than those of mistakenly delaying or disapproving a needed therapy.
As a result, FDA is inherently overcautious  --  an approach which serves its
interests but not those of the public.

<P>     The path to reform can be found in a gap in FDA's current monopoly.  Under
existing law, manufacturers may not market drugs or devices that have not
received FDA approval.  But if a drug or device is approved by the agency as safe and effective for one purpose, then doctors are free to prescribe it
for other purposes as well.  

<P>     Despite its efforts to suppress these "off-label" uses, FDA has not stemmed
the tide.  Off-label prescriptions have proliferated despite tort law's
implicit bias in favor of FDA-approved uses. 

<P>     A proposal by the <A HREF="/">Competitive Enterprise Institute</A> suggests a way to
preserve FDA's evaluative functions while expanding therapeutic choice.
Under this proposal, FDA would function not as a veto agency, but as an
evaluation agency.  Rather than being banned across the board, unapproved
therapies would be available under medical supervision and with clear
warning of their unapproved status.  That is, "off-label manufacturing"
would be permitted, much as "off-label prescribing" is presently allowed.
FDA would lose its veto power over new therapies, but it would continue to
act as a state-funded evaluator of therapies.     

<P>     Manufacturers might still choose to seek FDA approval if that approval was
sufficiently valued by the public and by physicians.  Moreover, under this
proposal FDA approval would confer a shield against design defect liability.
But patients and their doctors would be free to go beyond the circle of
government approved therapies.  The arena of initial therapeutic evaluation
would itself expand to encompass such private entities as testing
laboratories and medical journals, so that FDA itself would be subject to
competition in producing credible, and timely, evaluations of new drugs and
devices.

<P>     FDA's legal control over medicine has never been all-encompassing, but its
exercise of that power has had deadly consequences.  The "off-label" use gap
in FDA's power has mitigated its potentially disastrous effects, and
contains the kernel of a regulatory approach that would be far safer and
more effective than our current system.

<P><BR>

The field of biotechnology promises tremendous advances in medicine and agriculture.  Biotechnology products should be regulated no differently than other products.  Policymakers should focus on the safety of particular products and innovations, rather than upon their origin or means of production. <p>
	
Biotechnology&#146;s advance from the pharmacy to the supermarket shelf has
spurred a host of regulatory proposals, fueled in large part by scare stories about mutant cows and killer tomatoes.  Where specific biotechnology products are shown to pose risks that are higher than those of their &#147;natural&#148; counterparts, regulations may well be appropriate.  However, merely because a product has been produced through biotechnological means does not justify its being singled out for special regulation.  <p>
	
Nonetheless, several agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and
the Food and Drug Administration, in the past have imposed precisely such
regulations on products ranging from bio-engineered bacteria for use in
agriculture to biotech foods and pharmaceuticals.  Some of these agencies have
revised recently revised their policies.  For example, in the wake of the 1994
Congressional elections, FDA withdrew its proposal to subject biotech foods to
a host of extensive regulations; the agency now takes the far more reasonable
course of focusing on whether a genetic change may have created a new risk or
produced a substance significantly different than that commonly found in food.
Nonethless, in many cases the biotech origins of a product will still trigger
excessive regulatory scrutiny.<p>
	
Product labelling is another area of political and regulatory contention.  The
Food and Drug Administration&#146;s 1993 approval of rBST to enhance milk
production drew fire from some consumer groups, who argue for mandatory
labelling of rBST-derived products.  Such labelling requirements, they claim,
are necessary for consumers to be fully informed.  But the real effect would be
to restrict consumer choice under the guise of protecting the public&#146;s
&#147;right to know.&#148;<p>
	
If consumers really are interested in knowing whether their foods have been
biotechnologically produced, then they will be able to get that information
without labelling mandates.  Producers and sellers of &#147;non-biotech&#148;
foods can freely advertise that fact, just as many companies and stores today
advertise that their products are &#147;organic&#148; or
&#147;preservative-free.&#148;  Mandatory labelling laws are not needed to
produce such information.<p>
	
Labelling mandates, on the other hand, would not merely produce unneeded
information; <i>they would ultimately restrict consumer choice</i>.  Such
mandates would almost certainly target man-made substances over natural
substances and new technologies over older ones.  They would make it difficult
if not impossible to sell these products, because consumers would naturally
believe that they were being warned about some significant risk that they would
be better off avoiding.  The end result would be closed markets and undeveloped
products.  This, for example, was the chief effect of laws earlier in this
century that imposed labelling and packaging restrictions on margarine and
other dairy substitutes.  Their alleged purpose was to prevent consumer
deception, but their <i>anti</i>-consumer nature is well recognized today.<p>
	The field of biotechnology has an incredible potential to produce a wide-range
of medical and consumers products.  Biotechnology has already produced such
wondrous developments as clotting-factor VIII, an important treatment for
hemophilia, and cloned insulin, upon which many diabetics depend.  This
potential should not be compromised by excessive regulation.<p>

<i>Q:  Doesn&#146;t biotechnology pose new risks greater than those we&#146;ve
faced before?</i><p>

A:  No.  Nearly all our agricultural products have been developed by breeding,
which is itself a process of genetic alteration.  For example, tomatoes were
once small and bitter.  But careful selective breeding of tomatoes,
occasionally with other plant species, enabled the development of sweeter
modern varieties.  Biotechnology is simply a more advanced technique of this
same process that entails no special risks.  Many biotech techniques involve no
more than a speeding up of the breeding process.  The real risk is that of
across-the-board biotechnology regulation, and the delay that this can cause in
the availability of new products.<p>


<i>Q:  Don&#146;t consumers have a right to know what they are buying? </i><p>

A:  The basic consumer right is to able to buy what one wants, and companies
should not be allowed to deceive their customers.  If consumers demand
particular information about a series of products, companies should be free to
provide that information and to advertise it.  However, the government should
refrain from selecting which types of information should be placed on packaging
merely to satisfy certain interest groups.  When scientifically irrelevant
factors become the subject of arbitrary labelling rules, the end result will be
fewer products for people to choose from.<p>


<i>Q:  Why is biotechnology necessary?  Why can&#146;t we leave things the way
they are?</i><p>


A:  To stand still in a world where nature is steadily changing is to fall
behind.  Rapid technological and institutional change has made the world a
safer, healthier place; similarly rapid improvements will be necessary to
continue this trend.<p>
	
Biotechnology, thus, is a vital field of research.  Few people are aware of
how important biotechnology is to improving the lives of millions of people.
In the field of medicine, for example, biotechnological processes have been
used to develop vaccines, cloned insulin for diabetics, heart attack drugs like
TPA (Tissue Plasminogen Activator), and the diagnostic techniques used to keep
our nation&#146;s blood supply free of hepatitis B and HIV.  Biotechnology also
shows promise in the field of environmental remediation.  Scientist hope that
biotechnology will develop safer and more effective means of addressing
pollution and cleaning up contaminated ground water. <p>
	
We also should not forget the economic importance of this growing industry.
The U.S. is the world leader in biotechnology with over 1,000 biotech companies
which employ over 50,000 people.  Biotechnology is expected to be an $80
billion industry within several years.  These benefits, too, should not be
overlooked.

<H1>Cardiac and Cancer Specialists<BR> on the Need for FDA Reform</H1>
<H3>Two National Polls Debunk The Notion That FDA Doesn't Need Fixing</H3><P>
by <B>Sam Kazman</B><br>
July 24, 1996
</CENTER>



<P><BR>
Cardiology and oncology are two medical specialties whose members understand the need for new, life-saving drugs and devices.  They know, on a first-hand
basis, that such technologies can frequently mean the difference between life and death for many patients.  <p>

What do cardiologists and oncologists think of FDA?  In the past year, CEI
commissioned two polls to examine the views of these specialists.  The first, a poll of oncologists, was released in August, 1995.  It involved a total of 160 telephone interviews with randomly selected hospital-based oncologists.  Its margin of error was +/-5.1% at the 95th percentile confidence level -- that is, similar results would have been obtained in 19 out of 20 cases.<p>

The second poll, of 216 randomly selected cardiologists and cardiac surgeons, is being released today.  Its margin of error is +/-4.8 percent at the same high confidence level.<p>

Both polls demonstrate highly negative views of FDA on such issues as whether the agency is too slow in approving new drugs and devices, whether the public understands the human cost of FDA delays, and whether FDA delays impair the ability of these specialists to give the best possible care to patients.  Both polls demonstrate overwhelming opposition to FDA's policy of restricting information about off-label use, and strong support for making unapproved therapies available to physicians as long as they are clearly labeled as being unapproved.  <p>

There were minor differences on some questions.  For example, a majority of
cardiologists (57%) believe that FDA approval delays result in patient deaths, while oncologists were just about evenly split on this issue (47% agreeing, 48% disagreeing).  But even here, where negative views of FDA were not held by a majority of oncologists, the fact that such a large percentage of them were critical is itself of serious concern. <i> Something is wrong when an agency
charged with protecting public health is viewed this negatively by physicians fighting for their patients' lives.</i><p>

FDA reform is frequently attacked as a pet project of big business that will allegedly open the door to snake oil remedies.  This characterization is wrong. As these polls demonstrate, for many medical specialists, fighting heart disease and cancer can often mean fighting FDA.  If this isn't a public health
problem in need of reform, what is?<p>

<H2>CITIZEN PETITION</H2>
	
<P>The undersigned hereby submits this petition under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.  301 et seq., under 21 C.F.R.  10.25(a), and under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  553(e), to request that the Commissioner of Food and Drugs assert jurisdiction over and regulate caffeinated beverages as drugs and/or devices.
<P><BR>
	<H3>A. ACTION REQUESTED</H3>

	<P>Petitioner Competitive Enterprise Institute ("CEI") requests the Commissioner to assert jurisdiction over and regulate caffeinated beverages as drugs and/or devices under 21 U.S.C. 
 321(g)(1)(C) and 321(h)(3).
<P><BR>

	<H3>B. STATEMENT OF GROUNDS</H3>
	
<P>Petitioner, the Competitive Enterprise Institute ("CEI"), is a non-profit public interest group committed to the principles of free markets and limited government.  CEI has a longstanding interest in regulatory issues involving matters of health, safety and free speech.  See, e.g., CEI and Consumer Alert v. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 956 F.2d 321 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (adverse safety effects of federal fuel economy standards); CEI v. U.S. Department of Transportation, 856 F.2d 1563 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (First Amendment challenge to regulation of airline computer reservation systems).  

	
<P>CEI hereby petitions the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to assert jurisdiction over caffeine-containing beverages and to regulate them as drugs and/or drug delivery devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act (FDCA), 21 U.S.C.  301 et seq.  In CEI's view, such regulation of caffeine would not be socially beneficial; in fact, it would actually harm consumers by restricting the availability and advertising of products which should be freely available.  

	
<P>Nonetheless, CEI submits that caffeine beverage regulation follows directly from FDA's pending proposal on tobacco products.  FDA has proposed to regulate nicotine in tobacco products based on its determination that these products meet the FDCA's definition of a drug under section 321(g)(1)(C), and its definition of a device under section 321(h)(3).  As shown below, FDA's criteria for this determination are equally applicable to caffeine.  CEI submits that, under FDA's newly expanded interpretation of the FDCA definitions of drugs and devices, the agency is now required to regulate caffeine-containing beverages as well.
<P><BR>
	
<H3>REGULATION OF CAFFEINE-CONTAINING BEVERAGES UNDER THE FDCA</H3>
<P>
<OL>
	<LI> <B>The Common Sources of Caffeine </B>

	<P>The most common sources of caffeine are coffee, tea, and caffeinated soft drinks.  In coffee and tea, the caffeine occurs naturally.  Methods exist for removing this caffeine from coffee and tea, and a small percentage of the coffee and tea sold is fully or partially decaffeinated.  In caffeine-containing soft drinks, caffeine comes from both the caffeine in the kola nut used in some of these beverages, as well as from added caffeine. M.L. Bunker & M. McWilliams, "Caffeine Content of Common Beverages", J. Am. Dietetic Ass'n 28 (Jan. 1979);  O.M. Graham, "Caffeine -- Its Identity, Dietary Sources, Intake, and Biological Effects", Nutrition Reviews, April 1978, at 97.  

	<P>Soft drinks constitute the majority of caffeine consumed by children.  J.E. James, Caffeine and Health 52 (Academic Press, 1991).  In fact, 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	"[t]he largest percentage of caffeine consumers was among two- and three-year-olds, 91 and 93 per cent, respectively.  Notwithstanding differences in the amount of caffeine reported in different studies, this and previous surveys confirm that habitual patterns of caffeine consumption begin early in life."  Id. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<P>Although there are no FDA efforts underway to regulate caffeinated beverages as drugs and devices, the agency has proposed to codify a prior sanction on the use of caffeine as a food additive in soft drinks. FDA, Proposed Rule: Caffeine in Nonalcoholic Carbonated Beverages, 52 FR 18,923 (1987).  This proposed rule has yet to be finalized.
<P>

	<LI> <B>Regulation of Drugs and Devices under the FDCA </B>

	<P>Section 321(g)(1)(C) of 21 U.S.C. defines drugs as "articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals".  Food, which is defined in section 321(f) to include both food and drink, is excluded from the definition of drug.  

	<P>The statutory distinction between food and drugs is not clear, however, because there are many instances of food items intended to be used as drugs and and there are many instances of drugs that are derived from foods.  "That a product is naturally occurring or derived from a natural food does not preclude its regulation as a drug." Nutrilab Inc. v. Scheiker, 547 F. Supp. 880, 882 (N.D. Ill. 1982), aff'd, 713 F. 2d 335 (7th Cir. 1983).  The regulatory classification depends on intent.  "If a product is intended by the user and the manufacturer or distributor to be used as a drug, it will be regulated as such."  547 F. at 881-82.  Thus, the FDCA's exclusion of food from the definition of a drug does not preclude caffeinated beverages from being considered drugs.

	<P>Section 321(h)(3) defines device as an "instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, part or accessory which is... intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals ...."
<P>
	<LI> <B>FDA's Proposed Application of the FDCA to Nicotine</B>

	<P>FDA currently proposes that nicotine is a drug under section 321(g)(1)(C) and a device under section 321(h)(3), and has set out the criteria used to make this determination.  FDA, Proposed Rule: Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco Products, 60 FR 41,314 (1995); FDA, Nicotine in Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco Products Is a Drug, 60 FR 41,454 (1995).  FDA has summarized these criteria as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	"I. Cigarettes and smokeless tobacco "affect the structure or any function of the body" because they have pharmacological effects and lead to addiction.

	<P>"II. Tobacco manufacturers "intend" that their products have addictive and significant pharmacological effects.
  <DL>
  		<DD>A. Objective intent is the appropriate standard.

  		<DD>B. The evidence demonstrates intent to affect the structure or function of the body.
<OL>
    			<LI> The addictive, psychoactive, and other pharmacological effects of nicotine are widely known and foreseeable by any reasonable person in the position of a tobacco manufacturer.

    			<LI> Consumers use tobacco products to obtain the pharmacological effects of nicotine and to satisfy their addiction to nicotine.

    			<LI> Tobacco manufacturers know that nicotine has pharmacological effects and that consumers use tobacco for those effects and have acted to facilitate that use.
</OL></DL>

	<P>"III. Nicotine-containing cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products are drug delivery systems that are appropriately regulated as devices."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>	Based on this declaration of jurisdiction, FDA is now proposing to regulate the sale, distribution, and advertising of tobacco products. 
<P>
	
<LI> <B>Applicability of the FDCA to Caffeine</B>

<P>	The same criteria, applied to caffeine and caffeinated beverages, suggest that they too are drugs and devices.  With respect to Part I (effect), there is evidence that caffeine, like nicotine, has pharmacological effects.  Caffeine acts as a central nervous system stimulant and also affects the cardiovascular system as well as other organ systems.  James at 19-33.  It also affects human behavior and sleep patterns.  James, Caffeine and Health at 247-79, 301-08.  FDA itself has stated that "[t]he major pharmacological effect of caffeine is on the central nervous system, but it can also stimulate the heart and increase cardiac output."  FDA, Proposed Rule: Soda Water, 45 FR 69,815, 69,819/3 (1980).  

	<P>There is also some evidence that caffeine may lead to addiction.  A 1994 study, which builds on a substantial body of earlier work, states: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	"these results, together with other experimental evidence, suggest that caffeine exhibits the features of a typical psychoactive substance of dependence."<br> 
E.C. Strain et al., "Caffeine Dependence Syndrome", 
	<i>J. Am. Medical Ass'n</i> 1043 (Oct. 5, 1994).  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>According to this study, a majority of those addicted to caffeine showed symptoms of "withdrawal (94%), use continued despite knowledge of a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by caffeine use (94%), persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use (81%), and tolerance (75%)."  Id. at 1043.  
	<P>These are the same criteria that form the basis of FDA's proposal to regulate nicotine as an addictive drug.  60 FR 41,485-87.  
	<P>With respect to Part II, Subpart A (objective intent), FDA's conclusion that tobacco manufacturers objectively intend that their products have addictive and pharmacological effects similarly applies to caffeinated-beverage manufacturers.  As with nicotine, the effects of caffeine are widely known and are foreseeable to the producers of caffeine-containing beverages.  This is evidenced by the above-mentioned medical literature, as well as by industry-sponsored research.  See Caffeine: Perspectives From Recent Research 77-103 (P.B. Dews ed., 1984); J. Masterson, "Trends in Coffee Consumption", <I>Tea and Coffee Trade J.</I> (March 1983).  Thus, Part II, subpart B1 (manufacturer knowledge and foreseeability) is met.

	<P>There is also evidence that consumers use caffeinated products to obtain its pharmacological effects and to satisfy their cravings.  Again, this is found in the medical and industry literature discussed above.  Most notably, the fact that a majority of caffeine users show a "persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use" is evidence that caffeine-containing beverages are being consumed, at least in part, for their drug effects.  Strain at 1043.  

	<P>FDA Commissioner David Kessler has stated, in regard to smoking, that "many young people progress steadily from experimentation to regular use, with addiction taking hold within a few years."  FDA, Nicotine in Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco Products Is a Drug, Appendices at A-291.  Similar arguments have been made regarding caffeinated beverages, where doses known to be pharmacologically active are taken on a daily basis throughout the lives of many users.  James at 52.  The availability and relative unpopularity of similar-tasting no- or low-caffeine alternatives further attests to the fact that these beverages are taken for their pharmacological effects and to satisfy addictions.  Thus, subpart B2 is met.

	<P>There is also evidence that the caffeinated beverages industry knows that caffeine has pharmacological effects, that it may be addictive, and that consumers use caffeine for these effects, and that the industry has facilitated this use.  The above-cited medical and industry-sponsored research is evidence of this knowledge.  Advertising of these products often indicates an attempt on the part of producers to use caffeine's psychoactive properties as a sales pitch.  The name of one caffeinated soft drink, Jolt Cola, alludes to its stimulant effect, as does its slogan -- "all the sugar and twice the caffeine".  Similarly, Final Exam Tea, a high caffeine iced tea, has a name which alludes to the benefits of its stimulant effects, particularly for students.  Mountain Dew, which has one of the highest caffeine contents of any caffeinated soft drink, uses the slogan "You'll get a kick out of Dew," in its television advertisements.  Several coffee brands, such as Folgers, emphasize caffeine's stimulant effects for those who are groggy in the morning.  Their well known phrase is "the best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup."  Thus, industry's own research and marketing efforts suggest the requisite knowledge.

	<P>In addition, there is evidence that, like nicotine, caffeine levels are "manipulated".  The existence of low- or no-caffeine alternatives is evidence that manufacturers can and do adjust caffeine levels.  This can also occur in the choice of coffee bean, as the robusta bean contains roughly twice the caffeine as the arabica bean.  James at 56.  One company is attempting the alter the amount of caffeine in coffee beans through genetic engineering techniques.  H. Shand, "Gene-Altered Java", <I>Utne Reader</I>, Nov.-Dec. 1994, at 71-72.  Thus, there is evidence of industry knowledge of consumer use (Subpart B3).    

	<P>With respect to drug delivery systems (Part III), once caffeine is determined to be a drug, it follows that the various mechanisms for delivering caffeine to the human body are devices under section 321(h)(3).  FDA analogizes cigarettes and other tobacco products to pre-filled syringes, transdermal patches, and metered dose inhalers, which are all regulated as devices.  60 FR 41,521.  According to FDA, tobacco products are devices because they are used to deliver the drug nicotine into the body, after which the nicotine-depleted cigarette butt or smokeless tobacco material is discarded. 60 Fed. Reg. 41,521-22.  Similarly, caffeinated beverages provide a means to deliver caffeine to the body, after which the coffee grounds, tea bags, or empty caffeinated beverage containers are discarded.  By FDA's logic, these "caffeine delivery systems" are devices.

	<P>Because caffeinated beverages are both drugs and devices, they can be regulated as either or both.  56 FR 58,754, 58,754-55 (1991). 	
<P>
	<LI> <B>Caffeine Products Are Heavily Marketed to Minors</B>

	<P>Although not part of the definition of a drug or device under sections 321(g)(1)(C) and 321(h)(3), FDA's primary reason for its proposed regulations is the use of tobacco products by children and young adults.  FDA has expressed concerns that nicotine use among children is widespread, and that most adults addicted to nicotine began their use as minors.  In fact, FDA states that there is a concerted effort by the tobacco industry to target minors in its advertising campaigns in order to generate future customers of addicted adults who began their habits as children, when they did not know better.  60 FR 41,314-15.

	<P>The same may be said of caffeine.  There is evidence that caffeine use is widespread among minors, the primary source being caffeinated soft drinks.  M.L. Arbeit et al., "Caffeine Intakes of Children From a Biracial Population: The Bogalusa Heart Study", 88 J. Am. Dietetic Ass'n. 466 (1988).  Evidence also suggests that "life-long patterns of caffeine consumption are probably often established in childhood...."  James at 265.  

	<P>In addition, much of the advertising of caffeinated soft drinks seems to target young people, and some of the coffee and tea advertisements appeal to young adults.  For example, the advertising agency designing the campaign for one brand of caffeinated soft drinks has chosen to specifically target young adults because, in terms of brand loyalty, "[i]f you capture them at that age, you capture them forever."  A. Faiolo, "Pop Culture: RC Goes For the Youth Market", Wash. Post (Sep. 14, 1995) D-10, D-12.  Thus, FDA's argument that addictions to nicotine are deliberately created at an early age may also apply to caffeine.
<P>
	<LI> <B>Summary</B>

	<P>Once caffeinated beverages are defined as drugs and/or devices, FDA is required to initiate rulemaking proceedings to regulate them.  FDA has proposed to assert jurisdiction over nicotine-containing products based on the determination that they are drugs and devices.  CEI submits that the logic of this proposal requires that FDA similarly determine that caffeinated beverages are drugs and devices, and that the agency should promulgate similar regulatory restrictions on caffeine-containing beverages.  CEI reiterates its view that such regulations would be socially harmful, injuring the ability of consumers to obtain products which they enjoy and which they should be free to purchase.  Nonetheless, such regulations follow directly from FDA's tobacco proposal.

<H1>The FDA vs. Reform</H1><P>
by <B>Julie DeFalco</B><br>
Friday, June 7, 1996
</CENTER>



<P><BR>
Congress is pushing to reform the Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA's
answer?  Fudge the data to spruce up its image.<p>


	In what's known as "drug lag," the FDA frequently delays the release of promising new therapies.  Some patients die for want of new drugs and devices. And because approval time counts against the life of a patent, it forces firms to boost prices to recover their hefty R&amp;D costs.<p>

	FDA head Dr. David Kessler recently told Congress to look at "the substantial progress that the... FDA (has) achieved over the past several years."  But "progress" turns out to mean new ways to measure the lag -- or rather, to conceal it.<p>

	For example, the agency claimed last December that "FDA's tough standards do not delay consumer access to important new drugs, compared to other countries (Germany, U.K. and Japan).... The data clearly demonstrate that the United States has available valuable drugs as soon as, and in many cases, sooner than, its counterparts around the world."<p>

	In fact, the FDA only used data that would prove its claim.  Its study only looked at new drugs put on the world market from January 1990 to December 1994. That left out the many drugs first introduced in Europe in the late '80s and then submitted for U.S. approval in '90s, as well as drugs still on hold here from the '80s.<p>

	The report also took care not to look at the key issue -- how long it took each drug to get through the FDA's Byzantine approval process.  Thus, the FDA cited tacrine, a treatment for Alzheimer's, as a drug it had approved before the comparison countries.  Yet tacrine's discoverer, Dr. William Summers, says the FDA "attempted to pull the plug on our research" and delayed the drug's availability for nearly five years.<p>

	The FDA does admit that more drugs are available in Britain than in the U.S. -- but says "there appears to be no drug of major public health interest to U.S. patients" among them.  Such claims show the agency's paternal mindset. "It is only the FDA's judgement that other drugs are not that important," says Dr. Joe DiMasi of the Tufts University Center for the Study of Drug Development.  <p>

	Kessler also showcases a 1995 General Accounting Office study he says shows the FDA's speed in processing new medical device applications (known as PMAs).<p>

	The report is more statistical sleight-of-hand.  The FDA just switched from looking at the mean approval time to measuring the median.  (The mean is the average, the median just the middle value of a set of numbers).<p>

	Why the change?  The GAO report notes, "When the mean is larger than the median... it indicates that a group of applications required lengthy reviews." And that lag-time is just what the FDA hopes to hide.<p>

	The GAO also notes, "a large proportion of the applications have yet to be completed."  And as these pending applications are reviewed, the mean will increase.  The median, however, will stay the same -- a good thing for the FDA's image.<p>

	The genuinely relevant numbers show that the rate of PMA approvals stayed roughly constant from 1989 to 1994, while the actual number of PMAs submitted dropped by 50%.  At the same time, the FDA got an 80% hike in funding and a 20%
gain in personnel.<p>

	Indeed, higher budgets (and greater power) seem to matter more to Kessler's FDA than saving lives.  One reform before Congress is to allow "third party review," a watered-down version of Europe's drug-approval system.  This would let drug and device makers pay private, FDA-certified contractors to vet their
new products.  This would not change any FDA safety and efficacy criteria, and the agency would still determine final approval.<p>

	But Kessler said this "would perpetuate the kind of inappropriate and unproven medical practices that existed prior to 1962," when today's FDA was born.

<p>
	Yet the FDA itself experimented with a third-party-review program a few years ago.  It declared the program a success, but then dropped it.  Why?  A few months later, Congress allowed the agency to charge user fees to drug firms for
speedier approvals.  It looks like the FDA just wants the extra money for
itself.<p>

	The FDA's bitter, dishonest stand against even modest reform is a disgrace. Kessler's actions show less concern for the health and safety of Americans than
for the health and safety of his bureaucratic base of power.

<H1>Nailed by FDA</H1>

<P><BR>
I started 1996 with two new experiences.  I had a close-up photograph taken of my big toe, and I had my first personal run-in with "drug lag" -- the delayed availability of new medical therapies due to Food and Drug Administration regulation.  Neither my toe nor my encounter was a pretty sight.  And while drug lag happens to be an issue that I've studied professionally for several years, this was getting personal.
	
<P>The photo session was in a dermatologist's office.  For the past eight years I have suffered from onychomycosis.  This is not a condition of pathological rhyming, but a fungal toenail infection.  Onychomycosis is not a serious disease, but over time mine grew from a minor irritation to a major discomfort.  Itchy red patches sprouted randomly on the skin of my feet, like some poison ivy board game.  My toenails turned into thick misshapen growths that could only be trimmed with an acetylene torch; my kids would actually steer clear of me while swimming for fear of getting cut by a wayward foot.
	
<P>For seven years my onychomycosis stayed confined to my feet.  Then a year ago, perhaps out of boredom, it popped up on my hand.  First a fingernail, then some scaly patches on a palm, then another fingernail.  The handwriting was on the hand -- I could either go the Michael Jackson glove route, or I could seek medical treatment.

<P>But for many years the treatment options were not very promising, which is one reason why I had put off going to a doctor for so long.  Fungal nail infections are impervious to the various creams and ointments used to treat skin infections.  An oral medication, griseofulvin, required a lengthy course of treatment, with many side effects and a high recurrence rate.  Nail removal followed by topical treatment was another possibility.  But my wife had once had a fingernail removed, and she thought the pain of childbirth compared favorably with that experience; I wasn't about go through a dozen such procedures.  
	
<P>Then, several months ago, full-page newspaper and magazine ads began to appear for a new oral drug, Janssen Pharmaceutica's Sporanox.  The ads carried spitting images of my own grubby digits and promised to help me (and 10 million other sandal-challenged Americans) "KICK toenail fungus."  
	
<P>I had already read about Sporanox in the medical trade press.  It sounded good, but another new drug, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals' Lamisil, sounded even better.  An article in the British Medical Journal called Lamisil "the treatment of choice".  The problem is, Lamisil in tablet form has not been approved by FDA.  Lamisil tablets are available in over seventy countries, but in the U.S. only Lamisil cream, great for fungal skin infections but useless for nails, has been approved. 
	
<P>My dermatologist also thought that Lamisil was the better drug, but even though he had helped conduct clinical trials of it, he couldn't treat me with it.  He, like I, was stuck in the waiting room of Dr. David Kessler, FDA Commissioner.
	
<P>Some knowledgeable acquaintances gave me the names of several Canadian pharmacies.  One Ontario store offered to ship Lamisil without any prescription at all; another said it would require an Ontario physician's prescription.  But my health insurer wouldn't cover Lamisil because of its unapproved status, even though its cost, at about $600 (U.S.) for a three month course of treatment, is 40% cheaper than that of Sporanox.  Nor would Sandoz let me have it under some FDA exemption; one company spokesman could only suggest that I "call back in July; maybe it will be approved by then."  
<P>Or maybe not.
	
<P>In some ways my griping seems petty.  My ailment is relatively minor, the drug of choice is available from a friendly neighboring nation with little hassle and at a bearable, though steep, cost, and I have plenty of time to make a decision. 
	
<P>But what if I hadn't known to ask about Lamisil?  What if I couldn't afford it without insurance coverage?  Most importantly, what if I had something really serious? 
	
<P>Millions of Americans do; for many of them, the treatments of choice are unavailable in the country they call home.  In a poll of oncologists that my organization conducted last August, over 60% stated that their treatment of patients had been impaired at least once by FDA approval delays; over one in ten stated that this problem occurs frequently.  In the words of one physician at New York's St. Vincent's Hospital, "We are a third world nation when it comes to development of cancer drugs, AIDS drugs, and other drugs for people with life threatening diseases."  The situation for medical devices is no better; Dr. Joel J. Nobel, founder of ECRI, the world's foremost medical device testing organization, states: "Regulators elsewhere in the world wonder if the U.S. has gone mad."
	
<P>If this is the best that FDA can do for really important therapies, then it's not about to roll out the red carpet for a toenail medication.
	
<P>Why, I wonder, shouldn't my doctor's recommendation suffice for me to obtain Lamisil in the U.S.?  Commissioner Kessler claims that "if members of our society were empowered to make their own decisions... then the whole rationale for [FDA] would cease to exist."   Does Dr. Kessler think so little of his agency -- that if its medical evaluations were not backed up by its legal power, they would have no persuasive weight for "empowered" adults?
	
<P>I have decided to try Sporanox first; it's covered by insurance, and I'm not all that keen about getting into the drug importing business.  If Sporanox doesn't work for me, then perhaps Lamisil, approved or unapproved, will.  But regardless of how my nails eventually turn out, I'll always have one special finger reserved for FDA.

<H3>New Poll Boosts Institute Charges that ATF Fosters Public Ignorance</H3><P>

WASHINGTON, DC November 6, 1995&#151;CEI today releases a poll showing that over half
the American public does not know about the cardiovascular benefits of moderate
alcohol consumption.  The poll comes six months after CEI petitioned the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to lift its ban on mentioning this issue in
alcohol labelling and advertising.  ATF has taken no action on this petition.<p>
<p>
<b>CEI will hold a press conference Monday,  November 6, 10:30 AM at 1001
Connecticut Ave., NW (building entrance on K Street.)  Suite 1250. </b><p>
The connection between moderate alcohol consumption and reduced heart disease
risk is supported by a wide body of medical research, and has been noted in
publications ranging from the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> to
<i>Consumer Reports</i>.  According to the new poll, which involved telephone
interviews with 1,000 registered voters conducted in late October, only 41.7%
of adults know about this medical evidence.  Research indicates that the
benefits of moderate consumption can be obtained from all alcoholic
beverages&#151;wine, beer and spirits.  However, the poll found that only 9.7%
of the public knows this.  Of those polled who knew about the connection
between moderate alcohol consumption and reduced risk of heart disease, half
thought it applied only to wine or to red wine.<p>
<p>
On May 9, CEI petitioned ATF to permit alcohol beverage labels to carry this
statement: &#147;There is significant evidence that moderate consumption of
alcoholic beverages may reduce the risk of heart disease.&#148;  ATF has yet to
issue a response.<p>
<p>
CEI General Counsel <A HREF="sam.html">Sam Kazman</A> stated: &#147;This poll indicates that only one
in ten Americans knows the facts about moderate alcohol consumption.  ATF is
directly responsible for fostering this state of ignorance  with a policy that
flatly violates the First Amendment.&#148;<p>

<H2>Clinton's Stealth BTU Tax</H2>
<P>
<A HREF="/staff/adler.html">Jonathan H. Adler</A>, October 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>
The centerpiece of President Bill Clinton's first budget proposal was a
massive energy tax.  The tax on BTUs (or "British Thermal Units") was
estimated to cost approximately $30 billion per year, or over $300 per
family of four. Some economists predicted that it would eliminate over
one-half million jobs.  Had it been enacted, Clinton's BTU tax would have
made it more expensive to heat a home, cook a meal and drive to work.  Such
a proposal hardly fit the Clinton ideal of "putting people first." 

<P>Of course the energy tax was not just about raising money for federal
coffers.  It was designed to help save the planet too.  "We support the
energy tax not simply as a revenue raiser, and not even primarily as a
revenue raiser," explained then-Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Laura
D'Andrea Tyson. "It is primarily an energy conservation measure," she said.
Vice President Al Gore proclaimed that the energy tax "reduces pollution,
promotes energy efficiency, and helps us become more independent from
foreign oil."  Environmental activists cheered the President's bold move and
lined up to support the measure, despite its massive cost.

<P>Given its onerous impact, it should be no surprise that the BTU tax was a
political nonstarter.  Within days of Clinton's announcement, Senators from
both parties made it clear that they would not support such a tax.  The
White House was forced to settle for a 4.3 cent tax on gasoline and other
transportation fuels  --  far below what many administration officials,
including Gore, reportedly wanted.   In fact, many administration officials
simply believe that taxing energy is the right thing to do.  "We should be
looking at taxing the things we do not want to have happen: pollution and
excessive use of energy," said Alice Rivlin, Clinton's former budget
director who now sits on the Federal Reserve Board.  Before her appointment, Rivlin advocated a one-dollar hike in the gas tax.

<P>Energy tax proponents may get a second chance. This year, on July 17,
Undersecretary of State Tim Wirth pledged that the United States would lead
the charge toward "verifiable and binding" emission reductions in order to
prevent global warming caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases.
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions requires, in particular, cuts in carbon
dioxide emissions.   This, in turn, entails reducing the consumption of
energy.  Speaking in Geneva, Wirth said the world must "take urgent action"
or face the possibility of environmental armageddon.

<P>While a controversy continues to rage over the reliability of global climate
predictions, Wirth is insistent that the time to act is now.  This should be
no surprise, for Wirth has advocated dramatic action to avert global warming
for quite some time.  In 1988, he said that "What we've got to do in energy
conservation is to try to  ride the global warming  issue. Even if the
theory of  global warming  is wrong, to have approached  global warming  as
if it is real means energy conservation, so we will be doing the right thing
anyway in terms of economic policy and environmental policy."  Though Wirth
cited recent scientific developments as the reason for this year's policy
change, it is clear that science is not the basis for Wirth's insistence on
reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.

<P>Greenhouse gas emission reductions will not happen by themselves.  They will
have to be forced.  An energy tax  --  possibly in the form of a tax on the
carbon content of fossil fuels  --  is a favored method.  Thus, without saying
it, Wirth signaled that a new energy tax proposal will be on the table in a
second Clinton term. 

<P>Many economists argue that an energy tax would be the most economically
efficient means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the United States,
particularly when compared to regulatory alternatives such as automotive
fuel economy standards.  Yet that does not mean energy taxes are cheap.  Far
from it.

<P>Stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels over the next fifteen
years  --  a modest first step according to most global warming alarmists  -- 
would require a tax of more than $100 per metric ton of carbon, or its
equivalent.  Industry economists estimate that such a tax would cost
approximately $200 billion per year, or well over $2,000 per household.
Reducing emissions by an additional 20 percent, as proposed by Germany,
could more than double the costs of stabilization, says Gary Yohe, an
economist at Wesleyan University.  Even were the taxes offset by
corresponding cuts in income taxes, the new levy would crimp economic
growth.  Yohe suggests that the imposition of energy taxes on this scale
would feel like the energy crisis all over again.

<P>Industry would take a pounding.  Energy intensive sectors of the economy,
including mining, chemical production, and paper, would be particularly hard
hit.  This has some labor unions, such as the United Mine Workers, worried.
"We're looking at 10,000 jobs lost and the extinction of the UMW," the
union's Eugene Trisko told <I>The Washington Post</I>.

<P>Yet the burdens on industry are only the tip of the iceberg.  An energy tax
would raise the price of heating a family home, going to work, visiting
family and friends, and buying groceries.  In short, an energy tax would
impact everything.

<P>Of course energy taxes are not the only option.  Similar reductions in
greenhouse gas emissions could be achieved through a 1970s-style rationing
system. Such an approach might even incorporate tradable emission permits.
Imposing quotas on utilities and fuel suppliers could reduce emissions
without directly taxing consumers. Yet the effect on energy prices would be
the same.

<P>Must global warming policies be so costly?  Environmental groups once
claimed that energy conservation and a shift to alternative energy sources
(wind, hydro, etc.) could generate emission reductions at minimal cost. Some
even said that stopping global warming could generate a profit!  But few
still inhabit that fantasy land. 

<P>Universal adoption of off-the-shelf conservation technologies might generate
some savings, but not much.  If energy conservation is so wonderfully
profitable, there is no need to cry "global warming" at a crowded
international conference to get conservation measures adopted.  In fact,
environmental lobbyists should be able to quit their jobs, start energy
consulting businesses, receive royalties from their clients' cost savings,
and finance environmental activism.  Of course, that would mean that
conservation investments would have to compete in the real marketplace.
Energy conservation can only go so far.  Ultimately, there is no getting
around the fact that "verifiable and binding" emission reductions will
impose significant costs, economic and otherwise. 

<P>Senate Democrats do not appear any more enthusiastic about an energy tax now
than they did when Clinton first proposed one in 1993.  On July 17, six
Democratic Senators sent a letter to the President holding that "it is
premature for the United States to agree" to binding emission reduction
targets because such a policy would result in "significant economic
penalties and dislocations (e.g. job losses, reduced international
competitiveness and diminished economic productivity)."

<P>The Clinton Administration disavows any effort to hamstring the U.S. economy
or, indeed, to impose any policy that might hurt someone, somewhere, at some
time.  At a recent Senate hearing, Wirth pledged that "We would not...
agree to anything that would disadvantage our industry and disadvantage our
economic situation."  Then again, they probably said the same thing about
their energy tax in 1993.

<H1>THE ECONOMIC FALLACIES OF DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT</H1>
by Matthew C. Hoffman

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Recent years have seen the emergence of Demand-Side Management (DSM), a new
approach to the electricity utility planning process.  Through DSM programs,
utilities endeavor to diminish ratepayer demand to avoid supply costs and
capacity expansion.  Such programs typically encourage ratepayers to adopt
energy efficient lighting, heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems,
additional heat insulation, and other energy-saving investments, offering
partial or total subsidies for purchase and installation.  As an inducement,
shareholder-owned utilities are permitted to recover their DSM capital
investments and revenue losses by raising their rates.<p>
<p>
	DSM is premised on the notion that the self-interest of individuals is in
conflict with their behavior: Despite the availability of numerous
cost-effective energy efficiency investments, consumers have failed to adopt
them. <p>
<p>
	DSM theory classifies this apparent paradox as a species of &#147;market
failure.&#148;  In this view, the market imperfectly disseminates information
about the profitability of energy efficiency investments.  However, this
paradox may result from overestimation of the benefits of energy efficiency
investments.  In particular, DSM overestimates the benefits of energy
efficiency investments by:<p>
<UL>

<LI>only comparing investment options to the exclusion of other relevant choices
faced by energy consumers;  <p>
<LI>neglecting the non-monetary cost components of investments, including
transaction costs, measurement and evaluation costs, the risks and
uncertainties associated with the investment, its quality of service, and
others which often exceed the investment price of the asset significantly; and
<p>
<LI>ignoring the fact that true costs and benefits cannot be measured, since they
are subjectively experienced by individuals and therefore cannot be discerned
by external observers.  <p>
</UL>
Thus, the perceived market failure may be more accurately attributed to
overestimation of the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency improvements
rather than the failure of energy markets.<p>
<p>
	The enormous informational obstacles (i.e., the inability to accurately
measure costs and benefits) faced by DSM users raises an important question:
Why, given such glaring flaws, is it being attempted on such a grand scale?
The answer may be found in the incentives which confront the 
utilities, their larger commercial and industrial customers, their PUCs,
purveyors of energy efficient technologies, environmental activists, and other
DSM proponents. <p>
<p>
	DSM may more properly be seen as an attempt by various interested parties to
extract rents from others.  For instance:<p>

<UL>
<LI> Energy utilities see DSM as a means to improve their financial condition.  <p>

<LI> The PUC is able to distort its own performance, making it less accountable to
those who appoint the commissioners, and ultimately to the public at large.  <p>

<LI> Environmentalists see DSM as a way to connect the economic interest of
utilities to the realization of their own ideological goals, which include a
dramatic reduction in fossil fuel consumption and the consequent pollution.  <p>
<LI>Large commercial and industrial utility customers are subsidized, which allow
them to invest in energy efficiency at the ratepayer&#146;s expense.  <p>
<LI> DSM theorists, consultants and planners have made a cottage industry of DSM
planning.  They do not wish to see their jobs eliminated.  <p>
<LI> Producers of energy efficient technologies benefit enormously from the
inflated demand for their products.  These are all natural supporters of DSM
and other subsidy schemes.<p>
</UL>

	In its current form, DSM would be impossible without the monopoly power of the
utility, which allows it to raise rates and cross-subsidize DSM program
participants.  In recent years industrial power consumers are beginning to
demand access to the wholesale electricity market, bypassing the monopoly
utility.  This process is known as &#147;retail wheeling&#148; and would render
most DSM programs impossible.<p>
<p>
	DSM is flawed both in theory and practice.  Its theoretical foundation rests
on the discredited theories of central economic planning, which presume that
governmental and quasi-governmental institutions have the knowledge and
incentives to economize on behalf of individuals.<p>
<p>
	DSM&#146;s success can be effectively explained with a public choice model
that understands it as a &#147;racket,&#148; or a scheme to enable rent-seeking
on the part of special interests.  It is largely opposed by commercial and
industrial ratepayers, which seek to reduce its cross-subsidization effects and
clear the way for competitive electricity markets.  The outcome of that
struggle will ultimately determine the fate of DSM, as well as the nature of
the electricity industry in the United States.<p>

<H2>Electricity Competition</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>The nation&#146;s electricity system is currently dominated by local,
regulated monopolies.  This should change.  An &#147;electricity
superhighway&#148; now links utility customers with hundreds of power
producers.  Consumers should have direct access to this network.  Direct access
would enable consumers to pick electric utilities the way they can now pick
long distance telephone service.   Moreover, consumers would no longer be
forced to subsidize wasteful utility &#147;conservation&#148; programs that
benefit some utility consumers at the expense of others.  States have the
authority to allow for direct consumer access within their borders and many are
moving aggressively in that direction.  National competition in electricity
markets at the wholesale level is now being!  implemented by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC).<p>
	Utilities already have access to the &#147;electricity superhighway.&#148;
Because most utilities have been granted a local monopoly by government, they
can charge what are often exorbitant rates and deny their patrons access to the
wholesale and retail electricity markets. Giving consumers access to the grid
or allowing competition in transmission would reduce rates dramatically, saving
homeowners and businesses hundreds of billions of dollars and eliminating the
need for a cumbersome regulatory bureaucracy to oversee the industry.<p>
	The wholesale electricity market, which has existed in limited form since the
1920s, is made possible by a national network of transmission lines connecting
utilities, wholesale electricity producers, and utility customers to one
another. Power producers use the system to trade electricity with one another
in a diverse and vibrant wholesale market, free of the cost-of-service
regulation imposed on retail consumers. Allowing utility customers to use the
same system would liberate them from regulation and give them the same market
options their utilities enjoy.<p>
	Utilities oppose retail competition for obvious reasons: Substantial
investments in power plants and equipment will be rendered obsolete by
competition from leaner, more efficient generators.  As a &#147;price&#148; for
competition, utilities are demanding reimbursement for these &#147;stranded
costs.&#148;  Law makers should oppose such transfers of wealth from captive
customers to monopoly utilities and their shareholders.  Many <i>efficient</i>
utilities &#151; as opposed to poorly managed ones &#151; oppose the awarding
of stranded cost surcharges on the competitive grid.  No customer owes this
kind of obligation to any seller, in any event.<p>
	Unfortunately, even some environmental groups have joined utilities in
opposing reform of the electricity system.  Environmental activists are seeking
to preserve Demand-Side Management (DSM) programs administered by the
utilities. Through DSM programs, utilities increase their rates in order to pay
for energy conservation programs that only benefit a select portion of
ratepayers.  State regulators give privately-owned utilities various incentives
to administer the programs. Ratepayers are often entirely unaware of the
existence of this scheme, which costs them billions annually. <p>
	A competitive electricity system would render inefficient energy conservation
programs obsolete.  Conservation investments that could not pay for themselves
through increased efficiency would be jettisoned as utilities were forced to
compete for customers by offering lower prices.  The result would be dramatic
savings for consumers and increased efficiency within the electricity
industry.<p>

<i>Q:  Why should we abandon a proven system of public oversight and regulation
of electric utility monopolies in favor of the uncertainties of a competitive
system?</i><p>

A:  Competition has repeatedly proven itself superior to government regulation.
Only in a free market will producers have incentives to satisfy the demands of
a varied clientele. The current system of command-and-control regulation of
utility monopolies disregards consumer choice, and virtually eliminates
incentives for electricity producers to innovate and cut costs. In a free
market, producers would be immediately accountable to power consumers, who
would have the option to switch providers if the current one proves
unsatisfactory.<p>

<i>Q:  How much would competition in electricity markets reduce prices for
consumers?</i><p>

A:  The U.S. spends about $200 billion annually on electricity.  The consumer
savings from electricity competition would vary from community to community.
In some parts of the country, electricity bills would decline by as much as 50
percent.<p>

<i>Q:  If direct access eliminates DSM programs, will it be bad for the
environment? </i><p>

A:  Efficiency is a friend of the environment.  By encouraging greater
efficiency within the electricity industry, competition will also spur
utilities to develop new and innovative methods of electricity generation that
produce more energy by using fewer resources, thereby lessening much of the
environmental impact of regulated electricity generation.<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>Q: Aren&#146;t DSM programs simply an efficient alternative to building new
power plants?</i><p>
<p>
A: Proponents of DSM often argue that utilities should compare the cost of
constructing new power plants to the cost of avoiding the construction of a new
plant by reducing their customers&#146; electricity demand. If the latter is
less expensive, then clearly it is the optimal choice. Unfortunately, DSM
programs are no longer used as a less-expensive alternative to power plant
construction, which would lower electricity rates for all consumers. Instead,
DSM programs apply a &#147;surcharge&#148; to rates, raising them to pay for
energy-efficiency subsidies. DSM is not an efficient alternative to power plant
construction &#151; it is a system of taxation and redistribution.

<H2>Energy Taxes</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Congress should not impose an energy tax of any kind.  Neither a broad-based
energy tax, such as the &#147;Btu tax&#148; or carbon tax, nor an increased
gasoline tax should be used for deficit reduction or environmental protection.
<p>
	Energy taxes would weaken U.S. industry and destroy jobs.  America enjoys an
abundance of energy sources, and as a result the U.S. economy abounds with
energy-intensive industries, from petrochemicals to timber.  Taxing energy will
hurt these industries and compromise America&#146;s competitiveness.  In 1992,
Pittsburgh&#146;s CONSAD Research Corporation estimated that a proposed carbon
tax would destroy 600,000 jobs over an 8-year period.  Other studies have
confirmed that imposing a tax on energy would have dire economic
consequences.<p>
	Moreover, a tax on energy would increase consumer prices and have a general
inflationary impact.  Taxing energy would increase the costs of producing raw
materials and transporting goods, in addition to the costs of heating and
maintaining family homes.  This economic impact would be felt by every
American, particularly the least fortunate.  Energy taxes and other policies
that raise prices have the most pernicious effect on those with fixed incomes.
Also, fuel taxes tend to hit hardest motorists in low-density rural areas
&#151; areas least affected by pollution.<p>
	Some claim that higher energy taxes, by restricting consumption, will promote
efficiency and protect the environment.  These claims are false.  Raising the
price of energy would certainly result in reduced energy use.  However, energy
<i>conservation</i> &#151; using less energy &#151; is not necessarily the same
as energy <i>efficiency</i> &#151; using less energy to produce the same or
higher level of goods.  Energy is used, after all, for a purpose.  If that
purpose is valuable, then taxing energy will just hinder the production of
valuable goods and services.<p>
	Energy taxes may of course impel businesses to adopt new technologies and so
become more energy-efficient.  But <i>energy</i> efficiency is not necessarily
the same as <i>economic</i> efficiency.  The investments businesses make in
response to energy taxes represent resources that cannot be used to develop new
products, raise wages, create jobs, or make other, more urgently-needed
efficiency enhancements.  Attempts by government to force businesses to
&#147;save&#148; energy are inherently wasteful.<p>
	Energy taxes cannot be justified on environmental grounds either.  Energy
taxes are at best a crude and unreliable method of curbing pollution.  Energy
use is not a reliable indicator of pollution created.  For example, two
different automobiles will produce different levels of emissions from the same
amount of gasoline.  Taxing energy is not the same thing as taxing pollution.<p>
	A tax on energy is a tax on the lifeblood of an industrial economy.  Such a
tax is regressive in nature, and cannot be justified on either economic or
environmental grounds.<p>

<i>Q:  Isn&#146;t it true that Europeans pay more in gas taxes than
Americans?</i><p>

A:  Yes, but Europe also has a higher population density and few wide-open
expanses equivalent to those spanning the American West.  These factors reduce
per capita energy consumption, and the economic impact of higher energy prices.
Hauling goods from Frankfurt to Berlin is hardly the same as from St. Louis to
Seattle.  The U.S. transports over 3.7 trillion ton-kilometers of inland
freight annually.  This is more than ten times the amount shipped in Germany
and over five times that transported in the United Kingdom, Italy, France,
Spain, Belgium and Denmark combined.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  The U.S. contains only 5 percent of the world&#146;s population, yet
accounts for approximately 25 percent of energy use.  Moreover, America uses 10
percent to 25 percent more energy per unit of output than many other industrial
nations.  Doesn&#146;t this mean the U.S. is energy inefficient?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  Several factors make it reasonable for Americans to use more energy than
people in Western Europe and Japan.  America has more abundant energy
resources, so energy tends to be less expensive here.  America has a lower
population density, so we must consume more energy for transportation.
Americans have 50 percent to 80 percent more living space, per capita, than do
Europeans, and 250 percent more than do the Japanese.  Larger domiciles require
more energy to heat and cool.  More living space also means more and larger
household appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines.  Europeans and
Japanese use significantly more energy than do Africans and Latin Americans.
Does this make Europe and Japan energy inefficient?  To enjoy the benefits of
economic progr! ess and prosperity is not necessarily to &#147;waste&#148;
energy.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Won&#146;t energy taxes help prevent the depletion of fossil
fuels?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  The world is in no danger of running out of fossil fuels.  Political
pundits and policy analysts have predicted impending energy shortages for
years, without ever having these projections materialize.  For example, in 1970
the International Energy Agency claimed that the world&#146;s proven oil
reserves of 645 billion barrels would be depleted in the mid-1980s, yet by 1990
world oil reserves had actually increased to 1 trillion barrels.  Proven oil
reserves are more a function of market prices and extraction technologies than
they are of actual underground supplies.  As knowledge increases, so do proven
reserves.  The most recent estimates place the world&#146;s oil supply at
several hundred years.  Energy taxes, by discouraging consumption without
augmenting the profit margins of energy producers, actually discourage the
exploration and recovery of fossil fuels.

<H2>Environmental Politics Are Politics Nonetheless</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Nobel economist George Stigler once joked that choosing government
regulation on the assumption of &#147;market failure&#148; is like an opera
audition in which you reject the first singer before you hear the second one.
Most environmental problems result from the abuses and wastefulness endemic to
open-access, common-property resource systems, not from private property rights
and markets.   Yet even if shortcomings in our market economy were the primary
cause of environmental problems, it would not necessarily follow that
government can provide sensible solutions.  Political arrangements are also far
from perfect.  The relevant test for policymakers is not whether markets are
perfect but whether they perform better or worse than legislative mandates and
bureaucratic controls.<p>
	Although most Americans recognize that politics have a lot to do with the
pursuit of power, privilege, and special interest, there is a general
presumption that environmental politics are different.  When it comes to the
environment, we take it for granted that laws are what they seem, that the
legislators who enact those laws and the bureaucrats who implement them are
earnestly struggling to protect public interests and that these laws and rules
will be enforced in a fair and sensible manner.  Far more often than is
commonly realized, however, the purpose and effect of environmental regulation
is to serve narrow political and economic interests, not environmental
objectives.<p>
	The details of environmental policy have major economic consequences.  Thus
when environmental policies are framed and implemented, economic interests
lobby and litigate and make alliances with environmental organizations to
ensure favorable treatment for their own industries or companies.  Several
major environmental programs contain traditional &#147;pork-barrel&#148;
programs wrapped in green packaging or special-interest protections designed to
tilt the economic playing field in a particular direction.  Many environmental
programs do more to line the pockets of special interests than they do to
protect the planet.<p>
<UL>
<LI>	To placate agricultural interests the Clinton administration proposed
guaranteeing ethanol, a corn-based fuel, 30 percent of a lucrative fuel
additive market under the <A HREF="/ebb/cleanair.html">Clean Air Act</A> Amendments of 1990.  Had it not been
invalidated by a federal court, this move (which was opposed by groups ranging
from Consumer Alert to the Sierra Club to the American Petroleum Institute)
would have cost consumers between $48 million and $350 million per year.  Even
EPA officials acknowledged the proposal would do little, if anything for the
environment.  This program is itself only a small part of alternative fuel
subsidies and set-asides that could cost consumers as much as $3 billion each
year.<A HREF="#1"><sup>1</sup></A> <p>

<LI>	Of the first $8 billion ostensibly spent for toxic waste cleanup under
<A HREF="/ebb/suprfund.html">Superfund</A>, the biggest federal environmental program, the lion&#146;s share
ended up in the pockets of lawyers and consultants.  These &#147;transaction
costs,&#148; which include administative overhead, consume &#147;35 percent of
corporate Superfund expenditures, 88 percent of insurance company Superfund
expenditures, and 50 percent of public Superfund
expenditures.&#148;<A HREF="#2"><sup>2</sup></A> As a result, cleanup at Superfund sites has
proceeded at a snail&#146;s pace; After 15 years, only 108 of the 1,219
landfills and chemical dumps on EPA&#146;s priority list have been cleaned up
and deleted from the list.<A HREF="#3"><sup>3</sup></A><p>

<LI>	Aside from lawyers and consultants, the principal beneficiaries of Superfund
have been environmental organizations and waste treatment companies.  In the
mid-1980s, a coalition of those groups lobbied successfully to expand the
number of Superfund sites and mandate use of the most expensive cleanup
methods.  They even succeeded in blocking measures aimed at reducing the
production of hazardous waste!<A HREF="#4"><sup>4</sup></A><p>

<LI>	<A HREF="/ebb/cleanair.html">The Clean Air Act</A> of 1970 allowed utilities to choose whatever means they
considered most cost-effective in meeting federal requirements to limit sulfur
dioxide emissions.  The 1977 Amendments put an end to this sensible policy
after producers of high-sulfur coal lobbied to require set emission reductions
irrespective of the initial amount of emissions being produced.  This made it
too expensive to use cleaner-burning, low-sulfur coal.  The result was not only
to perpetuate large-scale use of dirtier coal, but also to raise consumer costs
by forcing many utilities to install scrubbers, even when using low-sulfur coal
would have provided the same environmental benefit.<A HREF="#5"><sup>5</sup></A><p>
</UL>
	<P>Also, let&#146;s not forget that bureaucrats have their own organizational
interests, which do not automatically coincide with the public interest.  A
1987 survey of EPA officials found little correlation between the
officials&#146; judgments as to which areas merited most attention and what the
agency actually did.<A HREF="#6"><sup>6</sup></A> In part, these skewed priorities result from
the political nature of the budget process.  To enlarge its share of federal
resources, EPA has not been above sensationalizing environmental risks such as
asbestos in schools, radon in homes, and pesticide residues on food.  When
environmental protection is political, it is bound to be distorted by fads,
careerism, and greed, while being simultaneously insulated from the market
disciplines that correct for such failings in private firms.  In this respect,
politics is politics, even if you paint it green.<p>
	
The lesson for policymakers?  Don&#146;t assume that every measure proposed or
adopted in the name of the environment will actually advance environmental
goals.  All too often, environmental regulation &#151; like many policies
enacted by the federal government &#151; is regulation of, by, and for special
interests.<p><br>

<H2>The Need for Environmental Reform</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>This year Americans will spend well over $150 billion complying with
environmental laws, according to an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
estimate.<A HREF="#1"><sup>1</sup></A>  As of 1993, local governments were forced to implement
over 400 &#147;essential&#148; regulations imposed by the EPA.<A HREF="#2"><sup>2</sup></A>
Property owners will be told that they are unable to build on
&#147;wetlands,&#148; sometimes as small as ping pong tables, and that if their
land is habitat for an endangered species, their use of it must cease until
they have secured the federal government&#146;s okay.<A HREF="#3"><sup>3 </sup></A>   Consumer
products will be more expensive as corporations attempt to pass along the
increased costs of environmental compliance, and the development of new
technologies will be frustrated by complex permitting rules that often favor
the polluting technologies of old over the cleaner technologies of tomorrow.
<p>
	This state of affairs created the so-called &#147;environmental backlash&#148;
which fueled environmental reform efforts in the 103rd and 104th Congresses.
Property rights and unfunded mandates were rallying cries in the last election
cycle, and maintain their political salience today.  While most people support
the cause of environmental protection, many Americans are dissatisfied with
current policies and demanding change.<p>
	Given the tremendous costs, economic and otherwise, imposed by environmental
regulation in this country, it is reasonable to ask: What are we getting for
all this? Is it really worth the cost? And, most importantly, is there a better
way?  To be sure, there have been real successes in environmental protection
over the past three decades, and federal government regulation may deserve some
share of the credit. For example, lead was banned from gasoline, reducing
ambient lead levels and the threat posed to childhood development.  This was a
significant environmental success achieved at relatively modest cost.  The
Cuyahoga River in Ohio no longer catches fire as it once did and emissions of
air pollutants are down substantially.<p>
	Yet simply because federal environmental programs may have achieved some good
does not mean that they are good programs.  The first generation of
environmental measures were relatively easy; the needed changes were obvious.
Even the most clumsy of regulations could have grabbed such low-hanging
fruit.<p>
	Today, however, the best means for achieving environmental gains are less than
clear.  Environmental rules impose billions of dollars in costs for minimal
benefits.  For instance, the EPA&#146;s hazardous waste listing of certain
wood-treating chemicals will impose over five <i>trillion</i> dollars in costs
before it saves one hypothetical life, according to the Office of Management
and Budget.<A HREF="#4"><sup>4</sup></A> Challenging existing environmental programs and
priorities is not anti-environment.  There is little to be gained from forcing
yet another round of emission reductions from new automobiles or adding 25 more
substances to the list of drinking water contaminants.  Moreover, as
environmental measures become more complex and difficult, the unintended
consequences of environmental regulation become that much more severe.  <p>
	Consider just a few examples:<p>
<UL>
<LI>	Conservationist Bill Ellen of Maryland was sentenced to six months in a
federal penitentiary for creating duck ponds on privately-owned
wetlands.<A HREF="#5"><sup>5</sup></A><p>

<LI>	Homeowners in Riverside County, California, were prevented from clearing
firebreaks to protect their own homes because the federal government feared it
would disturb habitat of the endangered Stephens&#146; Kangaroo Rat.  After
fire swept through the area in 1993, 29 homes and much of the habitat were
lost.<A HREF="#6"><sup>6</sup></A><p>

<LI>	In 1993, the State of Ohio was required to test for 52 different <A HREF="/ebb/pests.html">pesticides</A>
in water supplies under federal drinking water standards.  Yet two-thirds of
those pesticides have <i>never</i> been detected in Ohio waters, and there is
no reason to suspect that any of the others will ever be detected
there.<A HREF="#7"><sup>7</sup></A><p>

<LI>	Johns Hopkins University was sued by the federal government to contribute to
a five-million-dollar <A HREF="/ebb/suprfund.html">Superfund</A> cleanup because the University once owned three
electrical transformers that were later sold to a company whose property
eventually became a Superfund site, even though the University sold the
transformers before Superfund was enacted and there is no evidence that the
transformers contributed to the pollution at the site.<A HREF="#8"><sup>8</sup></A> <p>
</UL>
	<P>These examples are startling, but they are only part of the story.  The sad
fact is that just as environmental regulations impose costs on people, they
impose costs on environmental values as well. It is an unpleasant reality that
environmental regulation can be as cruel to the ecology as it can be to the
economy.  Consider:<p>
<UL>
<LI>	At an abandoned chemical factory in Arkansas, EPA regulations require the
incineration of dioxin-contaminated wastes.  Yet because the incinerator is not
capable of meeting the EPA&#146;s destruction standard, the incinerator
produces two barrels of dioxin-contaminated ash for every barrel that is
incinerated.  This ash cannot be landfilled under federal law, so instead it
sits in a $300,000 storage facility in perpetuity.<A HREF="#9"><sup>9</sup></A><p>

<LI>	When an <A HREF="/ebb/esa.html">endangered species</A> is found on private land, the owner of that land
may lose the right to use it as he or she sees fit.  This means that landowners
can actually be punished for creating habitat, and some have.  This policy
creates a strong, perverse incentive <i>against</i> the protection of imperiled
wildlife on private land.<A HREF="#10"><sup>10</sup></A>  Indeed, common wisdom in some areas is
that the safest response to the discovery of a rare species on one&#146;s land
is to &#147;shoot, shovel and shut up.&#148;<p>

<LI>	Hazardous waste permitting regulations were intended to encourage the
recycling and reuse of hazardous materials so they are not disposed of in
landfills.  Yet in practice they often achieve the opposite. These rules are
often so expensive, time-consuming, and complex, that it becomes more costly to
recycle than to simply ship the wastes away.  Indeed, hazardous waste rules
also discourage the increased use of environmental technologies and even
increase the cost of installing more energy efficient lighting as flourescent
light bulbs are classified as &#147;hazardous waste&#148; by the federal
government.<A HREF="#11"><sup>11</sup></A><p>

<LI>	Excessive <A HREF="/ebb/suprfund.html">Superfund</A> liability rules discourage the use of abandoned
industrial sites for new industrial development.  It is simply too risky and
expensive for companies to site facilities in these so-called
&#147;brownfields.&#148;  Instead, companies increasingly site new facilities
in pristine or undeveloped areas.  The result is that America&#146;s industrial
&#147;footprint&#148; expands to cover a greater portion of the
landscape.<A HREF="#12"><sup>12</sup></A><p>
</UL>
	<P>The problem lies in the overall approach to environmental policy.  The general
assumption among environmental policymakers today is that all environmental
problems require governmental regulation and control. Quite frankly, the United
States is attempting to produce environmental benefits in the same way that the
former Soviet Union attempted to produce wheat &#151; through government
command and control of all relevant resources.  This produces some
environmental improvements, just as the Soviet Union produced some wheat.  But
both approaches inevitably fail to meet the demands placed upon them.  Economic
central planning failed miserably. Ecological central planning, a far more
difficult task, will fare no better.  America&#146;s ecological nightmares have
been the former Soviet nations&#146; environmental realities.<A HREF="#13"><sup>13</sup></A>
Government control is no more friendly to the planet than it is to its
people.<p>
	If more government control is not the answer, then what is?  The answer is a
greater reliance upon property rights and the marketplace.  Environmental
problems do not result because markets fail to incorporate environmental
values.  Rather they result from a failure to integrate environmental resources
into the market.  By encouraging a more efficient use of resources, responsible
stewardship, and technological innovation, the free market provides the basis
for a superior approach to environmental policy.<p>
	Reforming environmental policy will not be easy; policy revolutions are not
made overnight.  In the pursuit of reform, it is useful to adhere to a set of
principles &#151; principles that can guide reform efforts in a free-market
direction.  The following principles should guide reform
efforts:<A HREF="#14"><sup>14</sup></a><p>
<ul>
<LI> <B>Economic Growth Is a Vital Prerequisite for Environmental Progress
&#150;</b> A healthy economy is necessary to finance environmental
improvements.  Sewage treatment facilities and other environmental improvements
are not free.  Moreover, a significant body of literature has found a
correlation between economic improvements and several measures of environmental
quality. Not only are wealthier communities healthier than poorer communities,
on average, they tend to be more concerned about protecting environmental
values as well.<p>

<LI><b> The Federal Government Should Establish an Environmental Hippocratic Oath:
First, Do No Harm &#150; </b>Many government programs cause or encourage
environmental harm, including agricultural subsidies, corporate welfare
programs, and reclamation projects.  Often, this environmental harm is itself
the rationale for costly environmental regulation. Before the government
imposes mandates or restrictions on the private sector, it should make sure its
own house is in order and eliminate environmentally-destructive programs.  In a
similar vein, environmental policies aimed at reducing risks must not increase
other risks in the process.<p>

<LI><b>	Land and Natural Resources Are Best Managed by Private Stewards &#150;</b>
America has a proud conservation tradition demonstrating that private owners,
whether individuals, corporations or environmental groups, are superior land
and resource managers than political entities.  Rather than expanding
government ownership and regulation of threatened ecological resources, policy
makers should seek creative ways of expanding property-based institutions into
the ecological realm.<p>

<LI><b> State and Local Environmental Problems Should Be Dealt with by State and
Local Governments &#150;</b> Federalization of environmental law inevitably
results in &#147;one-size-fits-nobody&#148; regulations.  Too often, problems
that are properly handled at the local, state or regional level are handled by
the federal government; most environmental concerns are local in nature, and
can and should be addressed locally.  There is no reason to presume that all
environmental wisdom emanates from Washington, D.C.  Devolution of
responsibility and control will foster innovation, experimentation and
encourage the development of forward-looking environmental protection
strategies.<p>

<LI><b>	Remaining Federal Efforts Should Focus on Results not Regulations
&#150;</b> Central managers can no more efficiently manage the environmental
practices of thousands of commercial enterprises than they can manage dispersed
economic practices.  Insofar as federal regulation is necessary at all, it
should establish basic environmental goals and standards in order to protect
persons and their property, and allow private actors or local authorities to
determine how best to achieve the stated aims.<p>
<LI><b>	No Regulation Without Representation &#150; </b>Most environmental rules
are written by unelected bureaucrats in the executive branch.  This undermines
accountability and has encouraged excessive regulation at the expense of other
societal priorities.  It has also impeded the development of common-sense,
market-oriented approaches to environmental concerns.  No lawmaking regulation
should go into effect until it is affirmatively adopted by the legislature and
signed into law by the Executive.<p>

<LI><b>	Property Owners Should Be Compensated for Regulatory Takings &#150;</b> It
is simply unfair to require a few citizens to pay the full costs of providing
public goods, environmental or otherwise.  When landowners are denied the
reasonable use of their land in order to advance an environmental goal, they
should be compensated.  This is a basic question of justice.  Moreover, private
property is not the enemy of environmental protection, it lies at its
foundation.  Requiring compensation will encourage a greater reliance on
non-governmental conservation efforts, and further the cause of environmental
protection.<p>
</UL>
	<P>The case for comprehensive environmental reform should be clear.  Current
environmental laws frustrate the development of cleaner technologies, penalize
landowners for owning habitat, and fail to address the most significant
environmental risks.  Those institutions upon which free and prosperous
societies are built &#150; private property, voluntary exchange, freedom of
contract, rule of law &#150; will best provide for the protection of public
health and ecological values.  It is important to give them that chance.<p>

<H2>The True State of America&#146;s Environment</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Environmental lobbying organizations seem preoccupied with visions of
man-made ecological catastrophe.  Each year the Worldwatch Institute publishes
a <i>State of the World</i> report that purports to document the planet&#146;s
deteriorating environmental condition.  Michael Oppenheimer of the
Environmental Defense Fund compares the earth to a truck careening down a
highway about to plunge over rail and into the abyss.  On the basis of such
predictions policy makers are called upon to enact costly new regulatory
programs that can cause tremendous economic and social dislocations.<p>
	Yet while real environmental problems do exist, the earth, and more
specifically the United States, is a long way from catastrophe.  Indeed, in
most respects environmental trends are getting better, not worse, and in many
cases environmental regulations had little to do with it.  These facts are
documented in the Competitive Enterprise Institute&#146;s <A HREF="/trustate.html"><i>The True State of
the Planet</i></A>, edited by Ronald Bailey.<A HREF="#1"><sup>1</sup></A> Among the environmental
successes that should be celebrated are the following:<p>
<UL>
<LI>	In the United States ambient levels of sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide,
volatile organic compounds, atmospheric ozone and particulates in the air are
decreasing.<A HREF="#2"><sup>2</sup></A><p>

<LI>	Industrial pollution has been largely eliminated as a source of contamination
in most of America&#146;s rivers, lakes and streams.  Consequently, 95 percent
of the nation&#146;s rivers are considered fishable.<A HREF="#3"><sup>3</sup></A> <p>

<li>	The United States has achieved no net loss of wetlands; in fact, in the 1990s
more wetlands have been created than have been converted to other land-uses.
Every year the U.S. is gaining tens of thousands of acres of
wetlands.<A HREF="#4"><sup>4</sup></A><p>
<LI>	In the last fifty years, life expectancy at birth has increased by more than
a decade, and continues to increase.<A HREF="#5"><sup>5</sup></A><p>

<LI>	In the last forty years, the amount of cropland in production has declined by
40 million acres.  At the same time crop production per acre has more than
doubled.<A HREF="#6"><sup>6</sup></A><p>

<LI>	Over the last fifty years America has been the world&#146;s leading timber
producer.  During this period, total forest area remained stable and total
standing timber volume increased significantly.<A HREF="#7"><sup>7</sup></A><p>
</UL>
	<P>Many of the environmental concerns voiced by activists were, and continue to
be, overstated.  For example, while there is concern about the impact of
industrial chemicals on human health, pollution appears to account for less
than one percent of human cancer.  A recent study by the National Academy of
Sciences confirmed what many scientists have known for some time: synthetic
chemicals, such as pesticides, in the human diet are not a significant source
of cancer.<A HREF="#8"><sup>8</sup></A>  People are at a greater risk for cancer as a result of
unhealthy behavior, such as smoking or an unhealthy diet, than from industrial
pollution.<p>
	Environmental progress is important and should continue into the future.  One
of the greatest hopes for further environmental improvements is technological
advance.  Technological improvements reduce the environmental impact of
industrial production and lower the costs of maintaining a clean environment.
For example:<p>
<UL>
<LI>	Technological advances have greatly enhanced energy efficiency; energy
consumption per unit of gross domestic product has declined dramatically in
developed countries over the past twenty years.<A HREF="#9"><sup>9</sup></A><p>

<LI>	Using modern silvicultural techniques, the world&#146;s current industrial
wood needs can be met using only 5 percent of the world&#146;s total current
forestland.<A HREF="#10"><sup>10</sup></A><p>

<LI>	Modern agricultural methods, such as conservation tillage and no-till
farming, are capable of reducing soil erosion by 65 percent and 98 percent
respectively.<A HREF="#11"><sup>11</sup></A><p>
<LI>	Increased aquaculture production could lessen the pressures that encourage
overfishing; aquaculture production increased by over 60 percent between 1984
and 1991.<A HREF="#12"><sup>12</sup></A><p>
</UL>
	<P>It is well-documented that &#147;richer is cleaner.&#148;  As nations become
wealthier, there are more resources to devote to environmental concerns such as
air and water quality.<A HREF="#13"><sup>13</sup></A>  Moreover, economic growth finances the
development of advanced technologies that are more environmentally sensitive,
and market competition encourages greater efficiency in the use of material
inputs, thereby lessening the human impact on the natural world.  Finally, a
wealthier population is also more prone to concern for environmental
amenities.<p>
	
While apocalyptic scenarios are a staple of the environmental debate, the
global reality is not so alarming.  There are real environmental problems, but
few, if any, pose a threat to human civilization.  In those cases where
environmental concerns are real, the best thing concerned policy makers can do
to promote further environmental progress is encourage economic and
technological advance and the spread of free market institutions.<p>

<H2>Grazing Reform</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>The current approach to grazing on federal lands is bad for ranchers, bad for
the taxpayer, and bad for environmental protection.  The lack of secure
property rights has disadvantaged western ranchers and weakened the incentives
for effective land management.  Property-based reform of grazing on federal
lands is a necessity. <p>
	
Federal grazing lands are currently subject to the &#147;scientific
management&#148; paradigm.  Under this approach, the federal government
determines how all of its rangeland should be utilized, and establishes
detailed land management guidelines.<p>
	Under a property-based policy, the management of rangeland would not be
determined by a central government planner subject to influence by various
interest groups (ranchers, environmentalists, recreationists, etc.).  Rather,
land management decisions would be made by those who hold forage access rights.
All groups that wish to benefit from federal rangeland resources would have the
opportunity to do so through the purchase and trade of private rights.  Whereas
the current system is marred by conflict, under this free market regime,
rangeland management would be based upon voluntary transactions, ensuring a
more peaceful process and just outcome.<p>
	Free market grazing reform should be based upon the following principles:<p>
<UL>
<LI> Existing rangeland subsidies to <i>all</i> parties (ranchers, recreationists,
bureaucrats, etc.) should be phased out over time.  So long as the federal
government owns rangeland, such lands should be managed at zero net cost to the
taxpayer.<p>
<LI>	Existing &#147;forage access&#148; (grazing) permits should be recognized as
tradable private property rights owned by the existing permit holders,
providing security of tenure to ranchers, and increasing the incentives for
sustainable stewardship of the land.  These rights should be of indefinite
tenure, requiring the payment of compensation should the government seek to
terminate them or otherwise prevent their use.<p>
<LI>	All Americans should have an equal opportunity to purchase, hold, and use
rangeland &#147;forage access&#148; permits (grazing permits).  Current
restrictions on nonranching access to forage resources on federal lands,
including base property requirements, restrictions on subleasing, and
&#147;use-it-or-lose-it&#148; rules, should be eliminated.<p>
<LI>	Holders of &#147;forage access&#148; (grazing) permits should have the
freedom to manage their forage resources as they desire, and determine the
proper level of use; the government&#146;s role should be limited to enforcing
nuisance rules (i.e. preventing one rancher from harming the land, forage, or
resources of other users) and enforcing voluntary transactions. <p>
</UL>
	<P>These principles would lead to sounder rangeland management through the use of
the marketplace. Environmental groups concerned about the state of current
grazing lands could seek to modify existing ranching practices by negotiations
with ranchers or the purchase of grazing rights (as some environmental groups
have sought to do in the past with minimal success).  Ranchers would also have
the security of knowing that forage access rights are recognized by the federal
government and could not be arbitrarily taken away or infringed upon in the
future.  Although some believe that existing rights are secure, the experience
of federal land management and regulation suggests otherwise.  Free-market
grazing reform is a win-win alternative to current federal land management.<p>
<i>Q:  Are the grazing reforms put forward by either the Clinton Administration
or the Republican Congress market oriented?</i><p>
<p>
A:  No.  Both reform proposals fall far short of necessary grazing reforms.
The Clinton proposal, advanced by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, would
increase bureaucratic meddling in the management of Western rangelands and
would impose significant burdens on many ranchers. The proposals advanced in
the Republican Congress would allow insufficient flexibility in land management
and alternative uses of federal rangelands.  Free-market grazing reform would
be superior to both approaches.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Don&#146;t ranchers pay below-market rates to use federal
rangeland?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Grazing permit fees are set by a bureaucratic formula, not market
pressures.  This formula sets the permit fee for all federal rangeland.  It is
fair to assume that this relatively arbitrary fee is too high for some lands,
and too low for others.  This is inevitable so long as the federal government
seeks to set a single fee for all federal rangeland.  <p>
	It is true that grazing permits on federal lands cost less than those on
private land.  However, federal lands are also typically lower quality, and
federal land ranchers are more likely to have to finance any land improvements
on federal lands. The only way to get market pricing for rangeland is to allow
the market to operate, and end the practice of politically-set grazing fees.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Is ranching subsidized on federal lands?</i><p>
<p>
A:  The net costs of federal land grazing programs are over $200 million per
year in the Bureau of Land Management alone.  However it would be a mistake to
assume that this necessarily represents a subsidy to ranchers, as a significant
portion of rangeland management costs is certainly due to BLM inefficiency and
burdensome regulatory requirements.<p>
	However, ranchers, on both public and private lands, do receive some federal
subsidies.  These include the emergency feed program, which costs approximately
$26.5 million per year, and the Animal Damage Control program, which spends
over $20 million per year controlling predators that can impact livestock
operations.  Both of these programs should be eliminated.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Will market-based grazing reform drive ranchers off of federal
lands?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Free-market grazing reform would make it easier for federal-land ranchers
to sell their grazing permits to other parties, including non-ranchers.  Some
ranchers would certainly exercise this option.  Others would not.  Under the
free-market approach, ranchers would only leave federal lands if they
voluntarily chose to do so.  Neither federal bureaucrats nor environmental
groups would have the power to force ranchers off of the land.  Ranchers,
owning property in their forage access rights, would be protected from
regulatory takings, and would have greater control of how their forage is
used.

<H1>HOW TO DISMANTLE THE<BR>
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT
</H1>
by Robert H. Nelson

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>The Department of the Interior was created in 1849 as the new &#147;Home
Department&#148; covering much of domestic affairs.  Today, Interior is often
thought of as the &#147;Department of the West.&#148;  In total, the Interior
Department has jurisdiction over approximately 450 million acres of public
lands &#151; 20 percent of the land area of the United States. It has about
77,000 full-time employees.  In fiscal 1994, the total operating budget of the
Interior Department was $7.6 billion.<p>
<p>
	Much of the Interior Department was created as part of the progressive-era
plan for American government.  The progressive vision sought rational and
efficient management, to be achieved through the systematic application of
science to the problems of American society.  This vision of scientific
management is no longer an adequate guide for American government.  Indeed, our
task today is to find a new guiding vision and to reshape American governing
institutions accordingly.<p>
<p>
	Many features of the Interior Department&#146;s responsibilities and
organization no longer make sense.  In particular, the Department is a result
of the major overreaching of the federal role that took place in this century.
Interior serves as in effect a planning and zoning board for large areas of the
rural West.  The Interior Department has ended up doing many things that are
properly state and local responsibilities; could be better done in the private
sector; or are not appropriate to government at any level.<p>
<p>
	This paper proposes a radical reorganization of the Interior Department and
its functions.  The changes proposed would cumulatively have the effect of
dismantling much of the Interior Department.  The basis for this reorganization
lies in  four common sense principles:<p>
<OL>
<LI>  Activities that can reasonably be carried out in the private sector should
be done privately.<p>

<LI> Activities that mostly involve state and local concerns should be
administered by state and local governments.<p>

<LI> The Federal government should limit its role to activities and concerns that
involve major Federal interests and responsibilities.<p>

<LI> Administrative organization at the Federal level should place
similar functions in the same agency.<p>

</OL>
	Applying these principles to the Department of the Interior would produce
dramatic changes.  The result would be to abolish altogether six of the current
ten agencies located within the Department of the Interior &#151; the Bureau of
Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Geological Survey, National
Biological Service, Minerals Management Service and Bureau of Mines.  Three
other agencies, the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and
Bureau of Indian Affairs would be sharply reduced in size.  The majority of
their current responsibilities &#151; perhaps 75 percent &#151; would be
transferred to state governments, to tribes, and to private groups.  The
responsibilities of the Office of Surface Mining would be transferred to the
Environmental Protection Agency.<p>
<p>
	Those responsibilities still remaining at the Interior Department would
largely consist of management of lands retained in federal possession for
reasons of their geology, history, rare wildlife or other features of special
national significance.  The various existing parts of the Interior Department
now responsible for these lands could be consolidated into one overall land
management agency.<p>
 <p>
	It is difficult to predict the final cost savings that would result for the
federal government from this plan.  A reasonable estimate, however, is that
approximately 50 percent of the current Interior Department budget, or $3.8
billion annually, would eventually be saved at the federal level, if all this
paper's  recommendations  were adopted.<p>

<H2>Federal Lands</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>The federal government is the largest landowner in the United States, owning
nearly one-third of the land.  Federal ownership of land is most pervasive in
the Western United States.  The federal government owns over half of the state
of California and over 80 percent of Nevada.  In some areas, such as
California&#146;s Inyo County, the federal government owns over 90 percent of
the land.  Federal land ownership has resulted in extensive land mismanagement
and is an affront to the tradition of private property in this country.  Policy
makers should seek to divest the federal government of most federal lands.<p>
	Expansive government control of land means that many land-use decisions are
based upon political considerations, rather than on economic or environmental
grounds.  Often these decisions are made in Washington, D.C. with little
concern for the needs and concerns of local communities.  As a result, federal
lands are routinely mismanaged and a drain on the American taxpayer.  Moreover,
federal ownership of lands often entails the imposition of land-use controls on
neighboring communities.  This increases the costs of federal ownership.<p>
	Federal land is managed by the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of
Reclamation, the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service in the
Department of the Interior, as well as by the Forest Service in the Department
of Agriculture, among others.  This duplication of responsibilities is
inefficient.  The problem is compounded by the fact that different land
agencies often work at cross purposes and fail to coordinate important
activities such as fire control.<p>
	Barring the wholesale transfer of federal lands to state governments and the
private sector, two key reforms should be implemented to ensure that the
federal government is more responsible and efficient in its management of
federal lands.  These are:<p>
<UL>
<LI>	<b>No Net Loss of Private Property</b> -- The federal government owns a
sufficient portion of the country as it is.  There is no need for federal
landholdings to increase.  At the same time, the federal government owns much
land that has no need to be in federal hands.  This reform would simply require
the federal government to sell off an offsetting portion of land before
engaging in further land acquisition.  Thus if the federal government wished to
purchase a 2,000 acre wilderness area, it could do so only if it transferred
2,000 acres of federal land into the private sector.<p>

<LI>	<b>Self-Sufficiency for Federal Land Units</b> -- Many federal lands are a
drain on the treasury, and therefore a burden on the taxpayer.  This is even
true on lands where the federal government collects user fees for
timber-cutting, grazing, or recreation.  Congress should require each federal
land unit that is used for commercial or recreational purposes to become
self-sufficient.  This means that land managers would be forced either to cut
administrative costs or increase user fees for resource development and
recreation so that the individual units no longer lose money.  Such efficient
management occurs on private and state lands; it should occur on federal lands
as well.<p>
</UL>
	Ultimately, the federal government should have to divest itself of significant
portions of its landholdings, devolving land to state governments, donating
ecologically-sensitive parcels to conservation organizations and/or selling
lands to private interests.  America was built upon a tradition of private
property and that tradition should be upheld.<p>
<i>Q:  Federal lands are clearly mismanaged.  But isn&#146;t there
mismanagement on private lands as well?</i><p>
<p>
A:  There is mismanagement on all types of land, private and federal.  However,
private lands, on the whole, tend to be managed better than public lands.  When
a private landowner mismanages land, that owner bears the cost, economic and
otherwise, as the value of the land declines.  Federal land managers, on the
other hand, bear none of the costs of land mismanagement.  This disparate
incentive structure means that private lands tend to be managed more soundly.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  How would you propose transferring lands from the federal government to
the private sector?</i><p>
<p>
A:  There is no easy answer to this question.  One possibility would be for
Congress to appoint a Commission to inventory all federal lands and evaluate
what uses are appropriate on which lands.  Those lands that are primarily used
for logging, ranching, or other resource development purposes could be the
first to be transferred into the private sector.  After all, the private sector
is more than capable of providing for such economic concerns.  The Commission
also could identify which lands, if any, must remain under federal control
because of environmental sensitivity or other compelling concerns.  This
process could also be used to consolidate the numerous federal land agencies to
increase the efficiency of land management and prevent federal land agencies
from working at cross-purposes.  Another possibility would be to transfer many
landholdings to state governments, which would, in turn, have the opportunity
to privatize selected lands.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Q:  Would divesting the federal government of land ownership eliminate
outdoor recreational opportunities for Americans?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Not necessarily.  There are many private lands that are managed for
recreation in conjunction with other uses.  For example, IP Timberlands in the
southeastern United States manages many of its lands for both timber production
and recreation.  Because trees are only cut every few decades, IP Timberlands
is able to encourage the use of its land for hiking, camping, hunting and bird
watching in the interim.  This not only means that IP Timberlands makes a
greater profit off of its land, it means that the land is managed in a more
ecologically diverse manner as well.

<H1>HOW AND WHY TO TRANSFER BLM LANDS TO THE STATES
</H1>
Robert H. Nelson
<P>
January 1996
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Devolving federal responsibilities to the states has emerged as a central
theme of the 104th Congress.  No area has greater potential for
decentralization than Western public lands.  In the eleven westernmost of the
lower 48 states, the federal government owns 47 percent of the land.
Historically, the control over the use of land has been considered the most
local of government functions.  Yet in the rural West, federal ownership means
that federal agencies are in effect the planning and zoning boards for much of
the land.  Federal land ownership on the scale seen in the western United
States is a basic anomaly in the American federal system.<p>
<p>
	A transfer of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands to the states would
signify the end of the progressive era in public land management which sought
to rely upon scientific management of public resources.  This era is coming to
a close and federal policy should reflect this fact.<p>
	<p>
	One of the major advantages of state ownership of land would be a much wider
leeway for experimentation in land management approaches, as compared with the
one-size-fits-all approach of the current federal system.  The current lack of
flexibility on the public lands fails to reflect the diversity of values,
political cultures, geography and other key features across the West.<p>
<p>
	On BLM rangelands, the general economic deficiencies of federal land
management are exacerbated by the very low productivity of the surface areas
being managed.  Indeed, it is remarkable that an agency can lose money on the
management of a natural resource asset that includes 10 percent of the land
area of the lower 48 states, 33 percent of the total coal reserves of the
United States, and 5 percent of the nation&#146;s oil and gas reserves.  This
failure on the part of the BLM reflects the political pressures that have come
to dominate the management of public lands, resulting in minimum revenues and
maximum costs.<p>
	There are a number of political obstacles to transferring BLM lands to western
states.  Not all states will gain fiscally in the short run from the
acquisition of federal lands.  Some state governments are thus ambivalent about
the possibility of taking ownership of BLM lands.  Many ranchers are concerned
that transferring lands would threaten their current status on the lands.
Another obstacle is the argument that to do so would give away public resources
of great value without any return to the taxpayer.  Despite these obstacles,
there are numerous factors that could increase the possibility of a transfer.<p>
<p>
	The states at present own substantial lands, many of them remaining from large
transfers of land to states in the nineteenth century.  The management of these
lands was little studied until recently.  Although the conventional wisdom had
been that states were doing a poor job, these studies on the whole have
assessed state management in considerably more positive terms.  Indeed, for the
state holdings in large contiguous blocks that are most manageable and thus are
more comparable to many federal lands, the state record compares favorably with
federal results.<p>
<p>
	As lands generally having few nationally distinctive characteristics, the BLM
lands are a logical starting place for any state transfer proposal.  The
following principles could provide a basis for developing improved future
legislation to offer western states the option of taking possession of BLM
lands.<p>
<DL>
<DD>
1.	Formally recognize rancher grazing rights to rangeland forage;<p>
2. 	Complete the wilderness designations for BLM lands and develop a process to
identify any other nationally significant lands;<p>
3. 	Clarify that BLM lands transferred to states would not then be subject to
federal environmental impact statement and land-use planning requirements;<p>
4. 	Provide that any existing endangered species requirements for BLM lands
will be maintained in effect;<p>
5.	Provide that the Endangered Species Act will otherwise apply to transferred
lands in the same manner it applies to existing state lands;<p>
6.	Exclude the O&amp;C forest lands in Western Oregon from any transfer
proposal;<p>
7.	Establish open-access easements assuring continued ordinary dispersed
recreation on transferred lands;<p>
8.	Consider maintaining fire fighting as a federal function;<p>
9.	Convert existing federal spending on BLM lands into block grants to be
gradually phased out;<p>
10.	Phase out the federal share of revenues from existing federal mineral
leases over a similar interim period;<p>
11.	Immediately transfer the ownership of all unleased federal leasable
minerals to the states;<p>
12.	Provide that all mining claims on transferred BLM land will be administered
for twenty years under the terms of federal law;<p>
13.	Immediately transfer ownership of all federal &#147;hardrock&#148; minerals
below BLM and state lands to the states;<p>
14.	Transfer inholdings of existing state lands that lie within nationally
significant areas to the federal government;<p>
15.	Transfer BLM lands and state inholdings to Indian tribes where these lands
are located within the boundaries of Indian reservations;<p>
16.	Retain the liability at the federal level for paying future cleanup costs
of any toxic waste sites on current BLM land;<p>

17.	Require that a state transfer request be approved by the state&#146;s legislature and signed by the governor.<p>

<TITLE>CEI EBB: Recreation Subsidies</TITLE>

<H2>Recreation Subsidies</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Although not thought of as a subsidized activity, recreation on federal land
costs the Federal Government $1.7 billion a year.  In contrast the government
only collects $159.7 million a year in user fees.  Recreation is probably the
most subsidized activity on federals lands.  Recreationists need to start
paying to play.  One way to do this is the adoption of broad based user fees.
These fees would be determined by the appropriate federal agency and kept
within the recreational system to pay for it.  The federal agencies that run
recreational services include not only the famous National Park Service and the
Forest Service, but also the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife
Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Army Corp of Engineers.  <p>
	
Recreationists receive a tremendously greater benefit from the government
provision of goods and services than do other subsidized activities.  The
Forest Service has estimated the fees it receives for various activities and
has compared this to what these activities would cost in the market.  These are
the economic benefits that users receive.  In 1993 they were given as:<p>
<BR>
<CENTER>
<table border=2><tr><td></td><td>
RETURNS TO GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC BENEFITS (from user fees)</td>
	  
<td>RECEIVED BY USERS</td></tr>

<tr><td>Recreation</td><td>$49.3 million</td><td>$6.8 billion</td></tr>
<tr><td>Range	  </td><td>$10.5 million	</td><td>$61.4 million</td></tr>
<tr><td>Minerals	  </td><td>$210  million </td><td>              	$573.9 million</td></tr>
<tr><td>Timber	</td><td>$1.1019 billion</td><td> $1.020 billion</td></tr>
</table>
</CENTER>
<p>


	In other words, recreationists received benefits almost 138 times more
valuable than what they paid, while range, mineral and timber users received
far less, according to the Forest Service&#146;s own numbers.  These numbers
are for the Forest Service only, and do not include the other government
agencies that provide recreation.  Nevertheless, it is clear that
recreationists are making out like old West bandits.<p>
	Although recreation is treated differently than these other subsidized
activities it has something in common with them:  It causes environmental
damage.  Recreation is so underpriced that many areas are overused, which
damages environmental health.  Additionally, the millions of recreational
visitors damage the land in countless ways by camping, hiking, biking, skiing
and other activities.  Not only do they get to play for cheap, but the repairs
and upkeep needed to keep these federal areas in shape are not done.  The
combined repair backlog for the National Park Service and the Forest Service is
$5 billion.<p>
	Even environmental groups recognize the deleterious environmental effects of
subsidized recreation.  The <i>Green Scissors &#145;96</i> report, published by
Friends of the Earth, targets recreational subsidies for reform.  Radical
environmentalist Dave Foreman, co-founder of the Wildlands Project, wrote,
&#147;when conservationists cry about funding cuts for National Parks, we
stumble into the morass of the victim, of the irresponsible citizens who want
their entitlement handouts.&#148;  Foreman advocates recreational users start
paying for what they are using.<p>
	Were federal lands privately owned, recreation subsidies would be eliminated.
Barring that, one solution to this problem is to require the agencies to
collect fees to pay for the costs of the recreational services provided so that
no subsidy occurs.  Traditionally, some agencies have had a wide latitude in
setting fees but have had no incentive to do so because they get back so little
of the money collected.<p>
<i>Q:  Don&#146;t people already pay for the National Parks and other federal
recreational lands with their taxes?</i><p>
<p>
A:  All taxpayers pay for the recreational services, yet only some use them.
Those who use it are being subsidized by those who do not.  Recreational users
have not paid the full cost for their visit and this is causing damages to
federally owned lands.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Wouldn&#146;t requiring public lands to raise their own revenues
encourage uses that undermine conservation or biodiversity.</i><p>
<p>
A:  No.  In fact the exact opposite would happen.  Recreation can hurt the
environment by affecting and destroying plant life.  Having fees will reduce
visitors in over-crowded areas and reduce damage there.  Underutilitized areas
can have competitive prices that attract visitors.  This process will allow
recreational usage to be smoothed out among competing areas.  An added bonus is
that when people pay for a service they usually tend to value it more and treat
it better.  This has even been pointed out by environmentalists as a reason to
have fees.<p>
<p>
<i>Q: Wouldn&#146;t raising fees and charging new ones discourage poor people
from using the parks or make recreation an &#147;elitist&#148; activity?</i><p>

A:  Almost all the people that visit these places in the first place are what
we would at least call &#147;middle class.&#148;  This is because the costs to
visit most federal recreational areas is expensive compared to the small fee
that will be charged for its use.  These types of activities are not engaged in
by poor people who cannot afford the trip costs in the first place.  Concern of
this nature can be taken care of with fee free days in some areas for those
that find the fees too expensive.

<H2>Clean Water Act</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>The United States has experienced substantial gains in cleaning up our lakes,
rivers, and streams over the past three decades.  Yet today, the Environmental
Protection Agency continues to write more stringent and more expensive
regulations that produce minimal environmental results.  The Clean Water Act is
a perfect example of diminishing returns, and why environmental regulation
needs to be reformed.<p>
	America&#146;s waters were once in bad shape.  On June 22, 1969, sparks from a
passing train ignited floating debris and industrial chemicals in the Cuyahoga
river, near Cleveland, Ohio.  The image of a burning river spurred the passage
of the Clean Water Act.  <p>
	Today, the offensive industrial pollution that characterized the 1960s has
been virtually eliminated.  Many rivers are cleaner than they have been in
decades.  Along the Cuyahoga riverfront in Cleveland there are now dozens of
upscale restaurants and bars, and during the summertime the river is crowded
with pleasure boats.  Tremendous progress has been made.<p>
	While there is far less water pollution to address, complying with the Clean
Water Act has become far more expensive.  Full compliance would cost as much as
$99 billion per year, according to the EPA.  This is more than the federal
government collects in corporate income tax.  The majority of these costs
&#151; as much as $41 billion per year &#151; are placed upon businesses.  A
significant portion of the Clean Water Act&#146;s costs, however, are also born
by municipalities, up to $37 billion a year.<p>
	In some cases compliance costs are so high because the EPA regulations are
inflexible and overly stringent.  For example, the EPA requires city treatment
plants to remove 30 percent of the organic material from the sewage that they
treat.  In most cities this is not a problem.  However, in Anchorage, Alaska,
the sewage coming into the treatment plant was so clean that it would have cost
$135 million to build a facility to treat water that already meets the
EPA&#146;s discharge standards.  It was cheaper for Anchorage to allow two
local fish processing plants to dump 5,000 pound of fish guts into the sewer
system so that a 30 percent reduction in organic waste could be achieved at an
affordable cost.  This is not how environmental policy should work.<p>
	The following elements should be part of any Clean Water Act reform
proposal:<p>
<UL>
<li>	The EPA should be required to perform a cost/benefit analysis on each
regulation to ensure that costs of complying with clean water regulation do not
outweigh their benefits.<p>
<li>	If the EPA sets stringent new standards that will be expensive to implement
for state and local governments, it should also provide the funds to comply
with the standard.  In other words, the EPA should refrain from imposing
unfunded environmental mandates.<p>
<li>	The EPA should provide greater flexibility for state and local environmental
agencies to set standards based on local needs.<p>
</ul>
<p>
	In the long run, water pollution control efforts must move away from federal
command-and-control regulations in favor of common law-based-standards.  This
approach, which empowers landowners to protect water quality from pollution and
other nuisances through the court system, has shown promise in other countries.
Yet a common law approach to water pollution is often precluded by existing
federal law.<p><BR>
<i>Q:  Shouldn&#146;t the Clean Water Act be strengthened to prevent companies
from polluting our steams, lakes and rivers?</i><p>
<p>
A:  The number one cause of pollution in America&#146;s rivers and lakes is not
industrial pollution, but agricultural runoff.  The number two cause is
municipal and urban runoff.  According to the EPA, industrial pollution ranks
last as a cause of pollution.  Imposing more requirements on industry will
simply create higher costs without achieving significant environmental
improvement.  <p>
<p>
<i>Q:  How would you change the Clean Water Act without worsening water
quality?</i><p>
<p>
A:  The first thing that must be done is to put more flexibility in the hands
of state and local officials.  Even the current administrator of the EPA, Carol
Browner, thinks it&#146;s essential.  In a 1994 speech she said, &#147;We must
allow for flexibility, innovation, and common sense as states and communities
look for ways to achieve the standards.&#148;  Even according to Browner, under
the present scheme, &#147;innovation is stifled rather than encouraged.&#148;
If anything, the EPA should be providing technical assistance and funding to
communities not dictating priorities and technology.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Are there ways to protect water quality without resorting to federal
regulation?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Yes.  It would be more effective and equitable if water quality was
protected through the assertion and protection of private water rights, rather
than by command-and-control regulation.  Under common law principles,
individual polluters could be held liable for damaging the water quality of
those downstream.  This would provide a strict, but fair, standard whereby no
individual, corporation, or even municipality, could infringe upon the water
rights of another.  This approach also would be more flexible, because upstream
and downstream users could negotiate over competing water uses.  However, this
sort of common law, property rights-based approach has been preempted by state
and federal water pollution laws. <p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Should the Clean Water Act be expanded to control non-point sources of
pollution such as agricultural and urban runoffs?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Rather than expand the CWA, Congress should amend it to permit local
flexibility and experimentation.  Emissions create problems <i>somewhere</i>
before they create problems <i>elsewhere</i>.  Local communities and water
users should be allowed to deal with runoffs based on their own assessment of
the environmental and economic trade-offs.  In some cases, local solutions
might be facilitated by extending property rights to recreational and sporting
clubs, shell fisheries, and others with a stake in water quality.  When local
problems are addressed locally, they are less apt to become large problems
requiring federal intervention.

<H1>The GOP Vs. The Environment?

<P>
The Republican drive to reform environmental law looks to be stalled. 
Last week, for example, the House backed off 17 proposed limits on the
Environmental Protection Agency.  Other reforms face similar trouble. 

<P>The problem, in the words of Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., is that "The
Republican party is quickly becoming known as the anti-environment
party." So long as the GOP seems to just want to roll back environmental
protection, Boehlert and his allies in both parties can make a powerful
case. 

<P>But Boehlert's answer--dropping reform efforts--is wrong.  Instead, the
new Republican majority should do what's done on issues from welfare to
Medicare: Present a clear alternative to the status quo. 

<P>Reformers should articulate their own long range vision for environmental
protection.  They must demonstrate a positive desire to use GOP principles
to achieve these goals.  They can show how free markets and limited
government will work better than the sprawling bureaucracies now in place. 

<P>The need for dramatic change should be clear.  Policies that effectively
curbed pollution in the '70s are too rigid and clumsy to deal with the
concerns of the '90s.  The haystack environmental problems of yesteryear
have been eliminated, while the needle-in-a-haystack environmental
problems remain.  New problems require new responses. 

<P>Conventional command-and-control environmental policies are no longer
worth their costs.  This year Americans will spend well over $150 billion
to comply with pollution control measures.  Yet many such rules no longer
do much for the environment. 

<P>In some cases, these laws actually harm the environment.  Hazardous-waste
and species protection measures, for instance, can actually encourage
increased waste production and destruction of habitat.  Removing such
perverse incentives is not anti-environment. 

<P>More broadly, reformers should aim to eliminate destructive subsidies and
encourage markets to address environmental concerns. 

<P>Most environmental problems are not caused by market failures but by a
failure to have markets.  Republicans know that sound stewardship begins
with private property.  Their pro-environment agenda should thus include
protecting property rights. 

<P>Regulatory approaches may sill be called for.  But these should focus more
on preventing harm to people and their properties, and less on
prescriptive bureaucratic edicts.  There is nothing pro-environment about
generating paperwork or letting the federal government micromanage
industry decisions. 

<P>This agenda should also move decisions out of Washington to the people who
will bear the costs--and reap the benefits--of the policy decision.  It
makes no sense for Washington to set environmental priorities for every
community in the nation. 

<P>Voters are ready to hear this message.

<P>A January 1995 Time/CNN poll shows that 68% of Americans believe
environmental regulations should be "subject to an analysis to determine
whether eliminating that risk justifies the economic cost."  A May 1995
Roper Starch poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe landowners
should be compensated when laws protecting wetlands or endangered species
devalue their land. 

<P>Both policies are key to the GOP regulatory reform agenda. 

<P>Voters also sympathize with the drive to return many environmental
decisions to the state and local level.  President Clinton's pollster,
Stanley Greenberg, conducted a series of focus groups for
environmentalists.  He concluded that "For ordinary citizens, devolution
is a way of making the environmental regime more responsive, more flexible
and sensible." 

<P>This is a message Congress' reformers should push in the environmental
debate. 

<P>Polls consistently show that Americans call themselves environmentalists. 
We believe in environmental protection.  But Roper Starch found that the
share of Americans who believe such measures "have gone not far enough"
has dropped by nearly a third since 1992, from 63% to 43%.  And the number
who believe they "have gone too far" has more than doubled, from 10% to
22%. 

<P>Americans are ready for a pro-environment, anti-regulatory message.  The
GOP's reformers just have to start sending it.

<H1>PICK A NUMBER<BR>
A Critique of Contingent Valuation Methodology and its Application<BR>
in Public Policy
</H1>
by Roger Bate

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>How much would you be willing to pay for an untouched expanse of wilderness?
The process by which this question can be answered is called Contingent
Valuation (CV).  CV attempts to quantify the &#147;satisfaction&#148; of
knowing that a natural resource exists, called a &#147;nonuse value&#148;
(NUV), regardless of any actual attempt to enjoy it. <i> </i> Once enumerated,
NUVs could  be used to impose liability for injuries to natural resources
placing billions of dollars at stake.<p>
The CV procedure involves asking people what they would pay, through increased
taxes, prices, or some other mechanism, to protect a valued environmental
resource.  For example, CV surveys provide respondents with a selection of
choices, such as a set of charities. You may be willing to give $100 to charity
and there may be eight separate charities that you find appealing. It is
therefore possible that in separate CV surveys, your stated willingness to
donate to charity could equal $800 in total, even though $100 is all that will
be given.  Obviously, this approach has serious problems including the
following:<p>
<UL>
<LI>the survey process can create the very values which they purport to measure;<p>

<LI>answers are likely to be biased by strategic considerations regarding the uses
to which  the survey could be put;<p>

<LI>survey results are often inconsistent;<p>

<LI>individuals are ill-trained to evaluate the monetary value of environmental
damage; <p>

<LI>rarely do individuals have experience in purchasing environmental assets;<p>

<LI>results cannot be empirically verified.<p>

</UL>
In sum, CV results are uncertain, subjective and speculative. <p>
CV surveys are further hindered by a fundamental difference between an actual
choice and a potential preference.  People may state a preference  for many
things but in actuality choose something entirely different. <p>
<UL>
<LI>A choice is superior to a preference because with the latter &#147;there is no
cost to being wrong, and therefore no incentive to undertake the mental effort
to be accurate;&#148; <p>
<LI>The only way to discover the values people place on things is through the
actual choices made by individuals. <p>

</UL>
Contingent valuation is an attempt to replicate the workings of the market
without a system where natural resource sites have well-defined private
property rights.  Markets allow people to make choices based on the amount they
are willing to pay for a good or service.   CV surveys  bypass the workings of
a true market process<i>.</i> The results from these surveys therefore cannot
be equated with market behavior, and any use of these figures should be treated
with skepticism.  <p>
Despite these problems, CV surveys are becoming more prevalent.  For instance,
the 1989 Supreme Court declared, in <i>Ohio v. U.S. Department of Interior</i>,
that nonuse values can be used to measure damages in liability cases.  <i>CV
surveys are likely to result in unwanted litigation, and could be presented in
liability claims at considerable social cost.</i>   Because the use of surveys
cannot be tested or verified empirically the valuation of natural resources
through CV is simply inappropriate.  The results may be interesting, but are
little more than picking a number, any number.<p>

<H2>Regulatory Accountability</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Although the Constitution reads, &#147;All legislative Powers herein granted
shall be vested in a Congress of the United States,&#148; law is routinely made
by unelected federal bureaucrats who are unaccountable to the public.  This has
diminished accountability for regulatory policies and fostered an
out-of-control federal bureaucracy.  Measures must be taken to halt the
excessive delegation of congressional lawmaking power to agencies.  There
should be no regulation without representation.<p>
	Federal regulations cost Americans approximately $647 billion per year
according to the General Accounting Office.  This is greater than the entire
annual federal budget was prior to 1966, and three times larger than the
federal deficit.  Regulatory reforms that seek to impose quick administrative
fixes, such as simple risk assessment or cost-benefit analysis requirements,
will do little to advance the necessary changes in America&#146;s regulatory
system.<p>
	 While Congress frequently delights in blaming agencies for economic woes, the
fact is that Congress gave agencies much of their power in the first place.
This enables elected representatives to take credit for enacting popular laws
&#151; such as the Clean Air Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act &#151;
while disavowing the implementing regulations that inevitably follow from their
own vague, high-minded legislative language.  If America&#146;s environmental
laws are too costly, Congress ultimately is to blame, and Congress must be
forced to make the necessary legal revisions.  <p>
	Federal law should require an explicit legislative endorsement of agency
regulations before they take effect.  Congress should have to vote on final
major agency regulations, and the President should have to sign them into law,
before they are binding on the public.  That&#146;s no more, but no less, than
is required of ordinary legislation.  Congress could, of course, approve
regulations on a fast-track basis to expedite the process.  But there should no
longer exist an opportunity for an elected official to blame an agency for an
unreasonable law.  Agencies should not make law, that is the job of Congress.<p>
	Incremental steps &#151; such as extending application of the unfunded federal
mandates law to private sector mandates, and regulatory budgeting &#151; are
also important in establishing accountability.  Like ordinary legislation,
voters should be able to check the record and determine where their
Representative or Senator stood on any given regulatory matter.  Restoring
direct accountability should be the guiding principle of regulatory reform.<p>
<i>Q:  How will Congress have time to vote on every regulation?  Won&#146;t the
legislative process grind to a halt?</i><p>

A:  Congress need not perform a recorded roll call vote on each regulation
finalized by an agency.  Unanimous consent &#147;voice vote&#148; procedures
can expedite the process.  Such procedures are routinely used in the Senate to
approve nominations, and often used to pass routine and housekeeping
legislation in both Houses.  It also may make sense to package certain
regulations together to be voted on simultaneously where roll calls are
necessary.  No amount of administrative difficulty, however, can excuse
&#147;regulation without representation.&#148;<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Does Congress have the expertise to make judgments about health and
safety issues?</i><p>

A:  The implication here that agencies do have such expertise may not always
hold, since regulation writers are typically lawyers rather than scientists.
Moreover, agencies routinely farm out studies and lab work to contractors.  A
congressional vote merely places a stamp of approval on finalized agency
regulations that owe their origins to delegated power in the first place.  The
key point, however, is that the policy decision regarding what to do about
scientific findings &#151; as opposed to performing the science itself &#151;
most emphatically is a job for Congress.  American government relies on
citizen-legislators, not philosopher-kings.  <p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Didn&#146;t federal courts strike down an effort to allow for a
&#147;legislative veto&#148; of regulation in the 1980s?</i><p>
<p>
A:  In 1983, the Supreme Court struck down a &#147;legislative veto&#148; that
allowed one Chamber of Congress &#151; either the House or Senate &#151; to
unilaterally strike a regulation, without a presidential signature.  This
policy clearly violated the doctrine of separation of powers.  However, since
Congress delegates power to executive agencies, there is nothing to stop
Congress from restricting that delegation, or from overriding regulations by
passing laws through both Chambers and sending such proposals to the
President&#146;s desk.

<P>The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is a pro-market, public policy group
committed to advancing the principles of free enterprise and limited
government.  Founded in 1984 by <A HREF="fred.html">Fred L. Smith, Jr.</A>, CEI emphasizes the
marketing and implementation of classical liberal ideals. <p>

<p>CEI utilizes a five-point management approach to affecting public policy:
analysis, education, coalition building, advocacy and litigation.  Its purpose
is to advance the free-market agenda, believing limited government and
competition best serve the public interest.<p>

<p>A non-profit, tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code, CEI relies entirely on donations from corporations, foundations,
and private individuals with an interest in restoring individual liberties and
economic freedom.  <i>All contributions are tax deductible.</i><p>

<B>FEDERAL AGRICULTURAL POLICY: A Harvest of Environmental Abuse</B><BR>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
     For the last decade, taxpayers have footed the bill for farm programs to the
tune of $10 billion a year.  Despite such tremendous expenditures, the American
public has reaped little benefit from this show of federal largess.  Farm
subsidies are no longer needed to ensure food security.  They are no longer
needed to support farm income.  And they are no longer needed to stabilize
agricultural markets.  Their sole purpose is to placate special interests.<p>
<p>
     Not only do these farm programs provide little benefit, they also carry
considerable costs.  Current farm policy, through supply control programs,
raises the price of many farm products.  These same supply control programs
encourage the more intensive use of agricultural land resulting in
environmental stress.  According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
agricultural runoff is the number one source of pollution in the nation&#146;s
rivers, streams, and lakes.<A HREF="agpap10.html#1"><sup>1</sup><p></A>
<p>
     An analysis of data from six major farm states shows that a fifty percent
reduction in subsidies would decrease chemical use by an estimated 17 percent
and fertilizer use by and estimated 14 percent.  The complete elimination of
subsidies could result in a 35 percent reduction in chemical use per acre and a
29 percent reduction in fertilizer use per acre. <p>
<p>
     In addition to commodity programs, other agricultural policies are often
responsible for local or regional environmental abuse.  It is clear, for
example, that the U.S. sugar program is responsible for not only increased
sugar production in south Florida but also more intensive sugar cane
production, contributing to the increased phosphorus contamination of the
Everglades, thus changing the unique nature of the ecosystem.  The elimination
of the U.S. sugar program would likely have a significant beneficial effect on
the environment of the Everglades ecosystem.<p>
<p>
     Another example of increased chemical use is the USDA peanut program.  Under
the peanut program the USDA licenses all peanut farmers and assigns each a
yearly quota.  One of the conditions of the peanut program is that farmers are
required to grow peanuts on the same farm.  This leads to a situation where
peanuts are grown year after year in the same handful of counties and nowhere
else.  In some regions this means that extensive quantities of pesticides are
used.  For example, peanuts grown in Georgia use four times more pesticide per
acre than those grown in Texas.  Obviously, from an environmental perspective
it would be better to grow peanuts where chemical inputs could be minimized.
The current peanut program, however, prohibits this.<p>
<p>
     Overall, both the environment and the consumer would be better off under a
free market agricultural policy.<p>

<H2>Background</H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
     Environmental analysts have often noted that government policies which
encourage more agricultural production from less land can directly conflict
with goals for environmental protection.  This has been observed by both
traditional and free market environmental thinkers.<p>
<p>
     In  their book <i>Free Market Environmentalism</i>, Terry Anderson and Donald
Leal note:<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The negative impact on the environment has been exacerbated by programs that
support commodity prices and reduce risks by subsidizing insurance.  With
returns higher and costs lower than they would be in a free market, farmers
plant more acres and produce more crops.  To reduce the surpluses, federal
programs require farmers to cut back on the acreage planted, but farmers
attempt to circumvent such efforts by using more pesticides and fertilizers to
increase output per acre.<A HREF="agpap10.html#2"><sup>2</sup></A><p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<sup></sup><p>
     Other researchers have come to similar conclusions using econometric and
mathematical models which show that government programs increase the use of
pesticides and fertilizers.<A HREF="agpap10.html#3"><sup>3</sup></A>  A study conducted on North Carolina
coastal plain agriculture, for example, determined that the elimination of farm
programs would have reduced nitrogen leaching due to fertilizer use by 46
percent.<A HREF="agpap10.html#4"><sup>4</sup></A>  Statistical analysis of chemical and fertilizer use has
also indicated that farm programs contribute to more intensive use of chemicals
and fertilizers.  Data from the 1991 and 1992 Cropping Practices Surveys showed
that corn producers who participated in the USDA feedgrain program used
nitrogen, herbicides and insecticides at greater rates than those who did not
participate.<A HREF="agpap10.html#5"><sup>5</sup></A> <p>

<p>
     The Department of Agriculture subsidizes farmers for growing most field crops,
such as corn, wheat, barley, oats, sorghum, cotton and rice.  They offer the 
farmer a guaranteed price per bushel of commodity.  Consequently, the farmer
has an incentive to maximize his production.<A HREF="agpap10.html#6"><sup>6</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Most direct subsidies to farmers take the form of deficiency payments.  When a
farmer goes to sell his product on the market, if the market price is higher
than the guaranteed price the government pays the farmer nothing.  But if the
guaranteed price is higher, the government pays the difference between the
market price and the guaranteed price.  <p>
<p>
     In the long run, the government ends up paying huge sums of money,
approximately $10 billion a year, directly to farmers.  This occurs because of
two compounding factors.  The guaranteed price is invariably above the market
price.  For example, in 1992 the target support price for corn was set at $2.75
per bushel.  The average U.S. market price that year was $2.05 per bushel.
Wheat subsidies are similarly elevated.  The target price for wheat in 1992 was
$4.00 a bushel, the market price was $3.25 per bushel.  Unless there is a
severe shortage of a particular commodity, the market price will likely stay
significantly below the guaranteed price.  Because the guaranteed price is set
higher than the market price, the farmer has an economic incentive to produce
more.  Consequently, farmers all across the country are increasing the supply
of certain crops beyond what would be produced in a consumer driven market.
But increases in supply drive down the market price, and when the market price
goes down the government has to make higher deficiency payments.  Not
surprisingly, USDA commodity programs routinely spend more than their budgeted
allocations.  For example, predicted budgetary expenditures in the 1990 farm
bill for direct payments were on average 75 percent of actual expenditures.  In
other words, between 1991 and 1994, the USDA actually spent $11.6 billion more
than Congress had anticipated in the 1990 farm bill.<A HREF="agpap10.html#7"><sup>7</sup></A> (See chart
below.)<p>
<p>
     In order to keep its budget under control, the USDA has historically engaged
in policies to drive up the market price of subsidized commodities.  Typically
this is accomplished by requiring farmers who participate in the subsidy
program to set aside a certain portion of their farmland and grow nothing on it
as a condition of receiving the subsidy.  In 1992, for example, the acreage set
aside was 5 percent for corn, sorghum, barley and wheat.<A HREF="agpap10.html#8"><sup>8</sup></A>  In other
words, to participate in the corn commodity program a farmer would have had to
set aside 5 percent of the acreage he would normally plant with corn and grow
nothing on it.<p>
<p>
     Equally important, the USDA also encourages farmers to participate in
voluntary set aside programs where they are paid to keep part of their land
idle.  The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is the best example of such a
program.  Under the CRP, the USDA pays annual rent to farmers who agree to idle
their land for ten years.<A HREF="agpap10.html#9"><sup>9</sup></A>  Currently the USDA has enrolled 36.4
million acres of land into the CRP, an area larger than the entire state of
Iowa.<A HREF="agpap10.html#10"><sup>10</sup></A>  In effect CRP is a supply control mechanism, restricting
the amount of land which is in production.<A HREF="agpap10.html#11"><sup>11</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Farmers participating in the subsidy programs are given tremendous economic
incentives to maximize their yields but they have fewer acres with which to
work.  Consequently, many of those farmers increase their non-land inputs,
typically by increasing chemical and fertilizer use.<p>

<H2>Case Study:<BR> Sugar Subsidies and the Everglades</H2>
</CENTER>




<p>
     The Everglades of South Florida provide a striking case study for the
potential effects of government policies and chemical use on the environment.
<p>
<p>
     In 1948, Congress authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to construct 1,500
miles of canals and levees throughout the area of southern
Florida.<A HREF="agpap10.html#12"><sup>12</sup></A>  This was done in an attempt to control flooding in the
region and promote the farming of sugarcane in the Everglades, a locality whose
soil was uniquely suited to this crop.  The Corps completed its task several
years later.  Over 700,000 acres of land was turned into the Everglades
Agricultural Area (EAA).<A HREF="agpap10.html#13"><sup>13</sup></A>  Through a series of pumps, canals, and
levees, the Corps now diverts over 2.5 million acre-feet of water every year
into the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico.<A HREF="agpap10.html#14"><sup>14</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The drainage project itself has caused several severe environmental problems,
including a shrinking water base for wildlife in the region.  In the twenty
year period from 1953 to 1973, when much of the Corps draining program was in
operation, the state of Florida lost 1.44 million acres of wetlands, almost
entirely in the Everglades region.<A HREF="agpap10.html#15"><sup>15</sup></A>  Furthermore, the state has
lost over fifty percent of the Everglades&#146; original area to drainage and
pollution in the past two hundred years, with much of that loss occurring over
the last fifty years.<A HREF="agpap10.html#16"><sup>16</sup></A>  While there have been some legitimate
concerns about flooding in the area, this drainage would, for the most part, be
unnecessary if the land was not used for agriculture.<p>
<p>
     In addition to the environmental damage caused by the drainage, agricultural
policies encouraging intensive sugar production have exacerbated the
environmental degradation.<p>
<p>
     The federal government has set up several different price schemes in an effort
to promote domestic sugar production.  These supports take the form of
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) non-recourse loans as well as import
restrictions on foreign produced sugar.  While each one seems to operate with a
different goal, their overall, cumulative effect is to support the price of
sugar in the U.S. and allow the increased marginal production of this crop.<p>
<p>
     The CCC non-recourse loans are an elaborate way for the government to
guarantee a minimum price for sugar.  Loans are made to the processors of
sugarcane who purchase the crop at a guaranteed price.  The processors can
store the final product for up to nine months, the time limit of the loan, to
see whether the price of sugar exceeds the USDA's established minimum price.
If it does not, the processors may simply default on their loan and give their
harvest to the USDA which accepts it as payment-in-full.  The dollar
&#147;floor&#148; price for raw sugar cane is 18 cents per pound, nearly twice
the going rate for sugar in the world market-place.<A HREF="agpap10.html#17"><sup>17</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Because the floor price is set so high, if there were no trade barriers for
sugar, domestic buyers would buy their sugar for the world price and sugar
producers would simply default on their loans and take the guaranteed price of
18 cents per pound.  This would leave the government holding millions of tons
of overpriced sugar.  To prevent this from happening, the USDA has established
a tariff-based quota on imported sugar.  Under this quota system, foreign
countries pay a low level tariff for sugar up until the point they reach the
quota set by the USDA.  Once they reach this point, any additional sugar they
export to the U.S. is subject to a 16 cent per pound tariff.<A HREF="agpap10.html#18"><sup>18</sup></A>  This
high duty, which is evaluated every year, allows the USDA to control the amount
of refined sugar coming into the country and maintains high domestic sugar
prices. <p>
<p>
     These higher prices are then passed on to the consumers.  Overall, the sugar
program is estimated to cost consumers $1.4 billion a year.  The higher prices
benefit both producers and processors.  For example, in 1992, farmers of
sugarcane received $161.5 million in benefits because of the commodity program,
and processors received $107.7 million.<A HREF="agpap10.html#19"><sup>19</sup></A><p>
<p>
     What the government fails to take into account, however, is the environmental
impact of their actions.  As already noted, the USDA&#146;s price supports
provide an incentive for farmers to produce more of their crop than they would
if no such subsidies existed.  To take advantage of this incentive, growers are
forced into overusing non-land inputs such as fertilizers, chemicals which
cause extensive harm to the Everglades ecosystem.<p>
<p>
     A major component of fertilizer is phosphorus, a chemical not abundantly found
in the natural water supply of the Everglades.  Due to the extensive use of
fertilizers in farming, a great deal of phosphorus leaches into the
groundwater, which is then pumped out to the Everglades National Park and
Loxahatchee Wildlife Refuge.  A recent study found that up to 80 percent of
phosphorus used in fertilizing sugarcane crops is transferred with drainage
water into the Everglades.<A HREF="agpap10.html#20"><sup>20</sup></A>  Once there, the phosphorus allows many
non-native plants to outgrow and crowd out naturally occurring species.  A
prime example of this phenomenon is the vast replacement of native sawgrass
with non-native cattails in nutrient rich waters.<p>
<p>
     Unfortunately, the consequences of overproduction are not only related to
compositional changes in plant life, but extend higher up the food chain.  The
plants that are appearing as a result of this pattern change cannot support
many kinds of animal life.  Without a ready supply of food, many animals once
common to the Everglades are shrinking in number.  This is not just affecting
certain classes of animals, but the entire food chain.  Bird populations have
been reduced dramatically due to the striking drop in habitat as well as fish
and other aquatic species on which they feed.  One study suggests that the
present number of birds in the Everglades National Park area is only 10 percent
of what it used to be at the turn of the century.<p>
<p>
     Changes in the U.S. sugar policy have accelerated the domestic production of
sugarcane in recent years.  Sugar consumption in the U.S. was 9 million tons in
1981, a level which has seen no overall growth in the past thirteen years.
Sugarcane production in the U.S., however, has increased approximately 26
percent from 1981 to 1991, from 2.7 million tons to 3.4 million
tons.<A HREF="agpap10.html#21"><sup>21</sup></A>  This is due to the increasingly strict tariff barriers set
up by the USDA in an effort to maintain the domestic price of sugar.  In 1977,
the U.S. imported 6.1 million tons of sugar.  By 1993 that amount had dropped
77 percent to only 1.35 million tons.<A HREF="agpap10.html#22"><sup>22</sup></A><p>
<p>
     This increase in production has been accompanied by both increases in land use
and the application of  non-land inputs such as fertilizer.  In Florida, for
example, the acreage that was farmed and harvested for sugar went from 233,000
acres in the early 1970s to 346,000 in the early 1980s to a high mark of
420,000 acres in 1990.<A HREF="agpap10.html#23"><sup>23</sup></A>  Phosphorus concentrations in agricultural
runoff water pumped into Lake Okeechobee from the Everglades Agricultural Area
(EAA) also increased during this time, from a level of  0.095 to 0.314
milligrams per liter (mg/l) between the years 1973 to 1979 to a level of 0.188
to 0.573 mg/l for the years for 1983 to 1985.<A HREF="agpap10.html#24"><sup>24</sup></A><p>
<p>
     It is clear that the U.S. sugar program is responsible for not only increased
sugar production in south Florida, but also more intensive sugar cane
production and its attendant environmental impacts.  The elimination of the
U.S. sugar program would likely have a significant beneficial effect on the
environment of the Everglades.<p>

<CENTER>
<H2> Other Farm Programs</H2>
</CENTER>
<p>
     Various other programs aimed at supporting the farm sector can also have
secondary environmental effects.  For example, market orders are used by the
USDA to control many fruit and vegetable crops.<A HREF="agpap10.html#25"><sup>25</sup></A>  Under market
orders the USDA does not restrict acreage, instead it applies an often strict
standard on the appearance or &#147;quality&#148; of the product.  By
restricting the amount of produce which can qualify as grade &#147;A&#148; the
USDA restricts the amount which can be marketed.  Consequently, market orders
often provide incentives to produce the highest &#147;quality&#148; produce in
order to receive the highest grade and therefore the highest price.  If grades
are determined on the basis of cosmetic standards and cosmetic quality can only
be achieved through high chemical use rates, the production of that commodity
will likely involve greater use of chemicals.<A HREF="agpap10.html#26"><sup>26</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     Another example of increased chemical use occurs in the peanut program.  Under
this program the USDA licenses all peanut farmers and assigns each a yearly
quota.  A farmer cannot sell more than his yearly quota in the domestic market.
One of the conditions of the peanut program is that farmers are required to
grow peanuts on the same farm two out of three years, and the quota must always
be grown in the same county.<A HREF="agpap10.html#27"><sup>27</sup></A>  This leads to a situation where
peanuts are grown year after year in the same handful of counties and nowhere
else.  In some regions this means that extensive quantities of pesticides are
used.  For example, peanuts grown in Georgia use 13 pounds of pesticide per
acre, while those grown in Texas require only 3 pounds per acre.<A HREF="agpap10.html#28"><sup>28</sup></A>
From an environmental, and perhaps from an economic perspective, it would be
better to be able to grow peanuts where chemical inputs could be minimized.
The current peanut program, however, prohibits this.<p>

<H2> Current Fertilizer and Pesticide Use</H2>
</CENTER>

  <p>
     Beginning in the early 1960s, the USDA began surveying the use of fertilizers
and pesticides in the United States.  Since that time pesticide use has more
than doubled and commercial fertilizer use has tripled.  These increases
resulted from increased acreage but more importantly from higher application
rates and increased proportion of acres treated with chemicals (see charts). <p>
<p>
     Total chemical and fertilizer use peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Since then per acre application rates have remained roughly constant at about
2.2 pounds of pesticide per acre and 130 pounds of fertilizer per acre.
Removing current agricultural programs would likely result in a decline of this
use.<p>

<H2>Commodity Programs and Chemical Use</H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
     Every five years the USDA conducts a survey of U.S. agriculture known as the
Agriculture (or Ag) Census.  In the Ag Census, USDA compiles both state and
county statistics.  Included in the 1992 statistics are county by county
chemical use, fertilizer use and government payment statistics.  <p>
<p>
     The states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas were chosen
as the study area.  These six states were chosen for several reasons.  First,
they produce a significant quantity of subsidized crops.  Not all field crops
are subsidized.  The most common subsidized crops are corn, wheat, barley,
oats, sorghum, cotton and rice.  With the exception of cotton and rice all the
other crops are routinely grown throughout the mid-west.  Soybeans are the one
major crop grown in the analyzed region which does not receive direct
government payments or subsidies.  Because soybeans do not receive government
payments they are not included for purposes of subsidized crop acreage.<p>
<p>
     Second, varying soil and weather conditions will undoubtedly affect the
quantity of chemicals and fertilizers which farmers apply.  In order to
minimize this type of variation states were chosen which have roughly similar
growing conditions so that any variations in chemical and fertilizer use due to
subsidy participation would not be overwhelmed by geographical causes.<p>
<p>
     A county by county analysis of the six states showed a significant correlation
between subsidies and chemical use as well as between subsidies and fertilizer
use. Comparisons are based on the amount of subsidy a county received per acre
of subsidized cropland and the amount of chemical or fertilizer purchased per
acre of cropland.<p>
<p>
     USDA statistics do not give the acreage of land in each county which is
subsidized.  This value was computed by taking the percentage of farms
receiving subsidies multiplied by the total harvested crop acreage minus the
acres of harvest soybeans in that county.<p>
<p>
     Government payments per acre of subsidized cropland for each county are
determined by dividing the total amount of government payments received in the
county reported in the Ag Census by the estimated farm acreage enrolled in
subsidy programs.  Chemical and fertilizer rates were similarly computed by
dividing the amount of chemicals and fertilizer purchased in each county by the
harvested cropland acreage.<p>
<p>
     Analyses were initially done which compared subsidy rates with chemical and
fertilizer levels per acre of farmland.  This was considered less accurate as
many types of farmland do not use chemicals or fertilizers.  Idle farmland,
pastureland and dairy farms, although included in farmland acreage, do not
contribute to significant pesticide and fertilizer use.  Normalizing both
subsidy rates, chemical and fertilizer use for the amount of land harvested for
crops gives a clearer picture of potential environmental effects of current
policies.<p>
<p>
     The correlation coefficient of government payments per acre of subsidized
cropland versus dollars of chemical use per acre cropland is 0.61 and for
fertilizer use it is 0.62.  The R squared for chemical use and fertilizer use
is 0.37 and 0.38 respectively.  This suggests that nearly 40 percent of the
variation in chemical and fertilizer use per acre can be explained by
government subsidy programs (see appendix #1).<p>
<p>
     Because there is such variation due to other factors, such as geography, crop
type, prevalence of pests and poor soil conditions, an averaging technique was
used to further clarify the correlation between chemical and fertilizer use and
participation in subsidy programs.  All data points were arranged in sequential
order according to government payments per acre, in ascending order (i.e.
lowest government payments per acre to highest government payments per acre).
Every ten data points were then averaged to yield both an average government
payment and average chemical and fertilizer consumption.  Comparing the ten
county averages gives a clearer picture of the effect of subsidies on chemical
and fertilizer use.  (See charts on pages 11 and 12.)<p>
<p>
     The correlation coefficient for ten county averages is significantly higher,
0.76 and 0.75 respectively.  It should be noted that both graphs show that
beyond a certain point agricultural subsidies have little or no effect on
chemical and fertilizer use.  This is what one would intuitively expect.  As
subsidies are initially offered the incentive to maximize production using
non-land inputs is greatest.  But as more and more chemicals and fertilizer are
used, their marginal benefit is decreased, (i.e. once all the weeds and insects
are killed there is little to no benefit from additional pesticide
applications.)  Consequently, beyond a certain point subsidies do not
significantly effect chemical or fertilizer use.<p>
<p>
     A regression analysis of government payments per acre of subsidized cropland
versus chemical and fertilizer use yielded results which suggest that
government payments contribute significantly to intensive chemical and
fertilizer use.  The upper 95 percent confidence interval of the y-intercept,
where subsidy payments are zero, is $10.42 of chemical use per acre, and $18.18
of fertilizer use per acre.  The average per acre chemical use in the analyzed
region is $16.1 per acre, and the average fertilizer use is $25.7 per acre.<p>
<p>
     The regression analysis suggests that current chemical and fertilizer use is
highly intensive due, in large part, to federal commodity programs.  In other
words, eliminating or reducing the commodity programs would decrease per acre
chemical and fertilizer use.  This model suggests that a fifty percent
reduction in subsidies would decrease chemical use by an estimated 17 percent
and would decrease fertilizer use by and estimated 14 percent.  <p>
<p>
     The complete elimination of subsidies could result in a 35 percent reduction
in chemical use per acre and a 29 percent reduction in fertilizer use per acre.
Although this most likely represents an extreme upper bound, it is not
inconsistent with the findings of Painter and Young in North
Carolina.<A HREF="agpap10.html#29"><sup>29</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Though suggesting that agricultural policies have a significant on-the-ground
effect, in terms of increased chemical and fertilizer use per acre, this model
is of limited value in evaluating scenarios of total chemical and fertilizer
use.  Principally this is due to the fact that as subsidy levels decrease
farmers tend to have increased options for crop production.  For example,
eliminating deficiency payments and the Conservation Reserve Program might mean
that farmers would plant more acres of commodity but use fewer chemicals per
acre.  If enough additional acres were planted more pounds of chemicals and
fertilizers might actually be used.  On the other hand, more acres might be
planted but the reduced use of chemicals and fertilizers might be so great that
even with the additional acreage a total reduction of chemical and fertilizer
use may be achieved.<p>

<H2>Environmental Fate of Agricultural Chemicals </H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
     The addition of larger quantities of agricultural chemicals to crops does not
directly imply increased environmental harm.  The fate of the chemicals once
they have been sprayed on the fields has as much or more to do due with actual
environmental damage as the quantities of chemicals used.  A persistent
pesticide, for example, is more likely to cause environmental harm than one
which degrades quickly in the field before it has a chance to run off into
surface water or seep into ground water.<A HREF="agpap10.html#30"><sup>30</sup></A><p>
<p>
     It is conceivable that the current policy of reduced acreage could result in
less chemicals and fertilizers entering into the surface waters if the land set
aside in idling programs acts as a buffer zone, especially between cropland and
surface water.  The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in particular was at
least initially designed to serve this very sort of function.<p>
<p>
     Originally the CRP was fashioned as a program to reduce soil erosion.  Under
the CRP, land which was considered highly erodible was to be put into the
reserve.  In recent years, however, the environmental benefits of the CRP have
been questioned.<p>
<p>
     One concern with the CRP has been the proximity of CRP land to surface waters.
An analysis was conducted of two Illinois streams to determine the effect of
enrollment in the CRP on sedimentation.<A HREF="agpap10.html#31"><sup>31</sup></A>   A total of 15.6 percent
of the cropland in the first watershed was enrolled in CRP and 26.5 percent of
cropland in the second watershed was enrolled in CRP.  Despite these relatively
high percentages of enrollment the study found that sedimentation in the two
streams was reduced by only 0.0125 and 0.265 respectively.  In other words,
even though a quarter of the cropland was idle, stream sedimentation was
reduced by a mere quarter of one percent.<A HREF="agpap10.html#32"><sup>32</sup></A>  The authors noted that
one of the reasons for this apparent lack of reduction in sedimentation was due
to the fact that, &#147;few of the CRP enrollments were in stream locations
where hydrologic theory indicates they would be most effective in trapping and
stabilizing existing near stream sediments.&#148;<A HREF="agpap10.html#33"><sup>33</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Additional studies have shown that this phenomenon is not isolated to Illinois
streams.  Analysis of the land enrolled in the CRP found that out of 36.4
million acres only 255,000 acres consisted of buffer strips separating cropland
for surface waters or wetlands.<A HREF="agpap10.html#34"><sup>34</sup></A>  An estimated 5.5 million acres of
buffer zones throughout the nation remain as cropland.  To date, acreage idling
programs appear to have negligible pollution control benefits.<p>

<H2>Conclusion</H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
     There is considerable evidence to suggest that many agricultural policies have
a negative effect on environmental quality.  Debate over pollution,
particularly water pollution, has turned away from point source and
increasingly focuses on non-point source pollution.  As a large component of
non-point source pollution, agriculture will increasingly come in conflict with
environmental regulations.  Farmers and farm groups, however, have historically
been resistant to increased environmental regulations.  One possibility which
could both improve the environment and decrease federal spending would be to
phase out commodity and other agricultural programs which have been shown to
have a detrimental effect on the environment.  To date, however, few
environmental lobbying organizations have endorsed this approach.<p>
<p>
     Overall, consumers, taxpayers and the environment would be better off under a
free market agricultural policy.  Direct and indirect payments to farmers
should be eliminated, and all supply control programs should be ended.  Several
commodities, such as soybeans and potatoes, are currently operated in this way
and should serve as models for all federal agricultural policy.<p>

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
     In the current debate over the re-authorization of the Clean Water Act,
environmentalists, in their zeal to condemn big business as the source of
America&#146;s &#147;dirty&#148; water, have overlooked a simple fact.
Agricultural runoff is now the number one source of pollution in the nations
rivers, streams, and lakes.  As many other sources of pollution have been
controlled agriculture has emerged as the largest source of water pollution in
the nation.<p>
<p>
     Although the last decade has seen an increased awareness of the environmental
effects of U.S. agriculture, the fundamental premises of U.S. agricultural
policy have remained intact since the Great Depression.  These farm programs
were designed in an era before commercial pesticides, fertilizers and modern
farming techniques.  In many instances they have had and continue to have
detrimental effects on the environment.<p>
<p>
     The U.S. sugar program is responsible for not only increased sugar production
in south Florida but also more intensive sugar cane production, contributing to
the increased phosphorus contamination of the Everglades which is disrupting
the unique nature of the ecosystem.  The elimination of the U.S. sugar program
would likely have a significant beneficial effect on the Everglades ecosystem.
<p>
     <p>
     Even the field crop programs can have detrimental environmental effects.
Wheat, corn and field grain programs contribute to the intensive use of land.
An analysis of data from six major farm states shows that a fifty percent
reduction in subsidies would decrease per acre chemical use by an estimated 17
percent and fertilizer use by and estimated 14 percent.  The complete
elimination of subsidies could result in a 35 percent reduction in chemical use
per acre and a 29 percent reduction in fertilizer use per acre. <p>
<p>
     Another example of government induced environmental damage is the USDA peanut
program.  By requiring peanuts to be grown in only a handful of counties in the
entire country, USDA indirectly increases the use of pesticides on peanuts.<p>
<p>
     Overall, consumers, taxpayers and the environment would be better off under a
free market agricultural policy.  Direct and indirect payments to farmers
should be eliminated and all supply control programs should be ended.<p>

<H1>AUTONOMY AND AUTOMOBILITY</H1>

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>



<P>As the automobile enters its second century, it is increasingly attacked as a
public malefactor.  The fact that automobiles cause deaths and pollution does
not seem sufficient to explain the intensity of the opposition to them.  These
are only its costs; what we still must account for are its benefits.<p>
<p>
	The focus of this paper will not be on the many and varied instrumental uses
to which the automobile is put, but on what is intrinsic to automobility &#151;
the capacity to move oneself from place to place.  Automobility directly
complements autonomy &#151; the distinctively human capacity to be
self-directing.  Automobiles enable us to extend the scope and magnitude of our
self-direction, and for that reason they are worthwhile.  <p>

<UL>

<LI>Automobiles allow us to choose where we will live, where we will work, and to
separate these two choices from each other.  <p>

<LI>Automobiles enhance knowledge.  From watching geese fly to Canada, to
visiting a battleground, to attending an opera, no form of transportation
combines local maneuverability with extended range to the degree that the
automobile does.<p>

<LI>Automobiles enhance privacy.  While public transportation is not always bad,
and sometimes is the only viable alternative, it necessarily encroaches on
privacy.  The automobile is for 20th century American society the
quintessential bastion of privacy.  The failure of diamond lanes and other
car-pooling inducements may be viewed as a failure of policy, but it can also
be seen as a result of the valid human desire for privacy.<p>

<LI>Automobiles allow control over one&#146;s immediate environment.  Surely one
reason for the fondness people hold for their cars is the scope of control over
this environment, which is not possible with any alternate transportation mode.
<p>
</UL>

	In short, what is conspicuously left off the balance sheet of automobility is
its intrinsic goodness of promoting autonomy.<p>
<p>
	When compared with alternate means of transportation, the automobile is the
prime vehicle of self-directedness.  Its most strident critics are well aware
of its relationship to autonomy, and that is precisely why they are so wary of
it. People who drive automobiles upset the patterns spun from the policy
intellectual&#146;s brain.  They wish to drive, and their exercises of choice
also have the effect of rendering the planners&#146; conceptions moot.  <p>
<p>
	In the end, highways are so heavily used because millions of people judge that
driving enhances their lives.  The striking feature of the critique of highway
building programs is that what should be taken as a sign of great success is
instead presented as a mark of failure.  But the only failure has been with the
critics&#146; attempts to talk people out of their cars and out of the
neighborhoods and workplaces that their cars have rendered accessible.  This
failure is well-deserved.  Automobile motoring is good because people wish to
engage in it, and they wish to engage in it because it is inherently good.<p>

<H1>WHO NEEDS AN EXIMBANK?</H1>
by William H. Lash III

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Despite being the world&#146;s leading exporter, the U.S. spends over 3
billion tax dollars annually on export promotion activities.  The most
egregious member of federal government&#146;s confederacy of dunces is easily
the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Eximbank.<p>
<p>
	With a nearly $900 million budget, the Eximbank provides several means of
export finance:<p>
<UL>

<LI><i>	subsidized loans</i> to foreign purchasers of U.S. products;<p>

<LI><i>	loan guarantees</i> to support loans made by private sector banks to
foreign purchasers of U.S. products;<p>

<LI><i>	loans and guarantees of working capital</i> for U.S. producers seeking to
enter export markets;<p>

<LI><i>	subsidized project finance</i>, loans or guarantees by banks to finance
foreign infrastructure projects in developing countries.<p>
</UL>

Despite these programs, the vast majority of U.S. exporters owe none of their
success to Eximbank finance.  Small businesses typically shun Eximbank programs
due to the delays in processing the indeterminable red tape. <p>
<p>
	Some industries do benefit from the Eximbank's programs, most notably the
aviation industry.   In fact, the Eximbank's critics often refer to it as
&#147;Boeing&#146;s Bank.&#148;  The Eximbank is corporate welfare with a fancy
name.  If foreign government purchasers of U.S.-made aircraft are creditworthy,
private sector banks ought to finance the transactions.  A country with
two-thirds of the world&#146;s market share cannot be suffering from market
failure.  <p>
<p>
	The Eximbank is a component of the Clinton administration&#146;s National
Export Strategy (NES), an aggressive foray into industrial policy and central
planning.  It empowers the federal government to target and develop:<p>
<UL>

<LI><i>Big Emerging Markets</i> &#151; Mexico, Argentina, Poland, Brazil,
China, Indonesia, India, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey;<p>

<LI><i>Big Emerging Sectors</i> &#151; aerospace, telecommunications,
information technologies, environmental technology, medical equipment and
infrastructure industries.<p>

</UL>
	Under a new &#147;green&#148; agenda, special consideration must be given to
ecologically-friendly exports &#151; demonstrating that the Eximbank is driven
by political pressures and not sound lending practices. <p>
<p>
	In the final analysis, Eximbank financing does not determine success in the
global marketplace.  Created in 1934 to facilitate trade with the Soviet Union,
the Eximbank is a government agency masquerading as a market-based financial
institution.  Sixty years later, the Eximbank should follow the lead of its
first customers, and go out of business.<p>

<H1>PICK A NUMBER<BR>
A Critique of Contingent Valuation Methodology and its Application<BR>
in Public Policy
</H1>
by Roger Bate

<BR>

<BR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>How much would you be willing to pay for an untouched expanse of wilderness?
The process by which this question can be answered is called Contingent
Valuation (CV).  CV attempts to quantify the &#147;satisfaction&#148; of
knowing that a natural resource exists, called a &#147;nonuse value&#148;
(NUV), regardless of any actual attempt to enjoy it. <i> </i> Once enumerated,
NUVs could  be used to impose liability for injuries to natural resources
placing billions of dollars at stake.<p>
The CV procedure involves asking people what they would pay, through increased
taxes, prices, or some other mechanism, to protect a valued environmental
resource.  For example, CV surveys provide respondents with a selection of
choices, such as a set of charities. You may be willing to give $100 to charity
and there may be eight separate charities that you find appealing. It is
therefore possible that in separate CV surveys, your stated willingness to
donate to charity could equal $800 in total, even though $100 is all that will
be given.  Obviously, this approach has serious problems including the
following:<p>
<UL>
<LI>the survey process can create the very values which they purport to measure;<p>

<LI>answers are likely to be biased by strategic considerations regarding the uses
to which  the survey could be put;<p>

<LI>survey results are often inconsistent;<p>

<LI>individuals are ill-trained to evaluate the monetary value of environmental
damage; <p>

<LI>rarely do individuals have experience in purchasing environmental assets;<p>

<LI>results cannot be empirically verified.<p>

</UL>
In sum, CV results are uncertain, subjective and speculative. <p>
CV surveys are further hindered by a fundamental difference between an actual
choice and a potential preference.  People may state a preference  for many
things but in actuality choose something entirely different. <p>
<UL>
<LI>A choice is superior to a preference because with the latter &#147;there is no
cost to being wrong, and therefore no incentive to undertake the mental effort
to be accurate;&#148; <p>
<LI>The only way to discover the values people place on things is through the
actual choices made by individuals. <p>

</UL>
Contingent valuation is an attempt to replicate the workings of the market
without a system where natural resource sites have well-defined private
property rights.  Markets allow people to make choices based on the amount they
are willing to pay for a good or service.   CV surveys  bypass the workings of
a true market process<i>.</i> The results from these surveys therefore cannot
be equated with market behavior, and any use of these figures should be treated
with skepticism.  <p>
Despite these problems, CV surveys are becoming more prevalent.  For instance,
the 1989 Supreme Court declared, in <i>Ohio v. U.S. Department of Interior</i>,
that nonuse values can be used to measure damages in liability cases.  <i>CV
surveys are likely to result in unwanted litigation, and could be presented in
liability claims at considerable social cost.</i>   Because the use of surveys
cannot be tested or verified empirically the valuation of natural resources
through CV is simply inappropriate.  The results may be interesting, but are
little more than picking a number, any number.<p>

<H1>HOW AND WHY TO TRANSFER BLM LANDS TO THE STATES

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Devolving federal responsibilities to the states has emerged as a central
theme of the 104th Congress.  No area has greater potential for
decentralization than Western public lands.  In the eleven westernmost of the
lower 48 states, the federal government owns 47 percent of the land.
Historically, the control over the use of land has been considered the most
local of government functions.  Yet in the rural West, federal ownership means
that federal agencies are in effect the planning and zoning boards for much of
the land.  Federal land ownership on the scale seen in the western United
States is a basic anomaly in the American federal system.<p>
<p>
	A transfer of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands to the states would
signify the end of the progressive era in public land management which sought
to rely upon scientific management of public resources.  This era is coming to
a close and federal policy should reflect this fact.<p>
	<p>
	One of the major advantages of state ownership of land would be a much wider
leeway for experimentation in land management approaches, as compared with the
one-size-fits-all approach of the current federal system.  The current lack of
flexibility on the public lands fails to reflect the diversity of values,
political cultures, geography and other key features across the West.<p>
<p>
	On BLM rangelands, the general economic deficiencies of federal land
management are exacerbated by the very low productivity of the surface areas
being managed.  Indeed, it is remarkable that an agency can lose money on the
management of a natural resource asset that includes 10 percent of the land
area of the lower 48 states, 33 percent of the total coal reserves of the
United States, and 5 percent of the nation&#146;s oil and gas reserves.  This
failure on the part of the BLM reflects the political pressures that have come
to dominate the management of public lands, resulting in minimum revenues and
maximum costs.<p>
	There are a number of political obstacles to transferring BLM lands to western
states.  Not all states will gain fiscally in the short run from the
acquisition of federal lands.  Some state governments are thus ambivalent about
the possibility of taking ownership of BLM lands.  Many ranchers are concerned
that transferring lands would threaten their current status on the lands.
Another obstacle is the argument that to do so would give away public resources
of great value without any return to the taxpayer.  Despite these obstacles,
there are numerous factors that could increase the possibility of a transfer.<p>
<p>
	The states at present own substantial lands, many of them remaining from large
transfers of land to states in the nineteenth century.  The management of these
lands was little studied until recently.  Although the conventional wisdom had
been that states were doing a poor job, these studies on the whole have
assessed state management in considerably more positive terms.  Indeed, for the
state holdings in large contiguous blocks that are most manageable and thus are
more comparable to many federal lands, the state record compares favorably with
federal results.<p>
<p>
	As lands generally having few nationally distinctive characteristics, the BLM
lands are a logical starting place for any state transfer proposal.  The
following principles could provide a basis for developing improved future
legislation to offer western states the option of taking possession of BLM
lands.<p>
<DL>
<DD>
1.	Formally recognize rancher grazing rights to rangeland forage;<p>
2. 	Complete the wilderness designations for BLM lands and develop a process to
identify any other nationally significant lands;<p>
3. 	Clarify that BLM lands transferred to states would not then be subject to
federal environmental impact statement and land-use planning requirements;<p>
4. 	Provide that any existing endangered species requirements for BLM lands
will be maintained in effect;<p>
5.	Provide that the Endangered Species Act will otherwise apply to transferred
lands in the same manner it applies to existing state lands;<p>
6.	Exclude the O&amp;C forest lands in Western Oregon from any transfer
proposal;<p>
7.	Establish open-access easements assuring continued ordinary dispersed
recreation on transferred lands;<p>
8.	Consider maintaining fire fighting as a federal function;<p>
9.	Convert existing federal spending on BLM lands into block grants to be
gradually phased out;<p>
10.	Phase out the federal share of revenues from existing federal mineral
leases over a similar interim period;<p>
11.	Immediately transfer the ownership of all unleased federal leasable
minerals to the states;<p>
12.	Provide that all mining claims on transferred BLM land will be administered
for twenty years under the terms of federal law;<p>
13.	Immediately transfer ownership of all federal &#147;hardrock&#148; minerals
below BLM and state lands to the states;<p>
14.	Transfer inholdings of existing state lands that lie within nationally
significant areas to the federal government;<p>
15.	Transfer BLM lands and state inholdings to Indian tribes where these lands
are located within the boundaries of Indian reservations;<p>
16.	Retain the liability at the federal level for paying future cleanup costs
of any toxic waste sites on current BLM land;<p>

17.	Require that a state transfer request be approved by the state&#146;s legislature and signed by the governor.<p>

"Anyone who has struggled to make sense of the history of public lands
management in the American West will want to read this book.  It assembles a
marvelous argument for the decentralization of natural resource and land
management in the West.  Along the way, Nelson also untangles the brushpile of
law, policy, executive fiat, and political pandering that have punctuated the
public lands history of the West."

<i>Environmental Politics:  Public Costs, Private Rewards</i><p>

co-edited by <a href="fred.html">Fred Smith</A> and Michael Greve<p>

What really happens when environmentalist legislation is passed?  Who is hurt and who is helped?  How does our modern democratic process lead to the
systematic overthrow of good intentions in the service of narrow political
gain?  CEI's first book effort is a collection of essays whose topics range
from Superfund and ozone depletion to clean air and property rights.<p>

<i>Environmentalism at the Crossroads:  Green Activism in
America</i><p>

by <a href="adler.html">Jonathan H. Adler</A>

<p>An analysis and overview of environmental lobbying organizations, the policies they promote, and trends in American environmentalism, past, present and future.  Includes appendices providing background on environmental groups from Audubon to Zero Population Growth.


<P>"Environmentalism at the Crossroads" clearly documents how Washington environmental groups have become yet another special interest calling for more government in our everyday lives.  This book is a wake-up call to all those who beleive--as I once did--that environmentalists are in their corner." --<b>Ann G. Corcoran</b>,
		former lobbyist, National Audubon Society
		founding editor, Land Rights Letter

<P>	"Jonathan Adler's book makes a strong argument that the environmental movement has strayed from its roots--its early ideals and its natural allies.  The further it strays, the more it risks.  This is a message that some will not like, but it is important for all to hear and weigh." --from the preface by <b>John Stossel</b>,
		ABC "20/20" Correspondent

<P>"Jonathan Adler well articulates the choices America and the world face in protecting the environment. His book tracks the advocates for increasingly radical and coercive environmental laws that rely on bad science to produce expensive policy failures. Adler explains why successful conservation requires a market for choices by free people." --<b>Hon. Malcolm Wallop</b>, former Senator (R-WY)

<P>The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is a pro-market, public policy group
committed to advancing the principles of free enterprise and limited
government.  Founded in 1984 by <A HREF="fred.html">Fred L. Smith, Jr.</A>, CEI emphasizes the
marketing and implementation of classical liberal ideals. <p>

<p>CEI utilizes a five-point management approach to affecting public policy:
analysis, education, coalition building, advocacy and litigation.  Its purpose
is to advance the free-market agenda, believing limited government and
competition best serve the public interest.<p>

<p>A non-profit, tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code, CEI relies entirely on donations from corporations, foundations,
and private individuals with an interest in restoring individual liberties and
economic freedom.  <i>All contributions are tax deductible.</i><p>

<P>
The Republican drive to reform environmental law looks to be stalled. 
Last week, for example, the House backed off 17 proposed limits on the
Environmental Protection Agency.  Other reforms face similar trouble. 

<P>The problem, in the words of Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., is that "The
Republican party is quickly becoming known as the anti-environment
party." So long as the GOP seems to just want to roll back environmental
protection, Boehlert and his allies in both parties can make a powerful
case. 

<P>But Boehlert's answer--dropping reform efforts--is wrong.  Instead, the
new Republican majority should do what's done on issues from welfare to
Medicare: Present a clear alternative to the status quo. 

<P>Reformers should articulate their own long range vision for environmental
protection.  They must demonstrate a positive desire to use GOP principles
to achieve these goals.  They can show how free markets and limited
government will work better than the sprawling bureaucracies now in place. 

<P>The need for dramatic change should be clear.  Policies that effectively
curbed pollution in the '70s are too rigid and clumsy to deal with the
concerns of the '90s.  The haystack environmental problems of yesteryear
have been eliminated, while the needle-in-a-haystack environmental
problems remain.  New problems require new responses. 

<P>Conventional command-and-control environmental policies are no longer
worth their costs.  This year Americans will spend well over $150 billion
to comply with pollution control measures.  Yet many such rules no longer
do much for the environment. 

<P>In some cases, these laws actually harm the environment.  Hazardous-waste
and species protection measures, for instance, can actually encourage
increased waste production and destruction of habitat.  Removing such
perverse incentives is not anti-environment. 

<P>More broadly, reformers should aim to eliminate destructive subsidies and
encourage markets to address environmental concerns. 

<P>Most environmental problems are not caused by market failures but by a
failure to have markets.  Republicans know that sound stewardship begins
with private property.  Their pro-environment agenda should thus include
protecting property rights. 

<P>Regulatory approaches may sill be called for.  But these should focus more
on preventing harm to people and their properties, and less on
prescriptive bureaucratic edicts.  There is nothing pro-environment about
generating paperwork or letting the federal government micromanage
industry decisions. 

<P>This agenda should also move decisions out of Washington to the people who
will bear the costs--and reap the benefits--of the policy decision.  It
makes no sense for Washington to set environmental priorities for every
community in the nation. 

<P>Voters are ready to hear this message.

<P>A January 1995 Time/CNN poll shows that 68% of Americans believe
environmental regulations should be "subject to an analysis to determine
whether eliminating that risk justifies the economic cost."  A May 1995
Roper Starch poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe landowners
should be compensated when laws protecting wetlands or endangered species
devalue their land. 

<P>Both policies are key to the GOP regulatory reform agenda. 

<P>Voters also sympathize with the drive to return many environmental
decisions to the state and local level.  President Clinton's pollster,
Stanley Greenberg, conducted a series of focus groups for
environmentalists.  He concluded that "For ordinary citizens, devolution
is a way of making the environmental regime more responsive, more flexible
and sensible." 

<P>This is a message Congress' reformers should push in the environmental
debate. 

<P>Polls consistently show that Americans call themselves environmentalists. 
We believe in environmental protection.  But Roper Starch found that the
share of Americans who believe such measures "have gone not far enough"
has dropped by nearly a third since 1992, from 63% to 43%.  And the number
who believe they "have gone too far" has more than doubled, from 10% to
22%. 

<P>Americans are ready for a pro-environment, anti-regulatory message.  The
GOP's reformers just have to start sending it.

<H2>THE HIGH COST OF COOL<BR>
The Economic Impact of the CFC Phaseout</H2>
by <A HREF="/lieber.html">Ben Lieberman</A>

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are an important class of compounds.  They have an
impact on the life of nearly every American.   Yet, as a result of
environmental fears, their production will soon be eliminated - by the year
1996.  In making this decision, little consideration was given to the costs of
eliminating such a widely used class of compounds over a relatively short
period of time.<p>
<p>
	This study examines the probable economic cost of the CFC phaseout on the
refrigeration and air conditioning sector in the United States.  The estimated
cost of the CFC phaseout is $44.5 to $99.4 billion over the next decade.  This
estimate breaks down as follows (figures in billions):<p>

<UL>

	<LI>   Vehicle air conditioners           &#151; $28.0 - $42.0<p>
	<LI>    Energy consumption               &#151; $     0 - $32.1<p>
  	<LI> Domestic refrigeration             &#151; $  4.0 - $ 8.0<p>
	<LI>   Commercial refrigeration         &#151; $  3.0 - $ 5.4<p>
	<LI>   Chillers                                    &#151; $  4.4 - $ 5.0<p>
	<LI>   HCFCs &amp; HCFC Equipment    &#151; $  5.1 - $ 6.9<p>

</UL>
Compliance with the law will impose large up-front costs on businesses and
individuals.  Much equipment will need to be replaced or modified
(retrofitted).<p>
<p>
	After decades of fine-tuning and extensive field experience, air conditioning
and refrigeration equipment using CFCs has become very reliable.  In contrast,
most CFC replacements are new, and manufacturers are still near the bottom of
the learning curve in making the massive technological changes necessary.<p>
<p>
	Because of the accelerated phase-out, which provides a limited time frame in
which to end dependence on CFCs, non-CFC systems are being rushed into use,
despite many unsolved problems.  In effect, a multi-billion dollar field test
of experimental equipment is being conducted at consumer expense.  The
frequency of break downs, and the costs of repairs can be expected to increase
for many applications.  <p>
<p>
	The CFC phaseout may well be the single most expensive environmental measure
taken to date.  During the policy debate, the costs were underemphasized to the
point that they never became an important factor.  The impact on consumers was
scarcely considered.  It may be too late to reverse course on the CFC phaseout,
but it can serve as a lesson for the future.

<H1>RACHEL'S FOLLY<BR>
The End of Chlorine
</H1>
by Michelle Malkin and Michael Fumento

<H2>OVERVIEW</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>The environmentalists are right about one thing: Dirty water kills.
Millions are people are dying needlessly all over the world because of it.  But
are the main culprits man-made pollution and chlorinated chemicals?  Try
endemic poverty, bad plumbing and lack of access to basic water chlorination
techniques. Every year, nearly 1.5 billion people -- mostly children under
five -- suffer from preventable water-borne diseases such as cholera,
typhoid fever, amoebic dysentery, bacterial gastroenteritis, giardiasis,
schistosomiasis, and various viral diseases such as hepatitis A.  Yet now there
is a mounting campaign, led by environmental activists in wealthy
industrialized nations, to eliminate every last man-made chlorine molecule from
the face of the earth.  <p>

	Greenpeace, the international environmental advocacy group,  launched the
first salvo in 1991 with its call to phase out completely &#147;the use,
export, and import of all organochlorines, elemental chlorine, and chlorinated
oxidizing agents (e.g. chlorine dioxide and sodium
hypochlorite)."<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>  As Greenpeace's Joe Thornton
explains, "There are no uses of chlorine which we regard as
safe."<sup>2&nbsp;</sup> Yet chlorination -- considered one of the
greatest advances ever in public health and hygiene -- is almost
universally accepted as the method of choice for purifying water
supplies.<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>  In the United States alone, 98 percent of public
water systems are purified by chlorine or chlorine-based products. Alternative
chemical disinfectants such as ozone and other short-lived free radicals have
been used in water treatment, but none has demonstrated the safety and efficacy
of chlorination.<sup>4&nbsp;</sup><p>

	Chlorine is a ubiquitous element, one of the basic building blocks of all
matter in the universe.  In fact, scientists are only now beginning to discover
and identify the great number of natural organohalogens present in our world.
By one estimate, Mother Nature manufactures at least 1,500 chlorine-containing
chemicals.<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>  Volcanic activity, forest and grass fires, fungi,
algae, ferns and the decomposition of seaweed all release chlorinated organics
into the environment.<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>  Our own bodies produce hypochlorite to
fight infection and hydrochloric acid for proper digestion.<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>
And there is, of course, sodium chloride -- common table salt --
present naturally in mines, lakes and seawater, found in our blood, sweat and
tears, and essential to the diets of humans and animals.<p>

Clearly, a goal of total chlorine removal from the environment would be
unattainable. And the potential human toll resulting from its eradication is
manifest and staggering. Every major scientific investigation of chlorinated
water has concluded that the real and proven health risks from microbial
contamination of drinking water far exceed the uncertain and hypothetical risks
of cancer from chlorination and its byproducts.<i>  Why, then, are governmental
bodies around the world embracing Greenpeace's caprice -- absolute
zero tolerance for man-made chlorine -- when the hazards to humanity are so
explicitly large?</i><p>
Perhaps the answer can be traced back to the publication of Rachel
Carson's<i> Silent Spring </i>in 1962.  The book is a lyrical tract, the
bible of the environmental movement.  Carson was the first to bear witness
against chlorinated hydrocarbons and other "elixirs of death" created
by "the ingenious laboratory manipulation of molecules."  She
condemned these arrogant manipulations, prophesied a man-made cancer epidemic,
and popularized the zero-based approach to regulating synthetic chemicals.  A
daunting theme runs throughout <i>Silent Spring</I> -- that man's
ingenuity would be his own worst enemy.  And therein lies the essence of
Rachel's folly.  Carson and her intellectual heirs in the environmental
movement embrace a mistaken vision of technology.  It is an impaired vision
that considers only the risks of industrial chemical compounds, and not the
risks created by their absence.<p>
<p>
	As the late Aaron Wildavsky observed, there are few unalloyed good things in
the world.  Rarely does one find a substance that has benefits but not
costs.<sup>8&nbsp;</sup>  "Sunsetting" all uses of chlorine may
reduce the hypothetical risks associated with such compounds as dioxin, DDT and
PCBs.  At the same time, however, a blanket ban on chlorine would increase the
enormous risks of waterborne microbial infection here and in underdeveloped
countries that can now barely afford chlorine disinfectants (let alone costly
substitutes such as ozone or ultraviolet light treatment).  <p>
<p>
	Even more daunting, a chlorine phase-out would halt the production of most
plastics, pesticides and chlorine-containing drugs like chloroquine, a key
anti-malarial drug; halogenated tetracycline-based antibiotics like
chlortetracycline; and the family of halogenated antipsychotics such as
chlorpromazine.<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>  According to one industry-backed report,
almost 85 percent of the pharmaceuticals manufactured worldwide require
chlorine at some stage of production; 96 percent of crop-protection chemicals
are chlorine-dependent.<sup>10&nbsp;</sup>  From safe drinking water, clean
swimming pools and pest-free crops, to flame retardants and food packaging,
quality white paper and bright socks, Saran wrap, plastic bottles, garden
hoses, window frames and sturdy plumbing pipes, the end of chlorine would spell
the end of modern civilization itself.  <p>

<b>RESOLVING THE TRAGEDY </b><p>
<b>OF THE COMMONS BY </b><p>
<b>CREATING PRIVATE PROPERTY </b><p>
<b>RIGHTS IN WILDLIFE</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
by Robert J. Smith<p>
During man&#146;s relatively brief existence on this planet, he has relied on
the bounty of its flora and fauna for his existence.  He has harvested wildlife
for food, clothing, shelter, medicines, beasts of burden, pets, and
companionship.  Over most of this period, this harvesting and exploitation had
little impact on those resources.  Human population was very low, and most
animal and plant populations were relatively large.  Animal and plant
communities, populations, and species that became extinct did so from other
than human causes.  Only in recent centuries  has  man&#146;s exploitation of
wildlife begun to have a deleterious effect. This was the result of rapid
population growth, more efficient means of capture and kill, and expansion into
new continents, especially islands and tropical areas where many species of
wildlife had evolved with small, localized populations and without contact with
man or his camp followers, such as dogs, cats, and rats. Western exploration
and colonization quickly created  serious problems of overharvesting and
overexploitation of wildlife and led to a slow  development of human-caused
extinctions. <p>
However, there is increasing evidence that primitive man also had a profound
impact on many species.  Humans did not live in the idyllic harmony with nature
that has been so rapturously  portrayed by the more romantic environmentalists
who question the direction of modern life and call for a new environmental
ethic. At least some of the large mammals, such as mammoths and mastodons, that
roamed the earth during the Pleistocene Epoch and immediately thereafter and
whose disappearance has been attributed to natural causes, were forced into
extinction by primitive men with primitive tools.  They drove herds over
cliffs, into swamps, or into box canyons, often setting massive grassland fires
to assist in the drive.<p>
It would appear that precivilized, or at least preindustrial, man exploited
wildlife just as carelessly and as effectively as does modern man.  The
mythologized American Indians also used wasteful and ecologically unsound
methods of hunting and killing.  Regarding the Plains Indians&#146;
exploitation of the buffalo, Baden, Stroup, and Thurman point out that <p>
. . . it is generally held that these highly diverse groups shared a common
reverence for the land and the interdependencies of nature that provided man
his niche. . . .The actual behavior attributed to these cultures reads like an
admonition from Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of the ecology movement.<p>
Prior to the introduction of the horse, the hunting of bison was uncertain, and
relatively unproductive.  In the pre-horse period  the capture of a buffalo was
comparatively rare.  Its biomass was highly valued and hence fully utilized.<p>
In effect, the introduction of the horse, steel tools and later  firearms
lowered the &#147;price&#148; of the animal. As the price fell due to
technological adaptation, patterns of utilization changed dramatically.  During
this period many buffalo were killed by Indians merely for the tongue and the
two strips of back strap.  By 1840 the Indian had driven the buffalo from
portions of its original habitat.<sup>1</sup><p>
It is not true, however, that the Indians&#146; &#147;wasteful&#148; use of
wildlife occurred after the introduction of white man&#146;s tools.  There is
abundant evidence that the Indians engaged in wasteful harvesting methods
whenever the opportunity arose.  Long before they had horses and rifles, the
Plains tribes regularly set vast prairie fires in the late summer and fall in
order to stampede buffalo herds over cliffs or bluffs.  &#147;A successful
drive produced a large number of carcasses, often more than could be used
before the meat spoiled. . . .At a large kill much of the meat spoiled before
it could be processed.&#148;<sup>2</sup>  Fires were so commonly used that
millions of acres were blackened each year.  The Washo tribe of the Great Basin
lived in an extremely hostile environment, barely eking out a precarious
existence, yet, during the fall they would drive such enormous numbers of
jackrabbits into their nets that after the skins were taken, the meat was left
to rot.<sup>3</sup>	<p>
Overexploitation of wildlife is not a peculiar characteristic of Western man,
nor is it a consequence of some form of the modern economic system or the much
maligned &#147;commerce&#148; so frequently condemned by environmentalists.
Whenever and wherever there have been incentives to overharvest or deplete
wildlife it has taken place, whether by primitive or modern man.<p>
While the environmental movement comprises a diverse amalgamation of different
groups, with concerns ranging from visual &#147;pollution&#148; such as
clear-cuts, to chemical- and smoke-induced damage to human health, the glue
that binds the groups is wildlife conservation and preservation.  Even here
there is a wide and growing chasm among organizations.  The more
&#147;conservative&#148; groups are interested in wildlife management, such as
increasing the numbers of commonly hunted species of fish and game.  The
&#147;middle-of-the-roaders&#148; are interested in developing sustained-yield
management programs for species where it is clear that wise management and
international cooperation can achieve better results than ending all
harvesting.  The &#147;liberals&#148; push for an end to the exploitation of
most species and a complete ban on all trade in most threatened wildlife.
Finally, there are the animal rights groups, the &#147;radicals,&#148; who
value the rights of animals to life and liberty at least as highly as human
rights.<p>
The growth, influence, and public support of these organizations has increased
rapidly over the past two decades.  Since 1970, conservationists have painted a
dismal picture of an increasing struggle for survival of wildlife, with one
species after another being pushed to the brink of extinction.  There is no
doubt that human-caused extinctions are occurring at an increasing rate and
generating momentum for the environmental movement.<p>
Norman Myers treats the problem of disappearing species in considerable detail
and emphasizes the accelerated rate of extinction:<p>
At least 90% of all species that have existed have disappeared.  But almost all
of them have gone under by virtue of natural processes.  Only in the recent
past, perhaps from around 50,000 years ago, has man exerted much influence.  As
a primitive hunter, man probably proved himself capable of eliminating species,
albeit as a relatively rare occurrence.  From the year AD 1600, however, he
became able, through advancing technology, to overhunt animals to extinction in
just a few years, and to disrupt extensive environments just as rapidly.
Between the years 1600 and 1900, man eliminated around seventy-five known
species. . . .Since 1900 man has eliminated around another seventy-five known
species. . . .The rate from the year 1600 to 1900, roughly one species every 4
years, and the rate during most of the present century, about one species per
year, are to be compared with a rate of possibly one per 1000 years during the
&#145;great dying, of the dinosaurs.<sup>4</sup><p>
Since 1960, human population growth and worldwide development have greatly
accelerated the extinction rate, which may have reached 1,000 species per year
by 1975.  Myers projects that by the late 1980s it may reach one species per
hour.<sup>5</sup>  This is, indeed, a dismal picture, and it is important to
recognize that it is not merely  small and local populations of wildlife that
have suffered.  Many animal species that have disappeared or have been
drastically reduced were at one time found in truly enormous numbers.<p>
The passenger pigeon, which was native to North America, was once probably the
most numerous species of bird on earth.  At its peak, its population may have
numbered around 3 billion.  Its migrating flocks darkened the skies over towns
and cities and sounded like an approaching tornado, yet they were extinct by
1914, mainly  because of massive market-hunting.  A similar fate befell the
great auk, a large, flightless seabird that nested in vast numbers on islands
in the North Atlantic.  It was exterminated by whalers and  fishermen who
slaughtered it for food, eggs, feathers, and oil.<p>
Many other species that  survived overexploitation, although often only barely
so, were slaughtered in equally staggering numbers.  The Spanish explorers
described the buffalo herds as a limitless &#147;brown sea.&#148;  At one time,
75 million roamed the western  plains, but by 1895 there were little more than
800 left, most in captivity or on private ranches.  Vast flocks of ducks,
geese, prairie chickens, and shorebirds were decimated by market hunters to
provide relatively inexpensive meat for the large cities.  Naturalist Frank
Graham, Jr., points out:<p>
In 1873 Chicago markets bought 600,000 prairie chickens at $3.25 a dozen.
Frank M. Chapman, the ornithologist, recalled as a boy in the 1870s the glut of
prairie chickens in the butcher shops .... By the end of the century he had to
travel to the sand hills of Nebraska to find them in any numbers.<sup>6</sup><p>
It is obvious, however, that not all natural resources or wildlife have
disappeared or even been seriously depleted.  Environmentalists, journalists,
and writers draw our attention to the most shocking cases.  But there are many
species that are more common today than they were at any previous time.  Many
plant and animal species exist in large numbers today that were not present in
North America before the arrival of the white man.  Furthermore, certain
animals and plants are thriving under some specific ownership and management
conditions but vanishing under other conditions.  It is extremely important to
examine these cases in order to understand why overexploitation of some
resources and wildlife takes place and why other living or renewable resources
are managed on a self-sustaining basis.<p>
Why are some species disappearing and others thriving?  First, we can examine
what is disappearing and what is not.  Apparently, few environmentalists have
taken the time to do this in their haste to catalog extinct and vanishing
species.  It is true that the prairie chicken nearly vanished &#151; the heath
hen is extinct, the Atwater&#146;s greater prairie chicken has been reduced to
endangered species status, and the rest are uncommon, localized, and greatly
reduced in numbers &#151; but what about other chickens?  Why is the
Atwater&#146;s greater prairie chicken on the endangered species list but not
the Rhode Island Red, the Leghorn, or the Barred Rock? These chickens are not
even native American birds.  They came to this continent with the first
European settlers, and the small flocks at the settlement in Jamestown,
Virginia, in 1607 became the basis for a broiler industry that produces 3
billion birds a year.<sup>7</sup><p>
Similar questions can be asked:  Why was the American buffalo nearly
exterminated but not the Hereford, the Angus, or the Jersey cow?  Why are
salmon and trout habitually overfished in the nation&#146;s lakes, rivers, and
streams, often to the point of endangering the species, while the same species
thrive in fish farms and privately owned lakes and ponds?  Why do cattle and
sheep ranchers over-graze the public lands but maintain lush pastures on their
own property?  Why are rare birds and mammals taken from the wild in a manner
that often harms them and depletes the population, but carefully raised and
nurtured in aviaries, game ranches, and hunting preserves?  Which would be
picked at the optimum ripeness, blackberries along a roadside or blackberries
in a farmer&#146;s garden?<p>
In all of these cases, it is clear that the problem of overexploitation or
overharvesting is a result of the resources being under public rather than
private ownership.  The difference in their management is a direct result of
two totally different forms of property rights and ownership:  public,
communal, or common property vs. private property.  Wherever we have public
ownership we find overuse, waste, and extinction; but private ownership results
in sustained-yield use and preservation.  Although it may be philosophically or
emotionally pleasing to environmentalists to persist in maintaining that
wildlife, the oceans, and natural resources belong to mankind, the inevitable
result of such thinking is the opposite of  what they desire.<p>
Harold Demsetz defines communal ownership as:<p>
a right which can be exercised by all members of the community. . . .The
community denies. . .to individual citizens the right to interfere with any
person&#146;s exercise of communally-owned rights.  Private ownership implies
that the community recognizes the  right of the owner to exclude others from
exercising the owner&#146;s  private rights....<p>
Suppose that land is communally owned . . . .If a person seeks to maximize the
value of his communal rights, he will tend to overhunt and overwork the land
because some of the costs of his doing so are borne by others.  The stock of
game and the richness of the soil will be diminished too quickly. . . .<p>
If a single person owns the land, he will attempt to maximize its  present
value by taking into account alternative future time streams of benefits and
costs and selecting that one which he believes will maximize the present value
of his privately-owned land rights....   It is very difficult to see how the
existing communal owners can reach an agreement that takes account of these
costs.<sup>8</sup><p>
It is important to recognize that this distinction between the destructive
overuse of common property resources and careful sustained-yield use of private
property resources does not merely apply to a comparison of wild with
domesticated populations of plants and animals. 	<p>
Common property problems involving wildlife have been especially prevalent in
America, and they continue to be extremely vexing precisely because of American
wildlife law.  The President&#146;s Council on Environmental Quality has
stressed that &#147;under U.S. law, native wildlife belongs to the people; it
is not private property, even on private land.&#148;<sup>9</sup>  Victor B.
Scheffer points out that:<p>
. . .wildlife in the United States is the property of the people. . . .No
animal may be reduced to private ownership except by permission of the state.
Wild animals do not belong to the owner of the land upon which the animals
live, though the owner can post his land against entry and thus restrain the
public from using its property.<sup>10</sup><p>
In Europe, native wildlife often belongs to private landowners or is managed
under a combination of private and public property.  Some European countries
have fewer problems of overexploitation of wildlife, regardless of population
pressures and economic and political systems.  In other words, we find
precisely what economic analysis has predicted about the treatment of common
property and private property wildlife resources.<p>
The salmon fishery provides a nearly perfect example of the differences between
private and common property management.  Salmon are anadromous fish.  They
hatch in the clear, shallow waters of the upper reaches of rivers, go
downstream to the sea where they grow to maturity, and then return upstream. to
spawn another generation in the same rivers where they were hatched.
Management of a fishery should be a relatively low-cost operation because the
only requirements are to maintain a high-quality spawning environment and to
prevent overfishing.  The fish don&#146;t need to be fed because they grow to
maturity in the sea and return as a highly valuable source of protein.<p>
Yet most of the salmon in the United States have either disappeared from their
ancestral rivers or are being rapidly depleted precisely as a result of their
being treated as part of the common heritage.  As a common property resource,
they belong to everyone, can be caught by everyone, and essentially belong to
no one.  They run a gantlet of competing users at every stage of their
migration.  They are sought at sea by commercial fishing boats, off the river
mouths by sports fishermen, in the rivers by netting operations, and upstream
by rod fishermen and Indians, all of whom are interested in taking all the
salmon they can before others do.  In addition, foreign fishing fleets take all
the salmon they can beyond the 200-mile limit.  Furthermore, the rivers are
also common property; dams and logging operations often make them impassable,
and pollution makes them uninhabitable.<p>
Because no one owns the salmon, each user is pitted against all other users,
and the result has been a rapid depletion of the stock.  As each group catches
fewer fish, they turn to the government for special legislation that will
limit, control, and regulate the catch and the fishing techniques used by their
competitors.  As a result, fishing techniques have become increasingly
inefficient and costly.  But this still does not prevent overfishing.<p>
Douglass C. North and Roger LeRoy Miller have commented on the alarming decline
of the Bristol Bay salmon fishery in Alaska.<p>
In an attempt to reverse the trend, regulations over the season, fishing hours,
boats, and gear increased in complexity. . . .<p>
Naturally, the results in real life are more like a nightmare than a fairy
tale.  Fishermen are poor because they are forced to use inefficient equipment
and to fish only a small fraction of the time, and of course there are far too
many of them.  The consumer pays a much higher price for red salmon than would
be necessary if efficient methods were used.  Despite the ever-growing
intertwining bonds of regulations, the preservation of the salmon run is still
not  assured.<p>
The root of the problem lies in the current non-ownership arrangement.  It is
not in the interests of any individual fisherman to  concern himself with
perpetuation of the salmon run.  Quite the contrary: It is rather in his
interests to catch as many fish as he can during any one season.<sup>11</sup><p>
The consequence of treating the salmon as common property has been to destroy
the salmon resource and to waste economic resources through regulations.  John
Baden describes the results:<p>
The regulations are such that it is increasingly more difficult and more
expensive to obtain salmon. . . .The state and federal regulations are now such
that salmon. . .have a negative social value, if one includes the cost of
government management of the industry.  Given current institutions, society
would be better off if the salmon disappeared; it costs society more to get a
salmon than it is worth for food.<sup>12</sup><p>
The environmental literature has reported at length on the sad plight of the
salmon fisheries; but many authors appear either to be unaware of common
property theory or, worse, to ignore it because it clashes with their
philosophical view that wildlife should belong to everyone.  So we continue to
read their attacks on profit-seekers, free enterprise, big business, and a
consumptionist lifestyle. And we continue to watch the salmon disappear.<p>
Fortunately, salmon are a highly desirable fish, and American entrepreneurs are
attempting to remove them from the common property trap, even though they
generally run afoul of our wildlife laws, which act to prevent private property
solutions.  Obviously, under a common property system, there is no incentive
for any user to restock the fishery by creating a private hatchery because
everyone else would merely receive a cost-free benefit from his investment.
But attempts at salmon mariculture or farming are being made where private
owners can avoid the problem of having their fish migrate along common property
rivers.<p>
One such effort is being made by Bay Center Mariculture Company in Washington
State.  Until recently, raising salmon in ponds in order to market them for
profit was not permitted in Washington, although taxpayer-supported state fish
hatcheries were used to help alleviate overexploitation.  Bay Center reports:<p>
It has been discovered in recent years that salmon go through their early
development and growth much faster in brackish water than in the fresh water we
are accustomed to expect them in during their early life. . . .We take
advantage of this by both sea-farming salmon and raising them to market size in
controlled ponds.  Because of the specificity of salmon to return to the spot
of their birth, it is possible to release them at an early age and allow them
to mature in the sea and return to the hatchery site a year earlier than they
would if raised in nature in freshwater streams.  The expected return is a very
small percentage, but still very profitable.<sup>13</sup><p>
In 1977 Weyerhauser initiated a similar system in southern Oregon, where the
young salmon will be raised in ponds at the head of a bay and then released
into the bay, whence they will go out to sea.  They will not be able to prevent
fishermen from catching the returning salmon at the mouth of the bay, but
Weyerhauser expects to make a profit if one percent of the adult salmon return
to the company&#146;s fish ladders.  In the wild, approximately 2 to 5 per cent
of the salmon survive to return to their spawning grounds.<p>
Such programs not only solve wildlife conservation problems at private rather
than at taxpayer expense, but they reduce the take on the wild common property
populations and, as a positive externality, provide food for the wild food
chain.<sup>14</sup> <p>
Outside the United States we find a strikingly different situation.  In Iceland
and in some European countries, the salmon fishery is in much healthier shape
because the rights to the salmon or the salmon rivers are privately owned. Some
of the finest stretches of rivers are owned or leased by individuals, groups of
fishermen, or fishing lodges, and the salmon are not overfished. It is in the
economic self-interest of the resource owners to conserve the salmon. Limits
are effectively placed on the number of fish that can be caught, enough fish
are released to maintain a healthy population, and the owners carefully protect
their streams and see that agricultural and grazing activities do not adversely
affect the quality of the water. <p>
In Iceland private property rights have also been extended to the common eider,
a large sea-dwelling duck of the North Atlantic. The eider supplies meat, eggs,
and especially eiderdown (a brownish  down under the breast feathers of the
female that she plucks for her nest to insulate the eggs) for the farmers and
local populations. As early as 1281, the civil and ecclesiastical codes stated
that the eiders &#147;belong to the occupiers of the lands where they
occurred.&#148;  The farmers have protected the eider nesting colonies for
centuries and actually farm them. Robin W. Doughty writes: <p>
Skuli Magnusson, pioneer agriculturalist and industrialist, and others, who
protected and farmed the nesting places of wild eiders for down and eggs,
promoted the concept of farming. In the 1770s, Magnusson protected a very large
colony on the island of Videy, where reportedly he gathered and cleaned about
90 pounds of down from his &#147;favorite&#148; birds. On a visit to the same
place in 1810, Sir George MacKenzie noted that eider ducks were &#147;assembled
in great numbers to nestle,&#148; and that severe penalties were imposed on
persons killing them.<sup>15</sup> <p>
The number of such farming operations grew during the nineteenth century and
peaked during the 1920s, when there were  more than 250 farms. Because many
farmers have moved into  towns, the number of farms has declined, currently
totaling about  200, and eiderdown production is now about half of its peak
figures. One result of this decline has been an increase in predation on the
eiders by gulls, ravens, and feral mink and fox. Even though the number of wild
predators has increased, the eider are still carefully protected on the
existing farms, where property owners shoot and poison predators. <p>
Iceland&#146;s management of the wild eider as a private property resource has
been a great success. The private eider farms have benefited both the property
owners and the eider population. The farmers have protected the birds from
overexploitation, from poachers, and from natural predators. They have also
created artificial nesting sites in which the female will nest. The combined
provision of protected nesting areas and artificial nesting sites has served to
maintain a thriving population. <p>
The individual self-interest of private property owners has caused them to
protect and carefully manage a valuable wildlife resource. Because private
property rights were extended to the wild eider, the harvesters of eiderdown
and eider eggs were allowed to manage the resource in a nonconsumptive and non.
destructive manner. If they had killed the eider to obtain the down, they would
have been killing the fabled golden goose. Instead, they harvested the resource
on a sustained-yield basis and realized a far greater return. <p>
If the eider had been treated as a common property resource, the only way the
Icelanders could have captured any economic value from the resource would have
been to take all they could before other users did the same. It would not have
been profitable to wait for the eider to line their nests with down; someone
else might have collected it first. The rational course of action for each user
would have been to kill the eider and immediately appropriate all of the down.
It also would not have been in anyone&#146;s self-interest to invest in
conservation programs, such as nest site construction or predator control. All
of the other down collectors would have benefited from the actions of the
conservationist. We would have seen the creation of a new fable: &#147;Who
killed the eider that provided the golden down?&#148; <p>
It is also instructive to compare wildlife ownership and management in Great
Britain with that in the United States. Throughout much of British history, the
right to harvest wildlife belonged to owners of the land.<sup>16</sup> For
centuries landowners in England were entitled by law to the wildlife on their
lands. This was supported by qualification statutes, which determined the
amount of land or income that was necessary in order to have the right to own
and harvest game. The landowner owned the game, and he had the right to what
was supported by his land. It was recognized that the economic incentives
engendered by the right to own wildlife often led the landowners not to use
their land for agricultural purposes that would be harmful to wildlife. To the
extent that wildlife was valued as a source of economic gain, or even of
hunting pleasure, wildlife would be protected, and it would be hunted on a
sustained yield basis to ensure the preservation of breeding stock and the
continuous replenishment of the population. Landowners even employed
gamekeepers who managed the game, protecting it against predators, preserving
habitat, and guarding against poachers.<sup>17</sup><p>
The evidence indicates that there have been far fewer problems of vanishing
wildlife in Britain than in the United States. We can still witness the
benefits of the private ownership system in the management of Britain&#146;s
most famous game bird, the red grouse. The opening of grouse season each August
is reverently referred to as the &#147;Glorious Twelfth.&#148;  So highly
prized and desired are the grouse that restaurants throughout the London area
compete to see which can deliver the first meal of grouse. Commercial airlines,
private jets, and even helicopters are used in the race, and the resulting
roast grouse may cost $85. <p>
The grouse are clearly a valuable resource, and they provide a substantial
income to the landowners of the great estates in Scotland, where wealthy
hunters gather to participate in the hunts. Reservations for the shoots are
required well in advance, and social status and wealth may be necessary in
order to hunt on the best and most productive lands. Landowners obviously have
incentives to carefully manage the grouse on a sustained-yield basis, to keep
the habitat in prime condition, to prevent the heather from being burned, to
control predators, and to keep out poachers. As a result, the birds are not
overexploited, in spite of heavy shooting and even though commercial marketing
is allowed.  Compare the results of this system with the overexploitation of
the American prairie chicken.<p>
Unfortunately, because so much of the ownership of land in Britain, especially
the great estates, was based on government grants of privilege, the
landowner&#146;s property right to wildlife increasingly came under attack as a
special privilege accorded to the wealthy.  In the eighteenth century, the
great egalitarian and democratic debates over property rights in land and
wildlife resulted in America&#146;s rejection of the English system.  Private
property rights in wildlife and game were viewed as part of an undemocratic
system emanating from government grants to the ruling classes.  But in
rejecting them, Americans threw out the baby with the bath water.  The English
system was attacked because it supposedly benefited the rich at the expense of
the poor, and it was held that wildlife in America should belong to all.  From
the earliest time American law adopted a policy of &#147;free taking,&#148;
which recognized everyone&#146;s right to take game.  Only the law of trespass
kept anyone from entering another&#146;s property, and its efficacy was
severely restricted by the requirement that the land be posted against hunting
if the owner wanted exclusive use of it.<p>
Thomas A. Lund essentially approves of the egalitarian approach to wildlife
law. Nevertheless, he states: <p>
Early American law sought to dispatch the antidemocratic vices of its legacy
while at the same time to preserve the system&#146;s virtues. . . .Following
these seemingly harmless improvements to the English system, American wildlife
populations fell as if afflicted by a plague.  While the incursion of new
settlers into habitat played a role in this decline, subsequent proof that
wildlife can coexist and even thrive alongside agricultural development shows
that the spread of primitive farming and ranching does not bear principal
responsibility.  Instead the affliction upon wildlife must be attributed to a
surprising source: those democratic policies that were injected into wildlife
law.  Their unforeseen impact was to undercut totally the bases upon which
English wildlife law had  been so effective.<sup>18</sup> <p>
Another especially illustrative example of private property rights in wildlife
appears in the Montagnais Indians of Quebec and Labrador.<sup>19</sup>  The
Montagnais dwelled in the forests of the Labrador Peninsula, hunting such
furbearing animals as caribou, deer, and beaver.  They treated wildlife as a
common property resource, with  everyone sharing in the bounty of the hunt.
Because game was  plentiful and the Indian population was relatively low, the
common  property resource system was able to work.  &#147;The externality was
clearly present.  Hunting could be practiced freely and was carried on without
assessing its impact on other hunters.  But these external effects were of such
small significance that it did not pay anyone to take them into
account.&#148;<sup>20</sup> <p>
However, with the arrival of the French fur traders in the 1600s, the demand
for beaver began to rise rapidly. As the value of the furs rose, there was a
corresponding increase in the exploitation of the resource. Increasing use of
the common property resource  would have led to overexploitation of the beaver.
However, <p>
with the beaver increasing in value, scarcity, depletion, and localized,
extinction could be predicted under the existing system of property rights.
But unlike the buffalo, virtually condemned to extinction as common property,
the beaver were protected by the evolution of private property rights among the
hunters.  By the early to mid 18th century, the transition to private hunting
grounds was almost complete and the Montagnais were managing the beaver on a
sustained-yield basis.<sup>21</sup> <p>
It was a highly sophisticated system.  The Montagnais blazed trees with their
family crests to delineate their hunting grounds, practiced retaliation against
poachers and trespassers, developed a seasonal allotment system, and marked
beaver houses. <p>
Animal resources were husbanded.  Sometimes conservation practices were carried
on extensively. Family hunting territories were divided into quarters.  Each
year the family hunted in a different quarter in rotation, leaving a tract in
the center as a sort of bank, not to be hunted over unless forced to do so by a
shortage in the regular tract.<sup>22</sup> <p>
This remarkably advanced system lasted for over a century and certainly served
to prevent the extinction of the beaver. Unfortunately, more whites entered the
region and began to treat the beaver as a common property resource, trapping
them themselves rather than trading with the Indians, and the beaver began to
disappear. Finally, the Indians were forced to abandon their private property
system and joined the whites in a rapid overexploitation of the beaver. Baden,
Stroup, and Thurman sum up this sorry return to a common property system: <p>
With the significant intrusion of the white trapper in the 19th century, the
Indian&#146;s property rights were violated.  Because the Indian could not
exclude the white trapper from the benefits of conservation both joined in
trapping out the beaver. . . .In essence, the Indians lost their ability to
enforce property rights and rationally stopped practicing resource
conservation.<sup>23</sup> <p>
Another example of how private ownership can successfully preserve wildlife is
found on game ranches, hunting preserves, safari parks, and animal and bird
farms.  Many of these private ventures, especially the game ranches, were
established to generate profits from private hunting.  Consequently, there has
been a tremendous outcry from environmentalists and conservationists because
the animals are raised for profit and some of them are killed.  Yet, if
emotional responses can be put aside, it seems clear that these game ranches
produce many positive results.  Many of the animals they stock are rapidly
disappearing in their native countries because of pressures resulting from a
rapidly expanding human population.  Native habitats are disappearing through
the encroachment, of agriculture, cattle grazing, timber harvesting, and
desertification arising from overexploitation of common property water
resources, overgrazing of grasslands, and overutilization of brush, scrub, and
trees for firewood and shelter.  So serious are these problems and so insoluble
under a common property system that there is little hope of saving many species
of wildlife in the developing countries.  Indeed, some of the more spectacular
and most sought-after big-game mammals may now have healthier and more stable
populations on some of the game ranches than in their native countries. <p>
As human population growth accelerates throughout the Third World, as annual
incomes hover at the subsistence level, and as rising costs of petroleum and
agricultural fertilizers and chemicals continue to compound the misery, fewer
and fewer internal resources will be available to preserve wildlife.  In spite
of the noble intentions of India and some African and South American nations to
preserve their vanishing wildlife, there are few signs of any real
accomplishments.  Impoverished people have little patience with elephants
rampaging through their meager crops or with lions, cheetahs, and leopards
preying on their livestock.  Poachers take a terrible toll, for food as well as
for ivory and spotted cat skins that bring high prices on the black market.
And there is ready evidence that government officials in many of these
countries, while publicly showing great concern for wildlife, are profiting
handsomely from the illegal trade.  If these common property resources are
going to be depleted anyway, what incentives do they have to act otherwise? <p>
Many environmentalists bemoan the fact that the once free roaming animal herds
of the African continent are now kept in captivity for the benefit of American
hunters and safari park visitors.  But free-roaming is a relative concept.
These animals are certainly free-roaming within the boundaries of the game
ranches, and many of these ranches are enormous.  Furthermore, as the African
plains are increasingly delimited with hostile political boundaries and with
warring armies and starving populations, there seems little point in mounting
campaigns against so-called immoral game ranches and preserves.  The growth of
agriculture and cattle ranching in these countries is also restricting the
free-roaming nature of the wildlife herds.<p>
If the profits gained by giving hunters access to exotic game can provide the
economic incentive for these landowners to manage the animals on a
sustained-yield basis, some species will be saved.  The same holds for the
profits to be derived from visitors to game parks and preserves.  In fact, the
protection provided at some of the parks, preserves, and gardens has actually
produced a glut of some animals.  There have been well-publicized efforts by
some preserves to return their surplus animals to Africa. Lions from America
have even been taken to Africa to appear in movies that were filmed there.
While we read of zoological parks attempting to discover reversible birth
control techniques in order to control their tiger populations, we continue to
read about the never-ending difficulties of preserving the remaining tigers in
the wild.<p>
Perhaps we should judge all of these activities by their achievements rather
than by their motives, for it may turn out that in the future the developing
countries will be restocked with their native fauna from specimens now thriving
on game ranches and preserves. <p>
It is important not to cloud the issue of common vs. private property resources
with philosophical judgments regarding competing economic systems or with
attacks on a free-market system or profit seeking activities.  The books on
disappearing wildlife abound with stories of captive breeding of birds and
mammals and the successful preservation of species that have either become
extremely rare or have disappeared entirely in the wild. <p>
Among the many mammals in this category are P&egrave;re David&#146;s deer,
which does not exist in the wild and was &#147;discovered&#148; living in the
royal zoological park in Peking.  It has been saved from extinction by breeding
in zoos and private parks.  The European bison, or wisent, was reduced to three
animals in 1927 and now survives in preserves in Poland.  There are similar
stories for the Asiatic lion, Prsewalski&#146;s Mongolian wild horse, the
Arabian oryx, the wild ass or onager, and the Bactrian camel. <p>
Private waterfowl breeders exist widely in many countries, and perhaps the most
notable success story has been the preservation of the Hawaiian goose, or nene.
Once they numbered over 25,000 in the wild, but under common property
management the population had plummeted to 20 to 30 birds by 1949. Fortunately,
they had been bred by aviculturists as early as 1824.  A Hawaiian rancher had
many on his farm, and there was a flock at the Wildfowl Trust at Slimbridge,
England.  Through the combined efforts of many interested parties, an intensive
captive breeding program was begun in the United States and Europe, and
thousands of young nenes were produced.  Beginning in the 1960s, they were
reintroduced to the wild in Hawaii, and by the mid 1970s there were as many as
600 in their native habitat.<sup>24</sup> <p>
Many species of pheasant have always had small and local populations and would
not have survived long under common property pressures.  Many of the rarest
species have been preserved in private aviaries and ornamental collections,
with at least six endangered species being raised in captivity in the United
States. <p>
The same is true for many members of the parrot family.  The familiar
budgerigar, or budgie, is commonly kept as a pet in the United States and is
bred in enormous numbers by thousands of breeders.  Practically the entire
trade is supplied by captive-bred birds.  This demonstrates another
conservation aspect of extending private property rights to wildlife, as
captive breeding can supply the market demand for the birds and reduce or
eliminate the demand on wild populations. <p>
In all of these examples it is clear that the single most important element in
wildlife survival was their removal from common property ownership.  Under
private property ownership, others were prevented from exploiting the resource,
and there were incentives for the owners to preserve them.  Furthermore, these
incentives were not solely motivated by the possibility of economic gain. With
the exception of game ranches, economic gain has seldom been the primary
motivation behind most captive breeding projects.  Many of these examples were
fostered for the pleasure of owning and breeding attractive or rare wildlife,
as well as for more &#147;altruistic&#148; reasons, such as a deep commitment
to the preservation of vanishing wildlife.  Private ownership includes not only
hunting pre-serves, commercial bird breeders, parrot jungles, and safari parks,
it also includes wildlife sanctuaries, Audubon Society refuges, World Wildlife
Fund preserves, and a multitude of private, non-profit conservation and
preservation projects.<p>
The problems of environmental degradation, overexploitation of natural
resources, and depletion of wildlife all derive from their existence as common
property resources.  Wherever we find an approach to the extension of private
property rights in these areas, we find superior results.  Wherever we have
exclusive private ownership, whether it is organized around a profit-seeking or
nonprofit undertaking, there are incentives for the private owners to preserve
the resource.  Self-interest drives the private property owners to careful
management and protection of their resource. <p>
It is important not to fall into the trap of believing that the different
results arising from these two forms of resource management can be changed
through education or persuasion.  The methods of using or exploiting the
resources are inherent in the incentives that are necessarily a part of each
system.  The overuse of common property resources and the preservation of
private property resources are both examples of rational behavior by resource
users.  It is not a case of irrational vs. rational behavior.  In both cases we
are witnessing rational behavior, for resource users are acting in the only
manner available to them to obtain any economic or psychological value from the
resource.<p>
It has nothing to do with the need for a new environmental ethic.  Asking
people to revere resources and wildlife won&#146;t bring about the peaceable
kingdom when the only way a person can survive is to use up the resource before
someone else does.  Adopting a property system that directs and channels
man&#146;s innate self-interest into behavior that preserves natural resources
and wildlife will cause people to act as if they were motivated by a new
conservationist ethic. <p>
Any resource held in common &#151; whether land, air, the upper atmosphere and
outer space, the oceans, lakes, streams, outdoor recreational resources,
fisheries, wildlife, or game can be used simultaneously by more than one
individual or group for more than one purpose with many of the multiple uses
conflicting.  No one has exclusive rights to the resource, nor can anyone
prevent others from using it for either the same or any non compatible use.  By
its very nature a common property resource is owned by everyone and owned by no
one.  Since everyone uses it there is overuse, waste, and extinction.  No one
has an incentive to maintain or preserve it.  The only way any of the users can
capture any value, economic or otherwise, is to exploit the resource as rapidly
as possible before someone else does. <p>
But private ownership allows the owner to capture the full capital value of the
resource, and self-interest and economic incentive drive the owner to maintain
its long-term capital value.  The owner of the resource wants to enjoy the
benefits of the resource today, tomorrow, and ten years from now, and therefore
he will attempt to manage it on a sustained-yield basis. <p>
Given the nature of man and the motivating forces of self-interest and economic
incentive, we can see why the buffalo nearly vanished, but not the Hereford;
why the Atwater&#146;s greater prairie chicken is endangered, but not the red
grouse; why the common salmon fisheries of the United States are overfished,
but not the private salmon streams of Europe. <p>
It should be equally clear that the analysis applies to broader environmental
issues.  Many of the most beautiful national parks are suffering from severe
overuse and a near destruction of their recreational values, but most private
parks are maintained in far better condition.  The National Audubon Society
does a better job of preserving its wildlife refuges and protecting wildlife
than do many federal wildlife refuges.  The public grazing lands have been
repeatedly overgrazed, while lush private grazing lands are maintained by
private ranchers.  National forests are carelessly logged and overharvested,
but private forests are carefully managed and cut on a sustained-yield basis,
and costly nursery tree farms have been developed.  In addition, the basic
concept of self-interest explains why people don&#146;t litter their own yards
but do litter public parks and streets, and why people don&#146;t dump old
refrigerators and tires in their own farm ponds or swimming pools, but
repeatedly dump them in the unowned streams, rivers, and swamps. <p>
Perhaps the most important treatment of the common property syndrome was that
of the noted biologist and environmentalist, Garrett Hardin: <p>
Picture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try
to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons.  Such an arrangement may
work reasonably satisfactorily for centuries because tribal wars, poaching, and
disease keep the numbers of both man and beast well below the carrying capacity
of the land.  Finally, however, comes the day of reckoning, that is, the day
when the long-desired goal of social stability becomes a reality.  At this
point, the inherent logic of the commons remorselessly generates tragedy. <p>
As a rational being, each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain.  Explicitly or
implicitly, more or less consciously, he asks, &#147;What is the utility to me
of adding one more animal to my herd?&#148; The utility has one negative and
one positive component. <p>
1. The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal.  Since
the herdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal,
the positive utility is nearly + 1. <p>
2. The negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created
by one more animal.  Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by
all the herdsmen, the negative utility for any particular decision-making
herdsman is only a fraction of - 1. <p>
Adding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman
concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another
animal to his herd.  And another; and another. . . .But this is the conclusion
reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing a commons.  Therein is the
tragedy.  Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his
herd without limit in a world that is limited.  Ruin is the destination toward
which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that
believes in the freedom of the commons.  Freedom in a commons brings ruin to
all.<sup>25</sup><p>
Unfortunately, environmentalists have either overlooked the economic analysis
of common property resources or they have deliberately ignored it because of
the profound difficulties it raises for a philosophy that is opposed to private
ownership of natural resources and wildlife.  Certainly, the former is true,
but there is also evidence of the latter, since some of the more scholarly
treatments of wildlife problems refer rather fleetingly to the problems of
common property resources and to Hardin&#146;s analysis.  But they mainly refer
to Hardin when they are following his proposals for limiting human population
growth to preserve the natural world.  Meanwhile, the logic of the commons
continues to generate a remorseless loss of the world&#146;s wildlife. <p>
Where, then, do most environmentalists place the blame for our environmental
problems?  Most environmental literature and treatments by the public media
consistently repeat attacks on man&#146;s greed, self-interest, consumerism,
piggishness, the profit system, the market economy, and Western political,
legal, economic, religious, and property institutions and beliefs.
<i>Newsweek</i> points to &#147;entrepreneurial greed.&#148;  <i>The New York
Times</i> mentions &#147;commercial exploitation.&#148; Michael Satchell
writes, &#147;the road ahead seems to lead to more extinctions on the altar of
consumerism.&#148;<sup>26</sup> <p>
This level of thinking is especially prevalent in popular magazines published
by the major wildlife, conservation, and environmental organizations, ranging
from the Audubon Society to The World Wildlife Fund.  A typical example,
written by the editor, John Strohm, appeared in a recent issue of
<i>International Wildlife</i>.  He asked why there were growing problems of
overfishing, overcutting, overgrazing, overplowing, and disappearing species of
plants and animals.  Following a discussion of too many people, too wasteful
demands, and the haves vs. the have-nots, he wrote:  &#147;We must eliminate
waste. . .and adopt a more frugal lifestyle.  You cut a tree, you plant a tree.
You catch a fish, you leave some behind so you can fish
tomorrow.&#148;<sup>27</sup> <p>
But even the most serious, scholarly books on wildlife conservation fail to
rise much above this level. Norman Myers, in <i>The Sinking Ark</i>, writes
about how we like hamburgers, our consumerist lifestyle, our desire to be
consumers and fat cats, and our love of inexpensive foreign beef.<sup>28</sup>
David Ehrenfeld, in <i>Conserving Life on Earth</i>, finds the problem to be
economic success and increases in consumption.  He calls for the disassociation
of progress from growth, blames the pet trade, attacks private land ownership
as unplanned, and points out that one of his students had discovered that
people believe that China is the only country that has successfully coped with
environmental problems.  Ehrenfeld calls for the creation of a radically
altered economic system that would produce labor-intensive and nonpolluting
goods, such as guitars, rather than goods that are capital-intensive and highly
polluting, such as snowmobiles.<sup>29</sup> <p>
These examples make one wonder whether the intellectual leaders of the
environmental movement are more interested in a visionary society patterned
after Rousseau and Thoreau than in grappling with the difficult problems of
finding a method of conserving life on earth. <p>
Two major themes repeatedly appear in the environmental literature as the
source of all our problems with environmental preservation and conservation:
commerce and the free-enterprise or free-market economic system.  We find
emotional references to the role of commerce in the overexploitation of
wildlife.  Victor Scheffer has written: <p>
By market hunting I mean the trapping and clubbing of fur-bearers, the shooting
of animals for the pet-food industry, the live capturing of rabbits for
coursing, the capturing of hawks for sale to falconers, and similar pursuits of
wild birds and mammals for  commercial ends.  The Friends of the Earth
organization has already taken the position that the use of wild animal
products as objects of commerce should be discouraged.<sup>30</sup> <p>
<p>
In <i>Time of the Turtle</i>, Jack Rudloe describes a conversation with Dr.
Archie Carr, widely recognized as the world&#146;s foremost sea turtle
scientist: <p>
Inevitably a discussion on the morality of eating this heavenly tasting, but
nearly extinct creature arose.  Was it wrong to eat it when we knew the
endangered status of the green turtle?  &#147;That touches on a very deep and
fundamental problem,&#148; said Archie in a defensive tone.  &#147;If we had
gone out and bought it, paid cash for it, and encouraged its commercial sale,
then we would have been wrong.  More than anything else, the commercialization
of turtle meat and products has pushed the species to extinction.  It
isn&#146;t the Indian eating a few turtles on the beach for subsistence.  At
least five thousand turtles each year are being slaughtered in Nicaragua right
up the coast from us.  Thousands used to be shipped into the Keys for soup.
And last year thirty thousand pounds of meat came in from Colombia, Mexico, and
even from the Middle East to the United State.  It isn&#146;t coastal people
sharing the meat among themselves in the village that&#146;s the problem,
it&#146;s that mass marketing that&#146;s going on in the world trade that
is.&#146;<sup>31</sup><p>
However, it seems totally inappropriate to refer to the harvesting of unowned
wild populations as commerce.  Environmentalists and scientists make exceptions
for wildlife harvesting by native populations and Indians, whether it is for
food, clothing, medicine, ornamentation, religious rites and ceremonies, or for
pets.  Yet, when European exploration and settlement began to affect wildlife
populations by providing food, clothing, and ornamentation for growing
settlements, it was referred to as commerce.  It is somehow suggested that
exchanging wildlife for money is somehow immoral. <p>
The overharvesting of the earth&#146;s wildlife can no more be labeled commerce
than the primitive gathering of wild fruits, vegetables, and grains can be
called agriculture even if those products are subsequently sold in the
marketplace.  Jacques-Yves Cousteau has written:  &#147;Unlike livestock
rearing and fish farming, fishing and hunting are really sheer pillaging of the
environment and quickly lead to the destruction of the very resources they seek
to cull.&#148;<sup>32</sup> <p>
The disappearance of wildlife has nothing to do with commerce or a lack of
reverence for wildlife.  The more rapid disappearance of common property
wildlife during the past century is due to the fact that much larger human
populations are using it, more efficient means of capture and kill are
employed, and a larger number of uses have been found for the resources.
Furthermore, many of the most populous species of wildlife had been reduced to
a severely depleted state long before the development of modern business and
commerce.  This is especially true regarding sea turtles. <p>
Sea turtles have been on earth for up to 100 million years and wildlife foods
used by man. They, were probably one of the first abounded in the warm water
between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. The green turtle, <i>Chelonia
mydas</i>, has been called the world&#146;s most valuable species of reptile.
Before Europeans arrived in the Caribbean its population was as high as 50
million.  On Columbus&#146;s fourth voyage to the New World he recorded that on
May 10, 1503, his ship &#147;raised two small islands full of turtles&#148; and
the surrounding sea &#147;seethed with turtles.&#148;  He named the islands Las
Tortugas.<sup>33</sup> <p>
By the time the British renamed their colony the Cayman Islands the turtles
were a valuable source of meat and eggs for seamen and early colonists.  One
scientist noted that the green turtle was the most valuable dietary factor in
opening up the Caribbean, although at a heavy cost to the species.<sup>34</sup>
Originally their numbers were so great that mariners lost in the fog could
navigate by following the sound of the turtles swimming toward their breeding
beaches.  But decades of overexploitation rapidly depleted the population.  As
early as 1620 the Bermuda turtle population was so reduced that the assembly
passed an act prohibiting their killing.  Today there are not more than a few
thousand green turtles in the Caribbean and possibly no more than 400,000
worldwide.  The appearance of a wild turtle in Caymanian waters is now a
rarity. <p>
The logic of the commons worked its inexorable tragedy for the green turtle
long before the development of any modern commercial trade in sea turtles and
turtle products, and thus it is all the more inappropriate for so excellent a
scientist as Professor Carr to single out commerce as the cause of the
turtles&#146; depletion and to state:  &#147;Turtles aren&#146;t feeding
protein-poor Indians, but rich gringos in high-rise hotels.&#148;<sup>35</sup>
Clearly, the current plight of the sea turtles has nothing to do with rich
gringos in high-rise hotels.  Common property exploitation had nearly doomed
the turtles long before Miami Beach was developed. <p>
Many farsighted scientists and conservationists have supported the development
of commercial sea turtle farms in an effort to reduce the exploitation of the
remaining wild turtles.  Even Archie Carr wrote: <p>
The one move that appears most promising as a way to accomplish the dual aim of
feeding people and saving natural turtle populations is to set up turtle farms.
If the teeming people of the future are to have turtle products tortoiseshell,
calipee, meat, soup, hides they should come from captive stock.  They cannot
keep coming from the small, shrinking, natural populations of the world. . .
.Turtle farming will be commercially profitable, however, only when it is done
on a big scale.<sup>36</sup> <p>
Unfortunately, following the successful development of Cayman Turtle Farm,
Ltd., many American environmentalists and some scientists launched an attack on
farming.  Essentially they were opposed to commercial use of sea turtles and
the profit-seeking nature of the farm.  They also argued that it was likely to
stimulate trade in sea turtles.  In spite of strong support for the farm from
other sea turtle experts, scientists, and conservationists, the antifarmers
ultimately persuaded the United States government to ban the import of
farm-bred turtle products.  This followed an earlier ban on the importation of
endangered wild turtle products. <p>
The predictable result has been the increased exploitation and smuggling of a
rapidly dwindling wild population.  The demand for turtle products is now being
met through illicit channels, that is, black market smuggling.  It is a sad
irony that while the Cayman Turtle Farm is being forced to reduce the size of
its captive stock because its American markets are closed, the <i>Washington
Star</i> reports that two huge shipments of illegal wild sea turtle meat have
recently been seized by United States agents.<sup>37</sup>  These shipments
contained fifty-three tons of wild olive ridley meat, the results of the
slaughter of nearly nine thousand irreplaceable wild sea turtles. <p>
For some perplexing reason Archie Carr reversed his position on turtle farms,
and he, David Ehrenfeld, and some of their associates have been leading the
fight against farming.  Rudloe&#146;s conversation with Carr concluded:<p>
&#147;That&#146;s absolutely correct,&#148; Archie rationalized as we ate the
last piece.  &#147;No money exchanged hands.  The meat was not swapped for
dollars.  The soldiers divided the meat up among the villagers, themselves,
their major, and ourselves.  If a turtle is going to be butchered, that&#146;s
the only way it should be done.  That&#146;s why I&#146;m against turtle
farming.  It isn&#146;t increasing the species, all it&#146;s doing is putting
more commercial pressure on an already endangered species.&#148;<sup>38</sup><p>
Farming was, of course, doing precisely the opposite.  The species was
increased because the pressure on the remaining wild population was reduced.
Further, the Cayman Turtle Farm became a closed-cycle operation and no longer
needed to collect breeding stock eggs from the wild, most of which were
&#147;doomed&#148; eggs that would not have hatched anyway because of beach
erosion, harvesting by natives, or predation.  The Cayman Turtle Farm achieved
the first recorded instance of captive sea turtle breeding and served as a
living laboratory for scientific research on sea turtle biology.  Yet the more
successful the farm became, the more vocal its opponents were.  The farm&#146;s
major markets are closed, and economic survival is in doubt.  Scientists still
visit the farm to carry on research, but the future of the green turtle and of
all sea turtles is now dim.  One of the most disheartening aspects of the
antifarm campaign is that the farm has been forced to reduce its captive stock
by an amount considerably larger than all the remaining wild green turtles in
the Caribbean.<p>
We can see just how counterproductive the emotional and philosophical
opposition to turtle farming has been.  By successfully halting the development
of private farming and the extension of private property rights into the
wildlife commons, environmentalists and antifarming scientists are subjecting
sea turtles to the tragedy of the commons.  Unless there is a rapid turnaround
in their views or in the United States laws, the worldwide demand for turtle
products will soon drive the remaining wild turtles to near
extinction.<sup>39</sup><p>
The second common theme used by most environmentalists is the private
enterprise system and the free market. Myers has written at length about the
evils of the system:<p>
But within the American system, with its emphasis on private profit to be
derived from private property, common property of society&#146;s heritage gets
short shrift; farmers&#146; interests are allowed precedence over the
native&#146;s needs. . . .<p>
The guts of the issue are that private interests do not necessarily run
parallel with public interests.  In certain circumstances, private interests
undermine public interests.  This runs counter to much conventional wisdom
concerning a free-market economy, as exemplified by Adam Smith&#146;s dictum
that, through pursuing his own interests, an individual is &#147;led by an
invisible hand to promote the public interest.&#148;<sup>40</sup><p>
In the concluding section of Myers&#146;s book, he develops his strategy for
conservation:<p>
Much decline of species is due to the deficiencies and failures of the
market-place system, which sometimes favors the here-and-now needs of private
individuals to the detriment of long-term needs of the community in general.
Moreover, the market-place tends to ignore the value of resources without a
price tag. . . .Governments should step in to take account of the fact that the
open market-place does not cater for all economic needs of society, and
especially that the market-place ignores and even depletes the common heritage
species.<sup>41</sup> <p>
Ehrenfeld argues from a nearly identical position:<p>
The greatest barrier to the implementation of a strong and unified conservation
policy is the difficulty of protecting those parts of the public domain that
have traditionally been exploited by private interests.  Both Keynes and later
Hardin have explained that there is no logically consistent reason why an
individual, corporation, or nation acting in self-interest should voluntarily
abstain from exploiting the public domain even when the result will be certain
destruction of the valuable features of that domain.  Hardin, in fact, goes
somewhat farther in &#147;The Tragedy of the Commons&#148; by asserting that it
is usually damaging to private interests (at least in the short run) to act for
the collective good as far as the commons are concerned....<p>
If private interests cannot be expected to protect the public domain, then
external regulation by public agencies, governments, or international
authorities is needed.  If that regulation is effective, the commons will be
managed to provide the maximum sustained yield of natural products, which in
turn will ultimately maximize the sum total of the profits for the various
interests that rely on the commons.  This concept, simple in theory, is
difficult to put into practice. <sup>42</sup><p>
It is difficult to decide how to deal with Myers&#146;s and Ehrenfeld&#146;s
critiques of free enterprise and the tragedy of the commons.  One can
understand their philosophical objection to private ownership of property and
to the free-market economy, yet it is difficult to deal with their analyses of
the tragedy of the commons.  Nowhere does Hardin state that the tragedy of the
commons is the result of free enterprise, the profit system, or the existence
of private property.<sup>43</sup>  Since common property is the antithesis of
private property, there is simply no way in which private property can be the
cause of the tragedy.  Hardin clearly stresses that it is by treating a
resource as common property that we become locked in its inexorable
destruction.  The conservationist-minded common property resource user has no
more incentive to restrain his overexploitation of the resource than the most
shortsighted and greedy common property resource user has.  That is precisely
why such a system remorselessly generates tragedy.<p>
Regarding the whaling industry in the ocean commons, Hardin mentions the
Japanese and the Russians.<sup>44</sup>  But the ocean&#146;s common property
resources are being overexploited by the ships of all nations, regardless of
economic and political systems.  It is certainly true that ships sailing out
from the United States are seeking to take all the fish they can, but ships
from socialist and communist nations are following a similar course.  Indeed,
because individual profit-and-loss calculations play such a small role in the
economic activities of socialist nations, there is less incentive for their
fleets to desist in their overexploitation when it becomes economically
unprofitable than there is for a private American fishing boat.  One can only
conclude that writers like Myers and Ehrenfeld have either completely failed to
grasp the concept of the commons or they have deliberately misrepresented it in
order to support their philosophical positions.<p>
It is true that Hardin is somewhat ambiguous in recommending a solution to the
tragedy of the commons.  He points out that there is no technological solution
and that a political solution must be found that will create some form of
ownership for the earth&#146;s resources.  While he does not explicitly
recommend private property rights, he appears to lean in that direction in his
discussion of parks as commons:<p>
What shall we do?  We have several options.  We might sell them off as private
property.  We might keep them as public property, but allocate the right to
enter them.  The allocation might be on the basis of wealth, by the use of an
auction system.  It might be on the basis of merit, as defined by some
agreed-upon standards.  It might be by lottery.  Or it might be on a
first-come, first-served basis, administered to long queues.  These, I think,
are all the reasonable possibilities.  They are all objectionable.  But we must
choose or acquiesce in the destruction of the commons that we call our National
Parks.<sup>45</sup><p>
At least in certain areas Hardin views the creation of private property rights
as a solution:  &#147;The tragedy of the commons as a food basket is averted by
private property, or something formally like it.&#148;<sup>46</sup><p>
Unfortunately Hardin swings in the other direction in his treatment of the
ocean commons:<p>
Faced with the tragedy of the commons, we can have only one rational response:
change the system.  To what?  Basically, there are only two possibilities: free
enterprise and socialism.  Free enterprise in the oceans would require some
sort of fences, real or figurative.  It is doubtful if we can create
territories in the ocean by fencing.  If not, we must &#151; if we have the
will to do it &#151; adopt the other alternative and socialize the oceans:
create an international agency <i>with teeth</i>.  Such an agency must issue
not recommendations but directives; and enforce them.<sup>47</sup><p>
It is possible that in perceiving the difficulties involved in. solving the
intricate boundary problems Hardin seems to acquiesce to some form of state or
socialist ownership and control of ocean resources.  Hardin does stress that
our experience with the League of Nations and the United Nations gives us
little hope that a system of state ownership would succeed.  Indeed, the
decade-long debates at the Law of the Seas conferences have repeatedly been
mired over the establishment of suprastate authority over the manganese nodules
carpeting vast areas of the ocean bottom &#151; a far more tractable problem
than managing the highly fugitive wildlife resources of the oceans.<p>
However, the problem of &#147;fencing&#148; the seas may not be as difficult to
solve as Hardin imagined. North and Miller have written: <p>
Notice that, until recently, it would have been immeasurably difficult, or even
impossible, to maintain and enforce private rights in the ocean, but the
invention of modern electronic sensing equipment has now made the policing of
large bodies of water relatively cheap and easy.  Through the centuries it has
often become feasible for common property to give way to private property
precisely because technology has made possible the, enforcement of private
rights (exclusivity).<p>
We are not saying that making the oceans into private property is
&#147;good.&#148;  We are saying that doing so would lead to more output and
fewer ecological disasters. . . .<sup>48</sup><p>
The problems of overexploitation and extinction of wildlife appear to derive
consistently from their being treated as a common property resource.  Example
after example bears this out.  It is also predicted by the economic analysis of
common property resources.  Both the economic analysis of common property
resources and Hardin&#146;s treatment of the tragedy of the commons suggest
that the only way to avoid the tragedy of the commons in natural resources and
wildlife is to end the common property system by creating a system of private
property rights.<p>
Private property rights have worked successfully in a broad array of cases to
preserve wildlife and resolve the tragedy of the commons.  Experience and the
logical implications of common property resource theory suggest that private
property rights are far superior to state or public property rights partly
because of the unambiguous exclusivity of private property rights and the
difficult problem of preventing too many from using the public domain under a
system of state ownership.  Furthermore, private property owners have a direct
and immediate incentive not to mismanage their own property, while government
owners or managers do not have the same incentives, nor are there many
incentives that prevent all of the public from overusing the resources held in
the public domain.<p>
It seems that Hardin&#146;s proposal that resolution of the tragedy of the
commons comes down to a choice between private ownership or government
ownership is insufficient.  State ownership appears to be little more than a
more regulated commons.  We witness the same overuse and destruction of the
public domain as we do in the purest commons.<p>
The proper path toward resolving the vexing issues of wildlife conservation
lies in removing wildlife from common property resource treatment and creating
private property rights.  This entails an outright rejection of the concept
that wildlife should be viewed as the common heritage of all mankind.  It also
poses a direct challenge to the basic philosophical beliefs of many
environmentalists.  But if we are to resolve the tragedy of the commons and
preserve our natural resources and wildlife, we must create a new paradigm for
the environmental movement:  private property rights in natural resources and
wildlife.<p>

  The distinction between natural and human-caused extinction seems to be a
philosophically loaded one.   Once we make human beings some special type of
causative agent apart from the rest of nature, it is very easy to begin to
single out  specific groups of humans as &#147;good&#148; or &#145;bad,&#148;
e.g., conservation organizations are  good and multinational timber companies
are bad.   What does it matter to the species  whether its extinction results
from natural or human causes?- it is just as dead.<p>

<sup>17</sup>0pponents of private ownership of wildlife have occasionally used
the example of overzealous attempts by English gamekeepers to destroy all
predatory species of birds and mammals as an argument against the system.
However, much of that happened long before the enlightened understanding of the
role of predators in the ecosystem. Furthermore, this hardly seems a convincing
argument in view of the incalculable loss of predators in the United States
resulting from three centuries of shooting, poisoning, and trapping of
predators by local, county, state, and federal government agents, as well as an
enormous payout in bounty fees by the government to private citizens for
eliminating predators and &#147;nuisance&#148; animals.<p>

<sup>39</sup>The full story of this controversy is still to be discovered. The
carefully orchestrated attack on the Cayman Turtle Farm as well as the apparent
campaign of abuse against its supporters raise a number of disturbing questions
regarding the true motives of the antifarming people. What do they have to gain
by closing the farm and encouraging rapid exploitation of the few remaining
wild turtles? Most people who have heard only the official antifarm party line
are usually astounded when they learn the facts. Scientific objectivity has
vanished in a biopolitical debate in which philosophical and personal
considerations carry more importance than the facts surrounding the
achievements of the turtle farm. This may prove to be a scientific scandal:

The Center for Private Conservation (CPC) is a project of the <A HREF="/">Competitive Enterprise Institute</A> that seeks to expand the knowledge and information base surrounding the ability to advance environmental objectives privately, absent government control or influence. 

<P>The Center researches and documents successful private efforts to conserve resources and ecologically sensitive
lands, and analyzes how various legal and social institutions assist or
hinder the ability of private individuals and associations to protect their
environment.  The Center seeks to publicize its findings through
publications, speeches, roundtables, and work with interested organizations.

<H1>THE ECONOMIC FALLACIES OF DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT</H1>
by Matthew C. Hoffman

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Recent years have seen the emergence of Demand-Side Management (DSM), a new
approach to the electricity utility planning process.  Through DSM programs,
utilities endeavor to diminish ratepayer demand to avoid supply costs and
capacity expansion.  Such programs typically encourage ratepayers to adopt
energy efficient lighting, heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems,
additional heat insulation, and other energy-saving investments, offering
partial or total subsidies for purchase and installation.  As an inducement,
shareholder-owned utilities are permitted to recover their DSM capital
investments and revenue losses by raising their rates.<p>
<p>
	DSM is premised on the notion that the self-interest of individuals is in
conflict with their behavior: Despite the availability of numerous
cost-effective energy efficiency investments, consumers have failed to adopt
them. <p>
<p>
	DSM theory classifies this apparent paradox as a species of &#147;market
failure.&#148;  In this view, the market imperfectly disseminates information
about the profitability of energy efficiency investments.  However, this
paradox may result from overestimation of the benefits of energy efficiency
investments.  In particular, DSM overestimates the benefits of energy
efficiency investments by:<p>
<UL>

<LI>only comparing investment options to the exclusion of other relevant choices
faced by energy consumers;  <p>
<LI>neglecting the non-monetary cost components of investments, including
transaction costs, measurement and evaluation costs, the risks and
uncertainties associated with the investment, its quality of service, and
others which often exceed the investment price of the asset significantly; and
<p>
<LI>ignoring the fact that true costs and benefits cannot be measured, since they
are subjectively experienced by individuals and therefore cannot be discerned
by external observers.  <p>
</UL>
Thus, the perceived market failure may be more accurately attributed to
overestimation of the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency improvements
rather than the failure of energy markets.<p>
<p>
	The enormous informational obstacles (i.e., the inability to accurately
measure costs and benefits) faced by DSM users raises an important question:
Why, given such glaring flaws, is it being attempted on such a grand scale?
The answer may be found in the incentives which confront the 
utilities, their larger commercial and industrial customers, their PUCs,
purveyors of energy efficient technologies, environmental activists, and other
DSM proponents. <p>
<p>
	DSM may more properly be seen as an attempt by various interested parties to
extract rents from others.  For instance:<p>

<UL>
<LI> Energy utilities see DSM as a means to improve their financial condition.  <p>

<LI> The PUC is able to distort its own performance, making it less accountable to
those who appoint the commissioners, and ultimately to the public at large.  <p>

<LI> Environmentalists see DSM as a way to connect the economic interest of
utilities to the realization of their own ideological goals, which include a
dramatic reduction in fossil fuel consumption and the consequent pollution.  <p>
<LI>Large commercial and industrial utility customers are subsidized, which allow
them to invest in energy efficiency at the ratepayer&#146;s expense.  <p>
<LI> DSM theorists, consultants and planners have made a cottage industry of DSM
planning.  They do not wish to see their jobs eliminated.  <p>
<LI> Producers of energy efficient technologies benefit enormously from the
inflated demand for their products.  These are all natural supporters of DSM
and other subsidy schemes.<p>
</UL>

	In its current form, DSM would be impossible without the monopoly power of the
utility, which allows it to raise rates and cross-subsidize DSM program
participants.  In recent years industrial power consumers are beginning to
demand access to the wholesale electricity market, bypassing the monopoly
utility.  This process is known as &#147;retail wheeling&#148; and would render
most DSM programs impossible.<p>
<p>
	DSM is flawed both in theory and practice.  Its theoretical foundation rests
on the discredited theories of central economic planning, which presume that
governmental and quasi-governmental institutions have the knowledge and
incentives to economize on behalf of individuals.<p>
<p>
	DSM&#146;s success can be effectively explained with a public choice model
that understands it as a &#147;racket,&#148; or a scheme to enable rent-seeking
on the part of special interests.  It is largely opposed by commercial and
industrial ratepayers, which seek to reduce its cross-subsidization effects and
clear the way for competitive electricity markets.  The outcome of that
struggle will ultimately determine the fate of DSM, as well as the nature of
the electricity industry in the United States.<p>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>It is often said that everyone is an environmentalist.  To be sure, every
American supports the goals of clean air, clean water, and the conservation of
natural resources.  This does not mean, however, that everyone supports current
environmental policies.  Indeed, the past few years have seen a rapid growth in
opposition to those policies now championed by environmental lobbying
organizations in Washington, D.C.  Today&#146;s overly politicized
environmental policy decisions too often result in poorly prioritized programs
more responsive to the sensational fear stories on the morning news than to
sound science.  State and local officials are bristling at the excessive costs
and rigidity of federally-imposed programs that divert resources and strain
local budgets.  Landowners nationwide are joining together in a grass-roots
movement against perceived environmentalist attacks on private property rights.
Business executives are crying &#147;enough is enough&#148; as the costs of
compliance continue to climb with no end in sight, and greater sums of money
are hurled fruitlessly at infinitesimal risks.  There is a growing consensus
that environmental policy is broken and needs to be fixed.<p>
     The Competitive Enterprise Institute shares that view, and has spent much of
the past decade advocating a critical reappraisal of environmental policy.  As
a former staffer at the Environmental Protection Agency, I have seen first hand
how misguided many environmental policies have become, and how easily
environmental protection can become a pretext for sacrificing individual
liberties and economic development to a green regulatory hydra.  What is needed
is for all of us to take environmental issues seriously enough that we open our
eyes to new approaches and a new environmental vision.<p>
     The environmental vision that CEI advocates is one that empowers individuals
and communities, not government  bureaucrats.  CEI believes that the best
defense of environmental resources comes from property rights, competitive
markets and common law liability rules, not politically determined and enforced
regulation.  This view is commonly referred to as &#147;free-market
environmentalism.&#148;<p>
     Under this approach, private stewardship arrangements would be encouraged to
empower all Americans to protect those environmental amenities that they value
most.  Free market environmentalism relies on creative approaches to extend
private property arrangements to ecological resources now exposed to the
tragedy of the commons, would reform the institutional arrangements for
addressing environmental risk by incorporating a recognition that regulations
can create risks as easily as they alleviate them, and would recognize that
pollution is best viewed as a trespass &#151; the coercive imposition of wastes
onto another&#146;s person or property &#151; rather than emissions per se.
These principles provide a powerful framework which would better integrate
ecological and economic values &#151; seeing people as a part of nature, rather
than as alien transgressors in the Garden of Eden.<p>
     This book is designed to help candidates share in the free-market
environmental vision, and to advocate a range of policies that can reorient
environmental policy so that it complements our political and economic
freedoms, rather than restricting them.  The first section of this book is a
series of brief essays to flesh out the insights of free-market
environmentalism.  The latter section consists of brief summaries of key issues
that will be in front of Congress in the years ahead.  We have also added a
selected bibliography for those who wish to learn more about the free-market
approach to environmental issues.  The CEI environmental staff &#151; the
largest free market environmental program in the Washington area, if not the
world &#151; is also ready, willing and able to explain CEI positions and
identify the research upon which CEI&#146;s positions are based.<p>
     In the past decade free market ideas have swept the globe.  The Berlin Wall
has fallen and the virtues of the free enterprise system and the individual
liberties upon which it rests are now widely recognized.  Tragically, current
environmental policies threaten a return to the horrors of centrally-planned
societies.  CEI is working to change that.  We hope that this monograph will
encourage you to as well.<p>

<H2>Environmental Foreign Aid</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>U.S. taxpayers currently give $1.2 billion in foreign aid for environmental
purposes.  An additional sum of taxpayer money is given to the World Bank, and
a significant portion of the Bank&#146;s $20 billion-plus loans are used for
environmental projects in developing countries.  As a rule, this money is not
well spent.  Just as foreign aid has failed to alleviate poverty and
underdevelopment in the Third World, so too will it fail to foster
environmental protection.<p>
     The Global Environment Facility (GEF), an environmental foreign aid program
run jointly by the World Bank and the United Nations, was first set up on a
trial basis in 1991.  The United States will contribute $430 million over the
next four years.  The GEF is viewed as a refund for the economic restrictions
imposed on Third World nations in the U.N. &#147;biodiversity&#148; and
&#147;climate change&#148; conventions.  While the GEF&#146;s goals may be
laudable, an internal World bank audit labelled the GEF
&#147;dysfunctional,&#148; serving only to make the Bank&#146;s own faulty loan
projects look &#147;greener&#148; and to &#147;mitigate criticism alleging
World Bank insensitivity to environmental concerns.&#148;<p>
     Not only is the GEF misspending U.S. assistance, the World Bank as a whole has
been accused of colossal environmental mismanagement and of subsidizing
wide-scale environmental destruction.  World Bank loans to a massive Narmada
Valley dam and canal project in India had to be discontinued in 1993 because of
intense local resistance.  The project called for forced resettlement of over
240,000 people.  When complete, the Narmada dam will eradicate 60,000 acres of
forests, farmland, and wildlife habitat and devastate the productive fisheries
of the Narmada river.  Similarly, the World Bank made over $1 billion in loans
to Brazil to clear rainforests for agro-industrial complexes, logging projects
and mining operations between 1975 and 1986.<p>
     The World Bank has enacted environmental &#147;reforms&#148; for itself and
the GEF.  But there is little reason to believe the &#147;greening&#148; of
foreign aid will change the Bank&#146;s bottom line.  An internal audit of
nearly two thousand loan projects found that 35 percent of all outstanding Bank
loans were &#147;unsuccessful&#148; as of 1991.  The failure rate represents
over $50 billion worth of loans.  If these loans are not repaid, much of the
financial burden will ultimately be passed on to taxpayers in the U.S., which
has guaranteed up to $36 billion of the Bank&#146;s portfolio against
default.<p>
     Both the American taxpayer and the environment have been ill-served by foreign
aid.  Rather than try to reform the aid giving process, it should simply be
eliminated, giving the American taxpayer a much-needed &#147;peace
dividend.&#148;<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Will America lose global leadership without foreign aid?</i><p>
<p>
A: Foreign aid has not been successful in promoting economic progress in the
developing world.  It has only propped up corrupt bureaucracies and accelerated
environmental degradation.  If the U.S. opens its markets to developing
countries, they will be able to export their way out of poverty, while
enriching American consumers.  Trade, not aid, is the best way America can show
foreign policy leadership.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>If America cuts back on foreign aid, won&#146;t it lose jobs to Japan in
the rapidly growing field of environmental technology exports?</i><p>
<p>
A: Jobs cannot be created by transferring wealth from American taxpayers to
foreign governments.  Even if foreign governments spent all of the aid on U.S.
products and technology, American consumers would have less money to spend in
the U.S. domestic economy.  Recipients of foreign aid subsidies may benefit,
but the U.S. cannot get rich by giving money away.  American technology and
know-how would be more competitive abroad if the federal government lowered
taxes on capital, investment, and labor.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>How can America prevent degradation of the global environment without
foreign aid programs for &#147;sustainable development?&#148;</i><p>
<p>
A: Foreign aid programs launched at the 1992 U.N. Earth Summit have required
continued U.S. taxpayer contributions to the World Bank.  Yet this type of
foreign aid has been the chief cause of environmental degradation in the first
place.  World Bank loans have been responsible for destroying rainforests in
Brazil and for subsidizing unsustainable government construction projects in
India.  The World Bank is not the vehicle for saving the planet.<p>
     America cannot preserve biological diversity by subsidizing Third World
government restrictions on land use.  Rather, Third World countries should
create a more sustainable environment by placing more land under private
ownership, giving individuals greater incentives to conserve biological and
other natural resources.<p>

<H2>Federal Lands</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>The federal government is the largest landowner in the United States, owning
nearly one-third of the land.  Federal ownership of land is most pervasive in
the Western United States.  The federal government owns over half of the state
of California and over 80 percent of Nevada.  In some areas, such as
California&#146;s Inyo County, the federal government owns over 90 percent of
the land.  Federal land ownership has resulted in extensive land mismanagement
and is an affront to the tradition of private property in this country.<p>
     Such expansive government control of land means that land-use decisions are
based upon political considerations, rather than on economic or environmental
grounds.  Often these decisions are made in Washington, D.C. with little
concern for the needs and concerns of local communities.  As a result, federal
lands are routinely mismanaged and a drain on the American taxpayer.  Moreover,
federal control of lands often entails the imposition of land-use controls on
neighboring communities.  This increases the costs of federal ownership of
land.<p>
     Federal land is managed by the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of
Reclamation, the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service in the
Department of the Interior, as well as by the Forest Service in the Department
of Agriculture, among others.  This duplication of responsibilities is
inefficient.  The problem is compounded by the fact that different land
agencies often work at cross purposes and fail to coordinate important
activities such as fire control.<p>
     Two key reforms should be implemented to ensure that the federal government is
more responsible and efficient in its management of federal lands.  These
are:<p>
<UL>
<LI><p><B>No Net Loss of Private Property</b> &#151; The federal government owns a
sufficient portion of the country as it is.  There is no need for federal
landholdings to increase.  At the same time, the federal government owns much
land that has no need to be in federal hands.  This reform would simply require
the federal government to sell an offsetting portion of land before engaging in
further land acquisition.  Thus if the federal government wished to purchase a
2,000 acre wilderness area, it could do so only if it transferred 2,000 acres
of federal land into the private sector.<p>

<LI><p><b>Self-Sufficiency for Federal Land Units </b>&#151; Many federal lands are a
drain on the treasury, and therefore a burden on the taxpayer.  This is even
true of lands where the federal government collects user fees for
timber-cutting, grazing, or recreation.  Congress should require each federal
land unit that is used for commercial or recreational purposes to become
self-sufficient.  This means that land managers would be forced either to cut
administrative costs or increase user fees for resource development and
recreation so that the individual units no longer lose money.  Such efficient
management occurs on private and state lands; it should occur on federal lands
as well.<p>

</UL>
<p>
     Ultimately, the federal government should divest itself of significant
portions of its landholdings, donating ecologically-sensitive parcels to
conservation organizations and selling much of the remainder to private
interests.  America was built upon a tradition of private property; that
tradition should be upheld.<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Federal lands are clearly mismanaged.  But isn&#146;t there mismanagement
on private lands as well?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A: There is mismanagement on all types of land, private and federal.  However,
private lands, on the whole, tend to be managed better than public lands.  When
a private landowner mismanages land, that owner bears the cost, economic and
otherwise, as the value of the land declines.  Federal land managers, on the
other hand, bear none of the costs of land mismanagement.  Taxpayers bear this
burden. This disparate incentive structure means that private lands tend to be
managed more soundly.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q:<i> How would you propose transferring lands from the federal government to
the private sector?</i><p>
<p>
A: There is no easy answer to this question.  One possibility would be for
Congress to appoint a Commission (akin to the military base commission) to
inventory all federal lands and evaluate what uses are appropriate on which
lands.  Those lands that are primarily used for logging, ranching, or other
resource development purposes could be the first to be transferred into the
private sector.  After all, the private sector is more than capable of managing
such economic concerns.  The Commission also could identify which lands, if
any, must remain under federal control because of environmental sensitivity or
other compelling concerns.  This process could also be used to consolidate the
numerous federal land agencies to increase the efficiency of land management
and prevent federal land agencies from working at cross-purposes.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q:<i> Would divesting the federal government of land ownership eliminate
outdoor recreational opportunities for Americans?</i><p>
<p>
A: Not necessarily.  There are many private lands that are managed for
recreation in conjunction with other uses.  For example, IP Timberlands in the
southeastern United States manages many of its lands for both timber production
and recreation.  Because trees are only cut every few decades, IP Timberlands
is able to encourage the use of its land for hiking, camping, hunting and bird
watching in the interim.  This not only means that IP Timberlands makes a
greater profit from its land, it means that the land is managed in a more
ecologically sound manner as well.<p>

<H2>Global Climate Change</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>There is no compelling reason for the United States to take drastic actions to
reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other &#147;greenhouse gases.&#148;
There is little evidence that human activity is having more than a marginal
impact on the Earth&#146;s climate and even less that moderate climate shifts
will be disastrous for either human civilization or the environment.<p>
     There is widespread disagreement within the scientific community on both the
nature of global climate change, and the impact it would have on the human
environment.  Recent polls by the Gallup organization and the environmentalist
group Greenpeace demonstrate that there is no scientific consensus to support
the proposition that human activity will produce an apocalyptic warming of the
Earth&#146;s atmosphere.  The primary basis for predictions of human-induced
global warming is a series of complex computer models that have difficulty
predicting present conditions, let alone future possibilities.  As these models
are refined and become more accurate, the direness of their predictions
recedes.<p>
     Moreover, the earth&#146;s climate is in constant flux, and human-induced
changes cannot be presumed necessarily bad.  A warming that occurs
predominately at higher latitudes and at night, as some suggest is the most
probable scenario, would hardly make for an environmental disaster.  Indeed,
some scientists even suggest that it might be, on net, beneficial.  Growing
seasons would be lengthened, and most people would experience a more benign
climate.  Furthermore, there is substantial evidence that increased levels of
atmospheric carbon dioxide would spur terrific advances in plant growth and
agricultural productivity.  In other words, the likeliest global climate change
is the creation of a milder, greener, more prosperous world.<p>
     Global climate science is fraught with uncertainty.  There is no clear
evidence that human activity will drive temperatures significantly upward, and
none that human-induced changes will have on balance a negative impact.  As the
late Roger Revelle, vice President Al Gore&#146;s mentor on global climate
change, wrote shortly before his death, &#147;<i>the scientific evidence for
greenhouse warming is too uncertain to justify drastic action at this
time</i>&#148; (emphasis in original).<p>
     However it is clear that enacting wide-scale policies to forcibly reduce
emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases would impose
tremendous costs on the American people.  Policies to increase the price of
energy would have a regressive impact and stifle economic productivity.
Emission reduction mandates will cost tens of billions of dollars and produce
no certain benefits.  Looking carefully at the issue, it seems that the risks
of global warming are outweighed by the risks of global warming policy.<p>
     The United States should not embark on a series of costly and ill-conceived
policies seeking to avert an unlikely catastrophe.  Prudence requires that the
U.S. enact only those policies to address global climate change which are
valuable in their own right &#151; such as eliminating subsidies that promote
the excess use of fossil fuels and encouraging increased efficiency in energy
production through the introduction of competition in the electric utility
industry.  Steps beyond these simply cannot be justified given current
knowledge of potential climate change.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>The Earth&#146;s average temperature has risen in the past 100 years as
emissions of greenhouse gases have increased.  Isn&#146;t this evidence of
global warming?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A: The Earth has gotten warmer in this century.  But most of the warming
occurred in the first half of this century, prior to World War II.  This was
before the dramatic increase in greenhouse gases occurred.  The increase in
greenhouse gases has occurred primarily in the past few decades.  Thus, most of
the warming in the past 100 years is more likely the result of natural climate
fluctuations than of human activity.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Whether the Earth will warm and how warm it will get are still matters of
speculation, but human-induced global warming is a real possibility.  Should
not we take precautionary measures, just in case?</i><p>
<p>
A: Precautionary measures are sometimes a prudent course of action.  Yet, the
simple fact is that coerced reductions in energy use will not come without
costs, both in terms of economic growth and in terms of social dislocation.  As
Dr. Richard Stroup of Montana State University points out, &#147;If
&#145;insurance&#146; against a particular risk, such as the threat of global
warming, is bought at the cost of reduced economic growth, then a decline in
the automatic insurance represented by wealth, and the social resilience it
provides, is one of the costs borne by future generations.&#148;  In other
words, inexpensive precautionary measures &#151; such as those that can be
justified in their own right &#151; may make sense.  Expensive precautionary
measures, on the other hand, may cause more harm than they prevent.<p>
     People do not emit greenhouse gas emissions capriciously.  These emissions are
the by-products of a wide range of activities that benefit everybody, from the
production of goods and services, the transportation of food and medicines, and
the generation of wealth throughout society.  Dramatically reducing greenhouse
gas emissions would mean giving all of this up for uncertain benefits.  That is
not a prudent policy.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Why should we take the risk that human activity is warming the
planet?</i><p>
<p>
A: The Earth&#146;s climate is in constant flux.  Temperatures vary from year
to year, decade to decade, thus it is difficult to say that one climate
condition is preferable to another.  Greenhouse gas emissions may cause the
Earth to warm slightly, but that warming is most likely to occur at winter and
at night.  Moreover, warming would produce benefits, as well as costs.  An
increase in the Earth&#146;s food-growing capacity might well offset a marginal
increase in wintertime low temperatures.<p>
     For the time being it makes more sense to continue to study the potential of
global warming and what it might mean for human society.  Should scientific
research confirm the need for action, there will be time to implement the
proper policies.<p>

<H2>Interstate Transport of Waste</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>The United States Constitution explicitly forbids state and local governments
from interfering  with interstate commerce.  In environmentally-related cases,
the Supreme Court has consistently held that &#147;a State may not accord its
own inhabitants a preferred right of access over consumers in other States to
natural resources located within its borders.&#148;  This is also true of waste
disposal services.  Congress should respect the intent of the framers of the
Constitution and the Supreme Court and not enact laws permitting state and
local interference with the interstate transportation of waste.<p>
     States that seek to limit the interstate transportation of waste argue that
some states should not be the dumping grounds for others.  In effect, they
argue that all states should be self-sufficient with regard to waste disposal
services.  This makes no more sense than arguing that all states should be
self-sufficient with regard to food production, energy generation, or mineral
supplies.  Different regions have a comparative advantage in the provision of
certain goods and services.  Unrestricted commerce throughout the nation
promotes the public interest by allowing specialization to increase efficiency,
lower prices and spur innovation.  This is as true in the field of waste
disposal as it is in any other.<p>
     Trade between states occurs for the same reason as trade between countries.
Trade occurs between parties that seek mutual advantage.  Trade encourages
specialization and greater productivity.  The ability of waste disposal
companies to attract business from other states increases the incentive to
develop the most efficient and environmentally-sound waste disposal processes.
Limiting the interstate transportation of waste eliminates these incentives,
and can actually have a negative impact on the environment.<p>
     While some states try to ban waste imports, some municipalities attempt to
restrict waste <i>exports</i> through so-called flow control ordinances.  These
local ordinances require local businesses to process and/or dispose of waste at
a predetermined facility.  This prevents companies that generate waste from
seeking the most efficient means of disposing of that waste.  The Supreme Court
has properly ruled that flow control ordinances are unconstitutional violations
of the interstate commerce clause.  Such ordinances are also unreasonable
infringements upon the right to contract.  They discriminate against
out-of-state companies, increasing waste disposal prices at the expense of the
consumer and the environment.<p>
     It is one thing for governments to impose health and safety regulations that
affect the transportation of waste.  It is quite another for governments to
limit the transportation of waste, as several states have tried to do.
Congress should refrain from authorizing any state or local infringements upon
interstate commerce in solid waste and waste disposal services.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Which states are most involved in shipping waste elsewhere and why?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A: The simple fact is that most states and the District of Columbia <i>both</i>
import and export solid waste.  In 1992, for example, 47 states exported waste
and 42 states imported waste from other parts of the country.  Interstate trade
in waste occurs because communities and waste disposal companies are always
looking for the least expensive and most efficient means of handling trash.
Sometimes this means using a local incinerator or recycling facility, in other
cases it means hauling the waste to a landfill, perhaps one across state
lines.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Why should some states be the dumping grounds for the rest of the
country?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A: Each region of the country has particular features &#151; geography,
population density, natural resource deposits, access to water, etc. &#151;
that make it particularly suited for the provision of particular goods and
services.  Just as some parts of the country are more suited for coal  mining
or orange growing than others, some parts of the country have a comparative
advantage in the provision of waste disposal services.  Some communities reap
significant economic benefits by providing waste disposal services for other
parts of the country.  Indeed, these communities see importing waste as an
opportunity, not a burden.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q:<i> Don&#146;t local flow control laws enable municipalities to manage solid
waste in a more environmentally-sound manner?</i><p>
<p>
A: The experience of most communities with flow control laws is that such rules
are used to prop up inefficient facilities at the expense of consumers
<i>and</i> environmental improvements.  By mandating that local waste haulers
use particular management facilities, they are prevented from using less
expensive or more environmentally-sound alternatives that may exist elsewhere.
The Sierra Club, for one, has pointed out that these regulations often inhibit
the development of recycling facilities and other waste management alternatives
in the marketplace.  It is actually likely that flow control laws do far more
environmental harm than good.<p>

<H2>Mandatory Recycling</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Recycling can be a useful exercise, reducing the need for raw materials and
the costs of waste disposal.  Recycling can also be a wasteful use of energy,
time and money.  Even from the environmental standpoint, recycling is not
always the best option.  Recycling can impose environmental costs, such as the
sludge generated from recycling paper or the increased energy use of collecting
and sorting some recyclable products.  The benefits of recycling, environmental
and otherwise, vary on a case-by-case and material-by-material basis.  Whether
or not to recycle a particular material or product should be determined by the
marketplace, not by government fiat.<p>
     The primary problem with recycling is that for most materials it is far more
expensive to sort, collect and process recyclables than it is to use raw
materials.  Indeed, the costs of collection alone are often more than the value
of the recyclable materials.  Where using recycled materials is not more
expensive than other options, recycling typically occurs absent government
intervention.  Thus mandatory recycling programs act as a hidden tax on
consumers who must pay for the additional cost of recycling through higher
prices, higher local taxes, or higher waste hauling assessments.  It is likely
that most people who support recycling are not aware that it will cost them
more.<p>
     A variant of mandatory recycling is to mandate a set percentage of recycled
content for particular products, such as newspapers.  As with other recycling
mandates, recycled-content laws increase costs for consumers while providing
minimal benefits.  For example, it is estimated that a 25 percent
recycled-content standard for plastics would increase the price of soft drink
containers by 10 percent.  Additionally, some materials that are more difficult
to recycle are actually to be preferred on environmental grounds, because they
are lighter, more compact, and require fewer resources to manufacture.  For
example, coffee can be packaged in lightweight, compact foil-plastic packs that
are difficult to recycle.  Yet this packaging leaves less than one-sixth the
waste of the dominant recyclable alternative.   Finally, politically determined
recycled-content mandates will always be set at arbitrary levels.  There is no
environmental basis upon which to prefer 10 percent recycled content over 20
percent or 5 percent.<p>
     It is important to remember that when recycling costs more than other options,
this reflects the higher value of resource expenditures required to recycle.
Dedicating these resources to recycling means that they cannot be used for
other things, no matter how useful or important.  If driven by the market,
recycling will only occur where it is the most efficient use of resources.  If
driven by politics, recycling will be an expensive and wasteful policy.<p>
     The United States generates 195 million tons-per-year of municipal solid
waste.  There is no doubt that some portion of this will be recycled.  How much
should be determined by market forces, rather than by government-imposed
mandatory recycling or recycled-content laws.  <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Don&#146;t we need to recycle because we are running out of landfill
space?</i><p>
<p>
A: No. 195 million tons-per-year sounds like a lot of solid waste of which to
dispose.  However, disposing of that waste in landfills poses little problem
for a nation nearly three million square miles big (not including Alaska).
Indeed, all of the solid waste produced in the United Sates over the next
one-thousand years could be landfilled on less than one-tenth of one percent of
America&#146;s land.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Doesn&#146;t recycling save resources?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Sometimes recycling does save resources.  Recycling aluminum, for example,
saves energy, and consequently money as well.  This is why aluminum has been
recycled for decades even without a government mandate.  In other instances,
however, recycling may not save resources.  Recycling may require a greater use
of energy or water, or even labor and money &#151; all of which are important
resources.  Finally, it needs to be recognized that as resources become scarce,
their prices rise.  This gives the market a signal to begin conserving,
recycling or developing alternatives.  Recycling can be encouraged by the
market in this way, without political intervention.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q:<i> Doesn&#146;t recycling a ton of paper save 17 trees?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Not necessarily.  Demand for paper is not a significant factor in
deforestation.  Most paper is made from either sawmill waste, scrap wood, or
trees planted solely for that purpose.  The planting of trees has been a key
factor in the growth of America&#146;s forests during the past several decades;
timberland acreage has increased by approximately 10 percent since 1952 and
there are now more trees in America&#146;s forests than at any other time in
this century.  In fact, by reducing the demand for paper, recycling could
actually discourage timber companies from planting more trees.<p>

<H2>Pesticides</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Since the publication of Rachel Carson&#146;s <i>Silent Spring</i>, the use of
pesticides has been an environmental concern.  To some extent that concern is
reasonable.  Unfortunately, exaggerated fears have produced policies that
unnecessarily limit the use of pesticides, increase food prices and retard the
development of better agricultural techniques.  U.S. pesticide laws need to be
reformed, not to be made more stringent, but to account more accurately for
both the risks of pesticides as well as the risks of doing without them.<p>
     The centerpiece of pesticide regulation is the so-called Delaney Clause.  It
is also the most controversial aspect.  Enacted in 1958, the Delaney Clause
prohibits residues of any pesticide or food additive in processed food that has
caused cancer in rodent lab tests.  As a result, the Delaney Clause bars the
use of pesticides for many food products in cases where there is no
identifiable risk to human health.  There is a wide consensus within the
scientific community that the Delaney Clause imposes an unreasonable standard.
This view is shared by Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency.  The central problem with the Delaney Clause is that its
standard has no relation to human cancer risks.  For this reason, many
scientists recommend replacing the Delaney Clause standard with a negligible or
&#147;de minimus&#148; risk standard.  This means that pesticide residues would
be prohibited only when they pose a non-negligible human health risk.  This
standard would be based on actual threats to human health, and not arbitrary
requirements.<p>
     Another problem with current pesticide regulation is the bias toward older,
less-effective, and potentially more dangerous pesticides.  New pesticides must
be submitted to an expensive registration process that can cost as much as $50
million and take eight to ten years.  This discourages companies from
developing newer, more efficient and safer pesticides to replace existing
pesticides that are already registered.  Technological advances have increased
the benefits available from the use of pesticides.  The current registration
process should be streamlined so that society can take advantage of these
benefits.<p>
     It is important to remember that pesticides are used for a reason.  They
reduce the loss of agricultural products to weeds and insects and increase
agricultural productivity.  Because of pesticides, America has a far more
abundant food supply and lower prices for food products.  Eliminating the use
of chemical pesticides would dramatically reduce crop yields.  It is estimated
that corn production would decline by a third and that fresh apples would no
longer be available in most supermarkets if synthetic pesticide use were
eliminated.  For most applications, there are simply not available alternatives
to the use of chemical pesticides in farming.<p>
     Pesticides are not only responsible for a more abundant food supply.
Pesticides can play an important role in the protection of environmental
quality as well.  By increasing agricultural productivity, pesticides make it
possible to devote less land to farming, leaving more land for other uses.  In
developing countries this means that there is less pressure to clear forests
and destroy wildlife habitat to create farmland.  Soil erosion is a serious
environmental concern.  Innovations such as no-till farming, which rely upon
the use of pesticides, can greatly reduce the extent of soil erosion.  If the
use of pesticides were eliminated, so too would the environmental benefits of
practices like no-till farming.<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Would reducing the use of pesticides lead to a safer food supply?</i><p>
<p>
A: No.  Scientists are nearly unanimous in their view that minuscule pesticide
residues on food pose no real health risk to human beings.  However, if
reducing the use of pesticides led to a decreased availability of many fruits
and vegetables, it could actually lead to a <i>less safe</i> food supply.
Scientists like Dr. Bruce Ames of the University of California at Berkeley make
it clear that people are at greater risk from not eating fruits and vegetables
as part of a balanced diet than they are from eating foods with negligible
pesticide residues on them.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Some groups say that children are at the greatest risk from pesticides on
fruits and vegetables.  What should be done about this?</i><p>
<p>
A: No one wants to place America&#146;s children at risk.  That is precisely
why the federal government should not try to eliminate the use of pesticides.
Children&#146;s health is dependent on many things, not the least of which is a
healthy and balanced diet.  Forced reductions in the use of pesticides would
mean a reduction in agricultural productivity and higher food prices.  Some
products, such as commercial apples, could not be grown without the use of
pesticides.  Because reducing pesticides use would increase the prices of many
food products, it would have its most pernicious impact on those with fixed
incomes and the poor.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q:<i> Don&#146;t many pesticides cause cancer in lab animals?</i><p>
<p>
A: Yes, but so do all sorts of natural compounds.  Where scientists once
thought that testing chemicals on rats was a good way to determine whether
those chemicals could cause cancer in humans, scientists now recognize that rat
tests are flawed.  Feeding large doses of chemicals to rats until they die is
not a good way to identify risks to human beings.  If it were, we would all be
at risk of getting cancer from eating celery, peanut butter and mushrooms, as
well as drinking coffee.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>What is wrong with organic farming?</i><p>
<p>
A: Nothing is &#147;wrong&#148; with organic farming, just as nothing is
necessarily &#147;right&#148; with it either.  Consumers who prefer to purchase
organic foods should have the freedom to do so.  But those consumers who find
that organic products are more expensive or less appealing should also have the
option of purchasing non-organic foods.  The extent to which organic farming is
used should be determined by the marketplace, not be government policy.<p>

<H2>Property Rights and &#145;Takings&#146;</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>The &#147;takings clause&#148; of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution
reads, &#147;nor shall private property be taken for public use without just
compensation.&#148;  Despite this clear admonition, federal environmental
regulations routinely &#147;take&#148; the property of American citizens
without compensation.  In the interests of fairness and Constitutional
integrity, it is important that landowners be compensated for government
takings of their land.<p>
     In the 1960 Supreme Court decision of <i>Armstrong v. U.S.</i>, the Supreme
Court wrote that the primary purpose of the Takings Clause is &#147;to bar
Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all
fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.&#148;  When a
landowner is forced to provide a portion of his or her land for public purposes
&#151; such as species habitat, &#147;greenways,&#148; and so on &#151; this
principle should apply.<p>
     Environmental laws, such as the Endangered Species Act, were passed by
Congress to benefit the public as a whole.  It is only fair that the burden of
these laws be paid for by the public as a whole, rather than by those
unfortunate landowners whose property happens to have characteristics that are
valued by the public at large.<p>
     Consider the following examples:<p>
<UL>

<LI><p>
Just outside Moab, Utah, a small town known for its scenic beauty and
proximity to two national parks, Brandt Child planned to build a campground and
golf course on his property.  The project came to an abrupt halt when the Fish
and Wildlife Service declared that the natural springs on Child&#146;s property
were habitat for the endangered Kanab Ambersnail.  The site was fenced off and
Child was forbidden to work in the area.  Child&#146;s land has been
effectively taken by the federal government because he can no longer use it.
He has estimated his losses at $2.5 million. Child is being forced to bear the
financial burden of protecting an endangered species, while the public as whole
benefits.<p>

<LI><p>
In the case of <i>Dolan v. City of Tigard</i>, the Dolans learned that they
could only receive a permit to expand their plumbing supply store if they gave
the city of Tigard 10 percent of their land for use as a bike path and
&#147;greenway.&#148; The Supreme Court ruled in 1994 that this amounted to a
taking of private property without just compensation.<p>
<p>
</UL>

     Congress should reaffirm the Constitutional protections afforded to private
property rights.  In particular, Congress should:<p>
<UL>
<LI><p>
Explicitly instruct regulatory agencies to analyze their regulations to
determine when takings will occur;<p>

<LI><p>
Require that compensation be paid directly from the budget of the agency
responsible for the regulation that resulted in a &#147;taking.&#148;<p>
<p>
</UL>
Property rights are the foundation of a free society and a free market economy.
They must be protected.<p>
<p>

Q: <i>Isn&#146;t the &#147;takings&#148; movement really about forcing the
taxpayer to pay polluters not to pollute?</i><p>
<p>
A: Not at all. All individuals should have the right to use their property as
they see fit, provided that they are not inflicting harm upon others.  This
means that there is no right to pollute the property of one&#146;s neighbor.
Compensation for &#147;takings&#148; is about compensating landowners when the
government tells them that they cannot make <i>reasonable use</i> of their
land, such as building a home, planting crops, or perhaps just maintaining
species habitat.  Yet these are all examples of actions that have been
prohibited by the government on private lands.  These are the type of
injustices that the &#147;takings&#148; movement seeks to redress.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Will compensating landowners for &#147;takings&#148; bankrupt the
government?</i><p>
<p>
A: If regulatory agencies continue to conduct business as usual, it will
certainly cost the government a lot of money to compensate landowners.
However, ensuring that landowners are compensated for regulatory actions that
deprive them of the reasonable use of their land will restore accountability to
regulatory actions by forcing agencies to consider the costs, economic and
otherwise, of their regulatory decisions.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Will forcing regulatory agencies to engage in &#147;takings&#148;
assessments bog them down in red tape and prevent them from fulfilling their
duties, such as protecting the environment?</i><p>
<p>
A: Adding this small requirement onto existing review, public notice and
comment procedures should not hinder any agency from achieving its mission.
The federal government is always required to file an environmental impact
statement when undertaking a new initiative.  All that &#147;takings&#148;
advocates ask, is that the federal government give the same deference to the
Constitutional rights of American citizens and assess how those rights may be
impacted by regulatory activities.  <p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Shouldn&#146;t landowners and developers be expected to anticipate
possible regulatory actions and to take those considerations into account when
purchasing land?</i><p>
<p>
A: In many of the &#147;takings&#148; cases that are mentioned, individuals
owned their land well in advance of any regulatory action.  It was only after
the fact that government agencies decided to bar reasonable land-uses, such as
farming or building a home.  More importantly, the fundamental issue is what
types of land-use should be barred without compensation from the government.

<H2>Risk Assessment</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Regulators are supposed to make our lives safer by eliminating or reducing our
exposure to certain risky substances and products, such as toxic chemicals,
dangerous food additives, or cars without airbags.  The problem is that the
current federal regulatory process often focuses on minute risks while ignoring
far greater threats to public health and safety.  This approach not only wastes
public and private resources, it diverts attention away from those things about
which people should be most concerned.<p>
     In the last fifteen years, regulatory policy has too often evolved in reaction
to popular panic to sensational fear stories in the media, not in response to
sound science.  As a result billions of dollars are wasted every year in
battling problems that are not considered dangerous, leaving no money for
others that cause far more harm.  The government needs to do a better job of
quantifying risks and focusing on those risks which require government action,
as opposed to those which do not.<p>
     Consider the example of a hazardous waste site in New Hampshire that was to be
cleaned up under federal law.  After much expense, the site was clean by any
reasonable standard.  The Environmental Protection Agency, however, was
unsatisfied and demanded that the company spend an additional $9.3 million to
make the soil on the site clean enough for children to eat small amounts of
dirt for 245 days of the year.  This might be justifiable if the site was
destined to become a kindergarten playground.  The site in question, however,
was located in the middle of a swamp.  The dirt-eating children were
nonexistent.  Yet federal regulations required that $9.3 million be spent on
clean up, even though it would not reduce risks to human health whatsoever.
The $9.3 million could have been spent to address other, more important
concerns.<p>
     Congress should pass legislation to reform the federal government&#146;s
efforts at risk assessment and prioritization.  Those reforms should include:<p>
<UL>
<LI><p>An open, transparent process for risk assessments to ensure credibility and
identify critical science issues and uncertainties;<p>

<LI><p>The requirement of a scientific &#147;best estimate&#148; of risks with which
other estimates can be compared;<p>

<LI><p>Publicly available information concerning the population at risk, exposure
scenarios, and known substitution risks;<p>

<LI><p>Meaningful comparisons to other risks to provide an overall perspective;<p>

<LI><p>
A process to review current regulations in light of new scientific
information;<p>

<LI><p>Required analysis of the potential negative impact of proposed risk
regulations on human health and safety;<p>
<p>

<LI><p>Creation of &#147;ombudsman&#148; offices within regulatory agencies with the
purpose of questioning regulatory assumptions and highlighting the costs of
regulatory actions that seek to minimize risks to human health and the
environment.<p>

</UL>
<p>
There are many risks to human health and safety.  Without more accurate risk
assessment and prioritization, taxpayer dollars will continue to be squandered
on questionable programs that do little, if anything, to promote public health,
safety, and environmental protection.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i> Shouldn&#146;t the government be protecting us from all unreasonable
risks?</i><p>
<p>
A:  In a world of unlimited abundance and perfect information, the government
might be able to do that.  But society and the government have limited
resources and different people have different risk-reduction priorities.  The
best course of action for the government is to identify the worst risks so that
people can focus their limited resources on those.  In a utopian world, there
would be no risks; there would also be no crime, no hunger, no wars, and so on.
In the real world, risks are always present.  Risk cannot be eliminated, it can
only be managed. The goal is a &#147;safer&#148; world, not a &#147;safe&#148;
world. More effective management of risks is better served by the promulgation
of more accurate information on risks than it is by proscriptive government
regulations.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q:  <i>Risk assessment sounds like putting a price on life.  How can you put an
price on life?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  Benjamin Franklin once said, &#147;In this world nothing can be said to be
certain, except death and taxes.&#148;  Risk assessment doesn&#146;t put a
price on life.  But it does try to focus the government&#146;s resources in
order to make death a little less certain and taxes a little less burdensome.
If the government is going to spend over $100 billion on addressing
environmental risks,  it is important to know how best to spend that money to
make everybody&#146;s lives healthier and safer.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q:<i> Do government agencies tend to exaggerate risks?</i><p>
<p>
A: Yes.  Government agencies often exaggerate the risks they are entrusted to
regulate.  That is because government agencies have to demonstrate they are
needed to continue to receive taxpayer funds.  This does not mean agencies
always exaggerate the nature of risks; it does mean, however, that agencies
often have a strong incentive to do just that.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Are there alternatives to federal risk regulation?</i><p>
<p>
A: Certainly.  Many risks that the federal government focuses on do not require
government attention at all.  This is not because these risks do not exist, but
because different individuals and communities are willing to accept different
trade-offs between  environmental risk reduction and other risk reduction or
life-enhancing measures.  These decisions should be left in the hands of the
affected individuals and communities as much as is possible, just as people are
allowed to take risks voluntarily, from riding motorcycles to hangliding, when
they choose.  Where government involvement is unavoidable, regulation should be
undertaken based upon the best available information and the regulated risks
should be placed within their proper context.<p>

<H2>Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Today&#146;s drinking water systems are capable of efficiently delivering 40
million gallons of safe water to American homes everyday.  All in all, they
work quite well.  Nonetheless the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is in need of
reform.  The current law is too rigid and fails to prioritize risks.<p>
     The SDWA currently requires the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
establish drinking water standards for 83 specific contaminants.  Additionally,
the SDWA requires the EPA to pick an additional 25 contaminants every three
years to regulate.  This mandate applies irrespective of whether there are
additional, identifiable contaminants that pose a human health risk in
America&#146;s water supply.  According to the EPA, the total cost for
implementing the new standards is $1.4 billion a year, nearly all of which is
paid for by local governments.<p>
     This combination of extreme rigidity and high cost results in wasteful
regulation.    For example, the city of Columbus, Ohio, spends thousands of
dollars a year to test its drinking water for 43 pesticides it knows it
won&#146;t find.  One of those pesticides (EBDB) has been banned for all
commercial uses except one, growing pineapples.  Needless to say, pineapples
are not grown in Ohio.  Indeed, most of the pesticides for which the state of
Ohio must test have never been found in Ohio waters.<p>
     The SDWA is premised on the idea that EPA bureaucrats, from thousands of miles
away, are better able than local public health officials to determine the
public health needs of a local community.  EPA officials are necessarily
unfamiliar with the problems of most local communities.  Therefore, this
assumption is questionable, at best.<p>
     To improve the SDWA, a reform package should include the following:<p>
<p>
<UL>

<LI><p>Scientifically accurate assessments of the risks posed by drinking water
contaminants, independently and in relation to other health risks.<p>

<LI><p>
Funding for the compliance of mandatory regulatory standards.  If the federal
government sets stringent new standards which will be expensive to implement,
it should either supply funds for compliance with the standard or make it
voluntary.<p>

<LI><p>
Greater flexibility for local water agencies to set standards based on local
needs.<p>

</UL>
<p>
In the long run, the federal government should return authority for safe
drinking water programs back to the local level.  Safe drinking water is
primarily a local concern and local authorities are up to the task of
protecting their communities from water-borne contaminants.  There is little,
if any, compelling need for continued federal intervention in this area.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i> In Milwaukee in 1993, more than one hundred thousand people became sick
after a parasite infected the water supply.  Shouldn&#146;t the Safe Drinking
Water Act be strengthened to keep what happened in Milwaukee from happening
elsewhere?</i><p>
<p>
A:  No, the Safe Drinking Water Act is part of the problem.  By requiring
municipalities to test, monitor and treat for so many chemicals (most of which
do not even occur in their local water supplies), the Safe Drinking Water Act
diverts attention and resources away from the most important problems.  Local
water agencies have limited budgets.  When the EPA forces them to test, monitor
and treat for obscure contaminants, it spreads the agencies&#146; resources
even thinner, increasing the likelihood that a mistake will occur.  The
parasite that infected Milwaukee is called Cryptosporidium.  The EPA had been
so busy writing regulations for obscure contaminants that it had not even
developed an approved method to test for the parasite until  thousands became
ill in Milwaukee.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q:  <i>An environmental group recently reported that one out of five Americans
drank water that was inadequately treated for pollutants.  Shouldn&#146;t the
Safe Drinking Water Act be strengthened to ensure that everyone&#146;s water is
adequately treated?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  The current Safe Drinking Water Act is part of the problem, regulating more
stringently or writing more regulations will only exacerbate the problem.
Inadequate treatment occurs most frequently when a water agency&#146;s budget
is stretched to the limit.  Forcing municipalities, especially small
municipalities, to test, monitor and treat so many different substances without
providing additional funds, creates more problems than it solves.<p>

<H2>Secondhand Smoke</H2>

<P>Fueled by public health hysteria, numerous measures have been introduced by
federal, state, and local governments to ban smoking in restaurants and
workplaces.  These pressures should be vigorously resisted.  Scientific
evidence does not support the claim that secondhand smoke is a health threat to
non-smokers.  More importantly, workplaces and restaurants are private spaces,
entered voluntarily by individuals.  Government agencies should not ban smoking
in such places under the guise of protecting public health or anything else.<p>
     Some individuals undeniably dislike being in smoke-filled restaurants and
other public places.  Others like to smoke.  The proper way to handle this
contentious issue is to allow independent establishments to determine their own
smoking rules.  Consumers will then vote with their wallets, frequenting those
establishments that cater to their preferences with regard to the amount of
smoke, as they do with food preparation, quality of service, ambience, and so
on.  If some people object to eating in a smoke-filled restaurant, they are
free to eat somewhere else.  Restaurant owners should be equally free in their
choice whether or not to accommodate smokers, non-smokers, or both.  The same
should be true of all privately owned establishments.<p>
     The impetus behind the movement to ban smoking is an Environmental Protection
Agency study. This study examined other studies to discern a statistical
relationship between secondhand smoke exposure and lung cancer. Almost all of
the studies EPA looked at found no relationship between the two.  Unsatisfied
with the results of these statistical analyses, the EPA engaged in what
<i>Science</i> magazine termed &#147;fancy statistical footwork,&#148;
violating scientific standards by modifying the results of the studies and
flouting conventional statistical methods.  While smoking is itself an
undeniable health risk, the case against secondhand smoke rests on incredibly
shaky ground.  If secondhand smoke is as dangerous as the EPA claims, there was
no need to ignore conventional scientific methodologies.<p>
     Some people undeniably object to secondhand smoke.  However, there are no
grounds for the federal government to legislate how private establishments
address this concern.  It would be one thing for the federal government to
impose standards on federal properties, another for it to reach into every
small business, or even every home, and dictate smoking restrictions to each
and every American.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Why would the EPA manipulate science, and make false claims about the
carcinogenicity of substances?</i><p>
<p>
A: The EPA has a strong incentive to label substances carcinogenic. With every
new environmental problem it &#147;discovers,&#148; the agency expands its
budget, influence, and prestige. The agency is in need of oversight and
restraint.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Shouldn&#146;t the EPA err on the side of caution? After all, it&#146;s
their job to protect us from environmental hazards.</i><p>
<p>
A: The EPA&#146;s proper function  is to provide accurate data about the risks
we encounter in day-to-day living,  not to protect us from such risks. That
should be the choice of the individual. If, for example, I&#146;m willing to
risk my health by eating in a restaurant that allows smoking, I should have
that option; if not, I should have the right to pick a nonsmoking restaurant.
Government controls remove the option entirely, and the manipulation of science
by the EPA can expand the scope of control.<p>

<H2>Automobility Fuel Economy Standards</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>The federal new car fuel economy program imposes a deadly trade-off of blood
for oil.  Popularly known as CAFE (for Corporate Average Fuel Economy), this
program requires that new cars sold in the U.S. by any carmaker meet, on
average, a specified yearly fuel economy standard.  The current CAFE standard
for passenger cars is 27.5 miles per gallon. Environmental lobbyists are
proposing to raise CAFE to 40 mpg or higher.  If anything, CAFE standards
should be lowered or, better yet, repealed.<p>
     CAFE has a lethal effect on auto safety.  Decades of research have made it
clear that large cars are more crashworthy than similarly equipped small cars
in all collision modes.  CAFE, however, restricts large-car availability.
According to a peer-reviewed Harvard-Brookings study, CAFE is responsible for a
500 pound downsizing of new cars, which translates into 2,200 to 3,900
additional traffic deaths per model year.<p>
     CAFE&#146;s proponents argue that the law is necessary to reduce gasoline
consumption.  But while the need for &#147;fuel efficiency&#148; is highly
touted, its underlying premises are questionable.  Oil is a resource whose use
benefits people.  When fuel-efficiency improvements pay for themselves, there
is no need for government intervention to promote them;
government-<i>mandated</i> fuel efficiency, on the other hand, is an entirely
different animal, as it restricts consumer choice and produces unwelcome
side-effects.<p>
     As for national security and foreign oil, America&#146;s use of foreign oil
depends not on fuel efficiency, but on international oil prices.  When oil
prices drop, our relative use of foreign oil increases, since domestic oil
fields are relatively high-cost producers.  We may well be better off relying
on foreign oil to supply our current needs while leaving our domestic reserves
unused until they are needed.  <p>
     Finally, the correlation between fuel economy and vehicle emissions is far
less direct than it appears to be.  Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, for
example, may actually <i>increase</i> when fuel efficiency rises.<p>
     Even if one accepts the need to reduce gasoline use, CAFE is an incredibly
costly means of accomplishing this.  By focusing on car design rather than car
use, it imposes its costs without regard to actual gasoline consumption.
Because CAFE standards impose a sales mandate, auto manufacturers are forced to
manipulate their prices to sell vehicles that meet the prescribed standards.
As a result, large-car buyers pay heavy CAFE premiums when buying their cars
even if they drive very little, while small-car buyers pay artificially-lowered
car prices regardless of how much they drive.  Moreover, CAFE may actually
increase consumption by reducing  fuel use and thus the cost of driving.
Because of its structure, CAFE penalizes full-line domestic carmakers such as
Ford and GM, to the advantage of foreign car makers.<p>
     In 1992, a federal appeals court ruled that the federal government relied
upon &#147;fudged analysis,&#148; &#147;statistical legerdemain,&#148; and
&#147;bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo&#148; in enacting current CAFE standards and
ignoring their impact on highway fatalities.  CAFE kills, even at current
levels.  If raised, the deadly impact of this law will only increase. <p>
<p>
Q:<i> Isn&#146;t CAFE necessary to increase fuel efficiency</i>?<p>
<p>
A: No.  When fuel efficiency increases were needed, the market has responded
far more quickly than the law.  In the late 1970s to early 1980s, for example,
the fear of rising gasoline prices produced increases in new-car fuel economy
that <i>exceeded</i> CAFE&#146;s requirements.  Should gasoline prices rise
again, there is no reason not to expect the market to respond in the same
fashion.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>How can CAFE be blamed for highway fatalities when the vehicle death rate
has improved since CAFE&#146;s enactment.</i><p>
<p>
A: The vehicle death rate has been declining not just since CAFE&#146;s
enactment, but for at least the last fifty years.  This has been the result of
improvements in vehicle safety, road design and, more recently, in enforcement
of drunk driving laws.  The death rate would have improved even more in the
absence of CAFE.  America&#146;s highways have been getting safer, but without
CAFE they would be safer still.  The long-term trend in this rate cannot be
used to exonerate CAFE.  <p>
<p>
<p>
Q:<i> If CAFE really is so deadly, why do safety groups such as the Center for
Auto Safety favor </i>increasing<i> the standard?</i><p>
<p>
A: In the case of CAFE, some so-called public interest groups have apparently
chosen to favor more government rather than more safety.  It is noteworthy that
the auto insurance industry, which has a financial stake in vehicle
crashworthiness and which in the past has generally sided with &#147;public
interest&#148; groups on expanding vehicle safety regulation, has opposed them
on the issue of raising CAFE.<p>

<H2>Superfund</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>The federal Superfund program to cleanup hazardous waste sites is an utter
failure.  &#147;It is hard to think of a government program with a wider gulf
between ambitions and results,&#148; according to the <i>New York Times</i>.
The existing program should either be radically reformed or replaced with an
entirely different approach.<p>
     Created in 1980 by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act of 1980, Superfund has cleaned up fewer than 20 percent of the
over 1,200 hazardous waste sites in the program.  Those sites that are cleaned,
are cleaned at a cost of over $25 million per site, with a large percentage of
these costs going to pay lawyers and file paperwork.  Originally touted as a
&#147;polluter pays&#148; policy, under Superfund, polluter and non-polluter
alike overpay.<p>
     One of the greatest problems with Superfund is that millions of dollars are
spent on cleanups which produce no environmental or public health benefits.
Current Superfund risk assessments greatly overstate potential risks to human
health.  Less stringent cleanup standards could achieve the same real-world
risk reduction at lower cost.  At some sites, containment of wastes is
preferable to attempting a costly cleanup.  Moreover, many communities with
Superfund sites would benefit more from the diversion of resources away from
Superfund toward more pressing and directly beneficial expenditures.<p>
     Another problem is the set of liability standards that Superfund has created.
Under Superfund, liability for the costs of cleanup is strict, retroactive, and
joint-and-several.  This means that even those who had a tangential
relationship to a Superfund site can be held completely liable for the costs of
cleanup.  For example, private waste hauling firms and previous owners of
materials that end up at a Superfund site have been held liable for
multi-million dollar cleanup bills at Superfund sites.<p>
     Tinkering with Superfund and reallocating costs at the margins will not rescue
this failed program.  Real Superfund reform should include the following
elements:<p>
<UL>

<LI><p>
More accurate assessments of the risks posed by Superfund sites;<p>

<LI><p>
The elimination of retroactive liability for harmless activities;<p>

<LI><p>
The elimination of liability for parties not directly responsible for the
creation or maintenance of sites;<p>

<LI><p>
The phase out of Superfund&#146;s taxes on chemicals, petroleum products and
corporations;<p>

<LI><p>
Increased flexibility in the selection of cleanup and containment standards
and methods;<p>

<LI><p>
Greater local control over the cleanup process;  <p>

<LI><p>
Greater local responsibility for the allocation of cleanup resources;<p>

<LI><p>
The ability of communities and site owners to opt out of the Superfund
process.<p>

</UL>
<p>
One possibility for Superfund reform is the creation of a revolving state loan
fund to assist local communities with the costs of cleaning up abandoned sites
and the phasing out of federal involvement in non-federal waste site cleanup.
This would increase local authority over and responsibility for the clean up of
waste sites and encourage a more rational determination of clean up
priorities.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Should there be a uniform, national cleanup standard for all Superfund
sites? Or should the required level of cleanup be flexible?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A: Each site is unique, and that is not accounted for in the current Superfund
program.  Instead, the federal government has imposed a one-size fits nobody
approach.  A site that is going to house a school or family homes has different
requirements than a site where industrial development, such as a factory or
waste processing plant, will occur.  This should be a factor in the
determination of cleanup standards.<p>
     This question &#151; &#147;How clean is clean?&#148; &#151; is one of the
central issues in Superfund reform. Equally important should be the question of
who makes that determination: affected communities or the federal government.
Fairness and accountability suggest that local communities, which have more at
stake, should have a greater role in this decisionmaking process. <p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Sites that are placed on the Superfund cleanup list are contaminated with
hazardous wastes. Don&#146;t health concerns justify mandating that all
Superfund sites be cleaned to the highest possible standards?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A: Although Superfund sites typically contain wastes that are defined as
hazardous, most public health experts do not believe that Superfund sites pose
a significant health risk, particularly when such sites are fenced off or
isolated.  At those sites where health risks are present, it is often possible
to mitigate those risks at far less expense.  For example, it is often possible
to contain contaminated portions of a site for far less money than would be
required to meet the cleanup standards.  Because the last ten percent of
cleanup is often as expensive as the first ninety percent, even though the last
stages of cleanup add minimal risk protection, Superfund regulations should not
be based on the assumption that cleanup to pristine standards is the proper
policy for every site.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q:<i> Does the Clinton Administration Superfund proposal adequately address the
needs of local communities?</i><p>
<p>
A: The Clinton proposal devotes considerable space to the inclusion of local
communities in the Superfund decisionmaking process.  However, the Clinton
proposal stops far short of what is necessary.  Rather than simply including
community representatives in the federal decisionmaking process, the process
itself should be decentralized.  This would truly give local communities the
authority and responsibility they need to adequately address Superfund
concerns.<p>

<H2>Technology Subsidies</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>Industrial policy is a dangerous and costly attempt to plan the nation&#146;s
technological future.  The federal government is no more capable of
&#147;forcing&#148; industry to develop viable
&#147;environmentally-sound&#148; technologies than it is capable of
centrally-planning the economy.  Federal subsidies for technological
development &#151; industrial policy by another name &#151; are more likely to
be determined by special interest considerations than they are by accurate
assessments of the technological future.<p>
     Historically, major industrial policy programs have consistently failed.
Federal technology projects such as the supersonic transport plane, the breeder
nuclear reactor, and the synthetic fuels program wasted billions of tax dollars
and produced few, if any, tangible benefits.  In short, the federal government
has a miserable record at picking winners and losers in the marketplace.  There
is no reason to believe that environmental industrial policy programs will be
any different.<p>
     Today the federal government is providing over $1 billion in  subsidies to
American auto-makers to produce an &#147;environmentally friendly&#148; car of
the future.  The true environmental benefits of this program are doubtful.  For
example, electricity must be generated in order to power electric car
batteries, which in turn requires the burning of fossil fuels.  There is no
reason why the &#147;Big Three,&#148; or any other corporations, should be
singled out for special government assistance in funding research and
development.<p>
     Department of Commerce subsidies have also been proposed for developing
technologies such as computers, biotechnology, advanced materials, alternative
fuels, and the fiber optic &#147;information superhighway.&#148;  Though
government subsidies for research and development are supposed to make industry
more competitive, they are more often an instrument for pork-barrel politics.
The Superconducting Supercollider was intended to keep the U.S. on the
forefront of particle physics research and generate thousands of high-tech
jobs.  Yet the $11 billion project hemorrhaged financially from its inception.
Taxpayer dollars were used for a holiday party at a fashionable Dallas hotel,
potted tropical plants, and even four lounge chairs.<p>
     Technology policy is a classic example of what Nobel Prize-winning economist
Friedrich Hayek once called the &#147;fatal conceit,&#148; a  futile attempt to
improve economic outcomes by substituting the judgements of central planners
for the dispersed knowledge of millions of producers and consumers which market
prices communicate and reflect.  Environmental technology subsidies are no
different.  All such programs are likely to do is create a green-coated spoils
system, while failing to advance environmental and economic goals.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Q:<i> Shouldn&#146;t the federal government ensure that new technologies are
&#147;Earth-friendly&#148;?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A: Saving the planet is a noble objective, but federal subsidies to the private
sector will not improve environmental quality.  The federal government will not
be able to identify the best technologies in an objective way.  Inevitably,
decisions about which companies to subsidize will come down to politics.
Companies with superior lobbying power in Washington, DC will be the
&#147;winners&#148; in the selection process.  Thus, businesses would have to
spend their money in ways which please politicians, not investors or consumers.
Markets reward technologies with real value; subsidies divert resources away
from the natural winners.<p>
     Bureaucracies have little incentive to spend the taxpayers&#146; money wisely.
If money is wasted on a foolish technological venture, the bureaucracy does not
suffer any loss.  In the private marketplace, businesses are held accountable
for unwise investments, and can be expected to take financial risks more
seriously.  Technology cannot be &#147;Earth-friendly&#148; if it is managed by
politicians.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Since the Cold War is over, we are spending less money on defense and
there are fewer jobs for the high-skilled workers in the defense industry.  Why
not spend more of the defense budget on high-tech projects to create worthwhile
jobs for these workers?</i><p>
<p>
A: Massive pork-barrel spending boosts the budget deficit and places
unnecessary burdens upon taxpayers.  When the focus is on creating jobs,
politicians inevitably want the money spent in their districts and at their
universities.  Too often, politics ignores the merits of the technologies
themselves.<p>
     Unfortunately, the record of federal spending on technology is abysmal.
Congressional mega-projects like the Supercollider have been terribly
mismanaged.  High-tech investments involve tremendous risk, and the country
cannot afford more expensive blunders.  Wasteful federal technology projects do
not help high-skilled workers, rather they prevent such workers from finding
productive work in competitive fields.  Instead, we must unleash the job
creation potential of the marketplace by reducing tax and regulatory burdens
and liberalizing tariffs and other trade barriers.<p>

<H2>Trade and the Environment</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>There is near universal agreement about the economic benefits of free trade.
Lowering trade barriers reduces consumer prices and increases choice in the
marketplace.  At present, environmental restrictions pose the single greatest
threat to the international trading system.  Congress should not allow the
&#147;greening&#148; of international trade to compromise these benefits.<p>
     The &#147;greening&#148; of international trade began under the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which includes an environmental side agreement
that encourages the upward harmonization of environmental regulations.  Similar
efforts are being made to &#147;green&#148; the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT), the Generalized System of Preferences, and the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum.  &#147;Green&#148; trade measures are also being
proposed in negotiations with Latin American countries, such as Chile and
Argentina, that oppose linking trade liberalization to environmental
regulations.  Regretably, &#147;green&#148; trade will do little to improve
environmental quality.<p>
     Some attempt to justify environmental import restrictions and trade sanctions
as necessary to reduce trade&#146;s impact on the environment and to equalize
environmental regulations across borders.  These measures are justified on
neither economic nor environmental grounds, and are often a thinly veiled guise
for special interest protectionism.  For example, the U.S. has embargoed
Mexican tuna imports because more dolphins got caught in Mexican tuna fishing
nets than in American nets.  Not only did the embargo protect U.S. sales from
foreign competition, it also forced Mexican fishermen out of the Eastern
Tropical Pacific and into new fisheries where tuna fishing results in even
greater environmental impact.  The ban may have benefited some American tuna
fisherman, but it came at the expense of American consumers and the dolphins it
purported to save.<p>
     The European Community has attempted to use phony health concerns to block
U.S. imports and deny European consumers the access to certain products.  For
example, the EC erected import restrictions on U.S. beef, alleging that the use
of bovine growth hormones posed a health risk to consumers.  However when these
claims were subjected to scientific scrutiny, they were found to be false.  It
is more likely that the EC was simply interested in protecting European beef
producers from American competition.  The &#147;greening&#148; of trade will
allow more industries to allege environmental concerns in order to block
foreign imports in this manner.<p>
     By closing off export markets, &#147;green&#148; protectionism results in
diminished competitiveness, higher prices, and unemployment.  &#147;Green&#148;
trade restrictions also harm the environment by destroying the wealth necessary
to pay for many environmental improvements, such as water sanitation and
purification.  Without access to global markets, developing countries lack the
means to acquire cleaner, more efficient technologies.  Equally important is
the fact that &#147;wealthier-is-healthier.&#148;  As incomes rise in
developing countries, so do life expectancies.  Restricting prosperity through
the imposition of protectionist measures, &#147;green&#148; or otherwise,
necessarily has a negative impact on human health.<p>
     U.S. trade policy should pursue free trade, not managed trade or protectionism
under the guise of environmental protection.  The resulting increase in
productivity and prosperity will do more for environmental quality than any
&#147;greening&#148; of international trade.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Won&#146;t free trade lead to a &#147;race to the bottom&#148; in which
environmental and labor standards are reduced for competitive reasons?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A: All countries have differing priorities when it comes to environmental
protection.  Developing countries, in particular, do not have the resources to
support massive environmental restrictions on business that we have in the U.S.
It would be unfair to impose our First World standards on Third World
countries.<p>
     There is a necessary trade-off between regulation and economic growth.  If the
U.S. uses its trade leverage to impose higher regulatory costs on developing
countries, crucial economic opportunities will be lost and poverty will
continue.  The best way to ensure environmental quality and economic growth in
developing countries is through free trade.  Only by expanding their trade and
development opportunities can Third World nations create the underlying wealth
that is essential for environmental protection.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Shouldn&#146;t America refuse to trade with countries that unfairly
subsidize their domestic industries by maintaining lax environmental
standards?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A: Trade should not be used as an instrument for social objectives.  President
Clinton wisely decided to separate trade issues from human rights concerns in
China because rising incomes will create greater pressures for democracy.
Higher incomes will have similar effects on environmental quality.<p>
     If trade sanctions are used as a weapon in trade policy, the U.S. risks
becoming the world&#146;s unelected environmental policeman.  Disruptions in
international commerce will unfairly burden American exporters and importers,
and hurt our competitiveness.  The consequences for developing countries &#151;
diminished trade &#151; would perpetuate poverty by preventing them from
exporting to the U.S. market.  Poverty is not an effective pollution-control
measure.<p>

<H2>Unfunded Mandates</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>Congress should scale-back existing unfunded mandates and refrain from passing
more in the future.  Imposing unfunded mandates is a fundamentally unfair and
undemocratic means of enacting environmental policy that short-circuits
accountability and hamstrings the ability to set rational environmental
priorities.<p>
     Congress creates unfunded mandates when it passes environmental laws requiring
state and/or local governments to meet particular goals or enact particular
regulatory programs and then fails to fund their implementation.  Unfunded
mandates are proliferating rapidly across the board.  Prior to 1988, there were
only 40 unfunded federal mandates, environmental and otherwise.  Between 1988
and 1991, that number nearly tripled.  Nearly 12 percent of municipal revenues
must now go to meeting unfunded mandates.<p>
     Environmental mandates are among the most expensive.  There are unfunded
mandates in the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and
many other major environmental laws.  Major cities will spend $3.6 billion on
the Clean Water Act this year, and county governments expect to spend over
$16.1 billion on environmental mandates between now and 1998.  Unfunded
mandates are devastating local treasuries.  For instance:<p>
<UL>
<LI><p>
Columbus, Ohio, is being forced to spend $16 million to lower atrazine levels
in the city&#146;s water supply to avert a speculative cancer risk.  To meet
the requirement, Columbus is forced to consider eliminating or scaling back
other health-related programs.<p>

<LI><p>
Lancaster, New Hampshire, with annual revenues of $1.4 million, will be forced
to spend $2 million meeting federal drinking water standards.<p>

<LI><p>
Lewiston, Maine, is looking at mandate costs of approximately $92 million.
For a city population of only 40,000, this equals $600 per household.<p>

</UL>
<p>
     Unfunded mandates are undemocratic and destroy accountability.  They enable
politicians to enact policies without voting for the taxes (or offsetting
spending cuts) to pay for them.  Members of Congress have used unfunded
mandates to demonstrate their support for popular public goals while disguising
the costs of their programs.  State and local governments, and their taxpayers,
are stuck footing the bill.  Unfunded mandates often mean that higher local
priorities must be pushed aside to meet Washington, D.C.&#146;s dictates.<p>
     Unfunded mandates should come to an end.  A simple &#147;no money, no
mandate&#148; policy whereby state and local governments are not obligated to
establish federally-mandated programs unless those requirements are paid for by
the federal government is one way to achieve this.  <p>
     In the end, Congress simply needs to recognize that not every environmental
concern requires a federal program or initiative.  State and local governments
are just as concerned with the health and well-being of their residents.  They
are more than capable of setting environmental priorities and addressing local
concerns.  In many instances, Congress could best foster more rational
environmental policy-making by simply getting out of the way.  The states were
intended to be &#147;laboratories of democracy,&#148; developing innovative and
experimental approaches to vexing public policy concerns.  Imposing unfunded
mandates prevents states from playing that vital role, and can even inhibit the
development of forward-looking and effective environmental policies.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Why shouldn&#146;t the federal government impose stringent environmental
standards on states and localities?</i><p>
<p>
A: This question assumes that state and local governments are unable to
determine environmental priorities for their own communities.  State officials
are no less concerned about clean water problems or clean air problems than are
federal officials.  If anything, state and local governments are closer to the
environmental concerns of local communities and better able to develop the
proper remedies.  It is one thing for the federal government to provide
guidance to local communities on environmental matters.  It is another thing
for the federal government to require particular programs, and leave state and
local taxpayers footing the bill.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Won&#146;t a &#147;no money, no mandate&#148; policy prevent the
government from providing the environmental protection that Americans
want?</i><p>
<p>
A: A &#147;no money, no mandate&#148; policy will restore accountability to
environmental policy.  Protecting the environment is important, but so are
health care, education, crime prevention, and the whole range of concerns that
state and local governments are forced to address.  State and local governments
need the flexibility to be able to respond to the needs of their constituents.
Piling on environmental requirements without providing the resources to meet
those requirements destroys that flexibility.  Environmental protection is
necessary, but it always has costs.  Controlling unfunded mandates ensures that
when environmental policies are enacted, it is clear how they will be paid
for.<p>

<H2>Wetlands</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>The federal government has implemented regulations to prevent the destruction
or alteration of America&#146;s wetlands.  These regulations deny private
landowners the productive use of their land without compensation.  Wetlands
rules have bankrupted landowners and even sent Americans to jail for the
&#147;crime&#148; of wetland modification.  The cause of wetland protection is
better served through positive incentives and wetland enhancement programs than
it is by imposing limitations on the use of private land.<p>
     Under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, landowners must receive a permit
from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before engaging in any activity that may
affect a wetland.  Because of how the federal government defines wetlands,
there are over 100 million acres of protected wetlands in the United States.
For example, according to North Carolina Senator Lauch Faircloth, 70 percent of
North Carolina is classified as wetlands.<p>
     These regulations restrict the rights and liberties of private property
owners.  Citizens are routinely denied permits from the Corps of Engineers to
modify their properties, even when such activities have minimal environmental
impact.  For example, in Nome, Alaska a woman whose house began to sink, so
much so that she can no longer close her front door, was denied a permit by the
Army Corps of Engineers to add 5 inches of fill material to stabilize her
house.  Similarly, in Sula, Montana a farmer was not allowed to drain water
from a hayfield, even though the field had been rendered unusable after a
nearby beaver dam caused increased seepage.  Similar examples can be found in
nearly every rural district in the country.<p>
     Federal wetlands policies also place burdens on state and local governments.
By prohibiting development, the regulations often depress land values and,
consequently, local government revenues from property taxes.  One study found
that local governments could lose over $180 million in revenue in the state of
Arkansas alone. If the Arkansas analysis is correct, local governments
nationwide may lose up to $6.3 billion in property tax revenues.<p>
     While some argue that section 404 regulations are needed to protect
America&#146;s vanishing wetlands, recent evidence shows that America is
creating more wetlands than are being destroyed.  In 1994, the
government&#146;s top three wetland restoration programs will restore a
combined total of 157,000 acres of wetlands.  At the same time, data from the
government&#146;s National Resource Inventory concludes that the U.S. will only
convert just over 100,000 acres of wetlands to other uses.  In other words, by
the end of 1994 there should be tens of thousands more acres of wetlands than
there were at the beginning.<p>
     When the Clean Water Act is reauthorized, the wetlands protection program
should be reformed.  The following reforms would improve the current federal
approach to wetlands regulation:<p>

<UL>

<LI><p>
Compensate property owners when reasonable use of their land has been taken by
wetland regulation;<p>

<LI><p>
Regulate only those wetlands deemed to be of significant ecological
importance;<p>

<LI><p>
Allow landowners who mitigate (create wetlands to replace the ones which have
be used) the unrestricted use of their land;<p>

<LI><p>
Eliminate &#147;no net loss&#148; of wetlands as an official government
policy.<p>

</UL>
<p>
These steps would enhance the protection of private property without
sacrificing the environmental goal of wetlands protection.<p>
<p>
Q:<i> Some say that America is losing 300,000 acres of wetlands a year.  Is
this true?</i><p>
<p>
A: No. The 300,000 acre figure is based on an old study that did not account
for both public and private wetland restoration projects.  In reality, more
wetlands are being created each year than are being destroyed.  The stated goal
of &#147;no net loss&#148; of American wetlands was achieved several years
ago.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>What is wrong with a simple permit process for people who wish to
develop, and potentially destroy, ecologically-important wetlands?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A: The permitting process is not so &#147;simple.&#148;  While the permitting
process sounds reasonable on paper, it has been extremely onerous in practice.
Under current law, the Corps of Engineers must approve or reject a wetland
modification permit application within 60 days.  However, the average wait for
a ruling on a permit application is currently over a year!  Furthermore, the
process does not account for the fact that not all wetlands have equal
ecological significance.  Some wetlands perform important water filtration,
flood mitigation, and habitat enhancement functions.  Others are mere bogs and
breeding grounds for pests.  If a permitting process is necessary, it would be
more appropriate for the federal government to seek to protect the
highest-value wetlands, and the ecological values they promote, than to impose
a blanket wetlands protection policy.<p>

<P>The field of biotechnology promises tremendous advances in medicine and
agriculture.  Biotechnology products should be regulated no differently than
other products.  Policy makers should focus on the safety of particular
products and innovations, rather than on their origin or means of production.
<p>
     Biotechnology&#146;s advance from the pharmacy to the supermarket shelf has
spurred a host of regulatory proposals, fueled in large part by scare stories
about mutant cows and killer tomatoes.  Where specific biotechnology products
are shown to pose risks that are higher than those of their &#147;natural&#148;
counterparts, regulations may well be appropriate.  However, merely because a
product has been produced through biotechnological means does not justify its
being singled out for special regulation.<p>
     This is especially true of proposals for mandatory labelling.  The Food and
Drug Administration&#146;s 1993 approval of rBST  (a bovine growth hormone) to
enhance milk production has drawn fire from some consumer groups, who argue for
mandatory labelling of rBST-derived products.  Such labelling requirements,
they claim, are necessary for consumers to be fully informed.  But the real
effect would be to restrict consumer choice under the guise of protecting the
public&#146;s &#147;right to know.&#148;<p>
     If consumers really are interested in knowing whether their foods have been
biotechnologically produced, then they will be able to get that information
without labelling mandates.  Producers and sellers of &#147;non-biotech&#148;
foods can freely advertise that fact, just as many companies and stores today
advertise that their products are &#147;organic&#148; or
&#147;preservative-free.&#148;  Mandatory labelling laws are not needed to
produce such information.<p>
     Labelling mandates, on the other hand, would not merely produce unneeded
information; <i>they would ultimately restrict consumer choice</i>.  Such
mandates would almost certainly target man-made substances over natural
substances and new technologies over older ones.  They would make it difficult
if not impossible to sell these products, because consumers would naturally
believe that they were being warned about some significant risk that they would
be better off avoiding.  The end result would be closed markets and undeveloped
products.  This, for example, was the chief effect of laws earlier in this
century that imposed labelling and packaging restrictions on margarine and
other dairy substitutes.  Their alleged purpose was to prevent consumer
deception, but their <i>anti</i>-consumer nature is well recognized today.<p>
     The field of biotechnology has an incredible potential to produce a wide-range
of medical and consumers products.  Biotechnology has already produced such
ground-breaking developments as clotting-factor VIII, an important treatment
for hemophilia, and cloned insulin, upon which many diabetics depend.  This
potential should not be compromised by excessive regulation.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Doesn&#146;t biotechnology pose new risks greater than those we&#146;ve
faced before?</i><p>
<p>
A: No.  Nearly all our agricultural products have been developed by breeding,
which is itself a process of genetic alteration.  For example, tomatoes were
once small and bitter.  But careful selective breeding of tomatoes,
occasionally with other plant species, enabled the development of the tomatoes
that we all enjoy today.  Biotechnology is simply a more advanced technique of
this same process that entails no special risks all its own.  Many
biotechnological processes involve no more than a speeding up of the breeding
process.  The real risk is that of across-the-board biotechnology regulation,
and the delay that this can cause in the availability of new products.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Why is biotechnology necessary?  Why can&#146;t we leave things the way
they are?</i><p>
<p>
A: To stand still in a world where nature is steadily changing is to fall
behind.  Rapid technological and institutional change has made the world a
safer, healthier place;  similarly rapid improvements will be necessary to
continue this trend.  <p>
     Biotechnology, thus, is a vital field of research.  Few people are aware of
how important biotechnology is to improving the lives of millions of people.
In the field of medicine, for example, biotechnological processes have been
used to develop vaccines, cloned insulin for diabetics, heart attack drugs like
TPA (Tissue Plasminogen Activator), and the diagnostic techniques used to keep
our nation&#146;s blood supply free of hepatitis B and HIV.  Biotechnology also
shows promise in the field of environmental remediation.  Scientists hope that
biotechnology will develop safer and more effective means of addressing
pollution and cleaning up contaminated ground water.<p>
     We also should not forget the economic importance of this growing industry.
The U.S. is the world leader in biotechnology with over 1,000 biotech companies
which employ over 50,000 people.  Biotechnology is expected to be an $80
billion industry within several years.  These benefits, too, should not be
overlooked.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Don&#146;t consumers have a right to know what they are buying? </i><p>
<p>
A: The basic consumer right is to be able to buy what one wants, and companies
should not be allowed to deceive their customers.  If consumers demand
particular information about a series of products, companies should be free to
provide that information and to advertise it.  However, the government should
refrain from selecting which types of information should be placed on packaging
merely to satisfy certain interest groups.  When scientifically irrelevant
factors become the subject of arbitrary labelling rules, the end result will be
fewer products for people to choose from.<p>

<H2>Clean Air Act Reform</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>State and local governments should be afforded more flexibility in the
determination of air pollution control methods and goals.  At present, areas
not meeting federal clean air standards are forced to implement costly and
inefficient air pollution control strategies and are discouraged from using
more cost-effective and equitable approaches.<p>
     At an estimated cost of $25 to $35 billion, the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990 are the most expensive single piece of environmental legislation ever
enacted.  In addition to industrial emissions, it regulates automobile design,
gasoline content, and driving habits, as well as emissions from dry cleaners,
bakeries and other small businesses.<p>
     A significant portion of federal clean air law is aimed at controlling motor
vehicle emissions.  It imposes broad &#147;drift-net&#148; strategies that
impact all vehicles and car owners irrespective of their relative contributions
to pollution levels.  It is well-established that only a small fraction of
motor vehicles generate the lion&#146;s share of emissions.  Ten percent of the
vehicles on the road are responsible for approximately half of
automobile-related emissions.  This means that for every ten vehicles on the
road, the dirtiest car emits as much as the remaining nine.  By failing to
focus emission-reduction efforts on the dirtiest vehicles, federal air
pollution control strategies are both inefficient and inequitable.<p>
     Under federal law, those areas that do not meet federal air quality standards
are required to implement particular pollution control measures, even if better
options are available.  Some of the Clean Air Act&#146;s rigid requirements
include:<p>

<UL>

<LI>Mandating expensive, centralized vehicle inspection and maintenance programs
that impose significant costs and inconvenience upon car owners without
providing corresponding benefits as opposed to less-expensive, decentralized
testing methods.
<LI>Requiring companies in the nine smoggiest metropolitan areas to induce
greater car-pooling and use of mass transit by their employees under threat of
fines.
<LI>Requiring that 30 percent of the oxygenates used in federally-mandated
reformulated gasoline comes from &#147;renewable&#148; sources, even though
these oxygenates are more expensive and no more beneficial for the
environment.
</UL>

<p>
There are few parts of the country that would voluntarily adopt these methods
to achieve the federal government&#146;s stringent air quality standards.
Moreover, air pollution strategies that are effective in one area, may be less
so somewhere else.  States need to be given greater flexibility to meet federal
clean air standards, and perhaps even the authority to evaluate proper regional
standards for themselves.<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Why shouldn&#146;t automakers be forced to manufacture cleaner cars and
the oil companies forced to make cleaner fuels?</i><p>
<p>
A: New cars produced today are already over 90 percent cleaner than those
produced twenty-five years ago.  There simply is not much to be gained from
further tightening new vehicle or new fuel emission standards.  If further
emission reductions are desired, it is better to focus on the greatest source
of emissions.  Ten percent of the cars on the road produce over half of the
emissions.  Targeting those vehicles for emission reductions will be more
effective, and more fair, than imposing fuel standards, vehicle standards, and
other &#147;drift-net&#148; strategies on everybody.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Are electric cars a viable way to reduce auto-related air
pollution?</i><p>
<p>
A: Many have proposed encouraging the purchase of electric cars to reduce air
pollution.  Unfortunately, while electric cars sound wonderful on paper, they
are less so in practice.  Electric cars have many drawbacks that make them
insufficient for the needs of most car owners, including limited range,
recharge requirements and a lack of amenities (air conditioning, heater, etc.).
Moreover, electric cars are not without their environmental impacts.  The
electricity to charge the batteries must come from some source, often resulting
in air emissions.  Moreover, we must remember that electric car batteries will
have to be replaced every few years, and used batteries may have to be disposed
of as hazardous wastes.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q:<i> Are existing federal clean air standards stringent enough to protect
human health?</i><p>
<p>
A: Yes, if anything they are too stringent.  Non-attainment status is triggered
by surpassing the federal standard for an hour more than three times over a
three year period.  Thus, four bad hours on four bad days over three years are
sufficient to classify a city as a nonattainment area  by federal standards.
Residents in some areas may prefer such stringent standards, but it would be
better if communities had that choice, rather than having these standards
imposed upon them by the federal government.<p>

<H2>Clean Water Act</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>The United States has achieved substantial gains in cleaning up our aquatic
environments over the past two-and-a-half decades.  Yet today, the EPA
continues to write more stringent and more expensive regulations that produce
minimal environmental results.  The Clean Water Act is a prime example of this
problem, and of why environmental regulation needs to be reformed.<p>
     America&#146;s waters were once in bad shape.  On June 22, 1969, sparks from a
passing train ignited floating debris and industrial chemicals in the Cuyahoga
river, near Cleveland, Ohio.  The image of the burning Cuyahoga river spurred
the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency as well as the passage of
the Clean Water Act.  <p>
     Today, the extreme industrial pollution that characterized the 1960s has been
virtually eliminated.  Many rivers are cleaner than they have been in decades.
Along the Cuyahoga riverfront in Cleveland there are now dozens of upscale
restaurants and bars, and during the summertime the river is crowded with
pleasure boats.  Tremendous progress has been made.<p>
     While there is far less water pollution to address, complying with the Clean
Water Act has become far more expensive.  Full compliance would cost as much as
$99 billion per year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.  This
is more than the federal government collects in corporate income taxes.  The
majority of these costs are placed upon businesses, as much as $46 billion a
year.  A significant portion of the costs, however, are also born by
municipalities, up to $37 billion a year.<p>
     One reason compliance costs are so high is that the EPA&#146;s regulations are
inflexible and overly stringent.  For example, the EPA requires city treatment
plants to remove 30 percent of the organic material from the sewage that they
treat.  In most cities this is quite feasible.  However, in Anchorage, Alaska,
the sewage coming into the treatment plant is so clean that it would cost $135
million to build a facility just to treat water that already meets the
EPA&#146;s discharge standards.  It was cheaper for Anchorage to ask two local
fish processing plants to dump 5,000 pounds of fish guts into the sewer system
so that there would be enough waste in the water to clean it at a lower cost
and meet the regulation.  This is not how environmental policy should work.<p>
     The following elements should be part of any Clean Water Act reform
proposal:<p>

<UL>

<LI>The EPA should be required to perform a cost/benefit analysis of each and
every regulation to ensure that costs of complying with clean water regulation
do not outweigh their benefits.
<LI>If the EPA sets stringent new standards that will be expensive for state and
local governments to implement, it should also provide the funds to comply with
the standard (in other words, the EPA should refrain from imposing unfunded
environmental mandates).

<LI>The EPA should provide greater flexibility for local water agencies to set
standards based on local needs.
</UL>
<p>
Q:  <i>Shouldn&#146;t the clean water act be strengthened to prevent companies
from polluting our steams, lakes and rivers?</i><p>
<p>
A:  The number one source of pollution of America&#146;s rivers and lakes is
not industrial wastes; it is agricultural runoff.  The number two source is
municipal and urban runoff.  According to the EPA, industrial pollution ranks
last as a source of pollution.  Strengthening the current Clean Water Act will
simply create higher costs without achieving significant environmental
improvement.  Tightening standards on industrial discharges would be about as
effective as requiring homeowners to get a permit from the EPA before they
watered their lawns or flushed their toilets.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q:  <i>How would you change the Clean Water Act without weakening it?</i><p>
<p>
A:  The most important change that must be made is to put more flexibility in
the hands of state and local officials.  Even the current administrator of the
EPA, Carol Browner, thinks it&#146;s essential.  In a speech earlier this year
she said, &#147;We must allow for flexibility, innovation, and common sense as
states and communities look for ways to achieve the standards.&#148;  Under the
present scheme, says Browner, &#147;innovation is stifled rather than
encouraged.&#148;  Increasing regulatory flexibility would allow for greater
innovation.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Are there ways to protect water quality without resorting to federal
regulation?</i><p>
<p>
A: Yes.  It would be more effective and equitable if water quality was
protected through the assertion and protection of private water rights, rather
than by command-and-control regulation.  Under common law principles,
individual polluters could be held liable for damaging the water quality of
those downstream.  This would provide a strict, but fair, standard whereby no
individual, corporation, or even municipality, could infringe upon the water
rights of another.  This approach also would be more flexible, because upstream
and downstream users could negotiate over competing water uses.  This type of
approach has been preempted by state and federal water pollution laws.  However
it would be useful to move toward this sort of common law, property
rights-based approach.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Should the Clean Water Act be expanded to control non-point sources of
pollution such as agricultural and urban runoffs?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A: Rather than expand the CWA, Congress should amend it to permit local
flexibility and experimentation.  Emissions create problems <i>somewhere</i>
before they create problems <i>elsewhere</i>.  Local communities and water
users should be allowed to deal with runoffs based on their own assessment of
the environmental/economic trade-offs.  In some cases, local solutions might be
facilitated by extending property rights to recreational and sporting clubs,
shell fisheries, and others with a stake in water quality.  When local problems
are addressed locally, they are less apt to become large problems requiring
federal intervention.<P>

<H2>Ecosystem Management</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Ecosystem management is the newest regulatory strategy advocated by
environmentalists to limit urban growth and preserve undeveloped land.  It
provides the most expansive justification for national land-use planning yet
devised.  Those who want to limit federal control over and regulation of
private land should oppose the implementation of ecosystem management.<p>
     The Endangered Species Act (ESA) currently allows federal regulation only when
a species is listed as threatened or endangered.  Then, regulations are allowed
only to protect the listed species and its habitat.  Advocates of ecosystem
management want to amend the ESA to enact a different approach. &#147;Instead
of focusing on individual species, we would do it on the basis of a whole
ecosystem,&#148; explains Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.  Yet ecosystems,
according to Babbitt, are &#147;in the eye of the beholder.&#148;  The goal of
preserving &#147;ecosystems&#148; in their entirety is thus a license to
regulate nearly anything the agency desires.  Because of the discretion that
would be granted to regulatory agencies, ecosystem management would entail an
increase in environmental regulation.<p>
     For example, consider the application of ecosystem management to the
protection of the coastal California gnatcatcher, a small songbird in southern
California.  There are approximately 250 gnatcatcher pairs in Riverside County.
Because each pair of gnatcatchers requires less than 20 acres of habitat,
current endangered species regulations would control around 5,000 acres of
land.  However, under ecosystem management, which focuses on types of habitat
rather than specific species, protection of the gnatcatcher would entail
federal control of nearly 150,000 acres.  Under the Interior Department&#146;s
model, ecosystem management will lock almost 30 times more land!<p>
     One tool for the implementation of ecosystem management is the proposed
National Biological Survey (NBS).  This agency would be responsible for
cataloging all species of flora and fauna in the United States, and it would
provide the federal government with a blueprint for nationwide land-use
regulation.  For this reason, the NBS is extremely controversial in Congress.
When proposed in 1993, Congress voted overwhelmingly to restrain the NBS from
infringing upon the rights of property owners.  Because it remains
controversial, the NBS has yet to be authorized by Congress.  However, despite
Congressional rules prohibiting appropriations that have not been authorized,
the NBS is up and running in the Interior Department nonetheless.<p>
     Ecosystem management will not enhance the position of private property owners,
as some claim.  Rather it will greatly worsen their already precarious state.
The loss of the use of private property without compensation is the primary
problem with the current species-by-species approach; but the ecosystem
approach promises that property owners will lose even more of their land.
Rather than solving the conflict over species protection, ecosystem management
will only worsen it.  <p>
<p>
Q: <i>Isn&#146;t the protection of ecosystems the goal of the Endangered
Species Act?</i><p>
<p>
A: No.  The goal of the ESA is to &#147;recover&#148; listed species to the
point at which the ESA&#146;s protections are no longer required.  Species are
listed under the ESA, ecosystems are not.  Only species can trigger the
Act&#146;s stringent land-use regulations.  There is only one mention of
&#147;ecosystems&#148; in the ESA, and only because it is thought that losing
species is tantamount to losing parts of and thus impairing ecosystems.  We
have no Endangered Ecosystems Act. <p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Secretary Babbitt argues that managing ecosystems will prevent species
from becoming threatened or endangered in the first place.  Won&#146;t that
avoid the strict land-use regulations imposed by the Endangered Species
Act?</i><p>
<p>
A: No.  Under current law, the federal government cannot regulate private
land-use unless a species is listed under the Act and present on the property.
To allow the government to regulate ecosystems to prevent species from becoming
threatened in the first place is an open invitation to regulation of private
land-uses and the problems that it creates, including the creation of barriers
to private conservation and disincentives to preserve and protect wildlife.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Is not destruction of vital habitat the greatest threat to endangered
species?</i><p>
<p>
A: Habitation alteration is certainly responsible for the decline of some
species.  With this in mind it is important to recognize that the ESA often
encourages the destruction of habitat because land that is declared habitat by
the federal government cannot be used by its owner.  This creates an incentive
for landowners to destroy habitat, lest it be classified as the home of an
endangered species and placed off limits for productive use.  Such negative
incentives are some of the primary causes of the ESA&#146;s ineffectiveness in
saving species.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Wildlife is a public resource.  As such, should not landowners be
prohibited from harming the public&#146;s wildlife habitat?</i><p>
<p>
A: Wildlife may be public, but most wildlife habitat is private.  Instead of
foisting the cost on individual property owners and punishing them for using
their own land, the public as a whole should pay for public goods like wildlife
protection.  We do not force urbanites to solve the homeless problem by giving
up rooms in their home; why should we force rural-dwellers to give up their
property without compensation to provide wildlife habitat?  It is a perverse
morality that gives more rights to imperiled wildlife than to imperiled people.

<H2>Electricity Competition</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
The nation&#146;s electricity system is currently dominated by local,
regulated monopolies.  This should change.  There is an &#147;electricity
superhighway&#148; which links utility customers with hundreds of power
producers.   Consumers should have direct access to this network.  This would
enable consumers to pick electric utilities the way they can now pick long
distance telephone service.   Moreover, consumers would no longer be forced to
subsidize wasteful utility &#147;conservation&#148; programs that benefit some
utility consumers at the expense of others.  States have the authority to allow
for direct consumer access within their borders.  However, national competition
in electricity markets cannot occur without explicit Congressional
authorization.<p>
     Utilities already have access to the &#147;electricity superhighway.&#148;
Because most utilities have been granted a local monopoly by government, they
can charge what are often exorbitant rates and deny their patrons access to the
wholesale electricity market, in which power is traded at prices as much as 75
percent less than that paid by retail ratepayers. Giving consumers access to
the wholesale electricity market would reduce rates dramatically, saving
homeowners and businesses hundreds of billions of dollars and eliminating the
need for a cumbersome regulatory bureaucracy to oversee the industry.<p>
     The wholesale electricity market, which has existed in limited form since the
1920s, is made possible by a national network of transmission lines connecting
utilities, wholesale electricity producers, and utility customers to one
another. Power producers use the system to trade electricity with one another
in a diverse and vibrant wholesale market, free of the cost-of-service
regulation imposed on retail consumers. Allowing utility customers to use the
system would liberate them from regulation and give them the same market
options their utilities enjoy.<p>
     Unfortunately, some environmental groups have joined utilities in opposing
reform of the electricity system. Environmental lobbyists are seeking to
preserve Demand-Side Management (DSM) programs administered by the utilities.
Through DSM programs, utilities increase their rates in order to pay for energy
conservation programs that only benefit a select portion of ratepayers.  State
regulators give privately-owned utilities various incentives to administer the
programs. Ratepayers are often entirely unaware of the existence of this
scheme, which costs them billions annually. <p>
     A competitive electricity system would render inefficient energy conservation
programs obsolete.  Conservation investments that could not pay for themselves
through increased efficiency would be jettisoned as utilities would be forced
to compete for customers by offering lower prices.  The result would be
dramatic savings for consumers and increased efficiency within the electricity
industry.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Why should we abandon a proven system of public oversight and regulation
of electric utility monopolies in favor of the uncertainties of a competitive
system?</i><p>
<p>
A: Competition has repeatedly proven itself superior to government regulation.
Only in a free market will producers have incentives to satisfy the demands of
a varied clientele. The current system of command-and-control regulation of
utility monopolies reduces consumer choice, and virtually eliminates incentives
for electricity producers to innovate and cut costs. In a free market,
producers would be immediately accountable to power consumers, who would have
the option to switch providers if the current one proves unsatisfactory.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q:<i> How much would competition in electricity markets reduce prices for
consumers?</i><p>
<p>
A: The consumer savings from electricity competition would vary from community
to community.  In some parts of the country, electric rates would decline by as
much as 50 percent, or more.  Nationwide, the consumer savings from electricity
competition are expected to be $200 to $300 billion.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>If direct access eliminates DSM programs, will it be bad for the
environment? </i><p>
<p>
A: Efficiency is a friend of the environment.  By encouraging greater
efficiency within the electricity industry, competition will also spur
utilities to develop innovative new methods of electricity generation that
produce more energy by using fewer resources, thereby lessening much of the
environmental impact of electricity generation.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Aren&#146;t DSM programs simply an efficient alternative to building new
power plants?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A: Proponents of DSM often argue that utilities should compare the cost of
constructing new power plants to the cost of avoiding the construction of a new
plant by reducing their customers&#146; electricity demand. If the latter is
less expensive, then clearly it is the optimal choice.  Unfortunately, DSM
programs are no longer used as a less-expensive alternative to power plant
construction.  Rather than reduce electricity rates for all consumers, DSM
programs apply a &#147;surcharge&#148; to rates, raising them to pay for
energy-efficiency subsidies. DSM is not a lower-cost alternative to power plant
construction&#151;it is a system of taxation and redistribution.<p>

<H2>Endangered Species Act (ESA)</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>The Endangered Species Act (ESA), designed to protect all manner of animal and
plant species in the United States, is one of the most controversial of all
environmental laws.  The ESA deprives property owners of the productive use of
their property throughout the country.  If species protection benefits all of
us, then we should be willing to compensate those landowners whose land is
effectively taken to protect endangered species.  The ESA has failed to do this
thus far.  The ESA has also failed to achieve its goal of recovering endangered
species.  The ESA is in need of dramatic reform.<p>
     Enacted in 1973, the ESA sought to prevent people from &#147;taking&#148;
members of species listed as endangered or threatened.  Throughout the history
of American wildlife law, &#147;taking&#148; an animal meant to physically
injure or kill it.  That changed however, when the Fish and Wildlife Service
(the Interior Department agency primarily responsible for administering the
Act) expanded the meaning of &#147;take&#148; in 1975 to prohibit ordinary land
uses that merely modified unoccupied habitat.  As a result, landowners from
coast-to-coast have been prevented from using their land.  In Travis County,
Texas, for example, small property owners have been prevented from building
homes for their retirement.<p>
     In March 1994, the second-highest court in the land said that such actions by
the federal government are illegal because they were never authorized by
Congress.  In the case of <i>Sweet Home v. Babbitt</i>, the court recognized
that Congress did not intend the ESA to apply so broadly on private property.
The decision is now under appeal.  In the meantime, Congress should make its
intentions clear by reforming the ESA to ensure that the Act is no longer used
to turn private property into public wildlife refuges without paying the
landowner just compensation.<p>
     The ESA is a clear failure when evaluated on its environmental impact.  The
ESA&#146;s objective is to recover imperiled species to the point that the
ESA&#146;s regulations are no longer needed and the species can be removed from
the endangered species list.  This rarely happens.  Only seven out of over 850
listed species have been recovered, according to the federal government.  The
same number of species has become extinct under the ESA&#146;s protection.
This is hardly a good track record.  Moreover it is doubtful in most of these
cases whether the ESA can take credit for the recoveries.<p>
     What many fail to realize is that the ESA actually creates incentives
<i>against</i> the protection of endangered species by private landowners.
Indeed, under the ESA, it is in a landowner&#146;s self-interest to destroy
habitat before it is identified and regulated by the federal government.  In
parts of the country, the advice given to individuals who are afraid that they
will lose their land due to endangered species is simply &#147;shoot, shovel,
and shut up.&#148;  This is a terrible incentive structure for a law designed
to protect endangered species. <p>
     The ESA is broken and needs to be fixed.  Most importantly, the ESA needs to
be more respectful of the rights of private landowners.  Landowners should be
compensated when they lose the productive use of their land.  For the ESA to be
more effective, it also needs to rely more upon private conservation efforts
and the power of the marketplace.  Private conservation efforts have been
instrumental in the resurgence of many species, from the wood duck to the
buffalo.  One useful reform would be to make it easier for landowners and
conservation organizations to protect, breed and care for imperiled species.
Until such steps are taken, the ESA will continue to be highly controversial,
and scarcely effective.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>A recent  </i>Times-Mirror<i> poll found that most Americans support the
ESA. Why should it be reformed?</i><p>
<p>
A: Americans care about wildlife, and so they support government efforts to
protect  endangered species.  However, Americans also believe in property
rights.  That same <i>Times Mirror</i> poll found that 59 percent of Americans
believe landowners should be compensated when they lose the productive use of
their land due to the ESA.  For federal wildlife protection to truly reflect
the will of the American people, it must include a greater protection of
property rights than it does right now.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Earlier this year the federal government down-listed the bald eagle from
&#147;endangered&#148; to &#147;threatened&#148; status.  Is this evidence of
the ESA&#146;s success in protecting species?</i><p>
<p>
A: No.  Most ecologists believe the greatest threat to the bald eagle was from
the pesticide DDT.  DDT was banned in this country in 1972, before the ESA was
even passed.  Moreover, harming bald eagles was prohibited decades earlier
under the Eagle Protection Act.  We should be happy that our national symbol,
the bald eagle, is thriving once again in this country.  However, it is not
appropriate to credit the ESA with that success.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Some groups implicated Endangered Species Act regulations in the spread
of fires in California last year that burned thousands of acres and destroyed
numerous homes.  Others say it&#146;s not true.  What really happened?</i><p>
<p>
A: When wildfire rips through a community it is impossible to know what
measures could have protected homes and properties that were destroyed.
However, fire experts recognize that some measures, such as &#147;disking&#148;
a fire break by turning the land over with a plow, dramatically reduce the
threat of fire.  Under the ESA, the federal government prevented property
owners in Riverside County, CA from taking such protective measures because of
fear that clearing fire breaks would disturb the habitat of the Stephen&#146;s
Kangaroo Rat.  29 homes were destroyed by the fires.  One landowner who cleared
a fire break in violation of the law saved his home.  So it is likely that the
ESA played some role in the spread of the fire and the loss of homes.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q: <i>Since less than one percent of all projects reviewed under the ESA have
been halted, isn&#146;t the Act much more flexible than its critics
claim?</i><p>
<p>
A: This statistic only pertains to federal projects.  The impact on private
projects has never been reviewed.  More importantly, project approval is no
indication of flexibility, particularly when onerous conditions are attached.
For example, the FWS &#147;approved&#148; a 1,000 acre development project near
golden-cheeked warbler habitat, on the condition that the developer give up 765
acres of its land <i>and</i> purchase an additional 873 acres for a government
warbler preserve.  This is not flexibility, it is extortion.<p>

<H2>Energy Taxes</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Congress should not impose an energy tax of any kind.  Neither a broad-based
energy tax, such as the &#147;Btu tax&#148; or carbon tax, nor an increased
gasoline tax should be used for deficit reduction or environmental protection.
Taxing energy would have a severe negative impact on the economy and produce no
significant environmental improvements.<p>
     Energy taxes would weaken U.S. industry and destroy jobs.  America enjoys an
abundance of energy sources, and as a result the U.S. economy abounds with
energy-intensive industries, from petrochemicals to timber.  Taxing energy will
hurt these industries and compromise America&#146;s competitiveness.  In 1992,
Pittsburgh&#146;s CONSAD Research Corporation estimated that a proposed carbon
tax would destroy 600,000 jobs over an 8-year period.  Other studies have
confirmed that imposing a tax on energy would have dire economic
consequences.<p>
     Moreover, a tax on energy would increase consumer prices and have a general
inflationary effect.  Taxing energy would increase the costs of producing raw
materials and transporting goods, in addition to the costs of heating and
maintaining family homes.  This economic impact would be felt by every
American, particularly the least fortunate.  Energy taxes and other policies
that raise prices are especially burdensome to people with fixed incomes.
Also, fuel taxes tend to hit hardest motorists in low-density rural areas
&#151; areas least affected by pollution.<p>
     Some claim that higher energy taxes, by restricting consumption, will promote
efficiency and protect the environment.  These claims are false.<p>
     Raising the price of energy would certainly reduce energy consumption.
However, energy <i>conservation</i> &#151; using less energy &#151; is not
necessarily the same as energy <i>efficiency</i> &#151; using less energy to
produce the same or higher level of goods.  Energy is used, after all, for a
purpose.  If that purpose is valuable, then taxing energy will just hinder the
production of valuable goods and services.<p>
     Energy taxes may of course impel businesses to adopt new technologies and so
become more energy-efficient.  But <i>energy</i> efficiency is not necessarily
the same as <i>economic</i> efficiency.  The investments businesses make in
response to energy taxes represent resources that cannot be used to develop new
products, raise wages, create jobs, or make other, more urgently-needed
efficiency enhancements.  Attempts by government to force businesses to
&#147;save&#148; energy are inherently wasteful.<p>
     Energy taxes are at best a crude and unreliable method of curbing pollution.
Energy use is not a reliable indicator of pollution created.  For example, two
different automobiles will produce different levels of emissions from the same
amount of gasoline.  Taxing energy is not the same thing as taxing pollution.<p>
<p>
Q: <i> Isn&#146;t it true that Europeans pay much higher gas taxes than
Americans?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Yes, but Europe also has a higher population density and few wide-open
expanses equivalent to those spanning the American West.  Hauling goods from
Frankfurt to Berlin is hardly the same as from St. Louis to Seattle.  The U.S.
transports over 3.7 trillion ton-kilometers of inland freight annually.  This
is more than ten times the amount shipped in Germany and over five times that
transported in the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Spain, Belgium and Denmark
combined.  European-level gas taxes would be economically ruinous in the United
States.<p>
<p>
<p>
Q:  <i>The U.S. contains only 5 percent of the world&#146;s population, yet
accounts for approximately 25 percent of energy use.  Moreover, America uses 10
percent to 25 percent more energy per unit of output than many other industrial
nations.  Doesn&#146;t this mean the U.S. is energy inefficient?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Several factors make it reasonable for Americans to use more energy than
people in Western Europe and Japan.  America has more abundant energy
resources, so energy tends to be less expensive here.  America has a lower
population density, so we must consume more energy for transportation.
Americans have 50 percent  to 80 percent more living space, per capita, than do
Europeans, and 250 percent more than do the Japanese.  Larger domiciles require
more energy to heat and cool.  More living space also means larger household
appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines.  Europeans and Japanese
use significantly more energy than do Africans and Latin Americans.  Does this
make Europe and Japan energy inefficient?  To enjoy the benefits of economic
progress and prosperity is not necessarily to &#147;waste&#148; energy.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>Q:<i>  Won&#146;t energy taxes help prevent the depletion of fossil
fuels?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  We&#146;re in no danger of running out of fossil fuels.  Political pundits
and policy analysts have predicted impending energy shortages for years, yet
these projections have never come true.  For example, in 1970 the International
Energy Agency claimed that the world&#146;s proven oil reserves of 645 billion
barrels would be depleted in the mid-1980s, yet by 1990 world oil reserves had
actually increased to 1 trillion barrels.  Proven oil reserves are more a
function of market prices and extraction technologies than they are of actual
underground supplies.  As knowledge increases, so do proven reserves.  The most
recent estimates place the world&#146;s oil supply at several hundred years.
Energy taxes, by discouraging consumption without augmenting the profit margins
of energy producers, actually discourage the exploration and recovery of fossil
fuels.    <p>

<A HREF="/cei.html">CEI</A>'s Economic & Regulatory Reform Program deals with many issues concerning the
over-regulation of financial instruments and insurance.  Particular emphasis is
placed on financial instruments used to minimize monetary risks, <a href="topic.html#insurance">insurance
reform</A> (which covers such issues as pension funds, social security, <A HREF="medicare.html">Medicare</A> and Medicaid) and deposit insurance reform.<p>

<OL>


<LI><i>Deriviatives, Financial Innovation, and Minimizing Risks in the Banking
System</i><p>
<p>
A story all too familiar to financial practitioners and entrepreneurs is what
Robert Merton calls "the financial innovation spiral."  Regulatory
bureaucracies, hungry to increase their domains and budgets, keep a watchful
eye on financial innovation and capital markets activities.  When such
activities become "too big" and start growing "too
rapidly," the busy beavers of Washington begin to build dams.  New
regulations are born.  New jobs for regulators are created.  Bureaucracies are
built up that plug the flows of commerce and capital.<p>
<p>
Entrepreneurship, however, is not typically foiled by regulation.  Indeed, the <i>response</i> to the regulation of innovation usually is more
innovation -- the financial innovation spiral.   When financial
intermediaries are forced to innovate around regulation, further costs are
incurred.  Sometimes it is more efficient to comply with the regulations.  In
either case, unnecessary regulations on financial innovation place a burden on
the processes of capital formation, risk management, and financial
intermediation.<p>
<p>
     Corporations, moreover, face "regulatory risk" -- perhaps the one
risk in capital markets which cannot be hedged.  For those firms which must
comply with regulation instead of innovate around it, the risk is that
regulators do not have the requisite expertise to regulate.  As a result, firms
engaged in legitimate albeit complex financial strategies often are penalized
rather than rewarded in the regulatory process.  This problem is compounded by
a typically huge deficit of public education and information on the benefits of
financial innovation.<p>
<p>
     The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is dedicated to the advancement of
the principles of limited government and free markets.  The advancement of
those principles is perhaps nowhere more necessary than in the arena of
financial intermediation and innovation.  As the world's commodity and
asset markets have become more volatile, the use of financial contracts in
managing financial risks has become an integral part of every corporate
treasurer's job.  Because of financial innovations such as
"derivatives" contracts, risks can be managed at a low cost, capital
can be raised efficiently, credit risk can be diversified, and capital can flow
to its most highly valued uses.<p>

     A derivatives transaction is a bilateral contract which derives its value from
the value of an underlying asset, reference rate, or index.  Popular types
include futures, forwards, swaps, and options.  Over the last two years, more
than ten studies by regulators, congressional committees, and industry have
been completed, virtually all of which explain the numerous benefits of
derivatives.  Despite these benefits, several highly-publicized corporate and
municipal losses -- many of which were not <i>caused</i> by
derivatives -- have encouraged some members of Congress to ignore the
benefits of derivatives extolled in those studies and instead to focus on the
"risks" of derivatives.<p>

     The 1994 return of the U.S. Congress to Republican control, moreover, does not offer much new hope on derivatives policy.  Several key Republican members of Congress, including new House Banking Committee Chairman Leach, are indeed at
the forefront of the "let's regulate derivatives" wave.  The
regulatory agencies, in addition, have undertaken several drastic steps
designed to step up their regulation of derivatives.  The CFTC has been
particularly aggressive under the leadership of Mary Shapiro in both calling into question the regulatory status of privately-negotiated derivatives and in tightening the CFTC's grip on the regulated futures exchanges.  The
Federal Reserve Bank of New York also reached a recent agreement with Bankers Trust which might be viewed as policy-making in disguise, as are the enforcement actions of the CFTC and SEC against Bankers Trust regarding Gibson Greetings.  The implications of those actions on the application of the anti-fraud portions of the Commodity Exchange Act and for the legality of products like equity swaps is not yet clear.<p>

     At first glance, the prospects for competition free from regulation in the derivatives arena seem rather grim.  But then, that shouldn't surprise
us.<p>

     In his <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, Adam Smith reviewed 18th-century public attitudes toward "forestalling" and "engrossing."
Forestalling was an activity in which corn was purchased during times of plenty in hopes it could be resold when prices rose.  Engrossing was a similar activity in which corn was purchased in one city and transported to another, hopefully to be sold at a profit greater than the transportation cost.<p>

     The anti-trade Corn Laws were intended in part to restrict forestalling and engrossing.  Smith nonetheless noted the numerous economic benefits of those
activities and went so far as to call forestalling and engrossing a "most
important operation of commerce."  He defended the activities and
noted -- more prophetically than he may have realized -- that "[t]he
popular fear of engrossing and forestalling may be compared to the popular
terrors and suspicions of witchcraft.  The unfortunate wretches accused of this
latter crime were not more innocent of the misfortunes imputed to them, than those who have been accused of the former."  <p>

Witch hunts closer to home have been frighteningly similar to that one in the 18th century.  Consider, for example, what happened when politicians sought in the 1930s to blame financial activities and "speculative excesses" for the Great Depression.  Legislation was enacted, for example, to eliminate financial contracts called "privileges."  Similar financial contracts finally were allowed again in 1981, and this time they were called "options."  Options traded on organized financial exchanges now meet
rarely with the derision they once did.  The contemporary attacks focus instead
on the same contracts negotiated off the floor of organized exchanges, such as interest rate options known as caps, collars, and floors, despite the
fundamental similarity of exchange-traded and off-exchange options contracts.<p>

Depression-era assaults on innovation also gave us the Glass-Steagall act as a straightjacket for banks to wear.  And thus was born federal deposit insurance, as well -- required to protect the banking system from the "systemic instability" created by restrictions on bank portfolios and interstate branching.  Capital formation was first regulated under the Securities Act and the Securities and Exchange Act during this period.  <p>

The ratcheting-up of financial regulation, moreover, did not end with the
Depression.  The last fifty years have seen just as much, if not more, of the financial innovation spiral.  Consider just a few more recent examples:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
     the Eurodollar market owes much of its origin in the 1950s and 1960s to
Regulation Q, which placed a ceiling on interest rates;<p>
     the Eurobond market was spawned by the 30% withholding tax on interest
payments on bonds sold in the U.S. to foreign investors;<p>
     the explosion of issues in deep discount corporate bonds in the early 1980s
was due largely by an error made by the U.S. Treasury in interpreting the tax
treatment of discount securities -- the error actually allowed firms to make
money by issuing zero-coupon bonds and <i>giving</i> them away because of the
manner in which the Treasury allowed interest to be deducted; and<p>
     the "swap" market is said to have developed in response to capital
controls in Europe in the early 1970s. <A HREF="#1"><sup>1</sup></A><p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
History thus affirms how the financial innovation spiral plays out.  As
regulations have become more and more onerous, corporations and other
entrepreneurs have had little choice but to live with that regulation through costly compliance or regulatory avoidance.  At the same time, capital market
participants have stepped up their efforts to innovate.  Financial innovation
allows capital market participants to exploit profit opportunities and manage
their business risks, but it also allows private parties to remain one step
ahead of the political dragon.<p>
<p>
The irony of the financial innovation spiral is that the more rapidly firms
innovate, the more rapidly the legislation and political dinosaurs which
regulate innovation become antiquated and increasingly incapable of addressing
innovation.  One need not look very far for evidence of this.  Consider, for
example, the problems of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) which was never
designed to address complex products such as structured (i.e., hybrid)
securities and swaps.  For that matter, consider the decades of case law
generated as courts try to interpret what Congress intended when it regulated
"futures" and "forwards" differently.  Or consider that
when bank examiners must assess capital adequacy of a swap dealer, they must
miraculously become students of such arcane sciences as stochastic calculus to
really judge the quality of a bank's risk management systems.<p>
<p>
In reality, regulators are slow to respond dynamically to innovation.  It
simply is far easier to change the regulations themselves.  These changes are
on rare occasions positive, such as the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission's exemption of swaps from the Commodity Exchange Act.  Usually,
however, new regulations compound existing problems by classifying financial
innovations in black and white terms.  Rather than expecting bank examiners
actually to learn the mathematical and financial modeling techniques required
to assess the internal risk management models employed by participants in
derivatives activity, new regulations are promulgated which force innovative
approaches into a box.  Examples are the early drafts of capital requirements
for interest rate risk proposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Reserve Board and
capital requirements for market risk proposed by the Bank for International
Settlements.  Both proposals mandated a "model" which all banks must
use to measure their interest rate risk.  Although the recent provision in the
proposed Bank for International Settlements capital requirements for market
risk represent an encouraging move toward greater reliance on internal models,
the underlying problem is still the inflexibility of bureaucracy and its
inability to expeditiously address the unpredictable dynamic of financial
innovations and market volatility.<p>
<p>
The ostensible justification usually advanced for financial regulations since
World War II is the "market failure" paradigm.  According to this
theory, markets often fail to perform their functions.  When a flaw -- real
or perceived -- in the market is found, government intervention is required
to "fix" the market's failure.  <p>
<p>
The work of no less than four Nobel prize winners in economics from The
University of Chicago -- George Stigler, Ronald Coase, Merton Miller, and
Gary Becker -- explodes the market failure paradigm.  The Nobelists point out
that market failure theory conveniently assumes government regulation to be
perfect and costless; "government failure" is assumed not to occur.
Yet, evidence does not support these assumptions.  Government can fail, too.
The "Chicago approach" demonstrates that sound economic policy can be
crafted only after comparing which failure is the most significant, the
market's or the government's.  <p>
<p>
Unfortunately, because the market failure paradigm ignores the possibility of
"government failure," the problems which arise from regulatory and
political failures are insufficient by themselves to result in a roll-back of
the misguided regulations.  Instead, market failure proponents will point at
the new problems created by regulatory risk as further evidence of market
failure, and new legislation will again follow.<p>
<p>
Once this vicious circle starts, it is difficult to break.  New regulations
create new jobs for regulators, new justifications for fatter bureaucratic
budgets, and new excuses for crusading legislators on re-election trails to
valiantly proclaim their role as the taxpayers' guardians.  All the while,
the derivatives industry in the U.S. will continue its migration to other,
less-regulated shores, thus decreasing competition and raising the costs of
risk management.<p>
<p>
If left unchecked, ever-constrictive regulations chasing on the heels of
financial innovation will progress.  As Adam Smith taught us, however, public
policy advocacy is an effective way to forestall such regulatory encroachments
on the investment and free movements of capital.  His voice stood out against
the doomsayers of 18th-century England, and, indeed, the Corn Laws were
repealed eventually.<p>
<p>
In more modern times, the effectiveness of public policy is evident -- at
least temporarily -- in recent successes in forestalling the ratcheting-up of
regulations on derivatives.  The earlier capital adequacy proposals on interest
rate risk and market risk were subsequently changed to allow some institutions
the discretion to use their own models.  Examiner oversight will be
complemented by supplemental examiner training.  This temporary success, like
the swap exemption from the CEA, is a result of advocacy, primarily by the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA).  <p>
<p>
Advocacy is most effective, however, if done by independent organizations whose
only agenda is the promotion of principles.  While ISDA's advocacy has
been very successful and based on sound economic principles, its efforts to
prevent the ratcheting-up of the regulation of privately-negotiated derivatives
can only be <i>complemented</i> by the efforts of independent, non-profit
advocacy groups like CEI.  The Competitive Enterprise Institute is in fact
uniquely positioned to complement the work of industry in forestalling the
regulation of financial innovation as just such a dispassionate enterprise.  <p>
<p>

<LI><i>Banking and FDIC Reform</i><p>
<p>
The analytical basis for deposit insurance reform is well-developed, with an
extensive array of literature and noted academic experts.  The case for various
forms of comprehensive reform has been made on many occasions and in many
forums, but "bright ideas" alone have not been enough to overcome
substantial problems concerning operational details, political coalition
building, transitional difficulties, and translation of technical jargon into a
message that resonates with the average American.  The critical task today
remains one of effectively marketing many good ideas in the policy arena in a
manner that builds a dominant consensus in favor of fundamental reform.  This
is the task that CEI does best.  <p>
<p>
To advance this reform agenda, CEI launched in 1988 its Financial Services and
Deposit Insurance Reform project--in anticipation of the federal
government's initial bailout of the savings and loan industry.  Our aim
was to promote a regulatory framework that would both encourage vigorous
competition in the U.S. financial services industry and ensure that American
taxpayers did not face an even greater insurance fund bailout in the
1990's.  <p>
<p>
By privatizing deposit insurance, consumers would benefit from a host of
savings including higher interest rates on deposits.  Also, another S &amp; L
fiasco funded by millions of taxpayers dollars would be a thing of the past.<p>
<p>


<LI><i>Private Insurance Reform</i><p>
<p>
Modern society has become increasingly safety conscious and risk-averse.  We
face growing pressures to reduce risks throughout society and to ensure that
those harmed by misadventure receive compensation.  But life is fraught with
uncertainties.  Over time, our societies have developed institutions to help us
mitigate the risk of uncertainty.<p>
<p>
Financial intermediaries, including banks, financial markets, insurance
companies, and others, facilitate the management of our monetary risks.  For
instance, when we buy insurance, we buy peace of mind.  With insurance, we
exchange the chance of a large, unexpected payment, whose timing we cannot
control, for a series of smaller, known payments over the life of the contract.
Moreover, when we shop for insurance, we receive an analysis of our risks.
Insurance companies determine the probability that our house will burn, that
our car will be stolen, or that we will become ill.  Insurers share this
information with consumers through differences in premiums.  We can learn what
actions we can take to reduce our risk by learning what behaviors earn a
discount, or lead to lower premiums.<p>
<p>
One important uncertainty for which we cannot plan and which we cannot manage,
is government policy.  Government action, now and in the future, is more likely
to create risks than to ameliorate them.  Government-imposed rules and
regulations are more likely to inhibit quality than to promote it.  But the
expansion of government regulations and government insurance programs, on both
the state and federal levels, has been significant in recent years.  Government
regulation of prices, capital requirements, rating criteria, and coverage
capacity makes it harder for insurers to offer appropriate risk management at
appropriate prices.  Moreover, these interventions distort markets and force
some to subsidize the politically favored. <p>
<p>
Perhaps the most significant examples are areas in which government actually
provides insurance to protect against certain risks.  These now include poor
health (Medicare, Medicaid), insufficient retirement income (Social Security),
natural disasters (flood insurance), depository institution insolvency (deposit
insurance), underfunding of private pensions (Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation), inadequate credit standing for home purchases (FHA-guaranteed
loans), and agricultural business risk (crop insurance).  Government also
provides insurance indirectly through its regulation of safety in private
activities (e.g. EPA, FDA, NHTSA, CPSC, OSHA) and its supervision of the
overall economy.<p>
<p>
Equally significant are attempts by the courts to reduce social risks.  They
are quite pervasive and often counterproductive.  This reduction by American
courts of the right of free contract has limited innovation in the area of risk
management.  If firms cannot assign risks via enforceable contracts, they will
find it difficult to develop the specialized knowledge needed to assess risk
adequately.  Unless a risk reduction firm can shield its customers from their
mistakes, it has little to sell.  The parallel move to transform tort law from
a system of corrective justice  --  an effort to identify and require
restitution from alleged wrongdoers  --  to a system of wealth redistribution
has created major difficulties for insurers while doing little to help most
"victims."<p>
<p>
As a society becomes wealthier, insurance becomes increasingly important as a
means of protecting existing wealth and freeing the resources of businesses and
individuals to be used in furthering economic growth.  As a nation's
wealth grows, insurance may also come to be viewed by some observers as a
"necessity" akin to sufficient food and adequate housing.  Such
attitudes are becoming more widespread, and insurance issues are becoming
increasingly more prominent at the federal and state levels.     <p>
<p>
CEI's Private Insurance Project promotes free market economic solutions to
the problems confronting the industry today.  To meet this end, CEI
concentrates on educating the media, Congress, and the public about the manner
in which the insurance market works and the dangerous effects of misguided
government intervention.  In coming years, CEI will address the important,
emerging issues as they move to the top of the insurance policy agenda.<p>

<P>Instead of relying on the political process to give sustained, long term
attention to environmental protection, <A HREF="/cei.html">CEI</A> has developed and promoted an
alternative strategy called <A HREF="/fme.html">free market environmentalism</A>.  CEI contends that
where individual property rights exist in environmental resources, the
environment is most likely to be protected.  After all, most of the
world's environmental problems exist in those areas where common ownership
of government management is the norm.  A free market environmental program
would allow individuals to advance environmental goals as effectively as free
markets permit individuals to advance economic goals.  The policies that flow
from this approach -- privatization, targeted liability rules, sound scientific
inquiry, reduced reliance on political regulation -- are very different from
those now being sought by environmental activists.  They are, however, far more
likely to prove effective.  <p>

<p>
CEI's Environmental Studies Program includes both an overall effort to
reframe the environmental debate and a series of targeted projects to reform
specific policies.  Only a comprehensive vision of market-oriented
environmental policies will engender the support needed to reform current
policies.  That framework must then be developed in detail for specific
environmental initiatives.<p>
<p>
As the leading proponent of free market environmentalism, the Competitive
Enterprise Institute continues to challenge the conventional wisdom of the
environmental movement and aggressively promotes free market environmentalism
as a more effective strategy for attaining our nation's environmental
goals.  CEI has fostered and coordinated the development of a network of public
policy organizations around the country and across the globe.  CEI has
positioned itself to take a stronger role in both domestic and international
debates over environmental policies in the 1990s.<p>

<p>
Specifically, CEI works on the vast array of particular environmental issues, including:

<H1>New Year's Revolutions

<a href="marlo.html">Marlo Lewis, Jr.</A>
<P>
Message from the Executive Director, January
1996
<BR>
<P>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<P>
Organizations, like individuals, periodically need to step back from the press
of business, the rush of events, and look at the big picture.  For many people,
the holiday season, culminating in New Year's resolutions, is a time for
such reflection.<p>

	Examining CEI in this spirit, I see an organization with clear principles
(limited government, competition, individual liberty), a specific modus
operandi (integrated "issue management" combining analysis,
education, coalition building, advocacy, and litigation), and a distinctive
mission (developing and marketing the case for freedom in precisely those
policy spheres where statist thinking still prevails).<p>

	But what about CEI's policy reform objectives?  Which are most central to CEI's principles and mission?  Herewith a quick sketch of three New Year's Revolutions we are plotting in 1996.<p>
<DL>
<DD>1. <b><i>Property Rights Protection</i></b>.  The Fifth Amendment states
unambiguously, "nor shall private property be taken for public use,
without just compensation."  Yet during the past two decades, federal
regulators, acting in the name of endangered species, wetlands, and other
environmental concerns, have routinely denied landowners the reasonable use of
their property and offered (in most cases) no compensation for the financial
losses incurred.  <p>
	At a minimum, regulators should be compelled to compensate the victims of
bureaucratic land grabs.  Better still, federal land-use controls should be
scrapped in favor of voluntary, incentive-based conservation programs. <p>
<BR>
<DD>2. <b><i>Regulatory Accountability</i></b>.  Congress has delegated to Executive
agencies the power to enact regulations.  This constitutionally dubious
practice undergirds the regulatory state.  Delegation allows lawmakers to pass
vague regulatory statutes and leave the implementation dirty work to anonymous
civil servants.  Individual legislators can claim credit for the ostensive
benefits of regulatory programs while blaming unelected bureaucrats for the
associated costs and abuses.  Indeed, the more punitive the regulatory system,
the more opportunities for legislators to intercede on behalf of aggrieved
"constituents"--a proven fund-raising technique.  <p>
     Congress should have to approve agency rules before they go into effect.
Similarly, all existing regulations should be sunsetted and periodically expire
unless reauthorized by a recorded vote.  Citizens could then punish elected
officials at the ballot box for increasing (or failing to decrease) regulatory
burdens, just as they can now punish them for increasing (or failing to
decrease) tax and spending burdens.<p><BR>

<DD>3. <b><i>Consumer Choice</i></b>.  Federal "consumer protection" agencies
impose mandatory standards on products ranging from children's toys to
construction ladders to medical drugs.  These rules restrict the range of goods
available to consumers.  However, many people believe such standards are
essential to assuring consumer safety.<p>
	It is possible to retain the benefits, real or imagined, of government
standards while still expanding consumer choice.  Simply change the veto power
of federal agencies (their power to ban nonconforming products) into a
"certification" power.  Instead of being banned outright, products
that do not meet federal standards would be available with clear warning of
that fact.  Persons who trust the standards could continue to use only
government-approved products, while others would be free to choose unapproved
products.  (In the case of unapproved medical drugs, a doctor's
supervision might also be required.)  In this way, government standards could
no longer be imposed by fiat; instead, they would have to earn their
credibility in the marketplace.<p><br>
</DL>
	The first and third reforms would reduce dramatically the coercive power of
the bureaucratic establishment.  The second reform would return political power from Washington to the states and the people.  Policy makers in search of a
reform agenda in the "post-Contract with America" period are
cheerfully invited to make CEI's New Year's Revolutions their own.<p>

<H1>Free Market Environmental Vision</H1>
</CENTER>

<BR>

<P>America has long been known as a nation where private homes and backyards are
beautiful but politically managed parks and streets are a mess.  For some the
answer is to raise taxes to better support the &#147;cash starved&#148; public
sector.  For others the answer will be found in stringent regulations covering
every aspect of modern society.  A better approach would be to discover what
makes homes and backyards beautiful and apply the lessons to problem areas.
Rather than bureaucratize the environment, we should privatize our efforts to
protect the environment....One might say that trees should not have legal
standing, but behind every tree should stand a private steward, a private
owner, willing and legally enabled to protect that resource....This vision of
an America engaged in creative ecological privatization may be radical, but it
offers great promise of lasting success in dealing with the ever-changing
circumstances of human interaction with the natural world.  Not only is this
vision applicable to environmental protection, it is compatible with the
traditional American respect for individual liberty.  (with Kent Jeffreys,

<A HREF="/cei.html">CEI</A>'s <i>Death by Regulation</i> project is aimed at changing the policy
debate, not only through conventional policy analysis, but also by exploring
new means of bringing this message to a wider audience.  One approach is to
focus on previously unrecognized victims of regulatory failure, showing, for
example, that government regulation can in some cases be literally lethal.
<p>
This focus is based, in part, on our recognition that past deregulatory efforts
have either been outright failures or, at best, only limited successes.
Traditional cost-benefit debates are often rigged contests, with market
advocates easily cast as the "greedy" defenders of
"profits" while regulators are the "good guys" who protect
us.  CEI's <i>Death by Regulation</i> work attempts an end-run around this
dilemma -- if the public can be persuaded that government intervention carries
its own deadly consequences, then the entire nature of this debate changes.
<p>
The potential of the <i>Death by Regulation </i>project is best illustrated by
CEI's work on the <A HREF="ebb2.html">CAFE</A> issue.  The CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy)
program imposes the minimum fuel efficiency standards for each automaker's
sales of new cars in this country.  The CAFE program was established by
Congress in 1975 in response to the oil shocks of that period.    <p>
<p>
As oil prices subsequently began to fall in the mid-1980s, however, the public
started to seek larger, safer vehicles once again -- a shift in consumer demand
that ran headlong into CAFE's constraints.  America's competitive
advantage in the large-car production was undermined, destroying domestic jobs
and raising consumer prices.
<p>
CEI entered the CAFE debate in 1986, recognizing that economic arguments alone
were failing to win the policy debate.  CEI raised the CAFE-safety issue,
arguing that CAFE literally kills people by restricting the production of
larger, more crashworthy cars.  Recognizing the lack of formal academic
research on this, CEI persuaded Brookings economist Robert Crandall to
investigate the issue.  The result was a study, co-authored with Harvard Public
Health Professor John D. Graham, that appeared in the 1989 <i>Journal of Law
and Economics</i>.  Its conclusion:  CAFE causes 2,000 to 4,000 car occupant
deaths each year.  <p>
     <p>
CEI also engaged in coalition building, spurring other groups not only to look
at this issue, but to produce their own policy papers on CAFE.  And CEI also
filed a new type of court challenge to CAFE, challenging not its economic
rationality but its lethal effect.  Our first case, in 1986, pitted CEI against
environmental groups who were seeking to make CAFE <u>more</u> stringent.  We
did not win that case on the merits, but we did establish that CEI had judicial
standing to raise the issue.<p>
<p>
The breakthrough came in 1992, in our second court case.  In the first judicial
overturning of a CAFE standard in the program's history, a federal appeals
court harshly rejected the government's claim that CAFE kills no one.  It
found that the agency had reached this conclusion through a combination of
"fudged analysis," "statistical legerdemain," and
"bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo."<p>
<p>
The agency at issue was NHTSA (the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration) whose main job is to promote traffic safety.  An agency whose
middle name is safety had been found to be concealing the fact that one of its
major programs kills people.  A key piece of evidence was the Harvard-Brookings
study that CEI had previously instigated.<p>
<p>
Most importantly, perhaps, the phenomenon of <i>Death by Regulation</i> was no
longer an academic hypothesis; it had been judicially confirmed.  <p>
<p>
The next chapter in the CAFE story is still being written.  CEI is back in
court, challenging NHTSA's refusal to follow the 1992 court decision.  A
ruling on our new case is imminent.<p>

When the answer is "Blizzards, heat waves, torrential rains, droughts,
hail, and hurricanes," the question must, of course, be "What
provides unequivocal evidence of imminent <a href="topic.html#global">global warming</A>?"  Is there
<i>any</i> climatic condition that might lead modern day apocalyptics to
reconsider their Chicken Little views?  I'm afraid not.  Consider the
comments of Jessica Matthews in a recent <i>Washington Post </i>column,
"Is Global Warming the Problem?": "think of the blizzard of
'96 as a glimpse of a part of the likely greenhouse future."
Jessica's concerns were echoed in the <i>New York Times</i> ("Blame
Global Warming for the Blizzard"), <i>Newsweek</i> ("Blizzards,
Floods and Hurricanes: Blame Global Warming"), and throughout much of the
media.  To Jessica and her environmental cohort:  <i>"It don't matter
whether it burns or freezes, it all proves Al Gore's thesis!" </i> <p>
	The argument for blizzards being the consequence of global warming leaps from
the observation that a warmer world is a more energetic world (true) to the
presumption that it will therefore experience worse weather (not necessarily at
all).  Although this apocalyptic linkage has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> by
the doomsday crowd, it is simplistic and almost certainly wrong.  Increasing
the energy of a system does not necessarily imply more chaotic behavior --
as anyone who has ridden a bicycle knows well.  <p>
	More significantly, weather is, in part, a by-product of the temperature
differences between the polar and equatorial regions.  If the impact of global
warming were to make the poles colder and the equatorial regions hotter, then
we might indeed expect stormier weather.  However, the models upon which
Jessica's hyperventilations are based suggest exactly the opposite; it is
the polar regions that are expected to warm most significantly, the equatorial
regions little if at all.  As extreme cold is produced by arctic air from the
polar regions, global warming should produce less of a deep freeze, even though
precipitation and hurricanes may rise.<p>
		Indeed, the balance of evidence suggests a warmer world will be a cloudier
world, with most of the warming occurring at night, moderating nighttime lows.
Also, the increased cloudiness will be greatest in the summer, least in the
winter, further reducing temperature variations across the seasons.  In effect,
the most likely impact of warming -- should it occur -- would be a more
benign climate, not a more hostile one.  <p>
		Not that anyone should throw away their snow shovels yet, however.   The
evidence that mankind is having any significant impact on present climate
patterns remains speculative.  The latest round of fear mongering stemmed from
a British study that claimed 1995 was the warmest year on record before the
December data was in.  As it turns out, December was mighty frigid, and 1995
was an ordinary year.  According to the satellite data released a few weeks
after the hysteria, 1995 was the 8th warmest of the last 15 years -- yet
Jessica and the papers largely ignored it. <p>
	Why is this?  To the Jessicas of the world, global warming is like any
religious belief, unmovable by facts or logic.  They find Paradise in nature,
the Fall in Man's increased reliance on technology and economic growth.
Only global planners can protect life outside the Garden!  Evidence that the
earth is robust, that disaster is not close, weakens the appeal of these
coercive utopians' policy prescriptions.<p>
	So, while the skies of Planet Earth are likely to remain clear for some time,
we should all expect far more stormy political weather.  Environmentalism has
become the last refuge of scoundrels; the last area where statism retains any
popular appeal.  We'll see much stormier weather before the policy skies
finally clear. <p>

<P>Ike C. Sugg is the Fellow in Wildlife and Land-Use Policy at the
Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free market research and advocacy
organization headquartered in Washington, D.C.  CEI emphasizes the marketing
and implementation of classical liberal ideals and believes limited government
and competition best serve the public interest.

<P>At CEI, Mr. Sugg works on wildlife and land use issues, focusing both on
the failures of governmental programs and the successes of private conservation
efforts.  Through intensive research, writing and speaking, Mr. Sugg seeks to
heighten public awareness of how government abuses private property owners and
mismanages natural resources.  By showing how private property rights and
economic incentives can work for natural resource conservation, rather than
against it, his work is aimed at reforming failing public policies (both here
and abroad) and fostering greater appreciation for the ethical and conservation
values of human liberty. 

<P>Mr. Sugg has presented his views before Congress, the President&#146;s
Council on Environmental Quality, the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species, National Public Radio, CNBC, C-SPAN and other fora.  Some
of his recent writings include a chapter in the book <i>Elephants and Whales:
Resources for Whom?</i> (Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, UK: 1995);
<i>Elephants and Ivory: Lessons from the Trade Ban</i> (IEA Studies on the
Environment No. 2, UK: Nov. 1994); <i>Defining &#145;Harm&#146; to Wildlife</i>
(The National Law Journal, vol. 16, no. 42; June 1994); <i>Caught in the Act:
Evaluating the Endangered Species Act, Its Effects on Man and Prospects for
Reform</i> (Cumberland Law Review, vol. 24:1, 1993-1994); <i>California Fires
-- Losing Houses, Saving Rats</i> (The Wall Street Journal, November 10, 1993
[which sparked ABC News program 20/20&#146;s breakthrough coverage of that
disaster]); and numerous other articles in <i>The Wall Street Journal, The
Washington Times, National Review</i> and <i>The American Spectator,</i> among
others.

individuals; it accepts no government funds and does not perform contractual
work.<P>

<H1>Insurance for Beginners</H1>
by Catherine England

<BR>
</CENTER>

<P>When we buy insurance, we buy increased peace of mind.  If insured-against
events occur, they will not be as much of a financial burden.  With insurance,
we exchange the chance of a large, unexpected payment, whose timing we cannot
control, for a series of smaller, known payments over the life of the insurance
contract.  Finally, buying insurance buys us private risk analysis.  The
insurance company must determine how many 30-year-old houses will catch fire
this year and what steps can be taken to reduce that probability.<p>
	Insurance companies share this information with consumers through differences
in premiums.  We can learn something about what actions or changes reduce risk
by finding out what earns a discount or leads to lower insurance premiums.<p>
	Insurance allows us to protect our wealth more efficiently, and wealthier
societies typically demand more insurance.  Funds can be invested in other
activities rather than being set aside for unforeseeable contingencies.
Insurance thus allows both insured individuals and society to operate with
longer time horizons.<p>
	To realize these broader benefits of insurance, private insurance markets must
exhibit three fundamental elements.  First, premiums must be risk-based.
Second, insurance markets should remain competitive.  Third, insurance
companies must be allowed to earn (but they should not be promised) profits.<p>
	True insurance does not &#147;spread&#148; risk.  Insurance is more accurately
described as a contract that transfers from the policyholder to the insurance
company part of the risk of financial losses associated with insured-against
events.  To better manage their exposure, insurance companies tend to pool the
risks they accept.  But the pools created by private insurance companies are
pools of similar risks.  Most important, premiums paid by an individual
policyholder reflect the probability that he or she will make a claim, not the
probability that someone somewhere will make a claim.<p>
	In insurance markets, consumers&#146; interests are best protected by
competition.  Competition (and potential competition) forces insurance
companies to remain efficient, to control administrative and claims costs.
Competition forces insurance companies to base premiums on expected future
losses.  It prevents them from passing along past losses to new policyholders.
Competition leads insurance companies to pay claims promptly and serve
policyholders well.  Finally, competition encourages innovation and leads
insurers to attempt to extend insurance markets into currently underserved
areas.  In a competitive market, insurers only grow and thrive to the extent
they meet customers&#146; needs.<p>
	As a rule, governments best foster a competitive environment by staying out of
the way.  Government-imposed rules and regulations are far more likely to
inhibit competition than to promote it.  Regulation of rates, artificial caps
on profits, unnecessarily high entry restrictions, and limits on the variations
in contracts may serve some purpose, but they also discourage vigorous
competition.  <p>
	Possible profits provide insurance company owners and managers with an
incentive to provide insurance services to consumers and to find better ways to
serve them.  When insurance companies&#146; profits are artificially restricted
by government fiat, consumers have no way to reward insurers that do a better
than average job, and insurers have no incentive to develop new insurance
products that meet the needs of underserved market segments.  Consumer
satisfaction with the insurance industry generally declines when governments
impose limits on insurance companies&#146; profits.<p>
	The ability of insurance companies to earn profits also directly affects the
supply of insurance available.  The amount of insurance that an insurer can
have in force at any given time (its &#147;capacity&#148;) is determined by the
insurer&#146;s financial capital  (its owners&#146; share of the assets of the
firm).  To add more capacity and to increase the number of new policies it can
write, an insurance company must increase its paid-in capital and surplus.  <p>
	In the absence of active government participation, insurance companies cannot
force individuals to do anything.  Neither a single insurance company nor the
insurance industry can require people to buy insurance products.  In a private
market, consumers purchase insurance only when the protection they receive is
worth the price they pay.  Only the government can insist that individuals buy
insurance products they do not believe are worth the price.  Insurance
companies cannot prevent people from taking risks.  Insurance companies can
only provide incentives for safer behavior through their pricing policies.<p>
	Insurance cannot undo many of the harms caused by insured-against events.
Insurance often cannot make individuals 100 percent whole.  What insurance
provides is some financial compensation, agreed to in advance, to help reduce
the burden of fires, accidents, floods, and other insured-against injuries.<p>
	In the long run, private insurers can only compensate policyholders to the
limits of the insurance contracts in force.    Private insurance cannot survive
as an after-the-fact compensation scheme.  Insurers cannot pay out (for long)
more than they take in.  Insurance is a business, not a charity, and if it is
treated like the latter, capacity will evaporate.<p>
	Private insurance is generally not available for events that are either
extremely unlikely to occur or for events that are extremely likely to occur.
In the first case, there is no demand for insurance.  In the second case, the
premiums are so high that potential insurance consumers are better off saving
their money and insuring themselves.  There are losses that are too small to
insure, and there are losses so large that private insurance cannot provide
coverage, except perhaps for a part of the loss.  Although there are limits to
the coverage private insurers provide, the trend has been (and remains) to find
ways to offer more coverage, ways to expand the limits of what is insurable.<P>

<H1>THE BUSINESS AND REGULATION<BR> OF INSURANCE<BR>
A Primer

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
	Most adults are familiar with what insurance companies do.  In our personal
lives and at work, we benefit from a wide variety of insurance
products--auto insurance, property insurance, life insurance, and health
insurance, to name a few.  But few consumers of insurance products understand
how insurance companies provide financial protection against accidents and
illnesses.  This lack of information can lead to frustration and
misunderstandings if premiums increase or claims are refused.<p>
	<p>
	This primer is intended to remove some of the mystery from insurance markets
and insurance company operations.  It describes the role insurance companies
play in the economy.  It also provides basic information about the insurance
industry's size and the fundamentals of industry operations.  Finally, the
primer reviews insurance company regulation.<p>
<p>
	The value of insurance to policyholders is determined by the probability of an
insured-against event occurring and the expected financial loss associated from
the event.  If an insurer attempts to charge policyholders premiums far in
excess of their expected losses, individuals will refuse to purchase the
insurance because the coverage provided is not worth the cost.  When
individuals can choose not to purchase insurance, insurance companies will be
forced to base premiums on expected claims costs.  As a result, private
insurance companies in a competitive market typically do not "spread"
risk in the sense of charging lower risk policyholders premiums that help cover
the claims costs of higher risk insurance customers.  Expected claims costs
account for both the general level of insurance premiums and the differences in
insurance premiums charged to different groups of policyholders.<p>
<p>
	The insurance industry is regulated by the states.  There is no federal
regulation of insurance.  Each state is largely responsible for monitoring the
solvency of insurance companies headquartered there.  Guaranty funds, which
protect claimants in the event of an insurance company's failure, are also
operated by the states.  Regulation of insurance contracts is typically
undertaken by the state in which the policyholder resides.  Contract regulation
addresses the premiums charged and/or the terms of the contract.  Insurance
policies sold to individuals generally attract more regulatory attention than
do commercial policies.<p>
<p>
	The state-based insurance regulatory system has been criticized (especially by
federal lawmakers) because of differences that exist among the states in terms
of the resources devoted to insurance regulation and the stringency with which
various rules are applied.  It is worth noting, however, that the insurance
industry survived the economically tumultuous 1980s in better shape than did
the federally regulated savings and loan or banking industries.<p>
<p>
	Important questions remain about state insurance regulation, however.  For
example, how far should regulators go in identifying appropriate investments
for insurance companies?  State-imposed limits on the premiums that insurance
companies can charge also cause serious problems for some insurance companies.
Rate regulation has, in some cases, led to reduced availability of insurance,
making it difficult for consumers to find coverage they want to purchase.<p>
<p>
	The largest insurance companies in the country have substantial financial
assets at their disposal.  This creates the temptation to view insurers as
&#147;deep pockets,&#148; capable of addressing society's financial ills.
It is important to remember that the largest insurance companies also have
substantial potential liabilities.  Insurance companies required today to pay
unexpected claims because of legal or regulatory interpretations of contractual
terms that are overly generous to policyholders  may not have the resources
needed tomorrow to meet claims arising from other policyholders.<p>
<p>
	Furthermore, insurance companies are not charitable organizations.  They are
in business to make a profit.  When regulatory policies prevent insurers from
earning profits on a line (or lines) of insurance, the supply of the
unprofitable line of insurance will be reduced.  Insurance companies must
answer to their stockholders just as companies do in any other industry.  If
insurance company owners can earn more money in another industry, they will
take their capital elsewhere.<p>
<p>
	The development of private insurance markets benefits society generally.
Businesses and individuals with insurance need not set aside funds for
unforeseen contingencies.  They can invest in other activities.  The
claims-based premiums charged by insurance companies also provide important
information about the risk associated with different activities and how
specific risks can be reduced.<p>
<p>
	Risk-based pricing also allows premiums to respond to the behavior of
individuals.  People who take care to make fewer claims should not be required
to pay the same premiums as individuals who make more frequent claims on the
system.  It is not surprising that compensation systems without risk-sensitive
pricing generally see claims costs rise as claims increase in number and
average size.<p>
<p>
	Private insurance plays a role in the economic body similar to the nervous
system in the human body.  Just as a person's nervous system warns of
danger through sensing pain and discomfort, a well-functioning insurance market
sends signals to economic actors about riskier and less risky activities.
Regulatory policies that interfere with the "insurance" process
interfere with the "pain" signals insurers would normally send.  When
insurance premiums do not reflect differences in risk, society may not realize
it is being "burned" until considerable damage has been done.<p>

<H1>HOW TO DISMANTLE THE<BR>
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT
</H1>
by Robert H. Nelson

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>The Department of the Interior was created in 1849 as the new &#147;Home
Department&#148; covering much of domestic affairs.  Today, Interior is often
thought of as the &#147;Department of the West.&#148;  In total, the Interior
Department has jurisdiction over approximately 450 million acres of public
lands &#151; 20 percent of the land area of the United States. It has about
77,000 full-time employees.  In fiscal 1994, the total operating budget of the
Interior Department was $7.6 billion.<p>
<p>
	Much of the Interior Department was created as part of the progressive-era
plan for American government.  The progressive vision sought rational and
efficient management, to be achieved through the systematic application of
science to the problems of American society.  This vision of scientific
management is no longer an adequate guide for American government.  Indeed, our
task today is to find a new guiding vision and to reshape American governing
institutions accordingly.<p>
<p>
	Many features of the Interior Department&#146;s responsibilities and
organization no longer make sense.  In particular, the Department is a result
of the major overreaching of the federal role that took place in this century.
Interior serves as in effect a planning and zoning board for large areas of the
rural West.  The Interior Department has ended up doing many things that are
properly state and local responsibilities; could be better done in the private
sector; or are not appropriate to government at any level.<p>
<p>
	This paper proposes a radical reorganization of the Interior Department and
its functions.  The changes proposed would cumulatively have the effect of
dismantling much of the Interior Department.  The basis for this reorganization
lies in  four common sense principles:<p>
<OL>
<LI>  Activities that can reasonably be carried out in the private sector should
be done privately.<p>

<LI> Activities that mostly involve state and local concerns should be
administered by state and local governments.<p>

<LI> The Federal government should limit its role to activities and concerns that
involve major Federal interests and responsibilities.<p>

<LI> Administrative organization at the Federal level should place
similar functions in the same agency.<p>

</OL>
	Applying these principles to the Department of the Interior would produce
dramatic changes.  The result would be to abolish altogether six of the current
ten agencies located within the Department of the Interior &#151; the Bureau of
Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Geological Survey, National
Biological Service, Minerals Management Service and Bureau of Mines.  Three
other agencies, the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and
Bureau of Indian Affairs would be sharply reduced in size.  The majority of
their current responsibilities &#151; perhaps 75 percent &#151; would be
transferred to state governments, to tribes, and to private groups.  The
responsibilities of the Office of Surface Mining would be transferred to the
Environmental Protection Agency.<p>
<p>
	Those responsibilities still remaining at the Interior Department would
largely consist of management of lands retained in federal possession for
reasons of their geology, history, rare wildlife or other features of special
national significance.  The various existing parts of the Interior Department
now responsible for these lands could be consolidated into one overall land
management agency.<p>
 <p>
	It is difficult to predict the final cost savings that would result for the
federal government from this plan.  A reasonable estimate, however, is that
approximately 50 percent of the current Interior Department budget, or $3.8
billion annually, would eventually be saved at the federal level, if all this
paper's  recommendations  were adopted.<p>

<H3>Private Conservation Case Study<BR>
February  1996</H3>


<H1>The Karner Blue Butterfly</H1>
</CENTER>


<P><BR>	In 1992 the Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Karner blue butterfly as an endangered species.  Although now considered rare and declining in numbers, the butterfly was once common.  Habitat destruction due to development is commonly blamed for the decline of the butterfly.
Ironically, however, human intervention in the environment may also provide
the opportunity to save the Karner blue.

<P>	In 1861, William Saunders of Ontario caught the first Karner Blue specimen.
At the time there were scores of thriving populations from southern
Minnesota all the way to New Hampshire.  Saunders sent his specimen to
William Henry Edwards of Philadelphia, who assigned it to the species
Lycaena scuderii, Scudder's blue.  The butterfly was later called the Karner blue because of the area where it had first been collected and described.

<P>	The Karner blue is an inconspicuous butterfly.  The butterflies have a
wingspan of approximately one inch and with their wings folded they appear
to be a rather plain slate gray. Only when their wings unfold do the males
show the silvery blue markings on the backs of their wings that give them
their name.

<P>	Usually, the Karner blue butterfly has two broods each year.  Eggs that
have overwintered from the previous year hatch in April.  The larvae feed on
wild lupine leaves and mature rapidly.  Near the end of May, they pupate and
adult butterflies emerge.  The adults are in flight for the first two weeks
of June when the wild lupine is in bloom.  Females lay eggs on or near the
wild lupine plants, after which the females soon die.  The summer eggs hatch
in about a week.  The emergent larvae feed on the lupine for three weeks,
pupate and the second (summer) brood adults appear in the second or third
week of July.  This time eggs are laid among the plant litter, on or near
lupine plants.  By early August all adults have died and the eggs winter over.

<P>	In 1941, writer Vladimir Nabokov, who happened to be an amateur
lepidopterist of considerable stature, received a non-paying curatorial
position at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology.  Nabokov decided to
sort out the North American members of the genus Lycaeides, which had
previously been classified in several mutually contradictory schemes.  In
the course of his work Nabokov determined that the Karner blue was not of
the species L. scuderii, but was in fact a subspecies of Lycaeides melissa.
Nabokov renamed the butterfly Lycaeides melissa samuelis in honor of the
entomologist Samuel Scudder for whom the butterfly had previously been named. 

<P>	The habitat of the Karner blue is characterized by the presence of wild
lupine (Lupinus perennis), a member of the pea family.  Wild lupine is the
only known food source for larva of the butterfly.  Consequently, the
butterfly is wholly dependent on the presence of lupine for its survival.

<P>	Lupine is an early successional plant.  As fire or some other disturbance
sweeps across a forest landscape destroying vegetation, lupine moves in to
take advantage of the sunlight afforded by the burned or disturbed land.  It
will flourish for several years until bushes or trees provide too much shade
for it to grow and blossom.

<P>	Repeated burning by native Americans followed by land clearing by early
settlers historically insured an abundant lupine population.  Fire
suppression in recent decades combined with the return of higher
successional forests have depleted the lupine, and consequently the
butterfly as well.  The only places lupine is consistently found is in poor
soil conditions such as pine barrens where the soil is too poor to allow
dense undergrowth.

<P>	The range of lupine extends from Maine, south to Florida and as far west as
Louisiana and Minnesota.  The butterfly inhabits only a narrow band in the
Northern portion of the lupine's range.  Historically it ranged from New
England, through the Great Lakes region and into Minnesota.  

<P>	Because lupine is a transitory plant, conservation of the butterfly
necessitates a solution other than a conventional regulatory strategy.
Areas which have been disturbed and contain the butterfly, if left alone,
will slowly become non-butterfly habitat.  The most areas where lupine
currently exists, such as pine barrens, cannot indefinitely support a stable
population of butterflies.  In other words, without active human involvement
the butterfly is likely to face extinction in the long term.

<P>	The Karner blue is now found in only a handful of sites and has been
extirpated in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois and Ontario.
The remaining populations are highly scattered and colonies rarely exceed
1,000 individuals.  Such small and disperse colonies are highly vulnerable
to weather events.  The extinction of Karner blue butterflies in Ontario
exemplifies this.  In 1984, the population of butterflies in Ontario was
estimated to be approximately 1,000 adults.  The drought of 1988, followed
by unusually cold weather in May and June of 1989, killed off the Karner
blue butterflies.  None have been seen in Canada since 1989. 

<P>	The only colony in the world which has significantly more than 1,000 adult
butterflies is the population found at the Saratoga County Airport.  In
fact, half the world population of Karner blue butterflies is found in this
one location, with an estimated 14,000 adults.   Ironically, the habitat at
the airport is not considered natural.  The lupine likely invaded the area
when it was disturbed and has been maintained by constant human
intervention.  This single largest population and habitat for the butterfly
is a fake sand-prairie in a region where there have been no sand prairies
for tens of thousands of years, an irony which has been noted by some of the
butterfly's researchers.    Some researchers have even suggested that the
fake prairie is a better habitat for the Karner blue than many prairie
preserves. 

<P>	The occurrence of butterflies at the Saratoga airport is something of a
chance coincidence.  The airport was likely created out of previously
cultivated land.  As annual plowing and planting ceased, local wild flowers
exploited this new landscape, just as if this area had been burned by a
fire.  One of these wild flowers is lupine.  This keeps out trees and
enhances visibility.  It takes relatively little mowing to keep trees and
large bushes to a minimum, simply mowing once a year is usually sufficient.
This sort of annual mowing keeps the area in a state of perpetual early
succession.

<P>	This fake prairie may be a better for the Karner blue butterfly than
natural prairie preserves because of fire.  Fire historically created the
prairie and oak savanna habitat in which the lupine thrives.  Lupine has a
long tap-root which extends several feet into the earth.  In a fire the
lupine leaves and stems will burn but the root is protected by the
insulating soil.  Once the fire is over, the plant sends up new shoots from
it's tap root.  Although lupine is well adapted to coping with fire, the
butterfly is not.  Fire kills the butterfly.  Any eggs, larva, pupae or
adult butterflies in a fire's path will be destroyed.  

<P>	A large prairie preserve could be managed with fire without unduly
endangering the butterfly.  But in a small preserve, such as those
surrounding most of the butterfly populations, the butterflies will be
destroyed unless extreme care is taken.  Management by fire ultimately means
that the butterfly is constantly faced with population setbacks.

<P>	Mowing, however, does not have to kill the butterfly.  The eggs which
survive the winter are generally laid in the leaf litter or near the base of
lupine plants.  Mowing conducted after the butterflies have laid their eggs,
sometime in September would have little effect on next springs butterfly
population.  This is reflected in the mowing schedule followed by the
Saratoga county airport, which is surprisingly simple.  After September
every year, the area is mowed to a height of eight inches.   

<P>	Population studies of the Karner blue have shown that one of the critical
factors in its survival is the number of healthy lupine plants in the spring
when the over wintering eggs hatch.  A survey of thirty seven sites
conducted in 1980 in New York revealed that on average two plants of lupine
are required to support every caterpillar.


<P>	In addition to lupine, adult butterflies which emerge in July need nectar
bearing plants on which to feed.  Lupine blooms in June and nectar from the
flowers feeds the first brood of adults.  Lupine, however, is not flowering
in late July and the butterfly must use other plants as a source of nectar.
Literature suggests that butterfly weed is the preferred secondary nectar
source for Karner blue butterflies, however there are a number of other
flowers the butterfly can use as a nectar source. 

<P>	As with the airport in Saratoga county, there are certain human activities
which are constantly creating an early successional habitat.  For example,
utility companies keep the right-of-way around their power transmission
lines constantly mowed.  This effectively creates thousands of miles of
early succession habitat, albeit in narrow strips.  In addition, there are
thousands of airports in the former range of the butterfly.  In essence, any
patch of land from Maine to Minnesota which is mowed only to keep out trees
is potential butterfly habitat.

<P>	Wild lupine seed and plants are readily available from several seed
companies and nurseries and could easily be planted.  Such areas as
right-of-ways and airports could provide the ideal habitat for the
butterfly.  In fact lupine may already exist in some stretches of
right-of-way.  Planting lupine and adjusting mowing schedules could ensure a
continuous habitat of lupine for the butterfly.  Once the lupine has been
established, butterfly cocoons, lupine plants with butterfly eggs, or adult
butterflies could be introduced.  Normally private land owners would be
reluctant to allow an endangered species to be intentionally introduced onto
their land.  However, the existing statute contains exceptions for
experimental populations.  Experimental populations do not have the same
status under the act granted to wild populations.  The butterflies should
only be introduced if the Fish and Wildlife Service is willing to designate
them an experimental population and exempt them from the regulatory
provisions of the act.  

<P>	Once established it is quite possible that the lupine will not only thrive
but also spread.  Established experimental populations of butterfly should
also spread with the lupine.  

<P>	The ease with which a large population of Karner blue butterflies is
maintain at the Saratoga county airport suggests that private conservation
efforts if properly executed could be enormously successful in enhancing the
population of the butterfly.

<H1>EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
<BR> AND THE PRIVATE STEWARDSHIP
<BR> OF MARINE RESOURCES
</H1>

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>Until recently, the prevailing notion among regulators was that
fisheries should be open and available to everyone. This assured that fisheries
were subjected to the tragedy of the commons, and led to their worldwide
decline.<p>
Maintaining open access to marine resources encouraged fishermen to develop
technologies that &#147;vacuumed&#148; the seas. In most other industries,
innovations develop to protect and increase the value and/or supply of
resources, but at sea they have only hastened the depletion of fisheries.<p>
Slowly, scholars and regulators are beginning to understand that if fisheries
are to survive, access to them must be limited. People will only work to
conserve resources when they have a vested interest in them. This can be
accomplished either partially or wholly by:<p>
<UL>	
<LI> creating government enforced rights to fisheries (ITQs),<p>
	<LI> creating or allowing common property rights to develop, or<p>
	<LI> creating or allowing private property rights to develop.<p>
</UL>
Government intervention has not allowed common and private property rights to
develop, and so government control has been the norm. Even though governments
are beginning to create rights to fisheries, these rights do not encourage
conservation as well as private rights. Common property promotes conservation,
but as resources increase in value and/or scarcity, private property rights
offer the greatest rewards for protecting resources.<p>
Private property rights encouraged entrepreneurs in the frontier American West
to develop and adapt technologies to protect their property, and as fishermen
secure rights to resources, they will do the same. Technologies exist today
that could be used to enforce ownership in the marine environment, just as
innovations like branding and fencing did in the American West. These
include:<p>
<UL>
	<LI> sonar systems like the IUSS,<p>
	<LI> tagging systems such as the PIT tag,<p>
	<LI> sonar and satellites that monitor areas,<p>
	<LI> submersibles to patrol areas,<p>
	<LI> artificial reefs that create and enhance habitat, and<p>
	<LI> aquaculture systems that farm fish inland, at sea, and on shore.<p>
</UL>
These technologies all offer a promising avenue for fishermen to exert control
over marine resources. Allowing private ownership in the oceans would encourage
their development and increase the private stewardship of marine resources.

<H1>Noah Was No Bureaucrat
</H1>
by Marlo Lewis

<P>
Bringing religious concerns into public life is as old as politics itself.
People do not cease having religious convictions when they vote, run for
office, oppose or support legislation, and it is silly to demand of believers
that they leave God out of their hearts and minds when acting as citizens or
officeholders.  Indeed, in a nation founded on the proposition that "all
men are... endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,"
the faithful need make no apology for participating in politics.  <p>
	By the same token, however, when people of faith enter the public arena, they
have a responsibility to respect the institutions that secure their own freedom
as citizens and believers.  In particular, they have an obligation to respect
property rights.<p>
	Private property is the institutional foundation of civil and religious
liberty.  If your home is your castle, then your home can also be your
sanctuary (or your political meeting hall).  Where property rights to land and
other assets are protected, believers can build churches, endow seminaries,
establish religious schools -- and nobody else may lawfully interfere.<p>
	In contrast, where property rights are insecure or nonexistent, the exercise
of religion is hostage to the whims of politicians, bureaucrats, or mobs.  As
the history of the former Soviet Union makes clear, when government owns the
printing presses, paper mills, and book stores, just obtaining a Bible can 
be difficult and dangerous.<p>
	What prompts these reflections are efforts by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
and a group called the Evangelical Environmental Network to mount a theological
defense of the Endangered Species Act.  Recalling that Noah was commanded to
save every kind of living creature, Babbitt claims the ESA serves a divine
purpose: "to protect the whole of creation."  Babbitt suggests that
only a complete philistine, blind to the reflections of divinity in the works
of nature, could possibly oppose the ESA.<p>
	What such sermonizing overlooks is that the ESA is unjust and inhumane.  The
ESA empowers bureaucrats to regulate, and thus effectively "take,"
private property deemed to be endangered species habitat.  Under the ESA,
federal agents can prohibit you from farming, building a home, or even clearing
fire breaks on your own land; fine you up to $100,000 and/or put you in jail
for engaging in the aforesaid activities; and pay you no compensation for the
lost value of your land.  This violates the Bill of Rights ("nor shall
private property be taken for public use without just compensation")
<i>and</i> the Ten Commandments ("Thou Shalt Not Steal").<p>
		God in His infinite goodness can bring good even out of evil, said St.
Augustine; but when mere mortals use bad means, they usually get bad results.
By turning wildlife assets into economic liabilities, the ESA encourages
landowners to destroy habitat, even to "shoot, shovel, and shut up."
The ESA harms the very species it is supposed to protect.  <p>
	Babbitt cites Noah as his inspiration, but Noah was no bureaucrat.  Noah did
not seize anyone's property to build the ark, nor did he tax anyone to
finance the operation.  The supreme irony is that if Noah were alive today, he
would be put in jail under the ESA for capturing and transporting endangered
species without government permission. 	<p>
	Religious fervor is no excuse for forgetting the Golden Rule of democratic
politics:  As you would have your rights be respected, so respect those of
others.  Wittingly or otherwise, ESA apologists presume that their secular or
religious concerns trump the equal rights of other citizens.  Such presumption
is the opposite of the respect required to maintain civil and religious
liberty.  Invoking the Bible to defend an unjust and inhumane law should be
seen for what it is -- a pious fraud.

The environmentalist assault on chlorine has taken a recent turn.  Organochlorines, we are now told, not only cause cancer, they are capable of altering human and animal sexuality as well.   For instance, environmentalists blame organochlorines such as dioxin for altering the sexual characteristics of fish.  Other compounds are blamed for (no joke) creating lesbian sea gulls, and shrinking alligators' penises.
<P>
	Perhaps the most potent weapon in the anti-chlorine activists' arsenal has been the charge of falling sperm counts.  The alarm over chemically-induced male infertility was prompted by a 1992 study from Copenhagen that claimed to show that sperm concentration per unit volume had fallen by over 40 per cent from 1940 to 1990.  A year later, one of the authors of the study, Niels Skakkebaek, penned a follow-up piece with Richard Sharpe of the British Medical Research Council Reproductive Biology Unit in Edinburgh, Scotland, in the journal <I>Lancet</I>.  The duo speculated that fetal exposure to synthetic estrogens may be the prime suspect in the sperm count crisis.
<P>
	Unsurprisingly, the <I>Lancet</I> article prompted a barrage of alarmist media reports. The BBC aired a documentary entitled "The Assault on the Male;" here in the U.S., Connie Chung devoted an installment of her now-defunct investigative show, "Eye to Eye," to the plight of infertile men under chemical siege. As scientists have noted, however, the original study -- a  meta-analysis  of 61 studies on falling sperm counts -- suffered from numerous statistical and methodological shortcomings. 
<P>
	First, the Danish researchers included studies irrespective of their sample size, many of which were so small that they would not normally be considered admissible evidence. In an editorial for the <I>British Medical Journal</I>, Stephen Farrow of Middlesex University's Health Research Center noted that one study was of seven men; 11 others were of fewer than 20 men; and another 29 were of fewer than 50 men. These were  given greater weight than they deserved,  Farrow wrote, through the misapplication of statistical tests. 
<P>
	After investigating the Skakkebaek data, a different team of researchers showed that nearly all of the alleged decreases could be explained by the changing definition of a normal sperm count over the past 50 years.  They concluded in a study also published by the <I>BMJ</I> that "The original evidence does not support the hypothesis that the sperm count declined significantly between 1940 and 1990."
<P>
	Furthermore, critics who reanalyzed the data have challenged the timing of the decline reported.  As reproductive specialists Anna Brake and Walter Krause of Philipps University in Marburg, Germany explained in a letter to the <I>BMJ</I>, 48 of the studies used in the meta-analysis were published since 1970 -- accounting for 88 percent of the men studied. These studies actually showed a slight <I>increase</I> in sperm counts. Krause and Brake concluded that "care should be taken when discussing a causal relation with environmental factors."
<P>
	The plea for caution fell upon deaf ears at Greenpeace headquarters.  Seizing on the Skakkebaek findings, the environmental group launched a new advertising campaign that publicized the alleged environmental threat to mans virility.  "Youre not half the man your father was," the ads taunted.   
<P>
	The Skakkebaek findings have also been touted by the authors of <I>Our Stolen Future</I>, the self-described "sequel" to Rachel Carson's <I>Silent Spring</I>.  This book warns of "reports that human sperm counts have plummeted over the past half century, a blink of the eye in the history of the human species."  Researchers that are skeptical of the sperm count decline are compared to those who challenged the initial scientific findings linking chloro-flourocarbons to depletion of the ozone layer.
<P>
	Skepticim is warranted, Greenpeace and <I>Our Stolen Future</I> notwithstanding.  Responsible scientists have assailed environmentalists for exploiting the data.  As one set of outraged researchers argued, "there is no conclusive evidence" for blaming exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the environment for falling sperm counts or shrinking penises. The hypothesis "is based on evidence too limited to allow firm conclusions to be drawn.  It is premature to call for a ban on these or any other chemicals before more research is done.  They are misrepresenting this research.  They are taking something which is a clearly stated hypothetical link and calling it fact." The identity of these critics?  None other than Neils Skakkebaek and Richard Sharpe, whose research prompted the sperm scare in the first place.
<P>
	There is certainly evidence that some chemical compounds -- both natural and manmade -- are capable of impacting human and animal reproductive systems.  In theory, this could impact human fertility.  To date, however, the scientific evidence does not support such a claim.  The charge that synthetic compounds are sterilizing men, like so many of the charges leveled by environmental activists over the years, simply does not hold up to scrutiny.

<H1>Medicare Monet</H1>

<P>The early versions of Medicare reform plans by House and Senate Republicans
this September bore the imprint of political tacticians rather than policy
revolutionaries.  In the name of &#147;preserving, protecting, and
strengthening Medicare,&#148; congressional leaders were primarily scrambling
to maintain political momentum.  <p>
	In the short run, the focus on properly framing the message, effectively
communicating it, and outmaneuvering statist quo opponents earned high marks.
In the long run, Medicare as we knew it was already dead.  This year&#146;s
proposed life-support surgery, however, sidesteps more direct routes to
reducing the total fiscal and political cost of Medicare&#146;s final funeral.
The political operation might be a success, but the health status of the
patient (Medicare) remains terminal.   <p>
	At the beginning of this year, the &#147;policy&#148; case for radically
overhauling Medicare was overwhelming.  The entitlement program was fiscally
unsustainable on a long-range basis and suffered from an antiquated structure.
Most of all, any credible effort to restrain federal outlays and eventually
achieve a balanced budget required a slowdown of projected Medicare spending
growth.  <p>
	The &#147;political&#148; case for radical reform, however, was more
uncharted.  Republican candidates had said little or nothing about Medicare
overhaul during the 1994 campaign, but the arithmetic of 1995 budgetary
politics insisted upon it.  Congressional Republicans could not afford to end
the year without being able to claim some kind of &#147;victory&#148; on the
budgetary front.  To maintain their political momentum, they first had to come
to terms with Medicare.<p>
	House Republican leaders in particular decided to make a virtue of necessity
by focusing on the Medicare program&#146;s own solvency problems.  They
brilliantly convinced the American public that there was a Medicare fiscal
crisis requiring immediate attention.  By early September, congressional
Republicans had won the broad political debate that Medicare needed to be
&#147;saved.&#148;  With congressional Democrats remaining in deep denial, the
only reform plans in play were the ones offered by House Republicans and Senate
Republicans.  <p>
	Both the House and Senate plans chipped away at the traditional structure of
the Medicare program.  Their key reforms included provisions whereby
beneficiaries could opt out of the traditional Medicare program and purchase a
wide variety of private sector health care plans.  By breaking up
&#147;old&#148; Medicare&#146;s tight control of permissible benefits packages,
fee schedules, cost-sharing structures, and health care delivery systems, the
proposed reforms opened up greater competitive pressure to meet the true
preferences of the elderly.  The trade-off for this greater flexibility and
choice was the recognition that Medicare would become a &#147;capped&#148;
entitlement that had to live within explicit (but still generous) budget
limits.<p>
	The House and Senate plans also hoped to establish several key precedents that
might lead to more far-reaching reforms in the future.  The proposals
introduced limited versions of vouchers, cash rebates, and means testing.  They
allowed beneficiaries to voluntarily bypass price controls on health care
providers and helped begin Medicare&#146;s transition from a largely open-ended, defined benefit program
to a more controllable, defined contribution program.  They also would start to
erode the &#147;universal&#148; nature of Medicare, by permitting beneficiaries
to customize their benefits and recognizing that everyone over age 65 is not
entitled to the same level of taxpayer-financed subsidies.<p>
	The Senate plan was surprisingly bolder than the House version in seeking more
fundamental changes.  Senate Republicans proposed more extensive cash rebates
(75 percent of all savings) to beneficiaries who chose private health plan
alternatives that were less expensive than the budgeted allocation for
quasi-voucher payments.  House Republicans timidly limited the maximum rebate
to the annual charge for Medicare Part B premiums.  Senate Republicans made a
modest attempt at raising Part B deductibles.  House Republicans ducked the
entire issue for political reasons.  Senate Republicans also made a down
payment on long-term Medicare reform by phasing in hikes in the future
eligibility age for Medicare to age 67.  <p>
	Many details of the proposed reforms, however, remain problematic.  Both plans
continue to rely predominantly on top-down budgetary controls that will
discourage any net budget savings below the predetermined baselines.  Minimum
floors on benefit offerings set in both plans will tend to encourage upward
quality competition, rather than downward price competition.  When you blow
away the rhetorical smoke, both plans made their budget cuts the old-fashioned
way &#151; they disguised them and would let private sector providers take the
blame for delivering bad news.  <p>
	The largest &#147;savings&#148; came from that old standby &#151; reduced
payments to health care vendors.  The dubious premise was that beneficiaries
would be unaware of the effect of those cuts on the size and scope of benefits
they ultimately received.  The bulk of the remaining savings came from a modest
increase in Medicare Part B premiums &#151; essentially a tax increase posing
as higher user charges &#151; that would offset only part of the
taxpayer-financed subsidies for a government-administered service.  The
plans&#146; look-back sequester mechanism, aimed at ensuring fiscal savings in
budget &#147;out years,&#148; was a formulaic, expedient placeholder that
sidestepped tougher decisions.  Even if future political pressure did not
prevent the look-back triggers from being pulled, the fail-safe reliance on
relatively crude price controls for a number of health care sectors would
create new rounds of arbitrary and clumsy distortions in medical decision
making.  <p>
	Meanwhile, serious efforts to directly confront Medicare beneficiaries with
more substantial cost sharing were abandoned.  The limited means testing in
both plans was largely symbolic, set at too high a level, and mistakenly
imposed on premium subsidies instead of benefits.  <p>
	Both reform plans refused to challenge and, indeed, reinforced fundamental
elements of Medicare lore.  By vowing to &#147;save&#148; the Hospital
Insurance Trust Fund, they perpetuated the myths that such a trust fund holds
real assets and that beneficiaries &#147;earn&#148; their benefits through
previous payroll tax payments during their working years.  Anyone who reached
the age of 65 next year, for that reason alone, would continue to have a large
part of their health care bills paid with <i>other people&#146;s money</i>.
The limited objectives of congressional Republicans would still perpetuate the
Medicare entitlement as an intergenerational, tax and spend, redistribution
scheme, in a somewhat more efficient manner with increased autonomy for private
sector subcontractors.  <p>
	The voluntary options available under both plans would leave Medicare in an
unstable environment.  Frequent mismatches between an individual
beneficiary&#146;s voucher payment and prospective estimates of his health care
claims are likely.  The transition will be complex and unwieldy in moving from
a community-rated, defined benefit structure for everyone age 65 and over to a
system based on defined contribution payments that are selected voluntarily in
an individual-based health insurance market.<p>
	Consider the shortcomings of existing risk adjustment methodology, the
rigidities of bureaucratic pricing, and strong incentives for healthier
beneficiaries to game the system and race to the front of the line exiting the
traditional Medicare program.  Opportunistic behavior could result in
overcompensation of lower-cost beneficiaries, strained resources for
higher-risk beneficiaries, and dilution of overall budget savings.  The House
and Senate plans stopped short of proposing more aggressive remedies to this
problem and punted the issue of risk adjustment to a study commission.  <p>
	The future scenario for Medicare&#146;s post-reform environment could well
come down to a race among several offsetting trends.  Congressional Republican
leaders are hoping that large numbers of beneficiaries exit the traditional
Medicare program and find more efficient, lower-cost private health plan
alternatives.  At the same time, this exodus must be balanced across risk
categories so that traditional Medicare&#146;s expenses don&#146;t begin to
outrun its remaining revenue base.  If a disproportionate share of high-cost
beneficiaries are reluctant to leave &#147;old&#148; Medicare, the budget
squeeze on the traditional program will grow too tight and require tough
look-back sequesters that could set off a destructive chain reaction.  Deeper
budget cuts would drive more providers out of the fee-for-service structure and
impair its remaining standard of health care.  Current overpromises to
beneficiaries that they can stay in traditional Medicare at no risk to their
health care expectations could come back to haunt congressional Republicans.
If most beneficiaries don&#146;t leave medicare fee-for-service fairly quickly,
a hybrid health care system for the elderly will be tied up in contradictions.
The necessary political groundwork has not been built for voluntarily
unraveling a highly subsidized entitlement that is based on unrealistic popular
assumptions.   <p>
	The two reform plans are betting the political ranch on private sector
efficiencies in restructuring health care services for the elderly.  This also
means that political frustrations will soon be concentrated on the significant
deficiencies that remain in the current version of private health insurance.
Expect greater political tension ahead over consumers&#146; growing
frustrations with the hidden rationing of managed care plans, particularly by
older Americans accustomed to paying only a fraction of the market price of
less-restricted, fee-for-service medicine.  <p>
	The wild card for Republican reformers remains widespread utilization of the
medical savings account (MSA) option.  Although MSA alternatives could be
designed better in both plans, their advocates contend that MSAs will drive
senior citizens&#146; health care utilization and aggregate costs substantially
downward.  Thus far, that remains a hope rather than a probability.  <p>
	More aggressive measures were left out of the congressional reform mix.  They
include:<p>
 <UL>

<LI>Substantially higher, income-based deductibles; <p>

<LI>Pure voucher payments made directly to beneficiaries, with minimal
restrictions on benefit configurations; <p>

<LI>Lower capitated voucher amounts, combined with supplemental financial
assistance to the high-risk poor; <p>
<LI>Integrating Medicare Part A and Part B into a single program; and<p>
<LI>Eliminating Part B premiums in exchange for higher deductibles.<p>

</UL>
The current round of proposed reforms buy a little fiscal time before the
demographic explosion a little more than a decade away.  They represent a mere
down payment on Medicare&#146;s long-term unfunded liabilities.  The plans will
strip away the first layer of accumulated stupidity in a
bureaucratically-guided entitlement program.  They need to dig much deeper in
order to move beyond one-time savings.  But that&#146;s policy, and the
immediate fight ahead is much more about politics.  For now, let&#146;s call
the effort &#147;close enough for government work.&#148;  A political coup?
Apparently.  A policy revolution?  As if. <p>

<H1>Free Microsoft
</H1>
by Clyde Wayne Crews, Jr.

<BR>
<p>
	Big ol&#146; Microsoft evokes strong emotions these days.  But even hating
Microsoft does not justify calling upon government to restrain it, as many
competitors and others are urging the U.S. Justice Department to do.  Hobbling
Microsoft will also hobble computer users.  Indeed, more than anything, the
Microsoft saga helps demonstrate how the real function of antitrust law is not
to help consumers, but to benefit competitors.<p>
	Earlier this year, the federal government secured a consent decree regarding
Microsoft&#146;s licensing of its DOS and Windows operating systems.  Under the
agreement Microsoft will no longer earn royalties from manufacturers on a
per-processor basis for each computer shipped.  Competitors argued that the old
arrangement precluded shipment of alternative operating systems, such as
IBM&#146;s OS/2, because manufacturers had to pay Microsoft for each machine,
regardless of whether it featured Windows.  Yet the per-processor royalties
simply amounted to a volume discount to computer manufacturers that helped
computers proliferate.  Ending it will hurt consumers.<p>
	The Justice Department also pressured Microsoft to forego a merger with
Intuit, the maker of the popular financial software Quicken and, more recently,
caused the entire computer industry to hold its breath wondering whether
Microsoft would be prevented from offering Internet access services as part of
Windows 95.  While the offering was not halted, the Department has yet to
assure Microsoft that the ordeal is over.<p>
	Preventing Microsoft from offering online access service would have hurt
consumers even more.  Consider: tens of millions of people use Windows 3.1, but
only 4.7 million subscribe to existing Internet access services like America
Online and CompuServe, a surprisingly low number.  <p>
	By easing Internet access for those familiar with Windows, Microsoft may
introduce the Internet to millions.  That&#146;s an argument in favor of the
company&#146;s moving ahead.  In fact, while the phrase has become too much of
a cliche, Microsoft in particular is helping provide perhaps the largest
&#147;on-ramp to the information superhighway,&#148; precisely what many &#151;
including the administration now targeting the company &#151; have been calling
for.<p>
	Real monopolies, unlike Microsoft, are created and sustained by governmental
barriers to entry, like licensing and the barring of competitors.  Examples are
the Postal Service and the tight monopoly that lawyers hold over even routine
services such as wills, bankruptcies, and divorces.  Where there&#146;s
monopoly, there are no alternatives.<p>
	Yet rival operating systems include Apple&#146;s OS, IBM&#146;s OS/2, and
others.  Users may switch to these competitors anytime.  Big businesses
especially, who would have the most to gain by switching to a more efficient
operating system, could lead the way if the gains were actually there.<p>
	One notable effort to shake Microsoft&#146;s dominance is that of Apple, IBM,
and Motorola, who&#146;ve joined forces to create a common hardware platform to
support a processor called the PowerPC.  PowerPCs would compete with the
Pentium &#147;brain&#148; that underlies Windows.<p>

<p>
	Why should Microsoft worry?  Future PowerPC-based machines will run software
developed for many different operating systems &#151; meaning using Windows
will not preclude using its competitors.  If any competing offering is
superior, it&#146;ll be a simple matter to shift environments, on the same
computer.<p>
	This, not running to Washington, is the proper way to compete with Microsoft.
<p>
	There are still more competitive threats, even if the Justice Department
leaves Microsoft well enough alone.  Some argue that desktop operating systems
themselves will be overshadowed by network-based operating systems to be had at
the press of a few buttons.  Instead of relying upon machine-based operating
systems and applications software, Internet-based versions will spread.<p>
	Such innovations put Microsoft&#146;s purported dominance in a new, more
vulnerable, perspective.  Early choice of the Windows standard can&#146;t suck
users in if it is inefficient.  Should Windows remain the &#147;standard,&#148;
it will do so because customers like it, not because there aren&#146;t
alternatives.  In this light, antitrust action appears either naive on the part
of enforcers, or worse, a blatant attempt by competitors to capture Microsoft
customers.<p>
	Microsoft phobia is one symptom of a broader effort by trustbusters to target
what they consider to be inefficiencies in networks (such as telephone
networks).  Generally, a &#147;network&#148; is any system in which benefits
increase with membership.  According to the theory, the market fails if people
join an inferior network simply because others did earlier.  While the
theoretical questions are amusing, they have no real world significance as
competitive threats to Microsoft illustrate.  Inefficiencies create profit
opportunities.<p>
	Like all central planners, enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal
Trade Commission regard their ideas as superior to an evolving marketplace,
superior enough to warrant imposing by law.  Before others are harassed like
Microsoft, Congress should conduct hearings designed to reexamine antitrust,
with a critical eye toward the notion that it benefits consumers.<p>

Even as they fought the Clinton health care plan, many Republicans signed
on to warm and fuzzy incremental insurance reform bills to show they were
in favor of "something."  In late January, President Clinton raised
the ante.  He challenged Congress to pass one of those measures, the
Kassebaum-Kennedy "Health Insurance Reform Act" (S. 1028).  If
congressional Republicans bite, Clinton will yell "Gotcha" and
America will once again be on the road to Clintoncare.<p>
	The proposed Senate legislation aims at making it easier for people to renew
or acquire health insurance coverage regardless of their health status,
particularly when they change or lose their jobs.  S. 1028 applies new
portability rules to all employment-based health plans and prohibits these
plans from limiting or denying coverage for more than 12 months for most
"preexisting" medical conditions.<p>
	Kassebaum-Kennedy also prohibits insurers and other health coverage issuers
from denying, based on health status, whole group coverage to employers with
two or more employees, and prevents employment-based health benefits plans from
excluding any employee from coverage through requirements based on
health-related factors.  In addition, the legislation generally provides
"guaranteed renewability" of health plan coverage to employer groups
and individuals, at the option of the insured, and guarantees
"group-to-individual portability" for individuals who leave group
insurance plans and lack access to other group insurance coverage.<p>
	Although the bill's goals seem compassionate and caring, S. 1028
misdiagnoses the problem.  Its remedial efforts will achieve little measurable
progress in expanding total levels of health insurance coverage and may
actually do some harm.  More dangerously, the bill would restore momentum for
surrendering the principles of individual choice, personal responsibility, and
risk-based pricing in favor of government-controlled health care markets.<p>
	The purpose of preexisting condition limits and exclusions in health insurance
policies is frequently misunderstood.  By providing partial coverage of persons
with preexisting conditions, the contractual clauses actually expand the
insurance market.  They offer some protection to persons who would be wholly
uninsurable unless some limits and conditions were attached to their coverage.
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill's permissible time period for preexisting
condition limits effectively eliminates their application to medical conditions
that will either not require immediate treatment or can be treated initially by
out-of-pocket payments until new insurance coverage is obtained.  New
restrictions on preexisting condition exclusions will also undercut the
incentive to prevent and avoid dangerous conditions in the first place.<p>
	If insurers are prevented explicitly from adjusting their premiums and
restricting their coverage to reflect the fact that different people have
different risks, they will resort to more indirect and less efficient means to
match the value of health insurance to the amount for which people will
voluntarily pay.  Insurers may devote more resources to pinpointing particular
high-risk individuals, industries, and small employer groups.  They then may
discourage such high-risk customers from seeking their coverage.  Techniques
will include more creative use of "objective" variables as health
status surrogates, selective marketing, geographic targeting, service-based
cues to customers, and so on.  <p>
	Employers also will respond to politically directed changes in the composition
of their risk pools.  On the margin, they may reduce or limit the number of
their employees; use more independent contractors; invest in more labor-saving
alternatives; relocate operations away from higher risk areas; or cut back the
scope of their group insurance coverage.<p>
	All of the above countermeasures will be set in motion by the political
impulse to "solve" a vastly overstated and mischaracterized problem.
Insurance coverage denials for medical reasons account for only a small portion
of uninsured individuals under age 65.  The much ballyhooed problem of
"job lock" is hard to prove and is not a significant impediment to
labor mobility.  The presence of more uninsured people does not lead to more
successful cost shifting and higher health care prices.  Nor do firms that do
not provide insurance succeed in shifting labor costs to other insured
businesses.  <p>
	Advocates of S. 1028 overlook the real factors that reduce the availability
and raise the cost of private health insurance coverage.  They include the
effect of poor health on earnings and labor supply, the rate of labor force
turnover in the small group market, the relative elasticity of small employer
demand for group health insurance, the higher-than-average risks of people who
switch health insurance policies, the effects of state mandated benefits, and
the inflationary effect of increased levels of insurance coverage.<p>
	Incremental insurance reforms such as guaranteed renewability, guaranteed
issue, and portability share several basic characteristics.  They restrict the
choices of most currently insured people and raise the cost of their insurance
policies, in exchange for subsidizing insurance coverage for a smaller group of
people with greater risks and higher likely health care costs.  The proposed
reforms force healthy people to subsidize sick people, regardless of income,
and undermine incentives to take personal responsibility for one's future
health care needs.<p>
	In a market where the purchase of health insurance is voluntary, raising the
cost of insurance will raise the number of uninsured people.  Estimates vary as
to the magnitude of this effect, depending upon how extensive the cost-raising
regulations are and who is affected by them.  A mid-range estimate of the
elasticity of demand for health insurance is probably -0.6.  That means that a
10 percent increase in the price of insurance may increase the number of
uninsured by about 6 percent.<p>
	Efforts to spread the cost of cross subsidies for a targeted population across
a wider base of insurance buyers is the public choice formula for politically
driven cost shifting (i.e., concentrated benefits, diffuse costs).  However, in
the group health insurance market segment where coverage levels are the most
disappointing -- small groups of 50 or fewer employers -- current
purchasers are very cost sensitive.  For them, relatively small changes in the
cost of health insurance create significant cutbacks in coverage.  The large
majority of the working uninsured, who pass up coverage not because of poor
health status but because it costs too much, place a low value on health
insurance relative to other forms of compensation.  <p>
	A voluntary insurance market can afford only a limited degree of premium cross
subsidies before the number of low-risk groups and individuals dropping
coverage exceeds the total of high-risk groups and individuals gaining access
to underpriced insurance.  At that point, one reaches a political no-man's
land in which the next logical step down the tunnel of cost shifting appears to
be mandatory universal coverage.  If the healthy are going to subsidize the
sick, it becomes imperative to round up as many overpaying conscripts as
possible.  <p>
	Therefore, S. 1028's guaranteed issue, renewability, and portability will
inevitably lead to tighter health insurance regulation on the federal level.
Renewal or issuance of insurance policies cannot be guaranteed without
involving the government in setting rating band limits on insurance policy
prices.  After all, in what sense can the availability  of an insurance policy
be considered guaranteed if it becomes too expensive for some policyholders to
buy or renew?  <p>
	Guaranteed issue, renewability, and portability also will increase pressure
for a policy of mandatory, standardized health benefits.  Variations and
changes in an insurer's package of health benefits can complicate those
mandated guarantees, because quality variation in health plans can be an
indirect means to exclude higher cost customers.  Addressing comparability
measures and integration rules for the varied quality and medical practice
style of health plans that mobile workers choose also will be difficult.  <p>
	Thus, despite its purportedly modest goals, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill's
efforts to remove health status considerations from the pricing and scope of
private insurance coverage leads down a one-way street where the ultimate
destination is the same one that Americans rejected in 1994: mandatory purchase
of standardized coverage, where the only cost constraints are imposed through
price controls and bureaucratic rationing.  <p>
	Advocates of Kassebaum-Kennedy deny the bill will raise insurance premiums
very much, if at all.  However, if providing guarantees of continued insurance
coverage is so inexpensive, why don't more people voluntarily buy such
protection on their own?  On the other hand, if individuals do find that the
cost of those insurance guarantees is more than they can (or are willing to)
pay, it's time to reexamine the cost estimates and search for different
answers to continuity of coverage issues.<p>
	S. 1028 takes a large step toward mandating that insurance companies offer
only multi-year policies at a fixed premium.  It assumes that voluntary market
arrangements have failed to meet the demands of consumers to provide products
that protect them from the consequences of health risk redefinition on an
annual basis.  Actually, the lack of more effective protection for individuals
against the risks of changing health status reflects the barriers of tax policy
and state restrictions on voluntary health plan purchasing coalitions, plus
variations in job status, income level, and risk preference.<p>
	Individuals who receive group health insurance through their employer enjoy
favorable tax treatment of employer-paid premiums.  If they work for a large
company, they also are likely to gain several additional advantages
(community-rated premiums, purchasing clout, lower administrative and
regulatory costs per worker.<p>
	On the other hand, employer-paid insurance policies are likely to provide few,
if any, continuing benefits for workers once they change or lose their jobs.
Employers sponsoring insurance plans are also less likely than their individual
employees to resist insurance policy exclusions for potentially costly
preexisting conditions.  <p>
	Theoretically, individuals who prefer other health insurance options and want
long-term protection against changes in their health status can purchase the
appropriate insurance policies on their own.  However, tax benefits are very
limited for individual health care buyers, and such policies cost more for
insurers to underwrite, market, and administer.  Given those costs, many
consumers are simply not willing to pay for multiperiod insurance contracts on
their own.  <p>
	Moreover, consumers may not want to be locked into one insurer for a long
period of time when health plan choices have significant, ongoing service
consequences (e.g., claims administration, provider networks, contract
interpretation).  Some consumers also need the contractual flexibility to
change insurers in the event that they later obtain a job offering better,
employer-paid insurance coverage.  Finally, many consumers are unwilling to
risk redistributing their income (when younger and healthier) through premium
subsidies to others in a voluntary pool, when they can instead be "picked
off" as good risks by other insurers and pay lower premiums.  <p>
	Kassebaum-Kennedy can round up support from consumers who do not want to pay
an actuarially fair price for health insurance, but prefer to have healthy
people subsidize their higher costs.  What can market-based alternatives offer
to other individuals who would try to pay their own way if less expensive
alternatives were available?<p>
	A short list of structural remedies would include (1) tax neutrality for all
health insurance purchases; (2) preservation of risk-based pricing; (3)
targeted income-based subsidies for the poor and those with medically
uninsurable risks; (4) legal reform that restores private insurers' rights
to enforce voluntary contracts regarding medical care choices and innovative
economizing options; (5) preemption or repeal of state mandated benefit laws;
and (6) encouragement of voluntary purchasing pools offering multiperiod,
experience-rated contracts.  (Kassebaum-Kennedy attempts to do the latter, but
undercuts the effort with rate restrictions.)<p>
	The most powerful solutions, of course, come down to fundamentals.  Ensuring
vigorous competition, unfettered consumer choice, and voluntary arrangements in
the insurance marketplace; empowering individuals to balance the risks,
rewards, and responsibilities of health care decisionmaking; and adopting
growth-oriented economic policies will do much more to expand insurance
coverage than incremental reform legislation that temporarily makes politicians
feel better but undermines its own official goals.  <p>

<H1>How's NAFTA Now?
</H1>

by <A HREF="sheehan.html">James M. Sheehan</a>

</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<p>
	It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that NAFTA has been a disappointment
for those who hoped the treaty would promote free enterprise and economic
liberty.  Despite all the promises, the treaty has failed to deliver a freer
market, liberalized trade, and reduced government interference in the private
economy.  Instead, NAFTA&#146;s first two years have been characterized by
hallmarks of excessive government: bailout guarantees, foreign aid giveaways,
and environmental controls.<p>
	To the mercantilists in Washington, D.C., lower tariffs are dangerous unless
accompanied by government intervention into private currency markets.  A NAFTA
side agreement created a $6 billion Federal Reserve bailout fund for the peso.
In the world of finance, a bailout guarantee results in &#147;moral
hazard,&#148; i.e., it encourages excessive risk-taking.  The NAFTA safety net
coaxed Americans into buying billions of dollars worth of high-risk Mexican
debt, while ensuring that Mexican leaders would not be held accountable if they
failed to make payments.  Mexico&#146;s spendthrift policies finally caused the
peso to crash, and when the dust settled, the bailout had grown to $50 billion.
Though NAFTA concealed Mexico&#146;s true financial condition, heightened
investment losses, and decimated U.S. exporters, White House flacks
remorselessly proclaim NAFTA&#146;s innocence.  If you believe them, you
probably think Mrs. Clinton just got lucky in the futures market.<p>
	CEI&#146;s 1993 monograph, <i>The Free Trade Case Against NAFTA</i>, warned
that the trade bloc would create several perverse incentives for governments to
devalue their currencies as a way to promote domestic industries.  Former CEI
policy analyst Matthew Hoffman deserves credit for noting that NAFTA&#146;s
Rules of Origin &#147;require invasive enforcement procedures . . . further
politicize trade, and destabilize international currency markets.&#148;  Over
the past year, the peso devaluation has given a boost to Mexican exports and
has generated a small trade surplus with the U.S.<p>
	NAFTA&#146;s hostility to the free market extends to its environmental
provisions, which imply that impoverished Mexico&#146;s lower environmental
standards are an unfair trading practice.  &#147;Fair&#148; trade can only be
guaranteed through raising Mexico&#146;s enforcement of EPA-style regulations
and standards.  To comply with NAFTA&#146;s upward harmonization provisions,
Mexico&#146;s laws are being patterned after U.S. laws in the areas of
transportation, forestry, fisheries, soil, and water standards.<p>
	The NAFTA environmental commission launched an investigation of a polluted
Mexican reservoir, where large numbers of migratory birds died from exposure to
raw sewage.  Environmentalist demands for increased public works spending to
protect the pretty birds are now bolstered by the findings of an international
investigation.  How quickly we bird-loving suburbanites forget that the Mexican
economy is in 1930s-style depression, that unemployment is nearly 40 percent,
and that most consumer debt is in default.  With Mexico City bankrupt, it is
likely that money for big government projects will have to be borrowed from
Uncle Sam, perhaps through NAFTA&#146;s North American Development Bank
recently funded by Congress.<p>
	As the average Mexican peasant witnessed his life&#146;s savings being wiped
out in the financial meltdown, NAFTA officials flew to the posh Caribbean
resort in Cancun to discuss how to enhance his quality of life.  Draft reports
of the Land Transportation Standards Subcommittee have been translated from
Spanish to English to French and back again.  Mexico&#146;s &#147;Emergency
Response Guidebook&#148; has been reviewed to ensure that it complies with
&#147;U.N. Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods.&#148;  The
NAFTA-crats appear to have settled on the all-important official definition of
a &#147;NAFTA truck.&#148;  A sigh of relief was heard throughout Chiapas.<p>
	NAFTA&#146;s commissions are working for peace of mind in this country as
well.  Through a continental environment workplan, the three governments are
developing plans to eradicate lead, cadmium, mercury, PCBs and other organic
chemicals and metals from the North American economy.  This is the agenda of
the U.N. Basel Convention, written into the NAFTA text, which forbids free
trade in materials declared &#147;hazardous&#148; by environmental bureaucrats.
Basel is the RCRA of international trade.  A jumble of NAFTA, Mexican, and
American border bureaucrats are preparing a &#147;five-year plan&#148; to
address water quality, air quality, and hazardous waste issues.  Don&#146;t
hold your breath expecting this plan to embody the principles of free market
environmentalism.<p>
	At an October conference in Oaxaca, Mexico, the NAFTA commission unveiled
joint harmonization initiatives on pollution prevention, energy efficiency,
climate change, and habitat protection.  NAFTA authorities intend to take a
complete inventory of all emissions in North America.  If you believe the
regulators mean no harm to private industry, you probably think Richard
Gephardt would make a good U.S. Trade Representative<p>
	Sadly, the public victory for the principle of free trade has resulted in
greater centralization of government power in North America.  Regulation,
bureaucracy and government intervention have distinguished the first two years
of NAFTA.  Free traders should think twice before endorsing another such
agreement.<p>

<H1>Rethinking Insurance Regulation</H1>
by D. Joseph Olson, Michigan state insurance commissioner
<P>
<I>On March 8, 1996, CEI held a conference on "Rethinking
Insurance Regulation." This article is adapted from the keynote speech.</i>
</CENTER>



<P>
<BR>
There is a common notion that insurance is somehow an exception to the
ordinary laws of economics.  Even among persons who would vehemently
assert that they support free markets, there is a tendency to make an exception with respect to insurance and to support government "solutions" to "problems" in the insurance market. <p>
	Since becoming Michigan's commissioner, I have done a lot of thinking
about insurance regulation.  Fortunately, I have not "grown" during
that process.  That is, I have not moved away from my long-standing commitment
to markets and toward a belief that "experts" can manage a better
outcome for both consumers and suppliers.<p>
	Instead, my thinking has been about the obstacles which confront a new
commissioner who has a free market orientation and who wants to challenge the
status quo approach to insurance regulation.  I have also done some thinking
about those who profess support for less regulation of insurance, thinking
which together with experience has increased my skepticism about the sincerity
of some of those supporters.  And perhaps most important, I have thought a lot
about what could be done to overcome those obstacles and about how to derive
some benefits even from fair-weather friends of the market.<p>
	What situation confronts a new insurance regulator in this country?  First is
the entrenched position of what might be called the regulatory community.  Many
of the employees of the insurance departments in the fifty states, as well as
most of the employees of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(NAIC), have held office for years, and they talk to each other.<p>
	It should surprise no one that the unstated consensus  among this group is
that extensive regulation of insurance is just, proper, and necessary.  I say
this not from the point of view of the cynic -- "After all, their jobs
depend upon regulation, so why wouldn't they be in favor?"  My
experience convinces me that their motivations are more complex and their
commitment to regulation is sincere.<p>

	Even though there may be some people who are supportive of less regulation and
who will assist in analysis and lobbying, you can be reasonably certain that a
large proportion of any insurance department staff will resist the elimination
or reduction of what they regard as necessary protection for consumers.  And
these people are the very ones upon whom the commissioner must rely to
discharge his statutory duties to enforce insurance laws as currently written.
This dependent relationship is likely to lead to a gradualist approach to
deregulation, with a commissioner's proposals often being a compromise
even before being sent to the legislature.  The final obstacle within this
regulatory environment is the press of day-to-day business.  Collectively,
commissioners face similar problems in their relationship with the NAIC staff.
<p>
The composition of the model laws and regulations which flow from the NAIC
should therefore not be surprising.  There are few, if any, proposals to reduce
the involvement of regulators in scrutinizing the rates and policy forms used
by insurers.  I cannot recall many proposals to reduce barriers to entry to
firms wishing to enter new markets.  <p>
	Typical justifications for regulation seem to be: control of monopoly power,
control of economic rents or "excessive profits," compensating for
externalities, inadequate information and excessive competition.  Among these
rationales, the only one which comes close to justifying insurance regulation,
at least with respect to most modern markets, is that of inadequate
information.<p>
	For a competitive market to function well, buyers must have sufficient
information to compare competing products.  In a well-functioning market, there
should be as much information available as consumers are willing to pay for in
order to lower the cost or improve the quality of their choices.  In some
markets the incentives to produce and disseminate information might  not be
sufficient, perhaps because those in the best position to produce it may not do
so or fear that disseminating it may not benefit them.  Or one of the parties
to the transaction may seek deliberately to mislead the other by conveying
false or incomplete information.<p>
	However, most insurance regulation seems to focus not on increased disclosure
and information, but rather on deciding in advance what choices consumers will
be allowed to make "in their own best interest," regardless of how
much information they have.  This approach suggests that the underlying reason
for much insurance regulation, in spite of the information rationale, is pure
paternalism.  Many adherents of the current regulatory approach seem to assume
that, even if consumers are provided with full information about their various
choices, they are incapable of dealing with that information and making the
"right" decision.<p>
	The natural result of such a regulatory community is an environment in which
the bias is toward regulation of markets, which are seen as so rife with
"failure" that government must intervene in most areas.  With these
obstacles, it is a wonder that any commissioner is ever successful in changing
anything -- except perhaps adopting more regulation.  Under these circumstances,
how can we possibly restore private markets?<p>
	Fortunately, that is not the primary responsibility of regulators, although
one might hope they would assist.  Those that do become involved need allies.
When one considers the amount of complaining by regulated entities about
excessive regulation, one might assume them to be logical allies.  To an
extent, they are.  I used to work for one, and we frequently took free market
positions which might not have been in our apparent short-term interest but
which we saw as valuable towards reaching our goal of a less regulated market.
My company consistently supported measures which would deregulate markets.
However, I must say that in my brief career as commissioner, I have observed a
resistance to deregulation on the part of many regulated entities.<p>
	Other possible allies include legislators dedicated to limited government and
free markets.  Unfortunately, I have found that many legislators who would
never support price controls in other areas, such as housing rents, do not
hesitate to vote in favor of price controls in the insurance field. There are,
of course, some legislators who are solidly in favor of free markets, but they
may not even be a majority of the Republicans in the state legislature.  <p>
	The free market regulator needs allies, as do similarly inclined legislators
and state government executives.  The need for such allies is the reason why I
have been so supportive of <A HREF="/errp.html">CEI's insurance reform project</A>.  The
intellectual support provided for market-oriented state regulators and
legislators from CEI is invaluable.  But most of the action remains at the
state level, and individual states have unique problems.  There exists in this
country an extensive network of state-based think tanks, all focusing upon
state-specific public policy issues and approaching them from a free market
point of view.  We need to develop cooperative relationships between such
state-based think tanks and CEI.  It seems a good fit.  CEI can use its
resources to look at broad economic themes in the area of insurance regulation,
and the state-based organizations can rely upon this body of work and fit it to
the specific local situations.<p>

	This research and analysis in the world of ideas is important because
politicians who impose regulations are followers, not leaders.  They respond to
the climate of opinion which dominates any particular era.  The single idea of
socialism which is most prevalent in those who think about insurance regulation
is the notion that, in light of scientific accomplishments in other fields,
surely society can be centrally planned and managed by a body of intelligent,
knowledgeable people.  Current ideas of regulation typically spring from the
belief that, in the words of Nobel laureate economist Friedrich Hayek,
"deliberate control of conscious organization is also in social affairs
always superior to the results of spontaneous processes which are not directed
by a human mind, or that any order based on a plan laid down beforehand must be
better than one formed by the balancing of opposing forces."  That
particular legacy of socialism must be discredited before we can achieve the
explicit goal of restoring private markets.<p>
	Ultimately, we can restore private markets in insurance and dispel the
prevailing myths about the institution only if we can win this war of ideas.
And there are massive resources arrayed against us, not only the government and
rent-seeking private forces I mentioned, but also academics and leftist think
tanks who view regulation more favorably than we.<P>

<H3>New Poll Boosts Institute Charges that ATF Fosters Public Ignorance</H3><P>

WASHINGTON, DC November 6, 1995&#151;CEI today releases a poll showing that over half
the American public does not know about the cardiovascular benefits of moderate
alcohol consumption.  The poll comes six months after CEI petitioned the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to lift its ban on mentioning this issue in
alcohol labelling and advertising.  ATF has taken no action on this petition.<p>
<p>
<b>CEI will hold a press conference Monday,  November 6, 10:30 AM at 1001
Connecticut Ave., NW (building entrance on K Street.)  Suite 1250. </b><p>
The connection between moderate alcohol consumption and reduced heart disease
risk is supported by a wide body of medical research, and has been noted in
publications ranging from the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> to
<i>Consumer Reports</i>.  According to the new poll, which involved telephone
interviews with 1,000 registered voters conducted in late October, only 41.7%
of adults know about this medical evidence.  Research indicates that the
benefits of moderate consumption can be obtained from all alcoholic
beverages&#151;wine, beer and spirits.  However, the poll found that only 9.7%
of the public knows this.  Of those polled who knew about the connection
between moderate alcohol consumption and reduced risk of heart disease, half
thought it applied only to wine or to red wine.<p>
<p>
On May 9, CEI petitioned ATF to permit alcohol beverage labels to carry this
statement: &#147;There is significant evidence that moderate consumption of
alcoholic beverages may reduce the risk of heart disease.&#148;  ATF has yet to
issue a response.<p>
<p>
CEI General Counsel <A HREF="sam.html">Sam Kazman</A> stated: &#147;This poll indicates that only one
in ten Americans knows the facts about moderate alcohol consumption.  ATF is
directly responsible for fostering this state of ignorance  with a policy that
flatly violates the First Amendment.&#148;<p>

Cover Story, January 1996 <a href="publist1.html#update"><i>UpDate</i></A>

</CENTER>
<P><BR>
<P>Since 1970, conservationists have painted a dismal picture of an increasing
struggle for survival of wildlife, with one species after another being pushed
to the brink of extinction.  There is no doubt that many animal species that
have disappeared or have been drastically reduced were at one time found in
truly enormous numbers.<p>
	The passenger pigeon, which was native to North America, was once probably the
most numerous species of bird on earth.  At its peak, its population may have
numbered around 3 billion.  Its migrating flocks darkened the skies over towns
and cities and sounded like an approaching tornado, yet they were extinct by
1914, mainly because of massive market-hunting.  A similar fate befell the
great auk, a large, flightless seabird that nested in vast numbers on islands
in the North Atlantic.  It was exterminated by whalers and fishermen who
slaughtered it for food, eggs, feathers, and oil.<p>
	Why are some species disappearing and others thriving?  First, we can examine
what is disappearing and what is not.  Why was the American buffalo nearly
exterminated but not the Hereford, the Angus, or the Jersey cow?  Why do cattle
and sheep ranchers over-graze the public lands but maintain lush pastures on
their own property?  Why are rare birds and mammals taken from the wild in a
manner that often harms them and depletes the population, but carefully raised
and nurtured in aviaries, game ranches, and hunting preserves?  <p>
	In all of these cases, it is clear that the problem of overexploitation or
overharvesting is a result of the resources being under public rather than
private ownership.  The difference in their management is a direct result of
two totally different forms of property rights and ownership:  public,
communal, or open-access common property vs. private property.  Wherever we
have public ownership we find overuse, waste, and extinction; but private
ownership results in sustained-yield use and preservation.<p>
  	It is important to recognize that this distinction between the destructive
overuse of open-access commons [common property hereafter] and careful
sustained-yield use of private property resources does not merely apply to a
comparison of wild with domesticated populations of plants and animals. Common
property problems involving wildlife have been especially prevalent in America,
and they continue to be extremely vexing precisely because of American wildlife
law.<p>
  	In Europe, native wildlife often belongs to private landowners or is managed
under a combination of private and public property.  Some European countries
have fewer problems of overexploitation of wildlife, regardless of population
pressures and economic and political systems.  In other words, we find
precisely what economic analysis has predicted about the treatment of common
property and private property wildlife resources.<p>
	An especially illustrative example of private property rights in wildlife
appears in the Montagnais Indians of Quebec and Labrador.  The Montagnais
dwelled in the forests of the Labrador Peninsula, hunting such furbearing
animals as caribou, deer, and beaver.  They treated wildlife as a common
property resource, with  everyone sharing in the bounty of the hunt.  Because
game was  plentiful and the Indian population was relatively low, the common
property resource system was able to work. <p>
	However, with the arrival of the French fur traders in the 1600s, the demand
for beaver began to rise rapidly. As the value of the furs rose, there was a
corresponding increase in beaver exploitation.  But unlike the buffalo,
virtually condemned to extinction as an unowned resource, the beaver were
protected by the evolution of private property rights among the hunters.  By
the early to mid 18th century, the transition to private hunting grounds was
almost complete and the Montagnais were managing the beaver on a
sustained-yield basis.<p>
	It was a highly sophisticated system.  The Montagnais blazed trees with their
family crests to delineate their hunting grounds, practiced retaliation against
poachers and trespassers, developed a seasonal allotment system, and marked
beaver houses.  Animal resources were husbanded.  Each year the family hunted
in a different quarter in rotation, leaving a tract in the center as a sort of
bank, not to be hunted over unless forced to do so by a shortage in the regular
tract.<p>
	This remarkably advanced system lasted for over a century and  certainly
served to prevent the extinction of the beaver. Unfortunately, more whites
entered the region and began to treat the beaver as a common resource, trapping
beavers themselves rather than trading with the Indians, and the beaver began
to disappear. Finally, the Indians were forced to abandon their private
property system and joined the whites in a rapid overexploitation of the
beaver. <p>
	Another example of how private ownership can successfully preserve wildlife is
found on game ranches, hunting preserves, safari parks, and animal and bird
farms.  Many of these private ventures, especially the game ranches, were
established to generate profits from private hunting.  Consequently, there has
been a tremendous outcry from environmentalists and conservationists because
the animals are raised for profit and some of them are killed.  Yet, if
emotional responses can be put aside, it seems clear that these game ranches
produce many positive results.  Many of the animals they stock are rapidly
disappearing in their native countries because of pressures resulting from a
rapidly expanding human population.  Indeed, some of the more spectacular and
most sought-after big-game mammals may now have healthier and more stable
populations on game ranches than in their native countries. <p>
	If the profits gained by giving hunters access to exotic game can provide the
economic incentive for landowners to manage the animals on a sustained-yield
basis, some species will be saved.  The same holds for the profits to be
derived from visitors to game parks and preserves.  In fact, the protection
provided at some of the parks, preserves, and gardens has actually produced a
glut of some animals.  There have been well-publicized efforts by some
preserves to return their surplus animals to Africa. Lions from America have
even been taken to Africa to appear in movies that were filmed there.  <p>
	Perhaps we should judge all of these activities by their achievements rather
than by their motives, for it may turn out that in the future the developing
countries will be restocked with their native fauna from specimens now thriving
on game ranches and preserves. <p>
	Such a success story has been the preservation of the Hawaiian goose, or nene.
Once they numbered over 25,000 in the wild, but under common property
management the population had plummeted to 20 to 30 birds by 1949. Fortunately,
they had been bred by aviculturists as early as 1824.  A Hawaiian rancher had
many on his farm, and there was a flock at the Wildfowl Trust at Slimbridge,
England.  Through the combined efforts of many interested parties, an intensive
captive breeding program was begun in the United States and Europe, and
thousands of young nenes were produced.  Beginning in the 1960s, they were
reintroduced to the wild in Hawaii, and by the mid 1970s there were as many as
600 in their native habitat.<p>
	The problems of environmental degradation, overexploitation of natural
resources, and depletion of wildlife all derive from their existence as common
property resources.  Wherever we find an approach to the extension of private
property rights in these areas, we find superior results.  Wherever we have
exclusive private ownership, whether it is organized around a profit-seeking or
nonprofit undertaking, there are incentives for the private owners to preserve
the resource.  Self-interest drives private property owners to careful
management and protection of their resource. <p>
	Asking people to revere resources and wildlife won&#146;t bring about the
peaceable kingdom when the only way a person can survive is to use up the
resource before someone else does.  Adopting a property system that directs and
channels man&#146;s innate self-interest into behavior that preserves natural
resources and wildlife will cause people to act as if they were motivated by a
new conservationist ethic.  If we are to resolve the tragedy of the commons and
preserve our natural resources and wildlife, we must create a new paradigm for
the environmental movement:  Private property rights in natural resources and
wildlife.<p>

<p>
CEI&#146;s <i>Death by Regulation</i> project is aimed at changing the policy
debate, not only through conventional policy analysis, but also by exploring
new means of bringing this message to a wider audience.  One approach is to
focus on previously unrecognized victims of regulatory failure, showing, for
example, that government regulation can in some cases be literally lethal.<p>
<p>
This focus is based, in part, on our recognition that past deregulatory efforts
have either been outright failures or, at best, only limited successes.
Traditional cost-benefit debates are often rigged contests, with market
advocates easily cast as the &#147;greedy&#148; defenders of
&#147;profits&#148; while regulators are the &#147;good guys&#148; who protect
us.  CEI&#146;s <i>Death by Regulation</i> work attempts an end-run around this
dilemma -- if the public can be persuaded that government intervention carries
its own deadly consequences, then the entire nature of this debate changes.<p>
<p>
The potential of the <i>Death by Regulation </i>project is best illustrated by
CEI&#146;s work on the CAFE issue.  The CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy)
program imposes the minimum fuel efficiency standards for each automaker&#146;s
sales of new cars in this country.  The CAFE program was established by
Congress in 1975 in response to the oil shocks of that period.    <p>
<p>
As oil prices subsequently began to fall in the mid-1980s, however, the public
started to seek larger, safer vehicles once again -- a shift in consumer demand
that ran headlong into CAFE&#146;s constraints.  America&#146;s competitive
advantage in the large-car production was undermined, destroying domestic jobs
and raising consumer prices.  <p>
<p>
CEI entered the CAFE debate in 1986, recognizing that economic arguments alone
were failing to win the policy debate.  CEI raised the CAFE-safety issue,
arguing that CAFE literally kills people by restricting the production of
larger, more crashworthy cars.  Recognizing the lack of formal academic
research on this, CEI persuaded Brookings economist Robert Crandall to
investigate the issue.  The result was a study, co-authored with Harvard Public
Health Professor John D. Graham, that appeared in the 1989 <i>Journal of Law
and Economics</i>.  Its conclusion:  CAFE causes 2,000 to 4,000 car occupant
deaths each year.  <p>
	<p>
CEI also engaged in coalition building, spurring other groups not only to look
at this issue, but to produce their own policy papers on CAFE.  And CEI also
filed a new type of court challenge to CAFE, challenging not its economic
rationality but its lethal effect.  Our first case, in 1986, pitted CEI against
environmental groups who were seeking to make CAFE <u>more</u> stringent.  We
did not win that case on the merits, but we did establish that CEI had judicial
standing to raise the issue.<p>
<p>
The breakthrough came in 1992, in our second court case.  In the first judicial
overturning of a CAFE standard in the program&#146;s history, a federal appeals
court harshly rejected the government&#146;s claim that CAFE kills no one.  It
found that the agency had reached this conclusion through a combination of
&#147;fudged analysis,&#148; &#147;statistical legerdemain,&#148; and
&#147;bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo.&#148;<p>
<p>
The agency at issue was NHTSA (the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration) whose main job is to promote traffic safety.  An agency whose
middle name is safety had been found to be concealing the fact that one of its
major programs kills people.  A key piece of evidence was the Harvard-Brookings
study that CEI had previously instigated.<p>
<p>
Most importantly, perhaps, the phenomenon of <i>Death by Regulation</i> was no
longer an academic hypothesis; it had been judicially confirmed.  <p>
<p>
The next chapter in the CAFE story is still being written.  CEI is back in
court, challenging NHTSA&#146;s refusal to follow the 1992 court decision.  A
ruling on our new case is imminent.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES PROGRAM</b><p>
<p>
Instead of relying on the political process to give sustained, long term
attention to environmental protection, CEI has developed and promoted an
alternative strategy called free market environmentalism.  CEI contends that
where individual property rights exist in environmental resources, the
environment is most likely to be protected.  After all, most of the
world&#146;s environmental problems exist in those areas where common ownership
of government management is the norm.  A free market environmental program
would allow individuals to advance environmental goals as effectively as free
markets permit individuals to advance economic goals.  The policies that flow
from this approach -- privatization, targeted liability rules, sound scientific
inquiry, reduced reliance on political regulation -- are very different from
those now being sought by environmental activists.  They are, however, far more
likely to prove effective.  <p>
<p>
CEI&#146;s Environmental Studies Program includes both an overall effort to
reframe the environmental debate and a series of targeted projects to reform
specific policies.  Only a comprehensive vision of market-oriented
environmental policies will engender the support needed to reform current
policies.  That framework must then be developed in detail for specific
environmental initiatives.<p>
<p>
As the leading proponent of free market environmentalism, the Competitive
Enterprise Institute continues to challenge the conventional wisdom of the
environmental movement and aggressively promotes free market environmentalism
as a more effective strategy for attaining our nation&#146;s environmental
goals.  CEI has fostered and coordinated the development of a network of public
policy organizations around the country and across the globe.  CEI has
positioned itself to take a stronger role in both domestic and international
debates over environmental policies in the 1990s.<p>
<p>
Specifically, CEI works on the vast array of particular environmental issues
including global warming, endangered species, private property rights,
hazardous waste, natural resources, clean air and water, agricultural policy,
oceans and fisheries, biotechnology, energy, trade and the environment,
recycling, pesticides, risk assessment, Superfund, and wetlands.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ECONOMIC STUDIES PROGRAM</b><p>
<p>
CEI&#146;s Economic Studies Program deals with many issues concerning the
over-regulation of financial instruments and insurance.  Particular emphasis is
placed on financial instruments used to minimize monetary risks, insurance
reform (which covers such issues as pension funds, social security, Medicare
and Medicaid) and deposit insurance reform.<p>
<p>
<i>Deriviatives, Financial Innovation, and Minimizing Risks in the Banking
System</i><p>
<p>
A story all too familiar to financial practitioners and entrepreneurs is what
Robert Merton calls &#147;the financial innovation spiral.&#148;  Regulatory
bureaucracies, hungry to increase their domains and budgets, keep a watchful
eye on financial innovation and capital markets activities.  When such
activities become &#147;too big&#148; and start growing &#147;too
rapidly,&#148; the busy beavers of Washington begin to build dams.  New
regulations are born.  New jobs for regulators are created.  Bureaucracies are
built up that plug the flows of commerce and capital.<p>
<p>
Entrepreneurship, however, is not typically foiled by regulation.  Indeed, the
<i>response</i> to the regulation of innovation usually is more
innovation&#151;the financial innovation spiral.   When financial
intermediaries are forced to innovate around regulation, further costs are
incurred.  Sometimes it is more efficient to comply with the regulations.  In
either case, unnecessary regulations on financial innovation place a burden on
the processes of capital formation, risk management, and financial
intermediation.<p>
<p>
	Corporations, moreover, face &#147;regulatory risk&#148;&#151;perhaps the one
risk in capital markets which cannot be hedged.  For those firms which must
comply with regulation instead of innovate around it, the risk is that
regulators do not have the requisite expertise to regulate.  As a result, firms
engaged in legitimate albeit complex financial strategies often are penalized
rather than rewarded in the regulatory process.  This problem is compounded by
a typically huge deficit of public education and information on the benefits of
financial innovation.<p>
<p>
	The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is dedicated to the advancement of
the principles of limited government and free markets.  The advancement of
those principles is perhaps nowhere more necessary than in the arena of
financial intermediation and innovation.  As the world&#146;s commodity and
asset markets have become more volatile, the use of financial contracts in
managing financial risks has become an integral part of every corporate
treasurer&#146;s job.  Because of financial innovations such as
&#147;derivatives&#148; contracts, risks can be managed at a low cost, capital
can be raised efficiently, credit risk can be diversified, and capital can flow
to its most highly valued uses.<p>
<p>
	A derivatives transaction is a bilateral contract which derives its value from
the value of an underlying asset, reference rate, or index.  Popular types
include futures, forwards, swaps, and options.  Over the last two years, more
than ten studies by regulators, congressional committees, and industry have
been completed, virtually all of which explain the numerous benefits of
derivatives.  Despite these benefits, several highly-publicized corporate and
municipal losses&#151;many of which were not <i>caused</i> by
derivatives&#151;have encouraged some members of Congress to ignore the
benefits of derivatives extolled in those studies and instead to focus on the
&#147;risks&#148; of derivatives.<p>
<p>
	The 1994 return of the U.S. Congress to Republican control, moreover, does not
offer much new hope on derivatives policy.  Several key Republican members of
Congress, including new House Banking Committee Chairman Leach, are indeed at
the forefront of the &#147;let&#146;s regulate derivatives&#148; wave.  The
regulatory agencies, in addition, have undertaken several drastic steps
designed to step up their regulation of derivatives.  The CFTC has been
particularly aggressive under the leadership of Mary Shapiro in both calling
into question the regulatory status of privately-negotiated derivatives and in
tightening the CFTC&#146;s grip on the regulated futures exchanges.  The
Federal Reserve Bank of New York also reached a recent agreement with Bankers
Trust which might be viewed as policy-making in disguise, as are the
enforcement actions of the CFTC and SEC against Bankers Trust regarding Gibson
Greetings.  The implications of those actions on the application of the
anti-fraud portions of the Commodity Exchange Act and for the legality of
products like equity swaps is not yet clear.<p>
<p>
	At first glance, the prospects for competition free from regulation in the
derivatives arena seem rather grim.  But then, that shouldn&#146;t surprise
us.<p>
<p>
	In his <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, Adam Smith reviewed 18th-century public
attitudes toward &#147;forestalling&#148; and &#147;engrossing.&#148;
Forestalling was an activity in which corn was purchased during times of plenty
in hopes it could be resold when prices rose.  Engrossing was a similar
activity in which corn was purchased in one city and transported to another,
hopefully to be sold at a profit greater than the transportation cost.<p>
<p>
	The anti-trade Corn Laws were intended in part to restrict forestalling and
engrossing.  Smith nonetheless noted the numerous economic benefits of those
activities and went so far as to call forestalling and engrossing a &#147;most
important operation of commerce.&#148;  He defended the activities and
noted&#151;more prophetically than he may have realized&#151;that &#147;[t]he
popular fear of engrossing and forestalling may be compared to the popular
terrors and suspicions of witchcraft.  The unfortunate wretches accused of this
latter crime were not more innocent of the misfortunes imputed to them, than
those who have been accused of the former.&#148;  <p>
<p>
Witch hunts closer to home have been frighteningly similar to that one in the
18th century.  Consider, for example, what happened when politicians sought in
the 1930s to blame financial activities and &#147;speculative excesses&#148;
for the Great Depression.  Legislation was enacted, for example, to eliminate
financial contracts called &#147;privileges.&#148;  Similar financial contracts
finally were allowed again in 1981, and this time they were called
&#147;options.&#148;  Options traded on organized financial exchanges now meet
rarely with the derision they once did.  The contemporary attacks focus instead
on the same contracts negotiated off the floor of organized exchanges, such as
interest rate options known as caps, collars, and floors, despite the
fundamental similarity of exchange-traded and off-exchange options contracts.<p>
<p>
Depression-era assaults on innovation also gave us the Glass-Steagall act as a
straightjacket for banks to wear.  And thus was born federal deposit insurance,
as well&#151;required to protect the banking system from the &#147;systemic
instability&#148; created by restrictions on bank portfolios and interstate
branching.  Capital formation was first regulated under the Securities Act and
the Securities and Exchange Act during this period.  <p>
<p>
The ratcheting-up of financial regulation, moreover, did not end with the
Depression.  The last fifty years have seen just as much, if not more, of the
financial innovation spiral.  Consider just a few more recent examples:<p>
<p>
 	the Eurodollar market owes much of its origin in the 1950s and 1960s to
Regulation Q, which placed a ceiling on interest rates;<p>
 	the Eurobond market was spawned by the 30% withholding tax on interest
payments on bonds sold in the U.S. to foreign investors;<p>
 	the explosion of issues in deep discount corporate bonds in the early 1980s
was due largely by an error made by the U.S. Treasury in interpreting the tax
treatment of discount securities&#151;the error actually allowed firms to make
money by issuing zero-coupon bonds and <i>giving</i> them away because of the
manner in which the Treasury allowed interest to be deducted; and<p>
 	the &#147;swap&#148; market is said to have developed in response to capital
controls in Europe in the early 1970s. <sup>1</sup><p>
<p>
History thus affirms how the financial innovation spiral plays out.  As
regulations have become more and more onerous, corporations and other
entrepreneurs have had little choice but to live with that regulation through
costly compliance or regulatory avoidance.  At the same time, capital market
participants have stepped up their efforts to innovate.  Financial innovation
allows capital market participants to exploit profit opportunities and manage
their business risks, but it also allows private parties to remain one step
ahead of the political dragon.<p>
<p>
The irony of the financial innovation spiral is that the more rapidly firms
innovate, the more rapidly the legislation and political dinosaurs which
regulate innovation become antiquated and increasingly incapable of addressing
innovation.  One need not look very far for evidence of this.  Consider, for
example, the problems of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) which was never
designed to address complex products such as structured (i.e., hybrid)
securities and swaps.  For that matter, consider the decades of case law
generated as courts try to interpret what Congress intended when it regulated
&#147;futures&#148; and &#147;forwards&#148; differently.  Or consider that
when bank examiners must assess capital adequacy of a swap dealer, they must
miraculously become students of such arcane sciences as stochastic calculus to
really judge the quality of a bank&#146;s risk management systems.<p>
<p>
In reality, regulators are slow to respond dynamically to innovation.  It
simply is far easier to change the regulations themselves.  These changes are
on rare occasions positive, such as the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission&#146;s exemption of swaps from the Commodity Exchange Act.  Usually,
however, new regulations compound existing problems by classifying financial
innovations in black and white terms.  Rather than expecting bank examiners
actually to learn the mathematical and financial modeling techniques required
to assess the internal risk management models employed by participants in
derivatives activity, new regulations are promulgated which force innovative
approaches into a box.  Examples are the early drafts of capital requirements
for interest rate risk proposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Reserve Board and
capital requirements for market risk proposed by the Bank for International
Settlements.  Both proposals mandated a &#147;model&#148; which all banks must
use to measure their interest rate risk.  Although the recent provision in the
proposed Bank for International Settlements capital requirements for market
risk represent an encouraging move toward greater reliance on internal models,
the underlying problem is still the inflexibility of bureaucracy and its
inability to expeditiously address the unpredictable dynamic of financial
innovations and market volatility.<p>
<p>
The ostensible justification usually advanced for financial regulations since
World War II is the &#147;market failure&#148; paradigm.  According to this
theory, markets often fail to perform their functions.  When a flaw&#151;real
or perceived&#151;in the market is found, government intervention is required
to &#147;fix&#148; the market&#146;s failure.  <p>
<p>
The work of no less than four Nobel prize winners in economics from The
University of Chicago&#151;George Stigler, Ronald Coase, Merton Miller, and
Gary Becker&#151;explodes the market failure paradigm.  The Nobelists point out
that market failure theory conveniently assumes government regulation to be
perfect and costless; &#147;government failure&#148; is assumed not to occur.
Yet, evidence does not support these assumptions.  Government can fail, too.
The &#147;Chicago approach&#148; demonstrates that sound economic policy can be
crafted only after comparing which failure is the most significant, the
market&#146;s or the government&#146;s.  <p>
<p>
Unfortunately, because the market failure paradigm ignores the possibility of
&#147;government failure,&#148; the problems which arise from regulatory and
political failures are insufficient by themselves to result in a roll-back of
the misguided regulations.  Instead, market failure proponents will point at
the new problems created by regulatory risk as further evidence of market
failure, and new legislation will again follow.<p>
<p>
Once this vicious circle starts, it is difficult to break.  New regulations
create new jobs for regulators, new justifications for fatter bureaucratic
budgets, and new excuses for crusading legislators on re-election trails to
valiantly proclaim their role as the taxpayers&#146; guardians.  All the while,
the derivatives industry in the U.S. will continue its migration to other,
less-regulated shores, thus decreasing competition and raising the costs of
risk management.<p>
<p>
If left unchecked, ever-constrictive regulations chasing on the heels of
financial innovation will progress.  As Adam Smith taught us, however, public
policy advocacy is an effective way to forestall such regulatory encroachments
on the investment and free movements of capital.  His voice stood out against
the doomsayers of 18th-century England, and, indeed, the Corn Laws were
repealed eventually.<p>
<p>
In more modern times, the effectiveness of public policy is evident&#151;at
least temporarily&#151;in recent successes in forestalling the ratcheting-up of
regulations on derivatives.  The earlier capital adequacy proposals on interest
rate risk and market risk were subsequently changed to allow some institutions
the discretion to use their own models.  Examiner oversight will be
complemented by supplemental examiner training.  This temporary success, like
the swap exemption from the CEA, is a result of advocacy, primarily by the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA).  <p>
<p>
Advocacy is most effective, however, if done by independent organizations whose
only agenda is the promotion of principles.  While ISDA&#146;s advocacy has
been very successful and based on sound economic principles, its efforts to
prevent the ratcheting-up of the regulation of privately-negotiated derivatives
can only be <i>complemented</i> by the efforts of independent, non-profit
advocacy groups like CEI.  The Competitive Enterprise Institute is in fact
uniquely positioned to complement the work of industry in forestalling the
regulation of financial innovation as just such a dispassionate enterprise.  <p>
<p>
<i>Banking and FDIC Reform</i><p>
<p>
The analytical basis for deposit insurance reform is well-developed, with an
extensive array of literature and noted academic experts.  The case for various
forms of comprehensive reform has been made on many occasions and in many
forums, but &#147;bright ideas&#148; alone have not been enough to overcome
substantial problems concerning operational details, political coalition
building, transitional difficulties, and translation of technical jargon into a
message that resonates with the average American.  The critical task today
remains one of effectively marketing many good ideas in the policy arena in a
manner that builds a dominant consensus in favor of fundamental reform.  This
is the task that CEI does best.  <p>
<p>
To advance this reform agenda, CEI launched in 1988 its Financial Services and
Deposit Insurance Reform project -- in anticipation of the federal
government&#146;s initial bailout of the savings and loan industry.  Our aim
was to promote a regulatory framework that would both encourage vigorous
competition in the U.S. financial services industry and ensure that American
taxpayers did not face an even greater insurance fund bailout in the
1990&#146;s.  <p>
<p>
By privatizing deposit insurance, consumers would benefit from a host of
savings including higher interest rates on deposits.  Also, another S &amp; L
fiasco funded by millions of taxpayers dollars would be a thing of the past.<p>
<p>
<i>Private Insurance Reform</i><p>
<p>
Modern society has become increasingly safety conscious and risk-averse.  We
face growing pressures to reduce risks throughout society and to ensure that
those harmed by misadventure receive compensation.  But life is fraught with
uncertainties.  Over time, our societies have developed institutions to help us
mitigate the risk of uncertainty.<p>
<p>
Financial intermediaries, including banks, financial markets, insurance
companies, and others, facilitate the management of our monetary risks.  For
instance, when we buy insurance, we buy peace of mind.  With insurance, we
exchange the chance of a large, unexpected payment, whose timing we cannot
control, for a series of smaller, known payments over the life of the contract.
Moreover, when we shop for insurance, we receive an analysis of our risks.
Insurance companies determine the probability that our house will burn, that
our car will be stolen, or that we will become ill.  Insurers share this
information with consumers through differences in premiums.  We can learn what
actions we can take to reduce our risk by learning what behaviors earn a
discount, or lead to lower premiums.<p>
<p>
One important uncertainty for which we cannot plan and which we cannot manage,
is government policy.  Government action, now and in the future, is more likely
to create risks than to ameliorate them.  Government-imposed rules and
regulations are more likely to inhibit quality than to promote it.  But the
expansion of government regulations and government insurance programs, on both
the state and federal levels, has been significant in recent years.  Government
regulation of prices, capital requirements, rating criteria, and coverage
capacity makes it harder for insurers to offer appropriate risk management at
appropriate prices.  Moreover, these interventions distort markets and force
some to subsidize the politically favored. <p>
<p>
Perhaps the most significant examples are areas in which government actually
provides insurance to protect against certain risks.  These now include poor
health (Medicare, Medicaid), insufficient retirement income (Social Security),
natural disasters (flood insurance), depository institution insolvency (deposit
insurance), underfunding of private pensions (Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation), inadequate credit standing for home purchases (FHA-guaranteed
loans), and agricultural business risk (crop insurance).  Government also
provides insurance indirectly through its regulation of safety in private
activities (e.g. EPA, FDA, NHTSA, CPSC, OSHA) and its supervision of the
overall economy.<p>
<p>
Equally significant are attempts by the courts to reduce social risks.  They
are quite pervasive and often counterproductive.  This reduction by American
courts of the right of free contract has limited innovation in the area of risk
management.  If firms cannot assign risks via enforceable contracts, they will
find it difficult to develop the specialized knowledge needed to assess risk
adequately.  Unless a risk reduction firm can shield its customers from their
mistakes, it has little to sell.  The parallel move to transform tort law from
a system of corrective justice &#151; an effort to identify and require
restitution from alleged wrongdoers &#151; to a system of wealth redistribution
has created major difficulties for insurers while doing little to help most
&#147;victims.&#148;<p>
<p>
As a society becomes wealthier, insurance becomes increasingly important as a
means of protecting existing wealth and freeing the resources of businesses and
individuals to be used in furthering economic growth.  As a nation&#146;s
wealth grows, insurance may also come to be viewed by some observers as a
&#147;necessity&#148; akin to sufficient food and adequate housing.  Such
attitudes are becoming more widespread, and insurance issues are becoming
increasingly more prominent at the federal and state levels. 	<p>
<p>
CEI&#146;s Private Insurance Project promotes free market economic solutions to
the problems confronting the industry today.  To meet this end, CEI
concentrates on educating the media, Congress, and the public about the manner
in which the insurance market works and the dangerous effects of misguided
government intervention.  In coming years, CEI will address the important,
emerging issues as they move to the top of the insurance policy agenda.<p>
 <p>

Miller, <i>Financial Innovation and Market Volatility</i> (London:  Blackwell,
1991).

<a href="marine.html"><i>Emerging Technologies and Private Stewardship of Marine Resources</i></A><p>
by Michael De Alessi<p>
Until recently, the prevailing notion among regulators was that fisheries
should be open and available to everyone.  This assured that fisheries would be
subject to the tragedy of the commons.  If fisheries are to survive, access to
them must be limited.  Mr. De Alessi, a Center for Private Conservation
Research Associate, explores options for saving the world's fisheries.<p>

<i>Resolving the Tragedy of the Commons by Creating Private Property Rights in Wildlife</i><p>
by Robert J. Smith<p>
The problems of overexploitation and extinction of wildlife appear to derive
consistently from their being treated as a common property resource.  Center
for Private Conservation Senior Scholar R. J. Smith, through several examples,
demonstrates how creating private property rights in wildlife can preserve our natural resources.  (Originally published in Cato Journal, Vol. 1, No. 2 [Fall 1981].  Copyright Cato Institute.)<p>

<i>Two Years After NAFTA: A Free Market Critique and Assessment</i><p>
by James M. Sheehan<p>
In this close inspection of the NAFTA proposal, CEI Research Associate James Sheehan revealed not genuine free trade, but a managed trade agreement designed to create a North American trade bloc.  The treaty erected new barriers to
outside parties and created a new bureaucracy capable of entangling trade
policy in a morass of environmental and social concerns.<p>

<A HREF="agpaper.html"><i>Federal Agricultural Policy: A Harvest of Environmental Abuse</i></A><p>
<i></i>by Jonathan Tolman<p>
This CEI monograph documents the significant environmental impacts caused by
federal farm subsidies, including more intensive use of  farm chemicals and the
destruction of the Florida Everglades.  Arguing that consumers, taxpayers, and
the environment would all be better off with a free market agricultural policy,
Mr. Tolman calls for an end to federal subsidies.<p>

<A HREF="title5.html"><i>Title V of the Clean Air Act:  Will America's Industrial Future be
Permitted?</i></A><p>
<i></i>by Ben Lieberman<p>
Title V of the 1990 Clean Air Act requires "major" industrial sources of air
pollution to incorporate all of the provisions of the Clean Air Act into a
single document, or "permit."  This will severely impact America's
competitiveness.  Mr. Lieberman argues in this paper that Congress must not
miss the chance to do away with Title V.  <p>

<i></i>by William H. Lash III<p>
Despite being the World's leading exporter, the U.S. spends over 3 billion tax
dollars annually on export promotion activities.  The most egregious member of
the federal government's confederacy of dunces is the Export-Import Bank of the
United States, the Eximbank.  Mr. Lash outlines all of the reasons why the
Eximbank should go out of  business.<p>

<a href="blm.html"><i>How and Why to Transfer BLM Lands to the States</i></A><p>
by Robert H. Nelson<p>
No area has greater potential for devolving federal responsibilities to the
states than Western public lands.  Transferring BLM lands to the states would
signify the end of the progressive in public land management.  In this booklet,
CEI Senior Fellow in Environmental Policy Dr. Nelson outlines why and how this
task should be accomplished.<p>

<A HREF="dsm.html"><i>The Economic Fallacies of Demand-Side Management</i></A><p>
by Matthew C. Hoffman<p>
Recent years have seen the emergence of Demand-Side Management (DSM), a new
approach to the electricity utility planning process.  Through DSM programs,
utilities endeavor to diminish ratepayer demand to avoid supply costs and
capacity expansion. In this monograph, former CEI Policy Analyst Matthew
Hoffman asserts that DSM is flawed both in theory and practice.<p>

<i>The Basel Convention</i><p>
<i></i>by Ray Evans<p>
The Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their
Disposal is a treaty designed to regulate, but, as Mr. Evans argues, more
fundamentally to ultimately bring to an end, international trade in a very
large number of materials.  It is "a high point...in green
imperialism."  In this paper, Ray Evans outlines the reasons why the
United States Senate should decline to ratify the Basel Convention.<p>

<i>The World Bank's Trail of Sorrows</i><p>
<i></i>by Paul Georgia<p>
The World Bank's stated objectives were the reconstruction of war-torn Europe
and the economic development of the less developed countries.  Instead, the
World Bank has been the source of human rights abuses, environmental disaster,
and economic stagnation.  In this paper, Mr. Georgia argues that for these
reasons, the United States should no longer fund the World Bank.<p>

<A HREF="tru7.html"><i>Conserving Biodiversity:  Resources for our Future</i></A><p>
by Stephen R. Edwards<p>
In this paper, part of CEI's Progress and the Planet project, Dr. Edwards
argues that governments and conservation groups need to begin promoting the
harvesting and sustainable use of wildlife by rural peoples living in
developing countries, rather than treating those people as if they are
criminals.  Sustainable use is sustainable development -- they are one and the same.<p>

Resources</i></A><p>
by Stephen Moore<p>
Part of the CEI's Progress and the Planet Project, this paper discusses the
possibility that the twenty-first century may be the first era in the history
of humanity that natural resource scarcity ceases to act as a significant
constraint on economic growth. Moore asserts that, based on measurable trends
of the past century, humanity will soon be entering an age of increasing and
unprecedented natural resource abundance.<p>

<A HREF="trade.html"><i>The Greening of Trade Policy:  &#147;Sustainable Development&#148; and
Global Trade</i></A><p>
by James M. Sheehan<p>
Though non-tariff barriers to trade are proliferating, world trade continues
its expansion.  Yet a new rationale for protectionism is emerging which argues
for the restriction of trade as a means of preserving and protecting the
environment. CEI policy analyst Jim Sheehan delves into this form of
"green" protectionism which demands that high environmental standards
be linked to trade.  This monograph discusses the history and implications of
GATT, NAFTA, CITES, and the Basel Convention.<p>

by Dr. Robert C. Balling, Jr.<p>
As part of CEI's Progress and the Planet project, Balling tackles the
apocalyptic vision of the greenhouse effect.  Sound scientific evidence argues
against the existence of a greenhouse crisis, against the notion that realistic
policies could achieve any meaningful climatic impact, and against the claim
that we must act now in order to avert disaster.<p>

<i>Gaining More Ground:  An Analysis of Wetland Trends in the United
States</i><p>
by Jonathan Tolman<p>
Far more wetlands are being created each year than are being converted for
other uses.  Nevertheless, the federal government's persecution of hapless
landowners continues.  This discussion paper demonstrates that such draconian
measures are unnecessary to protect America's wetlands.<p>

by CEI Environmental Policy Staff<p>

growing public concern about the global race between population and sustenance.

by James V. DeLong<p>
James DeLong, an independent environmental consultant, proposes that trash
disposal is a commodity, and should be treated as such.  MSW presents a minor

pointless, wasteful, and both environmentally and economically destructive.

<i>Evaluating the Employee Commute Option (ECO):   Can ECO Make Economic
Sense?</i><p>
by Jonathan Adler<p>
One of the more burdensome and least cost-effective provisions of the 1990
Clean Air Act requires employers in the nation's smoggiest cities to shoehorn
their employees into carpools and onto mass transit.  This policy makes little
sense, even from an environmental stand point.  This program is symbolic of the
failings of America's "one-size fits nobody" approach to environmental
policy.<p>

<i>Proceedings from the Seminar on Ecology and Religion</i><p>
Many commentators have observed that the environmental movement is infused with
a religious fervor.  At the same time, many religious denominations have become

"When Reagan was elected in 1982, I and others urged that the incoming
Administration take environmental policies seriously. They did not.
Republicans elected not to block the Superfund bill advanced in the lame
duck session preceding Reagan's innaugural.  The insufferable law was
passed, and this vastly complicated the task of reforming other
environmental programs.  James Watt and Anne Gorsuch were appointed to head
Interior and EPA respectively.  The Green response was to launch a massive
fund-raising effort that facilitated the rapid growth of the environmental
establishment throughout the 1980's.  Secretary Watt could well have been
the Finance Chairman of the Sierra Club.  In this climate, little was done
to reform environmental policy -- and from there, thing only got worse."

"After harvest, the first act of a wise farmer is to set aside enough seed
corn to ensure next year's crops.  Successful American entrepreneurs might
consider setting aside sufficient reserves to ensure the competitive
conditions that have fostered their success.  As Schumpeter warned years
ago, a capitalist society must be accepted as legitimate; a continuous
educational effort dedicated to that end is therefore required....
	
<P>"Corporations cannot win this battle alone.  In today's world, anyone having an obvious economic stake in a policy area is seen as suspect.  Drug
companies have little standing in any dispute with the Food and Drug
Administration; oil and chemical company research is rejected when questions of human health arise; automobile companies are seen as profiting from killing off their customers.  If capitalism is to be effectively marketed, I believe, market-oriented businessmen must develop creative new arrangements with their ideological friends in the free market community.  Just as a firm seeks third-party endorsement to market its products, it will need such independent supporters to advance its policy interests.  As in other situations, allies will be vital in the war for economic freedom."

"Individuals have the right to use their property as they wish.  Liberty is a neglected aspect of antitrust discussion.  Why should a businessman not be free to restrain his own trade if he wishes, alone or in combination with others?  The activities prohibited under antitrust laws are invariable
peaceable activities -- whatever their merit under an efficiency standard -- and thus should be allowed in a free society.... [I]n general, the Chicago School's case for antitrust policy -- and its opposition to price fixing in particular rests solely on economic efficiency, as if rights had nothing to do with the matter -- as if business had no right in principle to dispose of its property as it sees fit, but only a conditional freedom so long as it helps maximize some social utility function.  That is to say, no business is entitled to its property if that property can be redeployed so as to expand output.  With 'conservative,' 'pro-business' economists taking this view, who needs social democrats?"

"In America, religious as well as a wide range of other non-economic values
are honored and respected but not politically supported.  We each individually determine our own religious values and decide for ourselves what level of support we wish to provide.  In America, the cathedrals of God are built on private property and are financed privately under America's traditional concept of separation of Church and State.
	
<P>"There is no reason why those who believe in the intrinsic or even sacred value of nature cannot advance their beliefs in this manner as well.  After all, environmental groups now spend hundreds of millions annually advancing their values politically.  Were such funds invested in the private sphere, much private conservation would be possible."


<p><br><hr><p><br>


"Too often conservatives have focused only on one threat at a time --
national defense, economic deregulation, constitutional restraints on
spending -- while statist forces have found other routes to their goals.  As one statist rationale has been destroyed, they've quickly advanced another. American statists were very creative, inventing the modern regulatory state which retains the appearance of 'private' enterprise while destroying the reality.  Outright government ownership would be most honest, after all. Government agencies -- say the Postal Service -- are held somewhat responsible for their performance, while regulatory agencies exercise vast power but evade such accountability.  America has moved steadily down the road toward even greater regulatory controls.  The gains of economic deregulation were real but they have been more than offset by the losses associated with social, health and environmental regulations.  Such regulatory programs entail vague goals, universal scope, and massive
deregulations of authority to bureaucrats."

"Think about it!  There is not a medicine in your bathroom cabinet that does not carry some risk that is not deadly at some dosage.  But medicines cure disease.  Many of the cleaning supplies beneath your sink are 'toxic' if ingested; yet they make possible a cleaner home.  The world is made safer by dangerous products and processes that are less dangerous than the products and processes they replace."

<p><br><hr><p><br>

"Here we are, the safest, healthiest, longest-living people in history, and we have become a society of paranoids, obsessed with risk, fearful of the water we drink, the food we eat, the air we breathe, ozone holes exposing us to mysterious rays from space, radon seeping up from the earth into our showers. Honestly, does this not sound just a wee bit crazy?  Step back a bit and think about it."

<p><br><hr><p><br>


"The American Media and American greens are still actively frightening the citizenry over radon in our showers, lead paint on our walls, asbestos
siding and insulation, chlorinated compounds in our drinking water, alar on our apples, sick buildings, and unsafe foods -- sometimes, it seems as if the greens believe that the only safe people are the homeless and the starving."

<p><br><hr><p><br>

"Disillusionment with environmentalism reflects in part the success of such
groups at gaining power.  Power tends to corrupt, and the environmental
movement demonstrates that fact wonderfully.  Many environmental leaders have become more concerned with defending the clean air act than clean air, with retaining power than reducing pollution.  The result is that our greens no longer enjoy the saintly status of planet guardians."


<p><br><hr><p><br>

"Too often business finds itself highlighting current 
waste generation levels, then discussing how much better it is doing, and how
much better it intends to do tomorrow.  Let me suggest that there are dangers
in this approach.  Such approaches implicitly accept the view that firms are
engaged in the business of producing wastes, of harming the Earth.  Business
sometimes seems to have adopted a wife beating defense; yes, we beat our wives
but we've cut back considerably over the last decade and our plans call
for almost totally eliminating this activity by the year 2000.  Then they step
back expecting applause."

"I would describe CEI as a kind of 'battered business bureau,' a

"Smoking is a serious risk factor, causing over 500,000 lung cancer deaths per
year in the USA.  Driving in the US is also risky; about 50,000 people die in
highway-related incidents per year.  Few people are acquainted with the risk of
shark attacks in the US -- perhaps one or two per year. Yet, not too many years
ago, if one were to stand on a dune on a beach in America and cry 'Shark!
Shark!', almost everyone would rush from the water, some would light up a
cigarette, and most would soon drive home!  This illustrates well the all too
human tendency to rate sensational risks more highly than the more prosaic
risks that actually do us in."


<p><br><hr><p><br>

"You (attendees at the ICME June 15, 1995 conference) care about the environment but you also think.  A rare combination in the emotional and ideological climate that has defined environmental policy over the last several decades. Your challenge is to reconcile the passions which motivate many within the environmental movement with the intelligence that alone offers the only hope of resolving environmental problems."

<p><br><hr><p><br>

"Modern man is rapidly moving away from materialism itself as a basis for civilization.  We use less and less material to do more and more -- a handful of plentiful sand to transmit more messages via fiber optics than were once carried by tons of scarce copper.  As we have dug deeper, we have replenished the void with the one truly non-depletable, ultimately renewable resource -- the fruits of our intellect, science and technology.  Knowledge is the one resource that is not consumed by use."

<p><br><hr><p><br>


<b>Ecological Central Planning</b>
<p>
"Environmental policy today is pursued exactly as planned economies seek to
produce wheat.  A political agency is assigned the task.  It develops detailed
plans,  issues, directives, and the citizens comply.  That process will produce
some wheat just as environmental regulations produce some gains.  However,
neither system enlists the enthusiasm and the creative genius of the citizenry,
and neither leads to prosperity."  ("The Market and Nature," p. 352)
<p><br><hr><p><br>


<b>Endangered Industries</b>
<p>
"Consider the experience of the petroleum industry.  That industry willingly
paid very dearly to obtain leasing rights to explore and develop oil in
off-shore regions.  Yet, the oil industry was soon evicted.  The off-shore bans
were soon followed by bans on exploration in Alaska and throughout the nation.
The domestic oil exploration industry has been devastated -- the oil industry has
lost some 500,000 jobs over the last decade, perhaps half due to such policies.
Using the economic rhetoric of grazing fees and royalties, Babbitt and company
aim at eliminating economic activities from the Western lands." (Despairing
Optimist, 1 September 1993, p. 4)
<p><br><hr><p><br>


<b>Ecological Adoption</b>
<p>
"Current American law...prohibits ownership of endangered species.  This is the
environmental equivalent of prohibiting the adoption of orphaned and abandoned
children." ("Conclusion:  Environmental Policy at the Crossroads," p.
192)
<p><br><hr><p><br>


<b>Diversity, Human and Biological</b>
<p>
"Even if it could be shown that a flood of biblical proportions was likely, we
should avoid building a huge state 'ark' to shelter politically
preferred environmental amenities.  Instead, America should become a land of
millions of small arks, each tended by individuals or voluntary organizations
and thus better able to preserve and protect the natural world.
<p>
For public agencies to deal with the full range of ecological niches and
changing circumstances found in nature, constant fine-tuning of the
bureaucratic mechanism is needed, yet bureaucracies are notoriously difficult
to fine tune.  In contrast, free markets are naturally self-correcting and
every transaction is an act of fine tuning." ("A Free Market Environmental
Vision" p. 396)
<p><br><hr><p><br>


<b>Conservatives</b>
<p>
"Conservatives in general remain ambivalent about politics.  Too often, they
view political activities in the same way that the Victorians regarded sex-a
messy necessity that should not be openly discussed and certainly should not be
enjoyed.  This genteel view of politics handicaps its practitioners in the tug
of war over government policy.  If you don't like politics, you probably
aren't going to be very good at it." ("Learning the Washington
Game," p. 41)
<p><br><hr><p><br>

<b>Richer Is Safer</b>
<p>
"The United States has storms.  Bangladesh has storms.  In the United States,
no one dies.  In Bangladesh, many thousands of people die.  It is not because
nature is different in those two environments, it is because the U.S. has a
freer society and therefore has developed more ability to absorb whatever cards
nature deals to us.  We should free the world, not regulate it into oblivion."
("Balance Problem," <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>, 16 August 1992)
<p><br><hr><p><br>


<b>Socialism, American Style</b>
<p>
"Perhaps I should have stayed in France -- at least there socialism is honestly
labeled.  Tom Miller recently completed the <i>1992 Competitive Enterprise
Index</i> (enclosed in the last Despairing Optimist letter) and found that
Representative Bernie Sanders, the only formal socialist in the U.S. House and
Senate, scored higher on free market votes than some 160 of his fellow members
of Congress.  All this should remind us that America has no need for a formal
socialist party -- our Democrats and Republicans do quite well." (Despairing
Optimist, 1 November 1993, p. 1)
<p><br><hr><p><br>


<b>Baptists and Bootleggers</b>
<p>
"Businesses have found the environmental laws useful devices to restrict
competition.  The laws make it far harder to build a new plant, introduce a new
product, or even use an old product in a new way.  Such competitive innovations
are inhibited by environmental laws:  the new, the novel must demonstrate its
virtue; the old, the familiar is accepted, warts and all." ("What
Environmental Policy?," David Boaz (Ed.), <i>Asssessing the Reagan
Years</i>, Cato Institute, 1988, p. 334)<p>
<p><br><hr><p><br>


<b>Environmental Protection Agency</b>
<p>
"In fact, the EPA has suppressed information suggesting that environmental
problems pose less of a threat than previously thought.  Examples of this are
numerous:  Delaying release of urban air pollution statistics (illustrating
dramatic improvements) until after passage of the Clean Air Act; blocking the
release of the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Project which suggested
minimal harm from acid rain; refusing to clarify the risks from dioxin (the
"carcinogen" justifying many of EPA's control programs).
Promoting irrational fears through disinformation, after all, is in the
EPA's interest -- it is the surest way to increase its budget.  An EPA
that reassured the American people, that sought to alleviate irrational fears
might well face major cutbacks." ("Europe, Energy and the Environment and
the Case against Carbon Taxes," speech, 27 January 1992, p. 4)
<p><br><hr><p><br>

"The greens endorse a kind of romantic communalism eco-socialism in which
'this land is your land, this land is my land.' But, of course,
these people are hopelessly confused.  Haven't they heard of a title search?
To turn the world into a political commons is to ensure the destruction of all
values economic as well as ecological."
<p><br><hr><p><br>


"The greatest danger of all is <i>stagnation</i>   the slowing down, the
stopping, of new products and new technologies.  We should -- and we do -- 
consider the risks of innovation, of economic growth and technological change.
But we also should consider the risks of economic and technological stagnation.
Our challenge as a society is to balance the risks of change against the risks
of stasis."
<p><br><hr><p><br>

<b>Diversity, Human and Biological</b>
<p>
"It's hard for government to keep its mind on even one or two things, yet
by politicizing environmental policy governments are charged with preserving
bio-diversity, and there are hundreds of thousands of plants and animals out
there worthy of preservation.  That task is going to be very difficult if we
limit it to 150 governments worldwide.  In contrast, 5 billion people acting as
individual owners might well find it possible to protect a much broader array
of species.  We need a diversity of ideas if we are going to preserve a
diversity of species, and governments give us very little of the former."
("Protecting the Environment -- Market Alternatives to the Bureaucratic
State," p. 399)
<p><br><hr><p><br>

<b>Chemophobia</b>
<p>
"When I was a kid, people were convinced that evil forces were adding poisonous
substances to the water supply --  and people still believe that.  But, in
those days, the villains were the Communists, the substance was fluorine, and
the charges were brought by the John Birch Society.  Today, those same fears
exist, but the villains are American business, the substances are a vast array
of 'toxic' chemicals and the charges are brought by the Greenies.
The major difference, however, is that when I was a kid, few believed the
Birchers, but today, the greenie charges are treated as gospel by even our Vice
President." (Despairing Optimist, 24 March 1994, p. 4)

<H1>Rachel Was Wrong</H1>
by Jonathan Tolman

<P>March 1996 <a href="publist1.html#update"><i>CEI UpDate</i></A>

<P>

Rachel Carson's <i>Silent Spring</i> ushered in an era of national concern
over the potential effects of synthetic chemicals.  Published in 1962,
Carson's book suggested that the human use of synthetic chemicals amounted
to a "relentless war on life" and that modern society was
"losing the right to be called civilized." Americans experienced
widespread angst over the potential carcinogenic effects of chemicals over the
subsequent decades. As it turns out, Rachel Carson was wrong.<p>
	Last month, the National Research Council, the research arm of the National
Academy of Sciences, released a report on carcinogens in the human diet. Over
thirty years after <i>Silent Spring's</i> publication, a wealth of
scientific evidence suggests that many of the concerns Carson raised were
unfounded.<p>
	Plants have evolved numerous chemicals that serve as defensive agents against
predators. Some kill predators outright, others act as deterrents in some
fashion.  Many of these substances can be considered natural pesticides, and
are quite common.  These chemicals are likely present in our diet in amounts
exceeding the residues of synthetic pesticides.  <p>
	Nearly a decade ago Bruce Ames, of the University of California at Berkeley,
began to point out that many naturally occurring chemicals tested positive for
carcinogenicity in lab tests on rodents.  In fact, the percentage of
naturally-occurring chemicals identified as "carcinogenic" in rodent
bioassays does not differ significantly from that of synthetic chemicals. This
led Ames to the conclusion that insofar as there was a cancer risk in the human
diet, it was more likely the result of naturally-occurring chemicals than
synthetics.  There are after all, many more naturally occurring chemicals than
synthetic.  More importantly, Ames posited that the cancer threat posed by food
was likely small to nonexistent.  The NAS report confirmed the Ames thesis.<p>
	The NAS study concluded that based upon existing exposure data, the great
majority of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals in the diet appear to
be present at levels below which any significant adverse biological effect is
likely.  So low, in fact, that they are unlikely to pose any appreciable cancer
risk whatsoever.<p>
	The study also concluded that natural components of the diet may prove to be
of greater concern than synthetic components with respect to cancer risk.  Synthetic chemicals account for a
tiny fraction of the daily dietary intake of substances that have been labeled
carcinogens in lab tests.  Because of the greater abundance of
naturally-occurring substances in the diet, the total exposure to
naturally-occurring carcinogens far exceeds the exposure to synthetic
carcinogens.<p>
	Another finding of the NAS study was that the basic mechanisms involved in the
entire process of cancer -- from exposure of the organism to expression of
tumors -- are similar, if not identical for synthetic and naturally
occurring carcinogens.  The NAS study concluded that there was no notable
difference between synthetic and naturally occurring carcinogens.  The argument
made by many environmentalists that the human body has evolutionary defenses
against natural carcinogens, but not against synthetic ones, does not hold
water.<p>
	Despite the strong scientific consensus that underlies the NAS report, many 
environmentalists (who have made their careers opposing the trace levels of
pesticides on foods) still can't seem to believe it.  Al Meyerhoff, senior
attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council told the <i>New York
Times</i> that despite the report, synthetic chemicals "can still cause 
thousands of cancers in consumers, and they should be avoided whenever
possible."  Psychologists usually refer to this as denial.<p>
	The NAS study reviewed the issue of how many cancers might be caused by
carcinogens in the diet.  In citing one study the authors acknowledged that
"except for alcohol, the known dietary carcinogens could not account for
more than a few hundred cancer cases." This amounts to less than 0.01
percent -- one ten-thousandth -- of all cancers. What actually does
cause cancer, if not pesticide residues and other chemicals, is not earth
shattering news.  Smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and over eating were
listed as the biggest contributors to an increased cancer risk.<p>
	But just when you thought it was safe to go back into the supermarket,
environmentalists have created another environmental affliction.  Using cancer
as a scare tactic appears to be waning, so environmentalists have latched onto
a new cause celebr&eacute; -- endocrine disrupters.<p>
	The new theory is that certain synthetic chemicals, such as DDT, PCBs, various
organochlorines and other synthetic chemicals,  mimic estrogen or other
hormones and can interfere in human development and reproduction.  Among the
charges made is that these chemicals are responsible for a global decline in
human sperm counts -- even though there is no conclusive evidence that
sperm counts are declining.<p>
	This collective hypochondria is laid out in the new book by World Wildlife
Fund Senior Scientist Theo Colburn, environmental writer Diane Dumanowski, and
W. Alton Jones Foundation Director John Peterson Myers.  Their collective angst
is ominously entitled, <i>Our Stolen Future</i>.<p>
	Unfortunately for the proponents of synthetic endocrine disruption, mother
nature has already beaten them too it.  Just as they produce carcinogens, a
large number of plants routinely produce significant quantities of hormone
mimicking chemicals.  The human diet is simply filled with foods that contain
naturally-occurring endocrine disrupters from genestein in soybeans to
cafesterol in coffee. <p>
	Given the wealth of human exposure to these substances, if there were
widespread human effects, the world would have seen them by now.  The lack of
compelling data suggests that the kids are all right, and there is no cause for
alarm.  The issue of endocrine disruption clearly warrants further study, but
not the sort of hysteria routinely ginned up by environmental activists.<p>
	Let's just hope that it doesn't take science 30 years to do for
concerns about endocrine disrupters what it did for concerns about cancer.<p>

<H1>THE ANTI-REDLINING AGENDA:<BR>
An Assault on Risk-Based Insurance
</H1>

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>The House of Representatives is considering two competing bills aimed at
addressing recent charges of insurance industry redlining (the refusal to sell
insurance in certain communities).  The primary sponsors of the two pieces of
legislation, Rep. Cardiss Collins (D-IL) and Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-MA), have
both fashioned data collection programs.  Rep. Kennedy&#146;s Insurance
Consumer Protection Act, compared to Rep. Collins&#146; Anti-Redlining in
Insurance Disclosure Act (HR 1188), is a much more ambitious and costly effort,
in terms of the number of cities sampled, the questions asked, and the time
period involved.<p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, the millions of dollars that policyholders and taxpayers would
lay out under either proposal would not buy much.  The fundamental facts
surrounding urban insurance markets are less in dispute than the interpretation
of those facts.  Insurance industry spokesmen acknowledge that urban residents
often pay higher premiums for auto and homeowners' insurance than suburban
because of higher expected claims costs.  The Association of Community
Organizations for Reform Now and Consumers Union respond that the availability
of auto or homeowners' insurance is often key to the further development of
poorer neighborhoods.  Community groups maintain that higher expected claims
costs should not be allowed to price some consumers out of the insurance
market.<p>
<p>
	The consumer groups that support the pending legislation are clearly
interested in more than just a data collection program.  Their long-term agenda
includes regulatory changes that would:<p>
<UL>
<LI>  restrict the ability of insurers to use territorial rating; and<p>
<LI>  establish minimum acceptable policy terms.  <p>
</UL>
Some community activists have also urged regulators to base allowable rates of
return for insurers on their sales to targeted neighborhoods.  Others would
establish community reinvestment guidelines that would force insurance
companies to invest in neighborhoods from which they gather premiums.<p>
<p>
	In the long run, such regulatory initiatives would be counterproductive,
reducing both the availability and the affordability of insurance.  Insurance
consumers in all markets would be better served by policies designed to
encourage entry and increase competition in the insurance industry.<p>

<P>Combining a natural sciences background, geology at Stanford University,
with social sciences, economics at New York University, Mr. Smith began to
apply market and property rights solutions to environmental issues when he was
president of an Audubon society chapter in 1970.  In his book, <i>Earth&#146;s
Resources: Private Ownership vs. Public Waste</i>, he coined the term
"free market environmentalism."  He was consultant to the Department
of the Interior and the President's Council on Environmental Quality and a
special assistant at the EPA.  He was Director of Environmental Studies at the
<A HREF="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</A>.  Currently he works on wildlife, endangered species, property
rights and property stewardship.

<P>Sam Kazman is General Counsel of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free
market advocacy and research organization headquartered in Washington, D.C.
CEI emphasizes the marketing and implementation of classical liberal ideals and
believes limited government and competition best serve the public interest.  <p>
<p>
Mr. Kazman has been extensively involved in public interest litigation and
policy analysis, especially in the areas of transportation and health
regulation.  In February, 1992, he won a federal appeals court ruling that the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had illegally concealed the
lethal effects of CAFE (the federal auto fuel economy program) on highway
safety.  This marked the first judicial overturning of a CAFE standard in the
program&#146;s 17-year history.  <p>
<p>
His recent writings include <i>Deadly Overcaution:  FDA&#146;s Drug Approval
Process</i> (Journal of Regulation and Social Costs, Sept. 1990),  <i>Death By
Regulation</i> (Regulation Magazine, Fall 1991), <i>Saying Yes to Drugs</i>
(Journal of Regulation and Social Costs, June 1992), and <i>Purer Politics,
Greasier Pigs, and Other Wonders of Campaign Reform</i> (Regulation Magazine,
Summer 1992)<p>

<P>When the International Whaling Commission (IWC) convened in Aberdeen,
Scotland last month, the United States delegation strongly supported a
request by the Makah Indians to take five Gray whales. The Makah, a small
tribe from Washington state, were following a precedent well established by
the IWC, but midway through the meeting, the House Resources Committee
passed a unanimous resolution opposing the Makah request. That contributed
to an about face by the US delegation, which pulled its support during the
meeting. Denying the Makah request is shameful. Unlike Congress, the Makah
long ago recognized the important link between ownership and stewardship and have sensibly conserved their resources for centuries.

In recent interviews, House Speaker Newt Gingrich has challenged Majority
Leader Bob Dole's support for much needed property rights legislation and
belittled the experiences of those upon whom the weight of environmental
regulations sits.  In an interview with Greenwire, Gingrich said that Rep.
Richard Pombo (R-CA) is "open to growth" because he "has really tried to
bridge the world of the rural Westerner to the world of the scientist who
deals with this."  Were he not loyal to the Speaker, Pombo, who has led the
push for Endangered Species Act reform, might have suggested that it is the
"rural Westerner" whose land is regulated and livelihood is destroyed who
really "deals with" America's environmental laws.

Trying to beat the Democrats at their own game, a group of twenty-one House
Republicans, led by Christopher Shays (R-CT), propose raising the minimum wage by one dollar an hour after Democrats resurrect a proposal to increase the minimum by 90 cents.  If passed, the proposal would deny job oppportunities to hundreds of thousands seeking to enter the labor force, in the name of helping working Americans.  There is already one political party in the nation's Capitol subservient to big labor; America does not need another.

<p><br><hr><p><br>


One of the first bills passed by the 104th Congress was the
Congressional Accountability Act which applied federal labor laws to Congress. For the first time, Congressmen had to be concerned
about overtime pay and workplace safety (as defined by OSHA).  Although the law has yet to be fully implemented, some in Congress already are seeking to soften the law's impact by creating special exemptions, placing gag orders on complaints lodged against Members, and giving Congressional offices compliance advice not available to the private sector.

<p><br><hr><p><br>

Concerned about the rise of publishing baron Malcolm  "Steve"  Forbes, GOP presidential candidates have adopted the class-warfare rhetoric and economic populism of liberal Democrats.  Phil Gramm calls Forbes  "Richie Rich" and Pat Buchanan disparages flat tax proposals drafted by the "boys at the yacht basin." One is tempted to ask when Richard Gephardt and David Bonior joined the Republican party. Economic success used to be the American dream. Now Republican candidates want to make it a political liability.

<p><br><hr><p><br>

While Republicans scramble to pass a telecommunications reform bill, compromise after compromise has been made.  As the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> reported (12/27/95), Congressional leaders opted  to delay deregulation of 'expanded basic' cable... for another three years. They dropped a provision that would have allowed some foreign ownership of American broadcast outlets. They approved onerous language limiting 'media concentration' that will make it much harder for companies to collaborate in the data stream that will emerge at the convergence of the computer, telephone and cable businesses. And... they gave the Justice Department a bigger say in determining when the Bells can enter long distance markets    a move certain to delay full-scale competition between the Bells and AT&T, MCI, et al.  In fact, so many compromises have been made that Vice President Al Gore proclaimed "There's not a single provision of the bill were not happy about. This is a terrific bill, a centrist bill for the 21st century." Its enough to give one the shivers.

<H1>REINVENTING SUPERFUND<BR>
The Clinton Reform Proposal<BR> and an Alternative

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<BR>


<P>Superfund has been universally criticized as an expensive, largely ineffective
environmental cleanup program.  Even if it worked as intended, it would provide
insignificant benefits to human health and the environment.  As currently
administered, it is fair to say that the program causes more fiscal harm than
environmental good. <p>
<p>
The original Superfund was to be a five year $1.6 billion program intent on
cleaning up at least 400 sites.  Cleanup at Superfund sites has proceeded at a
snail-like pace and the cost of cleanup is enormous.<p>
<UL>
<LI> Fewer than 20% of Superfund sites have been cleaned to date.<p>
<LI> Fewer than 20 sites were cleaned during the first seven years of the
program.<p>
<LI>As of March 1994, construction and cleanup had yet to begin at almost half of the now 1,232 sites.<p>
<LI>
The average cost of a Superfund cleanup now exceeds $25 million per site. <p>
</UL>

To justify the high cost, Superfund was touted as a &#147;polluter pays&#148;
policy.  However, under Superfund, polluter and non-polluter alike
<b>overpay</b>.  Past or present owners or operators of a site, the producers
of potentially hazardous chemicals, and even the transporters of the waste are
potentially responsible under Superfund.  Superfund liability is retroactive,
and liability does not necessarily end if a site is removed from the Superfund
National Priority List.<p>
<p>
Although the administration addresses several of these concerns, it fails to
deal successfully with the force that is driving Superfund cleanup costs:  the
absurd risk assumptions.  By assuming that extremely unlikely&#151;sometimes
physically impossible&#151;events will occur in the future, EPA is able to
create the impression of risk where no actual harm will occur. <p>
<p>
EPA will generally take cleanup action if the estimated risk of developing
cancer from exposure to the site&#146;s contaminants is greater than one in
10,000.  Viewed in the light of the normal rate of total cancer incidence for
American&#151;approximately one in four&#151;expending tremendous resources to
reduce cancer risks by less than one-hundredth of one percent seems absurd.<p>
<p>
Many community leaders would prefer to divert resources away from Superfund
activities toward more pressing priorities&#151;programs that will prevent
real, as opposed to hypothetical, premature deaths.  As presently written,
Superfund does not permit communities to make the choice.<p>
<p>
The administration&#146;s proposal utilizes an administrative back door to
approach the &#147;environmental justice&#148; issue.  After more than a decade
of trying, EPA has failed to establish any reasonable correlation between
Superfund site pollution and specific diseases in surrounding communities.  The
fact is that if the federal gevernment truly desired to help people in poorer
communities, it would abandon the pretense and stop wasting money on the
cleanup projects.  There is ample evidence that most poor communities have far
more pressing public health concerns than Superfund remediation.<p>
<p>
Superfund imposes federal control on what are essentially state and local
problems.  Instead of making further attempts to salvage a failed federal
program, Superfund should be turned over to the states as much as possible.
Remodeling Superfund as a revolving state loan fund would be a dramatic
improvement over the status quo.  This would place authority for cleanup
decisions closer to the communities directly impacted by the outcomes, and
would sunset the existing Superfund tax structure.<p>
<p>
Under a revolving loan program, the monies must be paid back to the federal
government over time.  This would result in:<p>
<UL>
<LI>  stronger incentives to avoid waste and inefficiency,<p>
<LI>  development of more accurate user fees and charges,<p>
<LI>  selection of less costly cleanup alternatives,<p>
<LI>  greater flexibility in the system,<p>
<LI>  more community control in establishing local environmental priorities.<p>
</UL>
Superfund is creating health risks where none existed before.  Cleanup of a
site often creates a risk of construction accidents or exposures to unearthed
materials that are larger than preexisting risks from the sites under
remediation.  Moreover the unnecessary stress inflicted on nearby residents can
actually be significant.  <p>
<p>
A greater, hidden cost of Superfund is that it is economic dead weight.
Lowering the income of individuals can be harmful to their health.  Superfund
is almost certainly an example of a government program that &#147;kills&#148;
more people than it &#147;saves.&#148; Superfund activities create widespread
anxiety about potential health risks and divert attention away from far more
real threats to human health and the environment.<p>
<p>
Superfund is driven by fear.  By granting local communities more autonomy and
responsibility over Superfund sites, better results will be produced.  It is
time to reinvent Superfund. <p>

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>


<p>
     The operating permits program under Title V is the most significant innovation
in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act.  Although it makes no changes to
the substantive provisions contained in the rest of the Act, Title V requires
&#147;major&#148; industrial sources of air pollution to incorporate all of
these requirements into a single document or &#147;permit.&#148;  These
permits, approved under state programs, will become the primary enforcement
vehicle of the Clean Air Act, similar to the operating permits under the Clean
Water Act.  <p>
<p>
     Although ostensibly run by the states, the EPA retains ultimate control over
the state permitting programs, giving the agency numerous opportunities to
meddle in the process and micromanage industry when it so chooses.
Environmental groups, exploiting the generous public participation and citizen
suit provisions, will also acquire unprecedented power over industry.  <p>
<p>
     Title V will impose substantial costs on industry.  EPA puts the cost of Title
V at $500 million annually, but others believe this estimate may be an order of
magnitude too low.  In addition to the high paperwork and compliance costs,
Title V&#146;s extensive procedural requirements can result in costly delays
lasting months or even years, both during the initial permitting process, and
in the required revisions to existing permits to incorporate changes at a
permitted facility.  The potential delays will be particularly troublesome for
fast moving industries where facility changes are frequent and it is necessary
to quickly bring products to market.<p>
     <p>
     Given the significant improvements in air quality since 1970, and the marked
declines in emissions from the large industrial facilities Title V targets, it
is difficult to justify the introduction of a new and expensive enforcement
scheme at this time.  EPA has not attempted to quantify the benefits, in terms
of cleaner air, it expects from Title V, but they are likely to be marginal.<p>
<p>
     While a few legislative changes could make Title V considerably more tolerable
than it currently is, there is no reason not to do more.  No matter how
modified, Title V will never achieve results at an acceptable cost.  There now
exists a unique window of opportunity to eliminate Title V before it becomes an
entrenched part of the regulatory landscape.  If all that is accomplished is
the softening of a few of Title V&#146;s more onerous aspects, the current
period may one day be looked back upon as a lost chance at getting rid of the
most dispensable title in the Clean Air Act.<p>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>  The operating permits program under Title V is the most significant
innovation in the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act.  It fundamentally
changes the workings of state and federal air emission control.  However,
despite the recent focus on the Clean Air Act by reform-minded legislators,
Title V has received relatively little public attention.   <p>
<p>
     Although it makes no changes to the substantive provisions contained in the
rest of the Act, Title V requires &#147;major&#148; sources of air pollution to
incorporate all of these requirements in a single document or
&#147;permit.&#148;  This permit must be approved through programs run by the
states.  Operating permits will become the primary enforcement vehicle of the
Clean Air Act.<p>
<p>
     The stated purpose of  Title V is to bring to the Clean Air Act an
operating permits program similar to the one in the Clean Water Act.  Permits
are designed to clarify the requirements applicable to each emissions source
and facilitate their enforcement.<A HREF="title56.html#1"><sup>1</sup></A>  Whether the operating permits
program under the Clean Water Act can or should be duplicated in the realm air
emissions was never seriously debated.     <p>
<p>
     Title V exhibits many of the problematic characteristics of the current
federal approach to environmental protection.  It is a rigid and prescriptive
system of command and control emphasizing process over substance and fostering
an adversarial relationship between environmental regulators and industry.
Most states already have air emission operating permit programs.  Title V
federalizes these state programs, making them considerably more complex and
costly to implement.     <p>
<p>
     It is difficult to justify the implementation of Title V at this time.  With a
twenty year record of substantial declines in air pollution, particularly among
the large industrial emissions sources targeted by Title V, it is unclear why a
radically new federal enforcement scheme targeting such sources is needed now.
Moreover, Title V is unlikely to achieve additional improvements in air
quality.  The EPA has never attempted to quantify the benefits it expects Title
V to achieve, perhaps because they will be so meager. <p>
<p>
     While the benefits of Title V are questionable, the costs are not.  Title V
imposes startlingly high compliance costs.  More ominously, industries are
concerned about Title V&#146;s effect on timely operational flexibility.  In
addition to the initial delays in obtaining a permit, revising an existing
permit to account for operational changes at a regulated facility or other
post-permit events is a time consuming process, involving numerous precedural
steps.  Title V is replete with opportunities for the EPA and environmental
groups to tie up these permit revisions with procedural delays, in effect
giving them unprecedented power over industrial changes.  In fast moving
industries where changes are frequent, such as electronics or pharmaceuticals,
such delays will make it difficult to stay competitive, and deliver new
products to consumers in a timely fashion.  Once issued, these permits will
facilitate enforcement actions initiated by EPA, the states, and environmental
groups, for violations of permit terms, including minor technical violations.
No other nation has anything as onerous as Title V, giving foreign competitors
and American-owned plants located abroad a significant competitive advantage.<p>
<p>
     At the very least, legislative changes should be made to Title V to reduce the
costs and procedural delays imposed on American industry.  Ideally, Title V
would be completely eliminated.  Although less well publicized than some of the
other problems with the Clean Air Act<A HREF="title56.html#2"><sup>2</sup></A>, Title V, in its current
form, provides a very good reason for an extensive overhaul of the Act.<p>

<H2>Overview of Title V</H2>
</CENTER>



<p>
<b>Setting Up Title V: EPA Approval of State Programs</b><p>
<b></b><p>
     The day to day operation of Title V will, at least in theory, be run by the
states.  Each state will review permit applications, issue final permits, and
enforce them under its own program.  But states must first submit their planned
programs to EPA for approval.  Before receiving approval, each state must
demonstrate that its program will evaluate permit applications according to the
minimum standards set out in Title V and the EPA regulations.<A HREF="title56.html#3"><sup>3</sup></A>
States are permitted some flexibility regarding the specifics of their
programs, but only where EPA allows.  State permit program requirements are
described in the sections below.  <p>
<p>
     States were supposed to submit their applications to EPA by November 15, 1993
and EPA was required to approve or reject, in whole or part, within one year.
As is often the case with federal undertakings of this size, the process has
fallen severely behind schedule.  Many states missed the deadline.  EPA has
contributed to the delays by repeatedly making substantial changes to the
implementing regulations, including a new set of proposed rules due out in July
1995 (see the following figure).  To date, less than half the states have
obtained approval for their air permit programs.  Nonetheless, EPA is required
to impose sanctions on states that miss the deadline.<A HREF="title56.html#4"><sup>4</sup></A><p>
<p>
     If a state does not have an approved program in place by November 15, 1995,
the EPA must impose a federal operating permit program on the air emissions
sources in that state.<A HREF="title56.html#5"><sup>5</sup></A>  Once a state program is approved, or a
federal program is imposed, existing sources of air emissions have one year to
file a permit application.<A HREF="title56.html#6"><sup>6</sup></A>  States must act on at least one third
of all permit applications each year.<A HREF="title56.html#7"><sup>7</sup></A>  As an inducement to the
states, the law allows them to collect permit fees from the regulated sources,
based on the quantity of emissions by the permittee.<A HREF="title56.html#8"><sup>8</sup></A>  <p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u><b>Who Must Obtain a Permit</b><p>
<b></b><p>
     Each industrial source of air emissions must determine if it comes under Title
V and is required to file a permit application.  However, like nearly
everything else in Title V, the standards are unclear.  For now, EPA has
allowed state programs to limit the Title V requirements to &#147;major
sources.&#148;<A HREF="title56.html#9"><sup>9</sup></A>  A major source is defined as a stationary source
that:<p>
<p>
<UL>
<LI>emits or has the potential to emit 10 tons per year of 179 listed hazardous
air pollutants, or 25 tons per year of any combination of hazardous air
pollutants under [[section]] 112 of the Clean Air Act; <p>

<LI>emits or has the potential to emit 100 tons per year of any air pollutant
under [[section]]302 of the Clean Air Act; or <p>

<LI>emits or has the potential to emit certain criteria pollutants (volatile
organic compounds, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, particulates) in
nonattainment areas under Title I, part D, based on several sliding scales
which depend on the severity of the nonattainment and the pollutant at
issue.<A HREF="title56.html#10"><sup>10</sup></A>  <p>

</UL>

<p>
Additionally, there are complex rules designed to thwart efforts on the part of
industry to split up sites into two or more sources in order to fall below the
threshold levels.<A HREF="title56.html#11"><sup>11</sup></A>     <p>
<p>
     EPA initially limited the applicability of Title V to &#147;major&#148;
sources until the program is up and running, but may later expand the universe
of applicable entities when feasible.  Approximately 34,000 industrial sites
are &#147;major,&#148; and must be permitted.<A HREF="title56.html#12"><sup>12</sup></A>  EPA currently
allows states to exempt smaller, non-major sources.<A HREF="title56.html#13"><sup>13</sup></A>  Were this
exemption narrowed or eliminated, as many as 350,000 additional sources,
including small businesses such as gas stations and dry cleaners, would also
need to obtain a Title V permit.<A HREF="title56.html#14"><sup>14</sup></A>  There is little in Title V that
limits its reach in this regard.  And, if EPA hopes to control most of the
nation&#146;s industrial air emissions through Title V, much as it controls
water emissions, it will have to expand the number of sources subject to Title
V.<A HREF="title56.html#15"><sup>15</sup></A>    <p>
 <p>
     Important to recognize is that Title V applicability thresholds are based on
the &#147;potential to emit,&#148; not on actual emissions.  The
&#147;potential to emit&#148; assumes that a source operates 24 hours a day,
365 days a year, and ignores any efforts to reduce actual emissions unless they
are federally enforceable.<A HREF="title56.html#16"><sup>16</sup></A>  This standard has created irrational
results for many types of entities with much more limited emissions.  <p>
<p>
     &#147;Potential to emit&#148; ignores the seasonality of many kinds of
emissions.  For instance, many grain elevators will need to obtain a permit,
based on the assumption that they are constantly being filled and emptied and
emitting dust particles, though this is virtually impossible given the
realities of the business.<A HREF="title56.html#17"><sup>17</sup></A>  Title V also covers types of equipment
that make a negligible contribution to air pollution.  Potential emissions from
backup generators, for example, are calculated assuming they are in continuous
operation throughout the year, but in reality such equipment is rarely if ever
in operation.  Also, sources whose emissions are below Title V threshold levels
because of state or local requirements that are not federally enforceable, and
sources that have voluntarily undertaken measures to reduce pollution will
still have to comply.  Nothing other than federally enforceable limits can be
used in determining the potential to emit.<p>
<p>
     The result of the wide net cast by the &#147;potential to emit&#148;
thresholds is the application of Title V permit requirements to a large number
of sources with no regard for their actual air emissions.  In recent months,
EPA has, for the first time, shown some concern about Title V&#146;s extreme
breadth.  In a policy memorandum, EPA said they may allow states to exempt
certain sources whose actual emissions are considerably less than potential
emissions.  An EPA rule on this point may be forthcoming.<p>
<p>



 <b>Permit Applications and Permit Content</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>   Sources required to obtain a permit must submit a timely and complete
application.<A HREF="title56.html#18"><sup>18</sup></A>   Each application must include extremely detailed
information about
the emissions at the source,  a citation of all air pollution control
requirements, a compliance plan, and certification of compliance with all
applicable requirements.<A HREF="title56.html#19"><sup>19</sup></A>  Pending applications must be updated to
include any relevant new information arising after the initial
submission.<A HREF="title56.html#20"><sup>20</sup></A>  The permit application for a small iron foundry, for
example, runs several hundred pages, and must list such minutiae as the
estimated amount of dust kicked up by motor vehicles as they enter and leave
the parking lot.<A HREF="title56.html#21"><sup>21</sup></A>  A responsible official must attest to the truth,
accuracy, and completeness of each application, including the certification of
compliance.<A HREF="title56.html#22"><sup>22</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     Each permit issued shall list all federally enforceable air emission
limitations and standards.<A HREF="title56.html#23"><sup>23</sup></A>  The extensive monitoring,
recordkeeping, reporting, and inspection requirements must also be
included.<A HREF="title56.html#24"><sup>24</sup></A>   Permits are good for a maximum of five
years,<A HREF="title56.html#25"><sup>25</sup></A>  though most permits will probably have to be revised
several times during that span.  A new permit does not provide much long-term
certainty.  <p>
<p>
     Existing facilities going through the permit application process for the first
time as well as new facilities being planned or under construction will suffer
extensive procedural delays, up to 18 months, during which they cannot be
certain what their approved permit will or will not allow.<A HREF="title56.html#26"><sup>26</sup></A>  Long
lag times before commencing operations are very costly and in some cases render
a planned facility economically unfeasible.   <p>
<p>
     Intel Corporation provides a clear example of a company that will be hurt if
Title V causes procedural delays.  Those familiar with personal computers know
that Intel produces an entirely new generation microprocessor every few years.
The 386 microprocessor was introduced in 1985.  It was replaced by the 486 in
1989, followed by the Pentium in 1993.  The Pentium&#146;s replacement is
currently in the works.<A HREF="title56.html#27"><sup>27</sup></A>  Title V could prevent Intel from
maintaining this pace.  In a globally competitive field such as semiconductor
production, Intel is only slightly ahead of other manufacturers and already
must contend with numerous delays caused by other U.S. environmental laws and
regulations, such as the New Source Review program.  Now, Title V poses
additional delays that may slow new product introductions.       One of  Title
V&#146;s few purported benefits to industry is the so-called permit shield
provisions, whereby the actions of a permitted source that come within the
permit terms would be shielded against enforcement by EPA, the states, or the
public.<A HREF="title56.html#28"><sup>28</sup></A>  For example, a subsequent determination that a permit
term allows more than it should have, or a post-permit change in EPA&#146;s
interpretation of an existing rule could not be used in an enforcement action
against a permitted facility.   <p>
<p>
     Unfortunately, numerous exceptions reduce the permit shield&#146;s utility to
industry.<A HREF="title56.html#29"><sup>29</sup></A>  For one, permit shield provisions are optional to
states.<A HREF="title56.html#30"><sup>30</sup></A>  When adopted, they are limited to terms explicitly
addressed in the permit, and do not include applicable requirements promulgated
after the permit was issued.<A HREF="title56.html#31"><sup>31</sup></A>  Nor do they preclude EPA from
reopening a permit to eliminate any perceived deficiencies.<A HREF="title56.html#32"><sup>32</sup></A>  In
addition, the statutory and regulatory language describing the permit shield is
so unclear that, in many cases, regulated sources cannot confidently rely on
their protections.<A HREF="title56.html#33"><sup>33</sup></A>  In effect, the permit shield provisions do
little to reduce the uncertainty of Title V. <p>

<H2>The Clinton EPA and Post-Permit Facility Changes</H2>
</CENTER>



<P>Most regulated sources regularly make operational changes at their
facilities that may affect emissions, such as manufacturing process or product
design changes or increases in production levels.  Title V subjects many such
changes to review, making it a permanent bureaucratic imposition on
industry.<A HREF="title56.html#34"><sup>34</sup></A>  The needs of industry to stay flexible and competitive,
particularly in an increasingly globalized marketplace, is at odds with Title
V.  <p>
<p>
     To complicate matters further, last August the EPA proposed a new rule
affecting facility changes, and is now in the process of proposing another
rule.<A HREF="title56.html#35"><sup>35</sup></A>  Under the EPA rules currently in effect, there are three
categories of operational changes, with different procedural requirements for
each.<A HREF="title56.html#36"><sup>36</sup></A>  These categories were conceived so that environmentally
unimportant changes, such as a minor rearrangement of an assembly line, the
replacement of a broken or obsolete piece of equipment, or a switch to a
slightly different fuel source, can be made relatively quickly and easily,
while more serious changes, such as those likely to cause an overall increase
in emissions beyond that which the permit currently allows, invoke a greater
number of procedural steps.<A HREF="title56.html#37"><sup>37</sup></A>  Unfortunately, the regulations would
impose procedural delays on some environmentally minor modifications.
Companies must wait for approval before implementing changes, or risk the
expense of undoing the change should it be subsequently rejected, as well as
legal penalties in some cases.<p>
<p>
     The Clinton EPA rules proposed on August 29, 1994 will make matters worse.
These rules expand the scope of operational changes subject to procedural
requirements, including changes that are environmentally inconsequential and/or
have already been subjected to considerable process at the state level, such as
the tens of thousands of changes made each year under minor New Source Review
(NSR) program.<A HREF="title56.html#38"><sup>38</sup></A>   This complex proposal was strongly criticized by
industry, and EPA is currently considering a revised proposal.     <p>
<p>
     Whatever final rule on permit revisions emerges, it will significantly
influence regulated industries&#146; ability to compete, particularly in fields
where changes are frequent and necessary.  Thus, it is important for industry
to take advantage of every opportunity under the law to maintain as much
flexiblity as possible.  Sources of air emissions, when applying for their
initial permits, can, to an extent, reduce future problems by incorporating
leeway into their applications.  For example, a source can easily switch from
one reasonably anticipated operating scenario to another if both are part of an
approved permit.<A HREF="title56.html#39"><sup>39</sup></A>  But there are limits to what will be allowed in
a permit, and what can be anticipated years in advance.     <p>
     In addition to operational changes, Title V&#146;s procedural obstacle course
must be repeated when EPA promulgates a new regulation or standard that applies
to a permitted source, when EPA decides to reopen a permit &#147;for
cause,&#148; or when the five year permit term is up.<A HREF="title56.html#40"><sup>40</sup></A>   <p>
<p>
     One concern is that the procedural guantlet may create perverse incentives.
Technological advances continually give industry more efficient and less
polluting means to operate.  But because changes at a facility, even additions
of new equipment that may lead to reduced emissions, must go through Title
V&#146;s costly and time consuming process, owners and operators may choose to
continue using existing equipment because it has already been approved.  For
example, energy intensive manufacturing facilities have the incentive to save
on energy costs by periodically updating their equipment base with newer, more
energy efficient systems.  But such a change may now trigger Title V delays,
providing a reason to maintain the status quo.   <p>
 <p>
     Fast-to-market industries, already anticipating difficulties in complying with
Title V in its original form, are particularly concerned about the EPA&#146;s
proposed rule.  An electronics company, for example, may make numerous process
changes annually, any one of which could now cause administrative delays.
Intel estimates it makes 30 to 60 such changes annually at each facility, and
the Title V delays caused by just one of those changes could allow foreign
competitors to beat them to market.<A HREF="title56.html#41"><sup>41</sup></A>  Tom Davis, Director of
Environmental and Safety Affairs at AT&amp;T, notes that &#147;approval of
every change and modification might take as long as the life cycle of many of
our products.&#148;<A HREF="title56.html#42"><sup>42</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     In effect, under the Clinton EPA&#146;s August proposal, Title V red tape
could tie up a high tech product long enough for a global competitor,
unhindered by Title V, to introduce it first.  It could even delay the
introduction of a product until it is obsolete. &#147;Unless the proposed rules
are changed, we will have to consider locating new facilities overseas,&#148;
says Tim Mohin, Government Affairs Manager at Intel.<A HREF="title56.html#43"><sup>43</sup></A>     <p>
     In addition, changes as simple as stepping up production to meet an unexpected
surge in demand for a particular product may require time consuming procedures.
The pharmaceuticals industry is particularly concerned.  Thomas White,
Associate Vice President of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, notes that the &#147;administrative procedures hinder our response to
natural disasters or epidemics which force us to shift production to meet the
greater-than-expected need for [a] medicine.&#148;<A HREF="title56.html#44"><sup>44</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     The August 29th proposed revisions came about in part as a result of legal
pressure from environmental groups, claiming that the existing rules allowing
industrial changes without public participation violate the
statute.<A HREF="title56.html#45"><sup>45</sup></A>  But the Clinton EPA also seemed anxious to eliminate
what it perceived as an anti-environmental leftover from the Bush years.  The
Bush Administration&#146;s Competitiveness Council, in one of the most heated
debates over the Clean Air Act&#146;s implementation, fought hard for a modicum
of operational flexibility in Title V.  Under these rules, many environmentally
insignificant facility changes could be implemented without procedural delays.
However, in a July 1994 press release announcing the proposed rule, the EPA
derided these efforts as a &#147;Bush Administration Competitiveness Council
decision to restrict the public&#146;s right to participate in environmental
decision-making.&#148;<A HREF="title56.html#46"><sup>46</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     But now, as a result of strong industry opposition and the political
consequences of the 1994 elections, EPA is in the process of promulgating
another new proposal.  Although it may restore some of the flexibility that the
August 29th proposal would have taken from industry, it is not likely to
eliminate all of the time consuming and costly procedural requirements imposed
on environmentally minor facility changes. <p>

<CENTER>
<H2>Private Involvement in the Permitting Process</H2>
</CENTER>
  

<P>     Title V is wide open to federal and environmental group involvement.  Initial
permits and renewals, reopenings of existing permits, and some revisions
necessitated by operational changes at a source are subject to a period of
public comment, and a public hearing if requested, giving environmental groups
or local citizens the chance to inject themselves into the
process.<A HREF="title56.html#47"><sup>47</sup></A>  Each state, in addition to its own review process, must
submit all of the above actions to the EPA (as well as to other states that may
be affected).<A HREF="title56.html#48"><sup>48</sup></A>  The EPA is given veto authority.  States must
remedy EPA objections, and the failure to do so will result in a denial of the
application.<A HREF="title56.html#49"><sup>49</sup></A>  If EPA declines to object, any person may petition
them to do so.<A HREF="title56.html#50"><sup>50</sup></A>  Denials of such petitions are subject to review in
federal court.<A HREF="title56.html#51"><sup>51</sup></A>  EPA also retains oversight authority for all state
programs, and can impose sanctions for failures in administration or
enforcement.<A HREF="title56.html#52"><sup>52</sup></A>  In addition, interested parties may challenge a
state&#146;s issuance of a permit in state court.<A HREF="title56.html#53"><sup>53</sup></A>  Thus, the EPA,
environmental organizations and NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) groups have several
opportunities under Title V to block industrial operations by petitioning and
litigating for permit denials.  This can extend the permitting process
indefinitely and greatly increase uncertainty for businesses subjected to Title
V (see the accompanying table).<p>
<p>
     Once issued, the permits will facilitate enforcement of the substantive
provisions in the Clean Air Act by the states, the EPA, and citizen groups.
These provisions are similar to those contained in the Clean Water Act.  To
assist the public, nearly all of the information in permit applications, final
permits, and, most importantly, the data generated by subsequent
self-monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements must be made
available to members of the public upon request, giving these parties access to
the evidence necessary to take advantage of the Clean Air Act&#146;s citizen
suit provisions.<A HREF="title56.html#54"><sup>54</sup></A>  Any failure to provide the data is itself a
violation of Title V.    <p>
<p>
     Title V is designed to facilitate citizen suits under the Clean Air Act.  The
&#147;standing&#148; requirements are very broad &#151; for practical purposes,
standing is no barrier to environmental groups under Title V.<A HREF="title56.html#55"><sup>55</sup></A>
Also, as a result of a suit, civil penalties can be imposed in addition to
injunctive relief.<A HREF="title56.html#56"><sup>56</sup></A>  Litigation expenses are also recoverable,
sometimes in excess of the actual costs incurred by the litigating
party.<A HREF="title56.html#57"><sup>57</sup></A>  In some cases, fines, rather than going to the U.S.
Treasury, may go to environmental groups for use in what are termed
&#147;beneficial mitigation projects.&#148;<A HREF="title56.html#58"><sup>58</sup></A>     <p>
<p>
     In many respects, Title V represents a shift away from the traditional
presumption of innocence &#151; industry is presumed guilty of violating the
Clean Air Act, and must continually establish its innocence.  Industrial
sources are obligated by law to publicly demonstrate compliance, and anyone has
the power to prosecute for non-compliance.<p>
<p>
     Proponents of such citizen suit provisions have held up the Clean Water Act as
a successful model.  The operating permits program under the Clean Water Act
was designed to have a large private enforcement element.  Some point to the
large numbers of citizen suits as proof of their utility.  More than 100 such
suits are filed each year, comprising a significant part of Clean Water Act
enforcement.  As Title V was modeled on the Clean Water Act, citizen suits will
likely be common under Title V as well.  However, the citizen suits under the
Clean Water Act have proven an inefficient enforcement vehicle, and it is
unlikely that they will fare better under the Clean Air Act.<A HREF="title56.html#59"><sup>59</sup></A><p>
<p>
     One problem with citizen suits under the Clean Water Act is that they tend to
be misdirected.  Most of the suits are aimed at large industrial sources of
water pollution, while such sources contribute less than 10 percent of current
water pollution.<A HREF="title56.html#60"><sup>60</sup></A>  The dominant sources of water pollution today,
municipalities and agriculture, are largely untouched.  Industry is an
attractive target for reasons that have nothing to do with environmental
protection.  For one, businesses, more often than municipalities, choose to
quickly settle rather than go to court, providing environmental groups a
financial incentive to litigate. Settlements can be expected to cover
litigation expenses and mitigation projects.  In addition, for ideological and
public relations reasons, the environmental groups who bring most of these
suits prefer to target large corporations.<A HREF="title56.html#61"><sup>61</sup></A>  The defendants in
citizen suits under Title V will likely be chosen for the same reasons.     <p>
<p>
     The extensive monitoring and recordkeeping data made available to the public,
combined with the Clean Air Act&#146;s numerous requirements, are conducive to
citizen suits for relatively minor infractions.  Such infractions can be
spotted with minimal effort, often requiring no more than a few hours&#146;
effort from a student volunteer taught to scan the data, and a potentially
money-making suit can be filed at low cost.  Many suits under the Clean Water
Act focus on insignificant technical violations.  These suits have legal
grounding, but do nothing to enhance environmental quality.<A HREF="title56.html#62"><sup>62</sup></A>  The
problem of such &#147;nuisance&#148; citizen suits will likely occur under
Title V as well.  In fact, the EPA has indicated that a source in full
compliance with all air emission limits is nonetheless subject to enforcement
for a technical violation.<A HREF="title56.html#63"><sup>63</sup></A> <p>
<p>
     It should be noted that the generous public participation opportunities,
both in the permitting process and in subsequent enforcement provisions, will
likely be dominated by the large professional environmental advocacy groups
such as the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club Legal Defense
Fund, with only minimal involvement from local grass roots organizations and
community groups.  While Title V is promoted by the EPA as a vehicle for direct
participation by citizens concerned about the air quality in their communities,
it is actually ill-suited for that purpose.<A HREF="title56.html#64"><sup>64</sup></A>  It is so legally and
procedurally complicated that it will discourage (if not preclude) all but
professional environmentalists from meaningful participation, except in those
extreme cases where NIMBY groups are activated.  Whether the involvement of
professional environmentalists reflects the real interests and concerns of the
local communities is a matter of considerable debate.  <p>
<p>
     The prominent role of EPA and environmental groups in Title V also diminishes
state control of operating permit programs.  This is ironic, as Title V has
actually been characterized by EPA officials as a program that gives power back
to the states.  However, forty-five states, including most of the heavily
industrialized ones, already have some type of state-run air emission operating
permit programs.  By most accounts, these programs are relatively efficient and
effective, at least compared to federal programs.  Title V brings these
programs under EPA control, giving the federal agency the opportunity to meddle
in the permitting process and micromanage industry when it so chooses.  In
effect, the EPA treats the state environmental agencies like subordinates,
delegating extensive duties while retaining ultimate responsibility.<p>
<p>
     Special interest groups, exploiting the generous public participation
opportunites and lax standing requirements discussed above, can also get into
the act of second-guessing industrial decisions.  Lawyers at the national
environmental organizations can simply peruse the <i>Federal Register</i> each
day, make a note of any pending new or revised permit applications they object
to, and deny or delay them with public hearings, petitions, and/or lawsuits,
even if they don&#146;t have a legitimate environmental concern.  Activists who
dislike a particular corporation or industry, or have a general anti-technology
bias, will gain a powerful new weapon.  Title V may also be misused by
competitors or disgruntled former employees.  Some see the permit program as
little more than a costly vehicle for the EPA, large environmental groups and
others to exert increased power over industry.  <p>

<CENTER>
<H2>Title V and the Rest of the Clean Air Act</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>An operating permits program has been a part of the Clean Water Act
since 1972.  In contrast, the Clean Air Act evolved, since 1970, into an
extremely complex and potent statute without such a program.  Title V must now
mesh with numerous Clean Air Act provisions, including some that may no longer
be necessary once Title V is in place.  But Title V was added to the Act
without compensating deletions or streamlining of the other titles, despite the
fact that it is supposed to be the single comprehensive enforcement vehicle for
all of the Act&#146;s substantive provisions.  As a result, Title V brings an
additional layer of bureaucracy to a statute already notorious for massive red
tape and redundancies.<A HREF="title56.html#65"><sup>65</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     EPA has yet to explain precisely how Title V fits in with state
implementation plans (SIPs), the new source review program (NSR), the air
toxics program, enhanced monitoring, and others, let alone other pre-existing
state-level requirements.  The questions raised by the complex interface
between these provisions and Title V is beyond the scope of this analysis.  EPA
clarification on these matters would be helpful.<p>

<H2>Last Minute Revisions to Title V</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>At the time of this writing, the EPA is in the process of promulgating a new
rule on Title V.  While the proposed rule has not yet been published in the
<i>Federal Register</i>, the EPA has released a white paper describing the
suggested revisions.<A HREF="title56.html#66"><sup>66</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The white paper offers several measures to reduce the paperwork requirements
associated with obtaining a Title V permit, clarify some ambiguities in
previous rules, and streamline certification of compliance procedures.  Most
importantly, it reduces the number of environmentally insignificant changes
under minor New Source Review that need to be included in Title V permits and
permit revisions.   <p>
<p>
     The white paper is a belated step in the right direction, but leaves the
fundamental problems of Title V intact.  Even if these changes become final
rules, Title V will remain a program imposing costly delays and red tape while
achieving few environmental gains.  In addition, the white paper has no legal
force, thus industry cannot be certain about the manner and extent that Title V
will be changed until the final regulations have been promulgated &#151;
something that will not happen for several more months.   EPA may choose to
narrow some of the revisions in the final rule, and environmental groups will
undoubtedly pressure them to do so.  And, since EPA has substantially altered
Title V rules several times already, it is not unreasonable to assume future
changes in 1996 or 1997, perhaps ones that, political circumstances allowing,
will eliminate the prospective concessions that the white paper suggests.  <p>

<H2>The Costs of Title V</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>As affected industries and state environmental agencies are preparing for
their Title V deadlines, they are realizing how expensive implementing this
program will be.  Compiling the permit applications, which require an
exhaustive amount of detail, running them through the gauntlet of procedural
steps, and complying with the monitoring and other ongoing requirements is
costly for regulated companies.  Compliance is so complicated that few
companies can handle it in-house, necessitating the use of consultants and
lawyers.  The costs of inital compliance can reach $200,000 per
facility.<A HREF="title56.html#67"><sup>67</sup></A>   Even the smallest affected sources will typically pay
tens of thousands to comply.<A HREF="title56.html#68"><sup>68</sup></A>  The impact will be particularly
severe for single-facility manufacturers and other small entities that come
under Title V, many of whom are already having difficulties absorbing high
regulatory compliance costs, and cannot afford much more. <p>
<p>
     States are also going to expend significant resources on Title V.  Many state
environmental agencies are doubling their staffs to meet the deadlines.  The
Ohio Environemntal Protection Agency, for example, is adding 100 to 150 people
and spending half its budget on Title V.<A HREF="title56.html#69"><sup>69</sup></A>    <p>
<p>
     The EPA estimates that the total costs, public and private, will exceed $500
million annually, including $14 million to expand its own
bureaucracy.<A HREF="title56.html#70"><sup>70</sup></A>  But the EPA concedes that the actual costs could be
considerably higher.<A HREF="title56.html#71"><sup>71</sup></A>  By analogy, the operating permits program
under the Clean Water Act has proven to be far more expensive than originally
estimated.<A HREF="title56.html#72"><sup>72</sup></A>  Most recently, EPA&#146;s estimates of the cost of its
storm water operating permits program are proving an order of magnitude too
low.<A HREF="title56.html#73"><sup>73</sup></A>  It would not be surprising if the same occurred with
estimates of direct costs associated with Title V.  One analyst estimates the
paperwork costs to industry alone at $34.1 billion dollars over the first five
years of the program.<A HREF="title56.html#74"><sup>74</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     More than the direct dollar costs of complying with Title V, the delays and
uncertainties created by its extensive procedural requirements pose the
greatest threat to industry.  The impact will be particularly severe in
fast-to-market industries as well as companies facing stiff competition from
foreign competitors.  <p>
<p>
     Title V will exact a heavy price in terms of opportunities foregone or shipped
overseas.  Some companies are willing to limit future expansion in order to
avoid Title V.  Others fear losing market share to foreign competitors.
Several are considering placing new facilities outside the U.S.  And the
burdens of initial compliance will become another regulatory barrier to entry,
particularly for fledgling companies.  While it is difficult to put the
indirect costs in dollar terms at this early stage, especially since the EPA
rules are still in a state of flux, they may be greater than the direct costs.
<p>
<p>
     There may even be costs to the environment.  Title V will delay the
replacement of older equipment and facilities with newer, more environmentally
benign ones.  Its onerous paperwork requirements will also divert resources
away from real pollution prevention.<p>
   <p>
<p>

<A NAME="benefits"></A>
<CENTER>
<H2>The Benefits of Title V?</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>The only purpose of Title V is the attainment of cleaner air through improved
enforcement of the substantive provisions in the Clean Air Act.<A HREF="title56.html#75"><sup>75</sup></A>
Unless Title V brings about significant improvements in air quality, the entire
program will amount to nothing more than regulating for regulating&#146;s sake.
While only time will tell, there appear to be limits on how much Title V can
really accomplish. <p>
<p>
     By most measures, the air has been getting dramatically cleaner for the past
several decades without the benefit of Title V, or any other of the 1990 Clean
Air Act&#146;s new provisions (see the figure below).  Some attribute this
success to the 1970 Clean Air Act and 1977 amendments, pointing to significant
declines in most regulated pollutants during the past two decades.<A HREF="title56.html#76"><sup>76</sup></A>
Others point to air quality improvements predating the modern environmental
movement and attribute the gains to increasing wealth and technological
progress, particularly among western nations during the 20th
century.<A HREF="title56.html#77"><sup>77</sup></A>  Either way, the 1990 Clean Air Act can take no credit.<p>
<p>
     Progress has been particularly impressive for pollutants emitted by stationary
industrial sources (as opposed to mobile sources or residences), the subject of
Title V.  There are significant downward trends for particulates and sulphur
dioxide, for example.<A HREF="title56.html#78"><sup>78</sup></A>  All of this has occurred without a federal
air operating permits program.  The empirical evidence does not suggest a Clean
Air Act under-enforcement problem, especially for the kinds of entities
required to obtain a permit under Title V.   <p>
<p>
     Against this backdrop of continuing success, Title V is now substantially
tightening Clean Air Act enforcement.  EPA has stated that Title V &#147;may
result in an improvement in air quality,&#148; but has not attempted to
quantify the expected additional reductions in air emissions.<A HREF="title56.html#79"><sup>79</sup></A>  It
seems that Title V, despite its high costs, will achieve no more than marginal
improvements at best.  At worst, it will impose tremendous costs for no
environmental benefits whatsoever, and may frustrate efforts to implement
environmental improvements. <p>
<p>
<p>

<A NAME="possible"></A>
<CENTER>
<H2>Possible Solutions</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>There are two approaches to improving Title V &#151; keeping the law intact
and allowing EPA to make changes through the regulatory process, or changing
the underlying legislation.  The latter is far preferable.  Despite the
seemingly new attitude at EPA expressed in its white paper, there is little
hope for a regulatory fix to Title V.  <p>
<p>
     Some of Title V&#146;s problems are written into the law itself, such as the
excessive public participation requirements and opportunities for judicial
review.<A HREF="title56.html#80"><sup>80</sup></A>  Further, EPA is not genuinely interested in alleviating
industry concerns.  In its August 29th proposed rule, the agency tipped its
hand regarding its philosophy towards Title V.  EPA was clearly bent on making
Title V as onerous as possible, to the shock of many in industry who thought
that the overall parameters of Title V had been agreed upon.  Only after a
severe backlash from industry and political changes in Congress did EPA express
regret about its proposal and recognize that industry may be adversely
affected.  EPA did not have a change of heart.  It is simply adjusting to new
political realities.  If the political winds shift once again, EPA will
undoubtedly take advantage of any opportunity to tighten the screws on Title V.
And, in its current form, the underlying statute gives EPA the latitude to do
so.  Unless legislatively constrained, the EPA is unlikely to make Title V
workable and keep it that way.<p>
<p>
     Moreover, environmental groups could frustrate attempts at moderation by the
EPA.  Under Title V, these groups will be capable of tying up industry in
procedural and legal knots, with or without the help of the EPA.  As the law
currently exists, there are few checks on their interference in the permitting
process, and they have given every indication that they will make full use of
Title V&#146;s public participation opportunities.  Lack of resources may not
be a limitation, since citizen suits could become profit centers, as they have
under the Clean Water Act.  Legislative change is necessary if reasonable
limits are to be placed on the degree of involvement from environmental
groups.<p>
<p>
     The real question is not whether legislative change is needed but how much.
The options are either making a few specific modifications to eliminate Title
V&#146;s most objectional elements (such as the constraints on timely
operational flexiblity caused by excessive and frequent procedural delays) or
the total elimination of Title V from the law.  <p>
<p>
     While a few targeted changes, such as the ones in the EPA&#146;s white paper,
can make Title V more tolerable than it currently is, there is no reason not to
do more.  No matter how modified, Title V will never achieve worthwhile results
at an acceptable cost.  Giving the federal government (and by extension,
environmental groups) that much discretion over industrial decisions is
incompatible with a free marketplace.  There now exists a unique window of
opportunity to eliminate Title V before it becomes an entrenched part of the
regulatory landscape.  If all that is accomplished is the softening of a
handful of Title V&#146;s more onerous aspects, the current period may one day
be looked back upon as a lost chance at getting rid of the most dispensable
title in the Clean Air Act. <p>

<A NAME="15"></A><sup>15</sup> There is a fundamental difference between water and air
permitting.  Water, by its very nature, is conducive to a permitting system.
Typically, the numerous small sources of water emissions at a locality flow
into one large source, and only the large sources need to be permitted.  Thus,
a manageably low number of permits can cover most water emissions.  Air
emissions, however, are much more diffuse.  They are immediately released at
the hundreds of thousands of points where they are created.  Compared to water
permits, it will take a much larger number of air permits to account for the
same percentage of total emissions.  Although no figures exist, the percentage
of emissions covered by the approximately 34,000 sources being initially
permitted is probably small.  This is one reason air permits are unlikely to
achieve results worth the costs.<p>
<A NAME="16"></A><sup>16</sup> 40 C.F.R. [[section]]70.2 (&#147;Potential to emit&#148;).<p>
<A NAME="17"></A><sup>17</sup> 99 percent of the grain elevators in Iowa, if constantly being
filled and emptied throughout the year, would emit more than 100 tons of dust,
thus requiring a permit.  In reality, elevators operate far less frequently,
and emit considerably less than 100 tons of dust.  They are filled during the
harvest, and slowly emptied throughout the rest of the year.  In fact, a single
mid-sized elevator, if constantly operated throughout the year as hypothesized
in the &#147;potential to emit&#148; definition, could handle more than the
entire U.S. corn crop.  Compliance with Title V, for a typical grain elevator
requires filling out a 280 page form, which is beyond the capabilities of most
elevator owners, necessitating the hiring of consultants who charge $25,000 to
$40,000. (Testimony of Rick Keith, Manager of the West Bend Elevator Company,

<H1>NATURE'S HORMONE FACTORY<BR>
Endocrine Disrupters<BR> in the Natural Environment</H1>
by Jonathan Tolman
<P>
<BR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>
For millions of years plants have been quietly producing chemicals.  Through
countless generations they have been perfecting a potpourri of chemicals, some
benign some deadly.  As the ability to detect, isolate, measure and test
chemicals found in nature has progressed a starling fact has emerged: hundreds
of plants appear to produce endocrine disrupters.<p>
<p>
	Many of the plants that produce phytoestrogens and other endocrine disrupters
are edible.  In laboratory test more than 43 plants and foods found in the
human diet have been shown to be estrogenically active.  Many phytoestrogen
containing plants are common elements of our diet.  Such grains as corn and
wheat form a significant part of the human diet.  Many legumes have also shown
a surprising capacity for phytoestrogen production. <p>
<p>
	Although much more work has been done on phytoestrogens, some work has been
done on plant chemicals which are known to effect the production of sperm.
Only a handful have been discovered in the human diet.  Of these the most
common is cottonseed oil.  Although cottonseed oil is rarely sold as a
vegetable oil, it is commonly used in manufactured snack foods.<p>
	<p>
	A great deal of attention has recently been given to the fact that synthetic
chemicals have exhibited estrogenic effects in laboratory studies.  The
chemicals most prominently cited are PCBs and DDT, both of which have been
banned in the United States.  Compared with phytoestrogens, the concern over
synthetic estrogens may be somewhat overstated.  The estrogenic effects from
the phytoestrogens in our diet are an estimated 40 million times greater than
those from synthetic chemicals.  To date, however, there is no concrete
evidence that either pose a risk to human health.<P>

Enterprise Index, which analyzes all congressional votes judged to have a
significant impact on competition, freedom, and opportunity in the U.S.
economy. <p>
<p>

and Atlanta; a writer/producer for current affairs programs at the Voice of
America; and a consulting producer for two television programs, &#147;The
McLaughlin Group&#148; and &#147;John McLaughlin One-on-One.&#148;  Mr. Miller
was also a free lance writer on continuing assignment for <I>Reader&#146;s
Digest</I> and an investigative reporter for syndicated columnist Donald
Lambro.  <p>
<p>
Mr. Miller received his law degree from Duke Law School and a B.A. cum laude in
political science from New York University.  He is a member of the State Bar of
Georgia.   <p>
<p>
Mr. Miller&#146;s work on public policy issues has appeared in such

<H2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>World trade has been significantly liberalized during the last four decades;
average tariffs have fallen from 40 percent in the 1950s to less than 5 percent
today.  The lowering of selected tariffs has not meant an end to protectionism,
however.  Increased competition brought on by growing trade has put pressure on
governments to find new ways to protect domestic production in the absence of
tariffs.  A new rationale for protectionism is emerging which argues for the
restriction of trade as a means of preserving and protecting the environment.
The &#147;greening&#148; of protectionism and the merging of environmental
standards into international trade agreements could fundamentally change the
world trading system.<p>
<p>
     Environmentalist objections to trade and proposals for the
&#147;greening&#148; of trade require greater political management and
regulation of the private sector; thus, they are fundamentally an assault on
free trade principles.  Fearing lower environmental standards in the Third
World, environmentalists call for new trade barriers to combat what they see as
&#147;eco-dumping.&#148;  To business interests fearful of competition,
however, such trade barriers are just a disguised form of protectionism.  Green
trade measures, championed as a means to harmonize environmental standards, are
pumping new life into the old politics of protectionism, industrial policy, and
over-regulation.  The environmentalist critique of trade is rapidly becoming
conventional wisdom.<p>
<p>
     Green protectionism is premised upon the idea of &#147;market failure&#148;
and a theory of ecological central planning called &#147;sustainable
development.&#148;  However, environmental quality is only sustainable in the
context of free market institutions and free trade.  Markets have significant
environmental benefits, including:<p>

<UL>
<LI>market forces promote increased efficiency in energy and materials use;<p>

<LI>economic growth creates the wealth and technological resources necessary
to produce environmental improvement;<p>

<LI>pollution problems decline in severity as per capita income rises.<p>
<p>

</UL>
<p>
     A disturbing feature of green protectionism is eco-imperialism, in which
developed countries impose unattainable and unaffordable environmental
standards on the Third World, at the expense of economic development and the
poor.  Moreover, green trade measures intrude on the sovereignty of Third World
peoples, depriving them of the use of natural resources such as fisheries,
rainforests, and energy supplies.<p>
<p>
     The June 1992 Earth Summit produced a blueprint for environmental planning and
international policy coordination, which calls for &#147;sustainable
development through trade liberalization.&#148;  An emerging body of
international law for global environmental protection is beginning to have
profound impacts on trade and international economic affairs.  International
environmental agreements and treaties may be harbingers of sweeping new global
trade and environment policies.  Many environmental agreements conflict with
multilateral trade rules, and pressure is mounting to incorporate international
environmental policies into government-negotiated trade rules.  Among the most
important environmental treaties which employ trade measures are:<p>

<UL>
<LI>The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer;<p>

<LI>The Basel Convention on the Control of  Transboundary Movements of  Hazardous            Wastes and Their Disposal; and<p>

<LI>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of  Wild Fauna
and       Flora.<p>
</UL>

<p>
     Green protectionism gained a foothold with the environmental side agreement to
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a regional trade bloc.  Carol
Browner, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, calls the
NAFTA between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, &#147;the &#145;greenest&#146;
trade agreement ever negotiated.&#148;<p>
<p>
     The green trade agenda is now focused on the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT), the system of world trade rules.  GATT was designed in 1948 to
expand trade by reducing tariffs and other trade barriers.  Historically,
GATT&#146;s free trade orientation has prevented it from incorporating
environmental standards or other social policy objectives unrelated to trade.
GATT&#146;s bureaucratic growth remains stunted due to the fact that its
provisions are extremely difficult to amend.  Lacking an international
organization, a binding charter, or enforcement provisions, the GATT is
relatively powerless and non-binding.  The proposed World Trade Organization
(WTO), negotiated by the Clinton administration, would be an international
organization with greater legal authority to enforce world trade rules through
binding dispute settlement procedures.  WTO provisions are more easily revised
and interpreted, and modifications to world trade rules could be negotiated
through a WTO Committee on Trade and the Environment.<p>
<p>
     If successful, the greening of trade would institute a new generation of
environmental regulatory controls, trade sanctions, and regulatory
harmonization.  Bureaucratic centralization is incompatible with the objective
of free trade.  Further government intervention in the global market can only
result in the establishment of protected cartels and suppression of competitive
enterprise.<p>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
</CENTER>

<P> World trade has been expanding rapidly for several decades, even outpacing
global production.  In the U.S. alone, the economy quadrupled in size since the
early 1950s, while exports grew sevenfold.<A HREF="trade7.html#1"><sup>1</sup></A>  In
recent years the
trend has been even more pronounced.  Trade&#146;s share of the U.S. economy
rose from 5 percent of GNP in the 1970s to 15 percent by the late
1980s.<A HREF="trade7.html#2"><sup>2</sup></A>   In part, the growth in world trade is the
result of a
reduction of average tariffs from 40 percent in the 1950s to less than 5
percent today.<A HREF="trade7.html#3"><sup>3</sup></A>  In addition, technological
innovation has reduced
the costs of transportation and communication, easing the flow of goods and
services.<p>
<p>
     By the early 1970s, world trade had significantly liberalized under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but the lowering of selected tariffs
did not mean an end to protectionism.  Increased competition brought on by
growing trade put pressure on governments to find new ways to protect domestic
production in the absence of tariffs.  The terms of GATT offered countries
&#147;a freeway to still more protectionism,&#148; through subsidies,
standards, regulations, and other non-tariff barriers during the
1980s.<A HREF="trade7.html#4"><sup>4</sup></A>  Though average tariffs are currently low in
the U.S.,
extremely high tariffs remain in place for key products, especially those of
greatest importance to developing countries.<A HREF="trade7.html#5"><sup>5</sup></A> 
Important sectors,
such as agriculture, remain protected by massive price support programs.
Subsidies and import restrictions protect sugar, cotton, tobacco, peanuts and
other commodities.  The Multi-Fiber Arrangement, though negotiated under the
auspices of GATT for &#147;the reduction of trade barriers,&#148; allowed the
U.S. to impose quota restrictions on textile and apparel imports.<A
HREF="trade7.html#6"><sup>6</sup></A>
Likewise, the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences program (GSP) utilizes
GATT provisions allowing preferential tariff treatment to developing country
exports.<A HREF="trade7.html#7"><sup>7</sup></A>  Provisions in the U.S. Harmonized Tariff
Schedules
provide differential treatment for certain U.S. products assembled abroad and
imported back to the U.S., enabling multinational corporations to engage in
Third World production-sharing.<A HREF="trade7.html#8"><sup>8</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Concerns about &#147;fair trade&#148; prompted the U.S. to depart somewhat
from the GATT process in order to negotiate a regional trade bloc in North
America, and related trade arrangements in Latin America via the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative and the Caribbean Basin Initiative.<A
HREF="trade7.html#9"><sup>9</sup></A>  These
preferential trade schemes are a mixed blessing since they promote trade and
investment diversion, rather than true free trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#10"><sup>10</sup></A> 
Separately,
the U.S. government has negotiated import quotas for steel, autos, machine
tools, and ocean shipping.<A HREF="trade7.html#11"><sup>11</sup></A>  During the 1980s, the
U.S. signed over
170 bilateral trade agreements.<A HREF="trade7.html#12"><sup>12</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The fastest growing form of protectionism takes place through administrative
trade retaliation laws.<A HREF="trade7.html#13"><sup>13</sup></A>  Section 301 of the Trade
and Tariff Act
of 1974 authorizes the U.S. Trade Representative to take action to eliminate
foreign barriers to U.S. exports.  In addition, the 1988 Super 301 provision
sets timetables for the removal of foreign trade barriers, and authorizes
punitive and retaliatory trade sanctions against the imports of trading
partners the U.S. considers to be unfair traders.  These laws amply demonstrate
that protectionists desire &#147;free trade abroad but not so much at
home.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#14"><sup>14</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The merits of U.S. trade actions are often highly dubious.  Under anti-dumping
laws, the individual companies can initiate procedures to restrict imports
which they feel are priced too low.  Trade bureaucracies find dumping in
approximately 95 percent of the cases investigated.<A
HREF="trade7.html#15"><sup>15</sup></A>  Likewise,
countervailing duties may be placed on imports which the U.S. determines to
have benefited from government subsidies.  In one example from 1986, the U.S.
countervailed a Thai rice subsidy 100 times smaller than the U.S. subsidy to
its own rice growers.<A HREF="trade7.html#16"><sup>16</sup></A>  During the 1980s,
Congress broadened the
scope of administrative trade barriers, leading to a steady increase in the
number of complaints filed.<p>
<p>
     Pursuant to Section 301, the U.S. government has made prolific use of GATT
dispute settlement procedures.  As a result, according to the U.S. trade
representative, &#147;we [the U.S.] have been the complaining party in the
dispute settlement system in the GATT more often than any other
member...&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#17"><sup>17</sup></A>  Because of this, Congress in
1988 authorized the
President to strengthen GATT&#146;s dispute settlement system to encourage
&#147;tougher&#148; trade retaliation procedures.  In addition, the U.S. sought
to preserve its protectionist trade laws in the most recent Uruguay Round of
GATT trade negotiations.  As the U.S. trade representative reported to
Congress:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The Uruguay Round will not impair the effective enforcement of our trade laws,
especially Section 301 and our anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws.  Our
trade laws will continue to be our most important and effective response to
dumping and subsidies that injure U.S. industries.  As a result of the Uruguay
Round agreements, Section 301 will be even more effective than it has been in
the past in addressing foreign unfair trade barriers.  We have an improved
dispute settlement system with tight time periods for action, panel reports
that cannot be blocked by one party and the right of cross-sectoral
retaliation.<A HREF="trade7.html#18"><sup>18</sup></A><p>

     Though non-tariff barriers are proliferating, world trade continues its
expansion.  Yet a new rationale for protectionism is emerging which argues for
the restriction of trade as a means of preserving and protecting the
environment.  This form of &#147;green&#148; protectionism demands that high
environmental standards be linked to trade.  &#147;Environmentalism in various
guises has crept kudzu-like into the international trade arena so that we are
currently witnessing a &#145;greening&#146; of international trade,&#148;
writes William H. Lash III, associate professor of law at George Mason
University.<A HREF="trade7.html#19"><sup>19</sup></A>  The &#147;greening&#148; of trade

<H2>The Environmental Critique of Trade</H2>
</center>

<P>     Environmental objections to trade and proposals for the &#147;greening&#148;
of trade are a fundamental assault on free trade principles.  &#147;A more
accurate name than the persuasive label &#145;free trade&#146;...is deregulated
international commerce,&#148; scolds World Bank environmentalist Herman
Daly.<A HREF="trade7.html#20"><sup>20</sup></A>  International regulation of trade is
necessary &#147;to
build environmental responsibility into economic activity,&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#21"><sup>21</sup></A>
and to assure that &#147;trade meets the goals of environmentally sustainable
development,&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#22"><sup>22</sup></A> in the words of Jay Hair,
president of one of
the largest environmental organizations in the U.S., the National Wildlife
Federation.  As trade has become globalized, environmentalists argue, so has
the magnitude of environmental degradation.  &#147;Further growth beyond the
present scale is overwhelmingly likely to increase costs more rapidly than it
increases benefits, thus ushering in a new era of &#145;uneconomic growth&#146;
that impoverishes rather than enriches,&#148; the foreboding Daly
intones.<A HREF="trade7.html#23"><sup>23</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The &#147;green&#148; trade agenda necessarily entails greater political
management and regulation of the private sector to safeguard social and
environmental goals.  In the eyes of environmental groups like the Worldwatch
Institute, &#147;trade can bring greater prosperity and improved quality of
life, if properly managed, but if not it can become an engine of enormous
destruction&#148; of biodiversity, the global climate, and natural
resources.<A HREF="trade7.html#24"><sup>24</sup></A>  Fearing destruction of the
&#147;global&#148;
environment, environmental groups call for radical alterations in the free
market system by government.  The World Wildlife Fund, for instance, takes aim
at the market&#146;s calculation of prices:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The environmental impacts and consumption of natural resources stemming from
the production of goods are rarely fully accounted for in the goods&#146;
market prices.  The costs of these impacts are said to be
&#145;externalized.&#146;  International trade generates adverse impacts on the
environment and natural resources largely as a result of the externalization of
these costs at the production stage.<A HREF="trade7.html#25"><sup>25</sup></A><p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
     The lack of &#147;accurate&#148; pricing in a market leads to economic
distortions, which prevent environmental quality from reaping the benefits of
the market&#146;s efficiency.  Instead, the environment becomes a victim of
human exploitation. <p>
<p>
 Robert Repetto, senior economist at the World Resources Institute, calls for
&#147;effective legal, regulatory, or economic policies [to] substitute for the
lack of markets in environmental quality.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#26"><sup>26</sup></A><p>

     Environmentalists are particularly concerned with trade between progressive
nations (with high regulatory standards) and more free-market or less developed countries (with lower regulatory standards).  Nations without strict regulatory
standards attract accelerated flows of international capital investment,
leading to the creation of &#147;pollution havens.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#27"><sup>27</sup></A>  The lack
of stringent environmental regulation gives firms an unfair competitive trade
advantage, amounting to an environmental subsidy which enables firms to
undercut prices in export markets.  This phenomenon is called environmental
dumping, or &#147;eco-dumping.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#28"><sup>28</sup></A>  Vice
President Al Gore, in
his bestselling <i>Earth in the Balance</i>, argues that &#147;weak and
ineffectual enforcement of pollution control measures should also be included
in the definition of unfair trading practices.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#29"><sup>29</sup></A> <p>
<p>
     The remedy for eco-dumping is a mixture of protectionism, industrial policy,
and regulation.  To offset the unfair cost advantages of another nation, a
government can impose tariffs on the offending nation&#146;s imports
(protectionism), or a government can subsidize the exports of its politically
preferred businesses (industrial policy).<A HREF="trade7.html#30"><sup>30</sup></A>  The
purpose of import
and export restrictions and subsidies is to induce nations to adopt stricter
environmental standards, &#147;internalizing&#148; the externalized costs of
unenlightened environmental policies.  In this manner, nations can
&#147;harmonize&#148; their trade-related regulations and risk assessment
practices to facilitate an overall improvement in standards.<A
HREF="trade7.html#31"><sup>31</sup></A>
Harmonization of production standards is envisioned as a means of establishing
minimum environmental standards, either in the context of a regional trade
agreement, or through a system of global environmental
standards.<A HREF="trade7.html#32"><sup>32</sup></A><p>

<H2>Free Trade and Environmental Quality</H2>

<b>Market &#147;Failure&#148;?</b><p>
<p>
     Environmentalist opposition to free trade stems from harsh scrutiny of
&#147;market failure&#148; and the uncritical acceptance of political
approaches to environmental protection.  Wherever the market &#147;fails&#148;
to protect environmental values to the desired degree, political intervention
is assumed to be the solution.  Because all economic activities have some
impact on environmental quality, there is no end in sight for government
intervention in the marketplace.<A HREF="trade7.html#33"><sup>33</sup></A>  Viewing
economic growth as
incompatible with a healthy environment, the environmental lobby insists on
political restraints on private activity, both domestically and
internationally.  The environmentalist perspective is rapidly becoming
conventional wisdom.  <p>
<p>
     Ultimately, however, there is no contradiction between a commercial free
market and environmental quality.  Numerous academic studies demonstrate a
positive link between economic growth and environmental quality.  Princeton 
University economists Gene M. Grossman and Alan B. Krueger have found that
&#147;economic growth tends to alleviate pollution problems once a
country&#146;s per capita income reaches about $4,000 to $5,000 U.S. dollars.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#34"><sup>34</sup></A>  In
fact, levels of sulfur dioxide are significantly lower in countries that engage
in significant international trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#35"><sup>35</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The link between economic growth and environmental improvement becomes clear
in reviewing the ecological successes of the developed world.  According to the
World Bank, the economies of OECD countries have grown by approximately 80
percent since 1970.<A HREF="trade7.html#36"><sup>36</sup></A>  During that time period,
these countries have
achieved nearly universal access to clean water supplies, sanitation, and waste
disposal.  Air quality has improved dramatically, with particulate emissions
dropping by 60 percent and sulfur dioxide emissions by 38 percent.  Pollution
from large shipping accidents and oilspills has declined, and nearly all
countries have increased the acreage of their forestlands.  Similar statistics
for the developing world demonstrate that improved environmental quality in all
of these areas is generally associated with higher income.<A
HREF="trade7.html#37"><sup>37</sup></A><p>
<p>
     There are a variety of reasons for the beneficial relationship between growth
and environmental quality.  As economic activity increases, so does human
interaction with nature.  Since most human actions strive to improve quality of
life, environmental amenities receive greater attention.  Environmental
improvements are particularly significant in market-oriented economies.  The
societal institutions that facilitate prosperity, such as property rights,
market-based prices, and overall economic freedom, are equally essential for
rising environmental quality.  These institutions form the bulwark of private
stewardship of natural resources, and thus, sustainable management practices.
Market forces naturally drive economies to become more efficient by reducing
the costs associated with energy and materials use, and waste disposal.
Moreover, since growth creates wealth, greater economic resources are made
available to address the primary human needs, which must be fulfilled before
individuals will focus on environmental amenities.  According to Marian
Radetski, an economist at the University of Luleo in Sweden, &#147;rich
consumers are more willing than poor ones to spend substantial parts of their
income for safeguarding high environmental standards.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#38"><sup>38</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Furthermore, poverty is a significant cause of environmental degradation.
Poorer people are more likely to exploit environmental commons in search of
fuelwood and other basic necessities, causing overhunting, overfishing, and
stress to water resources.<A HREF="trade7.html#39"><sup>39</sup></A>   Lacking significant
employment
opportunities and productive land, the Third World poor often must utilize
marginal lands for food production, attempting to farm in deserts or tropical
forests. The result is environmental degradation in the form of soil erosion,
desertification, and deforestation.<A HREF="trade7.html#40"><sup>40</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Moreover, economic growth enables societies to advance in ways that are
environmentally beneficial.  At earlier stages of development, pollution
problems are likely to be more threatening to human beings.  Air and
water-borne hazards can result in immediate illness and/or death.  As societies advance, pollution
problems decline in severity.  Environmental concerns generally become less
life-threatening, and more aesthetic in nature.<p>
<p>
     Even though growth coincides with environmental improvement, &#147;market
failure&#148; is often blamed for the existence of pollution itself.  Many
environmentalists consider the system of capitalism and private enterprise inherently responsible
for environmental externalities.  Only government regulation in the public
interest can force businesses to internalize social costs, according to this
argument, and such regulation must be extended to trade.  Thus, there is a
strong anti-market bias to environmentalist arguments.<p>
<p>
     The environmentalist argument leads inexorably to central planning; any human
activity with environmental impacts must be politically controlled.  Government
is entrusted to effectively foster only the types of economic growth which are
environmentally friendly, while preventing the types that are not.  Yet no
government has the capability of assimilating the vast amounts of economic,
technological, and scientific data necessary to make such determinations.  The
task of ecological central planning is no easier than economic central
planning.<A HREF="trade7.html#41"><sup>41</sup></A><p>
<p>
     If market failure was truly the cause of pollution, we would expect that the
absence of markets in the centrally planned economies of Eastern Europe would
have been environmentally beneficial.  On the contrary, without the profit
motive of the market, some of the worst environmental degradation in the world
has occurred in the former Soviet Bloc.<A HREF="trade7.html#42"><sup>42</sup></A>  Central
planning failed
largely because it could not efficiently distribute resources.  Neither could
it safeguard environmental resources.  Data from sample market and socialist
economies shows that market economies become more resource-efficient with
economic growth.  Socialist countries, however, are generally more resource
intensive, even in times of recession.<A HREF="trade7.html#43"><sup>43</sup></A>  Without a
profit motive,
there is little incentive for political owners of a resource to conserve for
the future in order to maximize returns.<A HREF="trade7.html#44"><sup>44</sup></A><p>
<p>
<A NAME="markets"></A>
<b>Free Markets Are Truly Green</b><p>
<p>
     In a market economy, environmental and other costs are internalized more
thoroughly via the price system.  Internalization is made possible by the
extension of property rights and a system of voluntary exchange, to an ever
wider array of resources.  As environmental and other resources are integrated
into the market system of voluntary exchange, information is conveyed through
prices, which encourages more creative resolutions of environmental and other
problems.  Falling prices for energy and raw materials demonstrate that the
market&#146;s technological improvements and efficiency gains are making
resources more abundant.<A HREF="trade7.html#45"><sup>45</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The &#147;market failure&#148; argument misses the fundamental cause of
pollution &#151; the lack of private property institutions.  Individuals are
far more likely to care for the environmental sustainability of their own
resources.  Logically, the less common property there is, the less pollution
will be tolerated by a society of individual property owners.  Likewise, by
internalizing external costs, market forces obviate the need for corrective
regulations.  By reducing the scope of government intervention, markets enable
individuals to seek redress from those who impose unwanted pollution costs.
Political owner/managers are incapable of seeking adequate redress primarily
because they cannot calculate accurate prices and values for environmental
amenities.<A HREF="trade7.html#46"><sup>46</sup></A>  Thus, a free market effectively
implements the
&#147;polluter pays principle,&#148; making capitalism the only form of
sustainable development.<A HREF="trade7.html#47"><sup>47</sup></A>  Pollution externalities
could be reduced
further by eliminating the remaining barriers to full private property
rights.<p>
<p>
     Environmentalists need not fear that expansion of trade will produce growth in
pollution.  To the extent that expanded trade is generating economic growth,
environmental quality should also improve.  This fundamental economic reality
does not change simply because goods and services are crossing borders.  The
same free market institutions which generate economic gains also generate
environmental gains.  To the extent that protective tariffs and subsidies
restrict and distort trade, they reduce income and, hence, the demand for
environmental quality.<p>
<p>
     Environmentalists have more to fear from protectionism.  Current agricultural
policies cause major distortions of world food production and
trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#48"><sup>48</sup></A>  Industrial countries encourage agricultural
production
with price supports and other subsidies totaling $200 billion per year, while
developing countries discourage agricultural production through tax and trade
policies.<A HREF="trade7.html#49"><sup>49</sup></A>  Agricultural subsidies in the U.S., for
example, are
responsible for intense chemical pesticide and fertilizer use on farmlands.  By
fostering inefficient land use, U.S. subsidies and land setaside programs
contribute to soil erosion and loss of wetlands and forests.  Federal
mismanagement also encourages farmers to overplant while discouraging crop
rotation, depleting soils and exacerbating pest eradication.<A
HREF="trade7.html#50"><sup>50</sup></A>  By
scaling back interventionist government policies, trade liberalization would
have significant environmental benefits.<p>
<p>
<A NAME="focus"></A>
<b>Focus on Global Environment Fosters Ecological Central Planning</b><p>
<p>
     Environmental problems tend to become oversimplified when characterized as
global problems in which responsibility for their solution is commonly shared
by all.  It is no coincidence that global solutions for environmental
protection require global institutions.  In reality, there is no single
&#147;environment&#148; or &#147;ecology&#148; to protect, but rather a vast
array of environmental resources owned by individuals and governments.  Viewing
environmental issues in global terms can only promote state-directed, command
and control regulation, as well as heightened political control of resources.<p>
<p>
     This perspective also leads to a consideration of trade matters as if
government controls the country&#146;s &#147;trade&#148; for the good of the
overall &#147;economy&#148; (or the &#147;international trading system&#148;
for the good of &#147;the international marketplace&#148;), neglecting the
diversity of trading interests of all individuals, as both consumers or
producers.  Indeed, environmentalists propose that care for the global
environment necessitates that the traditional concept of a nation-state be
revised, and that global regulation and governance are required.<A
HREF="trade7.html#51"><sup>51</sup></A>
Because of the global character of the environment, &#147;the distinctions
between jurisdictional and extrajurisdictional interests and rights become
increasingly blurred.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#52"><sup>52</sup></A><p>

<A NAME="green"></A>
<P><b>Green Protectionism</b><p>
<p>
     Various measures have been proposed to counteract &#147;ecological
dumping&#148; and to promote fair competition &#147;on a level playing
field.&#148;  Countries with lower standards should &#147;harmonize up&#148;
their standards; countervailing duties should be imposed against imports not
subject to certain environmental standards; and domestic industries subject to
higher environmental standards should be subsidized in order to restore their
trade competitiveness.<A HREF="trade7.html#53"><sup>53</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The many variations on these proposals to incorporate environmental standards
into trade claim to promote freer trade by minimizing the differences between
the environmental protection policies of separate countries.<A
HREF="trade7.html#54"><sup>54</sup></A>  Yet
precisely the opposite has happened when GATT has attempted harmonization of
other government policies in areas such as antidumping, subsidies, technical
standards, customs valuation, import licensing, and procurement.<A
HREF="trade7.html#55"><sup>55</sup></A>
The promulgation of new international rules on these matters has led to
increased litigation and disputes as countries have utilized the wording of
GATT codes to justify new forms of discriminatory protectionism and managed
trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#56"><sup>56</sup></A>  Anti-dumping laws have been the most
virulent of these
practices.  Prior to 1990, roughly two dozen countries had anti-dumping
statutes.  By 1994, 40 countries had adopted them, and soon all GATT
signatories will adopt anti-dumping laws pursuant to harmonization under the
Uruguay Round.<A HREF="trade7.html#57"><sup>57</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Harmonization of environmental policies would be no different.  Since 1979,
GATT standards codes have urged harmonization of technical regulations using a
set of international standards.  Though intended to improve the transparency of
standards for businesses, harmonization has led to heightened use of technical
regulations.  Between 1980 and 1990, GATT recorded 211 instances where nations
had adopted technical regulations under the standards code which had
significant adverse effects on trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#58"><sup>58</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Harmonization under GATT also discourages reform of excessive regulations,
because deregulation is perceived politically as a unilateral concession to
trading partners.<A HREF="trade7.html#59"><sup>59</sup></A>  In practice, then, harmonization
under the
auspices of GATT has served to codify existing measures, which were intended to
disguise protectionism through formalized procedures.<A
HREF="trade7.html#60"><sup>60</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Some standards impede trade only incidentally, as with the use of metric
versus imperial measurements; others pose far more serious non-tariff barriers,
such as pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food standards coupled with rigid inspection and
customs procedures.  To the extent that such standards impose transaction
costs, they distort trade and protect domestic producers.  Even if such
standards treat all products equally, they still raise production costs.  If
product standards are strict
enough, causing foreign suppliers to withdraw from a market, they are no
different than an outright prohibition on imports.<A
HREF="trade7.html#61"><sup>61</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Harmonization of environmental policies would be inappropriate for many
reasons apart from free trade.  Environmental policies are unique to each
country, depending on factors such as natural resource endowments, pollution
absorptive capacity, and underlying material wealth, not to mention cultural
preferences.<A HREF="trade7.html#62"><sup>62</sup></A>  Some communities in rural or
coastal areas can
tolerate higher emissions than urban populations.  Some communities are better
equipped than others to deal with the income trade-offs involved in
environmental regulation.  Wealthier countries can afford greater trade-offs
than poorer countries.  Wealthier countries are also more likely to have
advanced technologies and equipment, while poorer countries and state-directed
economies typically make use of obsolete production methods.  Forcing higher
standards on Third World as a pre-condition for trade would be
counterproductive.<p>
<p>
     &#147;It is only in rare cases that [two countries] will have identical
environmental standards and expenditures in the same industry,&#148; argues
Columbia University&#146;s Jagdish Bhagwati; &#147;To demand that such
harmonization be made a precondition for free trade is therefore to ask for
something that makes no economic sense at all.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#63"><sup>63</sup></A>  Bhagwati
also points out that in industrial countries, rapid economic development has
depended on higher levels of pollution in the early stages, with clean-up
coming later on.<p>
<p>
     If environmental policy differences are unfair trade distortions, the same
reasoning can be used to indict a myriad of other policy
differences.<A HREF="trade7.html#64"><sup>64</sup></A>  Tax rates and incentives, robust
education policies,
and skill-based immigration policies all impact a nation&#146;s trade
competitiveness.  Other intangible factors, such as technological, historical
and socio-economic circumstances, vary from country to country.  To view all of
these differences as sources of unfair advantage is to justify widespread use
of trade barriers, a justification easily exploited by businesses eager to
blame declining competitive performance on cost differences abroad.  In its
&#147;Trade and the Environment&#148; report, the GATT Secretariat properly
asks, &#147;Where is the line to be drawn if the competitive implications of
differences in so many government policies are to become a source of demands
for the neutralization of the consequences for trade?&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#65"><sup>65</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The requirement that trade with another nation be conditioned on its
environmental standards is a recipe for unbridled protectionism, particularly
when mixed with the inherent tendencies of bureaucracies.  If having lower
environmental
standards is considered an unfair trade practice, countervailing duties would
have to be imposed in the same way as U.S. laws remedy dumping and subsidies.
Thus, the amount of the duty would have to be calculated by a government
bureaucracy, which would make its decisions based on political factors and
objectives.  According to Bhagwati, &#147;anyone familiar with the way dumping
calculations are made knows that the Environmental Protection Agency could come
up with virtually any estimates it cared to produce.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#66"><sup>66</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Even imputing the best possible motives to government officials, it would be
exceedingly difficult to achieve real environmental improvements using trade
measures.  Countervailing duties or tariffs would create new barriers to the
expansion of trade, certainly reducing potential income gains for both
producers and consumers.  Trade measures are relatively ineffective against
countries that strenuously object to outside pressure.  A government under the
threat of coercive trade measures is not likely to alter environmental policies
to suit the needs of a foreign government.  Trade measures are more likely to
inspire nationalism in the target country and resentment against foreign
interference.  Consequently, trade measures to promote reduction of trade
barriers have seldom achieved their objectives.<A
HREF="trade7.html#67"><sup>67</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Governments are easily influenced by interest group prodding for
&#147;unwarranted, trade-inhibiting restrictions,&#148; especially when setting
levels of environmental risk.<A HREF="trade7.html#68"><sup>68</sup></A>  Knowing this, many
experts see the
very purpose of harmonization as raising compliance costs for business:
&#147;common standards often result in a high degree of environmental
protection, not infrequently higher than any individual country would have been
willing to adopt on its own.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#69"><sup>69</sup></A>  Harmonized
standards, like
other multilateral environmental policies, promote &#147;coordinated
trade,&#148; not free trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#70"><sup>70</sup></A><p>
<p>
<A NAME="policy"></A>
<b>Policy Uniformity Breeds Cartelization</b><p>
<p>
     Harmonization of non-trade policies does not secure the efficiency gains of
free trade, it does just the opposite.  According to David Robertson of
Australian National University:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
[A]rguments that policies on the environment should be harmonized to avoid the
creation of new trade restrictions demonstrate misunderstanding of the
mechanisms that provide efficiency gains from international trade.  Worse, in
many instances these proposals are made jointly by environmentalists and
industry lobbies which implies a hidden agenda.<A
HREF="trade7.html#71"><sup>71</sup></A><p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>     That agenda is the creation of a government-protected cartel.  Rather than
promoting trade, harmonization will result in cartelization of the global
economy into protected monopolies, and erosion of the free trade principle of
comparative advantage.<A HREF="trade7.html#72"><sup>72</sup></A><p>
<A HREF="trade7.html#"><sup></sup></A><p>
<A HREF="trade7.html#"><sup></sup></A>    Under true free trade, an international division of
labor arises
through each nation maximizing its own trade advantages.<A
HREF="trade7.html#73"><sup>73</sup></A>
Comparative advantage is partially determined by each nation&#146;s regulatory
policies toward business, with excessive regulation driving firms away from
more oppressive countries.  Environmentalists understand that harmonized
standards would alter this dynamic of competitive trade.<A
HREF="trade7.html#74"><sup>74</sup></A> <p>
<p>
     Harmonization reduces competition between governments, leaving them little
incentive to liberalize economies.  Harmonization fosters increased government
intervention, and reduces freedom to revise regulatory policies.<A
HREF="trade7.html#75"><sup>75</sup></A>
Thus, harmonization curtails industrial output by raising testing, production
and distribution costs for producers.  Yet harmonized standards also benefit
established industries by locking in familiar regulations and protecting them
from competition.  New entrants and foreign competitors are put at a distinct
disadvantage by harmonized standards.<p>

<b>Eco-imperialism</b><p>
<p>
     When social values are injected into trade politics, the priorities of
developed countries inevitably prevail, a phenomenon known as eco-imperialism.
Yet such paternalistic environmental standards imposed on the Third World come
at the expense of economic development and the poor.  Industrialized countries
tend to support environmental trade measures to ward off some global
environmental crisis that may arise in the next century.  However, the greatest
environmental crises in the Third World involve immediate and local health
concerns.  Inadequate sanitation causes more than 2 million deaths and more
than a billion illnesses annually from water-borne diseases such as cholera and
typhoid.<A HREF="trade7.html#76"><sup>76</sup></A>  Environmental trade measures tend to
penalize the Third
World for its poverty, and force a diversion of resources away from real
problems in order to cater to the preferences of First World environmentalists.
Moreover, green trade measures intrude on the sovereignty of Third World
peoples, depriving them of the use of natural resources such as fisheries,
rainforests, and energy supplies.  Thus many developing countries have come to
suspect that the term &#147;sustainable development&#148; means minimal
development for them.<p>
<p>
     An illustrative example of eco-imperialism was the Tuna-Dolphin dispute
between the U.S. and Mexico.  The 1972 U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act 
(MMPA) sets dolphin protection standards for the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean
fishery.  The law provides a ceiling on the number of dolphins that may be
incidentally killed by tuna fishermen, whose purse-seine nets encircle
yellowfin tuna and the dolphins that school with them.  The U.S. must embargo
tuna imports from any country that takes more than 1.25 times the number of
dolphins as the U.S. fishing fleet in a given year.  The embargo must also be
applied to intermediary countries that import tuna products from an embargoed
country.  Embargoes have been imposed against Mexico, Venezuela, and Vanuatu,
and against intermediate countries in Europe and Central
America.<A HREF="trade7.html#77"><sup>77</sup></A><p>
<p>
     In February 1991, Mexico brought the dispute before the GATT.  A dispute
settlement panel ruled that the MMPA constituted a discriminatory barrier to
trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#78"><sup>78</sup></A>  The regulation was applied beyond U.S.
jurisdiction,
involving an attempt to impose a standard on other countries.  The regulation
did not involve a standard relating to a product characteristic.  Rather, the
MMPA attempted to embargo a product based on a process and production method,
i.e., the manner in which the tuna was produced; thus the MMPA did not qualify
as an internal regulation under GATT.<p>
<p>
     The rejection of extra-jurisdictional enforcement was an important precedent
under GATT.  If allowed, numerous types of import bans could be carried out
&#147;merely because the exporting country pursues environmental or health
policies different from [the importing country].&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#79"><sup>79</sup></A>  The
decision drew visceral opposition from many environmental activists.  Despite
the decision, the U.S. did not withdraw the MMPA, and Mexico has refrained from
seeking adoption of the dispute panel report by the GATT Council, under
diplomatic pressure from the U.S. and under constraints relating to its trade
agreement negotiations with the U.S.<p>
<p>
     The Tuna-Dolphin dispute encapsulates the clash between trade and
environmental values.  The impact was most acute in Venezuela, whose fishermen
contend that U.S. standards are virtually impossible to meet for poorer Third
World countries.  There is no way for a country to predict what the U.S. take
of dolphins will be, making it difficult to remain under the ceiling that
triggers the U.S. embargo.  Venezuelan fishermen have limited access to
dolphin-safe techniques and gear, and cannot afford the prohibitive costs
associated with traveling to the western tropical Pacific, where tuna
congregate with dolphins less frequently.  Venezuela&#146;s tuna fleet shrunk
from 118 boats in 1988 to 34 four years later.  Embargoes under the MMPA have
disrupted trade, destabilized tuna prices, and thrown fishermen out of
work.<A HREF="trade7.html#80"><sup>80</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The MMPA reflects not only the peculiar supremacy of dolphins over human
needs, but also the supremacy of dolphins over other competing ecological
values.  Dolphin protection measures lead to overexploitation of marine
resources and foil sustainable management of the eastern tropical Pacific
fishery.<A HREF="trade7.html#81"><sup>81</sup></A>  Deterred from harming dolphins,
fishermen are forced to
pursue smaller, sexually-immature yellowfin and skipjack tuna.<A
HREF="trade7.html#82"><sup>82</sup></A>
For every dolphin saved, approximately 9,000 undersize tuna are
lost.<A HREF="trade7.html#83"><sup>83</sup></A>  According to James Joseph, director of the
Inter-American
Tropical Tuna Commission, avoiding dolphins also means higher incidental kills
of sharks, mahi-mahi, billfish, and many other marine species.<A
HREF="trade7.html#84"><sup>84</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The Tuna-Dolphin dispute demonstrates that trade-restrictive policies
undertaken for environmental purposes can effectively close markets, but do not
necessarily result in tangible environmental benefits.  Environmental arguments
and value judgments are easily manipulated for protectionist purposes, with
serious consequences for the world&#146;s poor.<p>

<P>There is a growing body of international law involving trade restrictions for
environmental protection.  Emerging global environmental policies are beginning
to have profound impacts on trade and international economic affairs.
According to legal experts, international environmental agreements and treaties
may be harbingers of sweeping new global environment policies which &#147;use
trade restrictions as an integral element of their protective mechanisms and
link international regulation of environmental problems to complex questions of
trade and development.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#85"><sup>85</sup></A><p>

<b>The Earth Summit: Defining Sustainable Development</b><p>
<p>
<u>Agenda 21:</u><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Sustainability requires a process of national, regional, and local resource and
environmental planning, which is in direct conflict with the principle of free
trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#86"><sup>86</sup></A><p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
     Proposals for &#147;socially responsible&#148; trade open up a
&#147;Pandora&#146;s box&#148; of regulations for various production sectors,
including energy resources, mining, metals, plastics, chemicals, agriculture,
lumber, pulp and paper, fisheries, and so on.<A HREF="trade7.html#87"><sup>87</sup></A> 
Environmental
standards for trade gained momentum in June 1992, when world leaders broadly
endorsed the concept of &#147;sustainable development&#148; at the United
Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, also called the Earth Summit.  The conference produced <i>Agenda
21</i>, an 800-page blueprint for environmental planning and international
policy coordination covering a wide variety of issues, including trade,
forestry, desertification, ocean resources, rivers, and women&#146;s rights.
Under the agreement, governments commit themselves to adopt a national strategy
for sustainable development and to strengthen international cooperation on
sustainable development policies.  <i>Agenda 21</i> urges nations to:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
harmonize the various sectoral economic, social and environmental policies and
plans that are operating in the country. . .to ensure socially responsible
economic development while protecting the resource base and environment for the
benefit of future generations . . .[National strategies] should be developed
through the widest possible participation.<A HREF="trade7.html#88"><sup>88</sup></A><p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
     Governments are expected to consider &#147;the implications of economic
instruments and incentives for competitiveness and international trade,&#148;
and &#147;global transboundary issues&#148; related to energy, transportation,
agriculture and forestry, water, wastes, health, tourism and other areas.  The
aim of sustainable development is to facilitate the &#147;integration of social
and environmental costs into economic activities,&#148; by promoting &#147;the
efficient planning and utilization of resources for sustainable development
through sound economic and social policies.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#89"><sup>89</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Sustainable development was first conceived by the 1987 World Commission on
Environment and Development, which had specifically recommended that the GATT
&#147;reflect concern for the impacts of trading patterns on the environment,
and the need for more effective instruments to integrate environment and
development concerns into international trading
arrangements.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#90"><sup>90</sup></A>  The first program area of
<i>Agenda 21</i>
calls on all national governments to achieve Earth Summit goals by
&#147;promoting sustainable development through trade liberalization,&#148; and
by &#147;making trade and environment mutually supportive.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#91"><sup>91</sup></A>
It encourages the completion of the Uruguay Round of GATT for &#147;greater
security and predictability to the international trading
system,&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#92"><sup>92</sup></A> and for &#147;better
management of natural
resources.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#93"><sup>93</sup></A><p>
<p>
     By &#147;trade liberalization,&#148; <i>Agenda 21</i> does not refer to free
trade, but trade &#147;supported by the adoption of sound environmental
policies.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#94"><sup>94</sup></A>  <i>Agenda 21</i> endorses the
use of trade
measures, i.e., trade sanctions, &#147;to enhance the effectiveness of
environmental regulations.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#95"><sup>95</sup></A>  <i>Agenda
21</i> calls for
integration of national governments into a strengthened &#147;international
trade policies system.&#148;  An important objective of the trade program is to
clarify the role of GATT and U.N. institutions &#147;in dealing with trade and
environment-related issues, including...dispute settlement.&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#96"><sup>96</sup></A>
The plan also requires the &#147;international community&#148; to adopt
&#147;commodity policies&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#97"><sup>97</sup></A> to raise prices
for products such
as cocoa, coffee, sugar, and tropical timber.<A HREF="trade7.html#98"><sup>98</sup></A> 
<i>Agenda 21</i>
urges compensation to developing countries for losses incurred by changing
commodity policies,<A HREF="trade7.html#99"><sup>99</sup></A> and puts a price tag of  $8.8
billion per year
on its own recommendations.<A HREF="trade7.html#100"><sup>100</sup></A><p>
<p>
<u>The Rio Declaration:</u><p>
<p>
     The Earth Summit participants also approved the Rio Declaration on Environment
and Development, a set of twenty-seven sustainable development principles.  <p>
<p>
     This global ecological charter effectively places environmental resources
within international jurisdiction.  In it, countries are warned not to degrade
the environment in &#147;areas beyond the limits of national
jurisdiction,&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#101"><sup>101</sup></A> and are urged to
&#147;cooperate in a spirit
of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity
of the Earth&#146;s ecosystem.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#102"><sup>102</sup></A> 
Countries are instructed to
&#147;enact effective environmental legislation&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#103"><sup>103</sup></A> that will
bring about the elimination of &#147;unsustainable patterns of production and
consumption.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#104"><sup>104</sup></A>  Industrialized countries
are blamed for
environmental degradation, and told to take financial responsibility for its
resolution, &#147;in view of...the technologies and financial resources they
command.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#105"><sup>105</sup></A>  Thus, wealth redistribution
is implicit in
sustainable development.<p>
<p>
     The Rio Declaration calls for environmental standards to be linked to trade in
&#147;a supportive and open international economic system&#148; that would lead
to &#147;sustainable development in all countries, to better address the
problems of environmental degradation.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#106"><sup>106</sup></A> 
Escaping poverty
through international trade would be discouraged, as countries are instructed
not to transfer &#147;activities or substances&#148;<A
HREF="trade7.html#107"><sup>107</sup></A> that are
considered unhealthy for the Earth&#146;s ecosystem.  Important chemicals and
industrial materials would be removed from ecologically permissible commerce.
The charter also endorses a &#147;precautionary approach&#148; to environmental
policy: &#147;Lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason
for postponing&#148; environmental regulations and
restrictions.<A HREF="trade7.html#108"><sup>108</sup></A><p>
<p>

<A NAME="multi"></A>
<b>Multilateral Agreements</b><p>
<p>
     There are approximately 180 international environmental agreements and
treaties.<A HREF="trade7.html#109"><sup>109</sup></A>  More than two thirds of these treaties
were signed
subsequent to the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held
in Stockholm, Sweden.  The U.N. has continued to provide the momentum for
international action since then, sponsoring a dozen major conferences on a
variety of global environmental issues, including population control,
desertification, ozone depletion, and climate change.<A
HREF="trade7.html#110"><sup>110</sup></A>  Of these
international agreements, 19 employ trade restrictions in varying ways to carry
out and enforce their objectives.<A HREF="trade7.html#111"><sup>111</sup></A>  Among the
most important and
far-reaching of these multilateral agreements are those dealing with
ozone-depleting substances, endangered species, and hazardous waste.<p>
<u>Montreal Protocol:</u><p>
<p>
     Signed in 1987, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone
Layer restricts the production and consumption of certain substances thought to
erode the ozone layer, including chloroflourocarbons (CFCs), other chemical
refrigerants, and halons.  Signatories must reduce their consumption of these
controlled substances according to specific deadlines and
percentages.<A HREF="trade7.html#112"><sup>112</sup></A>  Parties must ban trade in
controlled substances and
related products that contain controlled substances, even from countries that
have not signed the Protocol.<A HREF="trade7.html#113"><sup>113</sup></A>  Parties are also
discouraged from
exporting technology that either produces or utilizes CFCs, such as
semiconductors washed with CFCs, and ultimately must ban such
trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#114"><sup>114</sup></A>  The Protocol also contains provisions for
financial and
technical compliance assistance and technology transfer for developing
countries via a Multilateral Fund.<A HREF="trade7.html#115"><sup>115</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The phaseout of CFCs will be very costly &#151; as much as $100 billion in
costs over the next decade for the U.S. alone, by one estimate.<A
HREF="trade7.html#116"><sup>116</sup></A>
The impacts will hit hardest in the Third World, however, where refrigerated
pharmaceuticals and foods are essential to the health and well-being of the
poor.  Refrigerants are responsible for reducing food spoilage and for enabling
a wider distribution of food products.  The Protocol is an exercise in
eco-imperialism &#151; developing nations are made to bear the burden of the
West&#146;s questionable environmental priorities.<p>
<p>
     The Protocol stipulates different trading terms for parties and for
non-parties.  It phases out trade in CFCs between parties, while it bans
imports from non-parties.  In addition, the Protocol bans exports of CFCs to
non-parties.  By restricting imports made with CFCs or other controlled
substances, rather than the substances themselves, parties are enacting trade
measures extra-jurisdictionally regarding a process and production method,
raising the same sort of trade barrier as the Marine Mammal Protection
Act.<A HREF="trade7.html#117"><sup>117</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The principal reason for these Protocol provisions is to encourage
non-signatories to join the agreement, and to prevent non-parties from
undermining the agreement&#146;s goals.<A HREF="trade7.html#118"><sup>118</sup></A>  By
compelling countries
to sign, it is hoped that greater environmental benefits will accrue from the
agreement.  Yet, there is no avoiding that such provisions constitute trade
barriers; they conflict with the free trade principle of non-discrimination
sought by GATT.<A HREF="trade7.html#119"><sup>119</sup></A>  For that reason,
environmentalists fear that a
GATT member could try to invalidate the Montreal Protocol under GATT&#146;s
dispute settlement procedures, proving once and for all that the agreement is
inconsistent with free trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#120"><sup>120</sup></A>  For action under
the Protocol to
be consistent with a country&#146;s obligations under GATT, a rules change or a
GATT waiver of the rules would be required.<A
HREF="trade7.html#121"><sup>121</sup></A><p>
<A HREF="trade7.html#"><sup></sup></A><u></u><p>
<u>Basel Convention</u>:<p>
<p>
     The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous
Wastes and Their Disposal is a treaty &#147;designed to regulate, but more 
fundamentally, to bring to an end, international trade in a very large number
of materials,&#148; according to N. R. Evans.<A
HREF="trade7.html#122"><sup>122</sup></A>  The
Basel Convention was convened to manage the production, trade, and disposal of
waste materials according to baseline international standards.<A
HREF="trade7.html#123"><sup>123</sup></A>
It prohibits export of these waste, scrap and recyclable materials to nations
that prohibit such imports, to non-parties, and to Antarctica.<A
HREF="trade7.html#124"><sup>124</sup></A>
Exports are also prohibited if a party has reason to believe the materials will
not be managed sustainably.<A HREF="trade7.html#125"><sup>125</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Environmental restrictions on the waste trade will not make such trade safer
per se, but will make it less frequent.  Businesses engaged in the waste trade
must 
conform to detailed requirements for written information, in addition to
complex 
notification and consent requirements prior to shipment.<A
HREF="trade7.html#126"><sup>126</sup></A>
According to Evans, the Basel Convention will subject trade in recycled
materials to interminable red tape and bureaucratic delay:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The extra transaction costs imposed on international traders in these materials
will tend to reduce that trade, perhaps very greatly . . .Where the margins on
a particular trade are low. . .then a dramatic increase in transaction costs
will kill the trade.<A HREF="trade7.html#127"><sup>127</sup></A><p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
     Among those hurt will be developing countries which have begun to specialize
in industries based on secondary and scrap materials, which will become more
expensive and harder to find in global markets.<A HREF="trade7.html#128"><sup>128</sup></A> 
Evans describes
the Convention as a government cartel to prevent individuals from trading with
one another for mutual benefit.  Despite environmentalist fears of
&#147;hazardous&#148; wastes, there is no reason why international competition
in recycling and disposal will not result in safer practices.  According to
Evans, the waste trade contains none of the elements of global commons abuse
&#151; &#147;property rights are secure at all times in the
trade.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#129"><sup>129</sup></A>  Thus, internalization of costs is
accomplished by
competitive markets.<p>
<p>
     Like the Montreal Protocol, Basel Convention provisions are inconsistent with
free trade principles.  These provisions apply environmental measures
extra-jurisdictionally, and apply different standards to trade with parties
versus non-parties, making them inconsistent with GATT.<A
HREF="trade7.html#130"><sup>130</sup></A>
Likewise, the ban on exports to the Antarctic region may constitute an
arbitrary trade barrier under GATT.<A HREF="trade7.html#131"><sup>131</sup></A><p>
<p>
<u>CITES</u>:<p>
<p>
     The Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) strictly regulates
international trade in wildlife, with the intent of protecting biodiversity and
preventing extinction.  CITES puts threatened species in three categories, each
with different trade restrictions.  Parties are required to create complex
permit systems for trade in any listed species.<A
HREF="trade7.html#132"><sup>132</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Appendix I bans commercial trade in any species currently endangered,
including trade in the species itself or in species-derived
products.<A HREF="trade7.html#133"><sup>133</sup></A>  Appendix II requires trade permits in
species which
are nearing threatened status, but are not endangered currently.<A HREF="trade7.html#134"><sup>134</sup></A>  Appendix III lists species
that a party
wishes to restrict trade in, if a population or sub-species in its own
territory is threatened.  Certificates of origin are required for other
countries that wish to trade in species on this list.<A
HREF="trade7.html#135"><sup>135</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Under CITES, there are bans on imports of elephants, whales, flying foxes,
polar bears, fur seals, and migratory birds, among other species.<A
HREF="trade7.html#136"><sup>136</sup></A>
Because trade in non-domestic species can be banned, CITES may constitute an
extra-territorial environmental trade barrier of the type that was struck down
in the U.S.-Mexico
tuna-dolphin panel.<A HREF="trade7.html#137"><sup>137</sup></A>  Also, because CITES
parties are required to
regulate trade even with non-parties, the agreement may run afoul of GATT
prohibition against quotas, bans, and licensing schemes.<A
HREF="trade7.html#138"><sup>138</sup></A><p>
<b></b><p>
<A NAME="merging"></A>
<b>Merging international trade and environment rules.</b><p>
<p>
     By defining a steadily increasing number of environmental quality issues as
global commons problems, multilateral treaties are effectively expanding
international jurisdiction in these areas. Environmentalist advocates of
multilateralism welcome the expanding principles of international law, pointing
out that under the Law of the Sea convention, for example, &#147;the
international community has reserved jurisdiction over these [global] commons
areas.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#139"><sup>139</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The multitude of environmental restrictions mandated by international
agreements is having a growing impact on world trade.  Obligations under many
environmental agreements conflict with the obligations of multilateral trade
rules, which were originally intended to expand trade, not restrict it.
Political trade management regimes, such as GATT, have traditionally not
recognized much of a governmental role in environmental regulation outside of
national jurisdictions.  As multilateral action to regulate the global commons
continues to grow, environmental advocates argue that international
environmental policies should be incorporated into government-negotiated trade
rules so that there is no inconsistency between the two.<p>
<p>
     An even greater factor in the greening of trade policies is the environmental
establishment&#146;s desire to strengthen compliance with multilateral
agreements 
and to quicken the pace of multilateral action.  Implementation of
environmental agreements is frustrated in part by inadequate monitoring and
enforcement,<A HREF="trade7.html#140"><sup>140</sup></A> and by the chronic managerial
inefficiency of the
U.N. system.<A HREF="trade7.html#141"><sup>141</sup></A>  Some countries, especially in the
poorer Third
World, are deterred by the prohibitive costs of environmental restrictions and
by loss of national sovereignty.<A HREF="trade7.html#142"><sup>142</sup></A><p>
<p>
     To overcome these problems, a report by the General Accounting Office suggests
that a greater sense of urgency about global environmental crises might be necessary, and recommends more active participation by environmental
interest
groups in monitoring enforcement of multilateral agreements.<A
HREF="trade7.html#143"><sup>143</sup></A>  GAO
further recommends greater use of technology transfer programs and financial
inducements for Third World governments, such as the Global Environment
Facility, the financing instrument for the U.N. Biodiversity and Global Climate
Change Conventions.<A HREF="trade7.html#144"><sup>144</sup></A>   These proposals would
increase the foreign
indebtedness of developing countries, strengthen central governments, and
impede free market economic reforms.<p>
<p>
     Enforcement of multilateral environmental agreements can also be ratcheted up
gradually, as Worldwatch Institute&#146;s Hilary French explains: <p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Paradoxically, one way to make environmental agreements more effective is in
some cases to make them less enforceable &#151; and therefore more palatable to
the negotiators who may initially feel threatened by any loss of sovereignty .
. .[Such agreements] can help to create an international consensus, mobilize
aid, and lay the groundwork for the negotiation of binding treaties
later.<A HREF="trade7.html#145"><sup>145</sup></A><p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
     Under this strategy, a non-binding framework convention is agreed to first,
which identifies a global crisis and establishes a political commitment to take
some undefined action at a later date.  Then, information from research and
monitoring programs is used by governments and environmental interest groups to
justify binding targets and timetables in protocols and treaties.<A
HREF="trade7.html#146"><sup>146</sup></A>
Along these lines, the World Resources Institute calls the creation of an
institution to monitor <i>Agenda 21</i>, the U.N. Commission on Sustainable
Development, &#147;one of the quiet successes of the Earth
Summit.&#148;<A HREF="trade7.html#147"><sup>147</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Ultimately, however, adequate enforcement of global environmental regulatory
policies is possible only through trade measures.  In some international
environmental agreements, like the Montreal Protocol, trade restrictions are
seen as integral to the agreement&#146;s purpose.  In others, trade measures
are necessary to induce additional countries to join an
agreement.<A HREF="trade7.html#148"><sup>148</sup></A>  Many environmentalists argue that
effective solutions
to &#147;transboundary&#148; pollution problems would be impossible without
greater coordination of trade and environmental policies, including trade
measures.<A HREF="trade7.html#149"><sup>149</sup></A>  For example, the threat of U.S. trade
sanctions has
been instrumental in pressuring whaling nations to adhere to the strictures of
the International Whaling Convention.<A HREF="trade7.html#150"><sup>150</sup></A><p>
<p>
     International institutions such as the OECD, GATT, and UNCTAD have each
attempted to address the need for coordinated, multilateral trade and
environment policies<A HREF="trade8.html#151"><sup>151</sup></A>  In 1972, the major
industrial powers of
the OECD collaborated to produce a report entitled &#147;Guiding Principles
Concerning the International Aspects of Environmental Policies,&#148; which
recommends more stringent environmental standards and that governments should
harmonize their standards.<A HREF="trade8.html#152"><sup>152</sup></A>  Since that time,
OECD efforts have
evolved, and in 1991 an OECD report declared that &#147;unlike sustainable
development, free trade is not an end in itself. . .&#148;<A
HREF="trade8.html#153"><sup>153</sup></A>  An
EPA trade and environment advisory committee, created in 1990, recommended that
the U.S. seek to integrate environmental concerns into multilateral and
regional trade agreements, and that the U.S. seek to harmonize international
environmental standards.<A HREF="trade8.html#154"><sup>154</sup></A><p>
<p>
     GATT&#146;s theoretical work has been marginally less sympathetic to
multilateralism than that of other international institutions.   Nevertheless,
even GATT concedes the environmentalist premise that multilateral solutions to
environmental problems are necessary, arguing that they &#147;offer the best
chance of ensuring that the policy changes deal directly with the problem at
hand and that they provide minimum scope for protectionist
abuses.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#155"><sup>155</sup></A>  Though GATT seeks to
minimize trade discrimination
and unilateral sanctions, it does not seek to prevent the growing use of trade
measures through multilateral environmental agreements.<A
HREF="trade8.html#156"><sup>156</sup></A>  In fact,
the GATT panel decision in the Tuna-Dolphin dispute argued that U.S. trade
restrictions on dolphin-unsafe tuna from Mexico could be GATT-consistent if
part of an international agreement.<A HREF="trade8.html#157"><sup>157</sup></A>  And in
1993, countries
participating in the GATT Working Group on Environmental Measures and
International Trade agreed that the underlying philosophy of GATT is basically
compatible with the guiding principles of <i>Agenda 21</i>.<A
HREF="trade8.html#158"><sup>158</sup></A>
Thus, the intellectual case for linkage of trade and environmental policies
remains fundamentally unopposed by traditional defenders of a free trading
system &#151; the United States, the other industrialized nations, and GATT.<p>

<P><B>Environmental Standards and the European Customs Union</b><p>
<p>
     Tangible actions to incorporate environmental standards into trade policies
initially began in the European Community, which has long fancied placing
environmental protection, along with economic policies, under international
jurisdiction.  The EC can be seen as a model for regional free trade area
regimes, in that its trade and environment rules govern separate and distinct
sovereign nations.<A HREF="trade8.html#159"><sup>159</sup></A>  The EC model for
integration of trade and
environment policies could have significant influence on GATT.<A
HREF="trade8.html#160"><sup>160</sup></A><p>
<p>
     EC international law is based on the Treaty of Rome, as modified by the Single
European Act of 1987 and the Maastricht treaty of 1991.  The former eliminated
internal barriers to trade as of 1992 (hence the term &#147;EC-92&#148;) and
established a general framework for European environmental policies.
Maastricht, when fully implemented, will further amplify the relationship
between economic integration and uniform environmental
policies.<A HREF="trade8.html#161"><sup>161</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The establishment of a single market and customs union in the EC has provided
the basis for a harmonization of environmental standards to a uniform level.
According to an EC report on environmental policy, Article 100a of the Treaty
of Rome establishes a base level of environmental protection within a framework
that allows some flexibility to member countries.<A HREF="trade8.html#162"><sup>162</sup></A> 
Given that
different countries have different priorities, member countries&#146; standards
may exceed the stringency of the base level.  Yet they may not fall short of
the minimum EC level, so generally, standards are upwardly
harmonized.<A HREF="trade8.html#163"><sup>163</sup></A>  The EC report states: &#147;the
purpose of Community
level quality targets is to ensure that minimum standards are observed.&#148;<p>
<p>
     Rising environmental standards have become legally accepted in the EC despite
their status as non-tariff trade barriers.  The tone of European trade and
environment policy was set in 1981, when Denmark passed a bottle bill requiring
all beverages to be sold in returnable containers.  This requirement is
effectively a protectionist measure since it discriminates against producers
outside of Denmark, whose higher transportation costs make recycling
uneconomical.  However, the measure was upheld in the European Court of
Justice, which determined that Denmark&#146;s duty to avoid trade
discrimination was outweighed by its responsibility to protect the global
environment.  Denmark&#146;s victory has emboldened other countries to adopt
similar protectionist legislation justified as environmental protection.
Germany, for instance, subsequently passed legislation requiring recycling of
all forms of consumer product packaging.  &#147;Companies that are unable to
establish a return cycle in Germany will not be able to sell in that
market,&#148; writes Konrad von Moltke, senior fellow at the World Wildlife
Fund; &#147;presumably these regulations ...will set a pattern for the
EC,&#148; and possibly GATT.<A HREF="trade8.html#164"><sup>164</sup></A><p>
<p>
<A NAME="green"></A>
<b>NAFTA&#146;s Green Accords</b><p>
<p>
     Some hope that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) could parallel
the EC.  Carol Browner, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, calls the NAFTA between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, &#147;the
&#145;greenest&#146; trade agreement ever negotiated.&#148;  NAFTA was
remarkable in that the Clinton administration secured the endorsement of six
environmental groups for a trade agreement &#151; Natural Resources Defense
Council, National Wildlife Federation, Environmental Defense Fund, National
Audubon Society, Conservation International and the World Wildlife Fund.<p>
<p>
<u>History and Evolution:</u><p>
<p>
     Environmentalist support was cultivated throughout the NAFTA negotiations.
Environmental organizations participated in numerous public hearings, and
submitted advisory reports to the U.S. trade representative.  Representatives
of these groups were briefed extensively during the negotiations and the
ratification process.  Remarkably, some even received security clearances to
participate in an advisory role with U.S. negotiators.  In addition, several
environmental regulatory agencies were involved directly in the negotiations,
especially EPA, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Interior.<A
HREF="trade8.html#165"><sup>165</sup></A>
&#147;These participating agencies...incorporated many [business and
environmental] groups&#146; proposals into U.S. negotiating positions,&#148;
reveals the U.S. trade representative&#146;s office.<A
HREF="trade8.html#166"><sup>166</sup></A><p>
     The consultation process began under the Bush administration, and produced a
number of significant recommendations which guided the U.S. negotiating team.
Among them were commitments to:<p>
<UL>
<LI> maintain the right to maintain and enforce through trade              restrictions,
product standards and technical regulations            that are more stringent than
international standards. . .;<p>
<LI> maintain the right to impose trade restrictions pursuant to                U.S. health,
environmental, conservation, and endan-           gered species legislation and
international agreements;<p>
<p>
<LI> develop dispute resolution mechanisms that are sensitive              to
environmental
programs and values; and<p>
<p>
<LI> harmonize safety and environmental standards for motor                carrier,
hazardous
materials, and rail transportation.<A HREF="trade8.html#167"><sup>167</sup></A><p>

</UL>
<p>
     This process produced NAFTA&#146;s unprecedented environmental provisions,
widely seen as the model for &#147;greening&#148; future trade agreements.
They include:<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<i>The preamble</i>: This commits the countries to conduct trade in &#147;a
manner consistent with environmental protection and conservation&#148; and
calls on them to &#147;promote sustainable development&#148; and
&#147;strengthen the development and enforcement of environmental laws and
regulations.&#148;<p>
<p>
<i>Primacy of international environmental agreements</i>: The treaty affirms
that trade obligations in international agreements supersede NAFTA.  Such
treaties include: Montreal Protocol, CITES, the Basel Convention, and two
conventions on migratory birds and game mammals with Canada and Mexico.<p>
<p>
<i>Upward harmonization</i>: Two treaty chapters on sanitary and phytosanitary
measures and standards-related measures commit the three countries to harmonize
health, safety, and environmental regulations without reducing them.<p>
<p>
<i>Anti-deregulatory measures</i>: Countries renounce the relaxation of health,
safety, or environmental standards to encourage or retain investment.<p>
<p>
<i>International bureaucracy</i>: NAFTA creates a Committee on Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures to strengthen food safety regulations and agricultural
standards.  A Committee on Standards-Related Measures is created to enhance
safety, consumer, and environmental standards.  Numerous other bureaucracies
are formed.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
     The environmental lobby remained unsatisfied with these provisions, however.
Worried that environmentalists would oppose NAFTA, in early 1993 the new
Clinton administration commenced negotiations for additional environmental
commitments with Mexico and Canada.  Environmentalists outlined a detailed
proposal for an environmental side accord as a condition for their support of
NAFTA.  They demanded:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
1) the establishment of a North American environmental bureaucracy;<p>
<p>
2) a role for the bureaucracy in promoting compliance with environmental laws
and authorizing trade remedies for non-compliance;<p>
<p>
3) substantial funding for border environmental spending projects and
conservation programs;<p>
<p>
4) access to the government decisionmaking process through &#147;public
participation&#148; measures; and<p>
<p>
5) a means to clarify NAFTA&#146;s rules regarding upward harmonization of
process standards.<A HREF="trade8.html#168"><sup>168</sup></A><p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
     The supplemental environmental side accord of August 1993, negotiated by U.S.
trade representative Mickey Kantor, conforms broadly with the environmental
lobby&#146;s proposal.  The agreement establishes a new supra-national
bureaucracy, called the North American Commission on Environmental Cooperation,
to monitor environmental conditions, to promote compliance with environmental
laws and regulations, and to authorize trade sanctions for failure to enforce
environmental laws.<A HREF="trade8.html#169"><sup>169</sup></A>  The Commission is
comprised of a Council,
Secretariat, public advisory committees, and arbitral panels.  According to a
legal analysis commissioned by environmental organizations, the side
agreement&#146;s &#147;sanctions and penalty provisions are arguably stronger
than the penalty provisions proposed [by environmental
groups].&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#170"><sup>170</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The CEC&#146;s Council will develop recommendations for the upward
harmonization of regulations across the continent, &#147;without reducing
levels of environmental protection.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#171"><sup>171</sup></A>  The
agreement lists
several areas for consideration, including pollution prevention techniques,
endangered species protection, ecologically sensitive national accounts, and
eco-labelling.  The purpose of harmonization of rules and standards is to
prevent a country from gaining improper trade advantages through deregulation,
which is considered a kind of subsidy.<A HREF="trade8.html#172"><sup>172</sup></A>  The
CEC also provides for
a high degree of public participation and access to environmental
decisionmaking, features which will allow environmental groups to continue to
exert influence over trade and environmental policies in the region.  Citizen
petitions to the CEC, for example, can lead to formal dispute settlement.<p>
<p>
     The environmental agreement commits the countries to &#147;promote sustainable
development&#148; and to &#147;enhance compliance with, and enforcement of,
environmental laws and regulations.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#173"><sup>173</sup></A>  It further
provides that each
country &#147;shall ensure that its laws and regulations provide for high
levels of environmental protection and shall strive to continue to improve
those laws and regulations.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#174"><sup>174</sup></A>  To ensure
compliance with laws
and regulations, countries agree to utilize several enforcement measures:
on-site inspections, environmental audits, administrative orders, searches and
seizures, fines, imprisonments, and closure of facilities.<A
HREF="trade8.html#175"><sup>175</sup></A>   Alland regulations. 
Arbitral panels can levy fines on governments in the amount
of $20 million per infraction, or authorize the complaining party to impose
equivalent trade sanctions (maximum fine/sanction may rise with trade after the
first year).  Canada is exempt from trade sanctions, but must enforce rulings
in domestic courts.<A HREF="trade8.html#178"><sup>178</sup></A>  Fines are paid into an
environmental fund,
which the Commission may use to improve environmental enforcement.<p>
<p>
<u>The Formal Language:</u><p>


<p>
     Some environmentalists have discounted the extent of NAFTA&#146;s
environmental commitments.  Environmental groups such as the Sierra Club,
Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace viewed the NAFTA as insufficiently
&#147;green&#148; because of the cumbersome process of securing trade
sanctions.<A HREF="trade8.html#179"><sup>179</sup></A>  Similarly, the Cato Institute reads the
harmonization
features of the treaty to be totally meaningless: &#147;no reasonable reading
[of NAFTA&#146;s environmental provisions] can possibly lead one to conclude
that upward harmonization of environmental law is required by those parts of
the treaty.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#180"><sup>180</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Others see NAFTA as a major innovation in trade and environment policy.  Legal
advisors to the EPA write that the U.S., &#147;in its negotiation of a NAFTA,
committed not to weaken U.S. environmental and health laws or regulations [and]
to maintain enforcement...&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#181"><sup>181</sup></A>  Daniel
Magraw, EPA&#146;s
associate general counsel for international activities, points to the NAFTA
obligation that each country provide for high levels of environmental
protection, and improve environmental laws and regulations.  Magraw calls that
provision, Article 3 of the environmental side agreement, &#147;an
anti-rollback provision...intended to prevent a country from reducing its level
of [environmental] protection...&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#182"><sup>182</sup></A>  And
the U.S. trade
representative&#146;s office, in its &#147;Report on Environmental
Issues,&#148; explains how the treaty commits the three countries to
&#147;upward harmonization:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The NAFTA provisions on sanitary and phytosanitary measures were spec-ifically
negotiated to make clear that there would be no &#145;downward
harmonization&#146; of such measures...Article 713.1 explicitly states that [harmonization] is to be done &#145;<i>without</i>
reducing the level of protection of human, animal or plant life or
health&#146;....[Article 714.1 harmonizes the parties&#146; measures] in order
to minimize the differences between the three NAFTA countries&#146; sanitary
and phytosanitary measures...the text makes clear that these procedures must
not reduce the level of protection of human, animal or plant health or of the
environment. (Emphasis in original).<A HREF="trade8.html#183"><sup>183</sup></A><p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
     The NAFTA countries are obligated to engage in harmonization talks through
various tri-national committees, which will encourage the countries to make
their standards equivalent.  The most widely respected authorities on NAFTA,
Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott of the Washington DC-based Institute for
International Economics, describe this process as harmonization of NAFTA
standards &#147;at levels that are not lower than the highest minimum standards
within the NAFTA region.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#184"><sup>184</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     William H. Lash III, writing for the Center for the Study of American
Business, uses even stronger language: &#147;Under NAFTA, the United States,
Mexico, and Canada are expressly forbidden from lowering environmental
standards to attract investment.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#185"><sup>185</sup></A>  The
three countries
renounce the relaxation of environmental measures to attract or encourage
investment in NAFTA&#146;s investment chapter, and the side agreement&#146;s
dispute settlement provisions provide a mechanism to enforce that
commitment.<A HREF="trade8.html#186"><sup>186</sup></A>  Legally, a country may choose to
reduce its desired
level of environmental protection, but not for the purpose of encouraging
investment.  Determining a country&#146;s intent in relaxing its environmental
enforcement may become a controversial subject of future arbitral panels.<p>
<p>
     NAFTA&#146;s &#147;green&#148; provisions persuaded many environmentalists
that NAFTA would not reduce environmental protection in North America, but
might actually improve environmental regulatory enforcement.<A
HREF="trade8.html#187"><sup>187</sup></A>
EPA&#146;s Carol Browner claimed in congressional testimony that these NAFTA
provisions would lead to &#147;cooperation on region-wide environmental
planning, not just pollutant-by-pollutant controls.&#148;<A
HREF="trade8.html#188"><sup>188</sup></A>
Authorities in environmental law contend that NAFTA&#146;s provisions
&#147;should result in a major improvement in law enforcement. . . .these
provisions should ensure a sea change in how Mexico (and improvements in the
way the United States and Canada) develop, implement and enforce environmental
law.<A HREF="trade8.html#189"><sup>189</sup></A>&#148;  According to a Federal Reserve
Bank of Dallas study,
the NAFTA agreements &#147;open broader opportunities to protectionists to
reduce trade through appeals against environmental and workplace enforcement in
areas with little direct effect on the international exchange of goods and
services.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#190"><sup>190</sup></A><p>
<A HREF="trade8.html#"><sup></sup></A><p>
     NAFTA effects are expected to be visible more through international
cooperation than through confrontation.<A HREF="trade8.html#191"><sup>191</sup></A>  In the
future, the
effect of NAFTA will be the internationalization of environmental regulation.
According to Hufbauer and Schott, for example, the agreement has made possible
new cooperative environmental efforts such as an Air Pollution Control Zone
covering El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez.  A joint project of the EPA, State
Department, and a Mexican agency, the Control Zone would initially entail
monitoring activities and voluntary emissions control programs.  Once the
Control Zone is operational, it &#147;will have the power to establish and
enforce emission standards.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#192"><sup>192</sup></A><p>
<p>
     This is but one example of the far-reaching implications of NAFTA&#146;s
environmental provisions.  EPA&#146;s Magraw claims that NAFTA&#146;s
institutional innovations represent if not a redefinition of traditional
notions of sovereignty, at least a refinement of those notions and a
development of types of social organization that allow countries to exercise
and realize the legitimate aspects of sovereignty in a way that reflects the
growing environmental, economic, and political interdependence of the world.<p>
<u></u><p>
<u>The Experience to Date:</u><p>
<p>
     Many opponents of trade with Mexico strenuously objected to its lower social
and regulatory standards, and cited fears that U.S. standards would be
undermined by NAFTA.  &#147;We have in fact seen the opposite, that is, Mexico
is rising to the same standards we have in the United States,&#148; reports
Susan K. Ross, a Los Angeles international trade attorney.<A
HREF="trade8.html#193"><sup>193</sup></A>  In
the environmental arena, the treaty has been the impetus for greater regulation
and government intervention, particularly on the Mexican side of the border.<p>
<p>
     In preparation for NAFTA harmonization negotiations, Mexico&#146;s transport
ministry published 125 pages of new regulations in March 1994, classifying
hundreds of important industrial materials as officially &#147;hazardous.&#148;
These classifications used United Nations-approved standards as a baseline.
Other rules are being issued for vehicle emission standards, engine
manufacturing requirements, fuel standards, and food inspection
regulations.<A HREF="trade8.html#194"><sup>194</sup></A> Before the end of 1995, the three
NAFTA countries
will harmonize standards for weights and transport regulations.  The regulatory
upheaval will not be as burdensome to large corporations used to dealing with
red tape.  But for small and medium-sized firms &#147;unfamiliar with the
regulations. . .it&#146;s going to be a tough time,&#148; complains Carlos
Cantu, a Mexico City international sales manager.<A
HREF="trade8.html#195"><sup>195</sup></A>  Over time,
this could represent a barrier to competitive trade.<p>
<p>
     In June of 1994, Mexican commerce officials published new regulations
concerning food and beverage labelling and packaging, which will require
product information to be included on all imports.  They also proposed new
rules on product safety and consumer information labels.  U.S. exporters fear
the regulations will create further delays at the already burdensome Mexican
border.  &#147;What winds up happening is you&#146;re just giving another tool
to some guy at Customs to hold you up,&#148; one trade expert told the
<i>Journal of Commerce</i>.<A HREF="trade8.html#196"><sup>196</sup></A>  When
confronted with this trade
barrier for entrepreneurs, Mexican president Carlos Salinas was unsympathetic:
&#147;We have to protect the interest of Mexican consumers,&#148; he
said.<A HREF="trade8.html#197"><sup>197</sup></A><p>
<p>
     By the end of 1994, Mexico will have upgraded its food inspection regulations
to meet U.S. standards.  The changes are causing substantial delays at border
crossings, where as many as 1,000 trucks per day must pass.  According to
agricultural producers, the Mexican distribution system is so plagued by
inefficiency and delay that 35 percent of Mexico&#146;s perishable items are
destroyed by spoilage.<A HREF="trade8.html#198"><sup>198</sup></A>  Inspection procedures
are in dire need of
streamlining, as eight government agencies are currently responsible for
inspecting perishables at the border.<A HREF="trade8.html#199"><sup>199</sup></A>  Beginning
in late June
1994, Mexican officials began placing every truckload of U.S. beef into cold
storage in order to verify compliance with Spanish-language labelling
requirements and meat inspection laws.<A HREF="trade8.html#200"><sup>200</sup></A>  The
U.S. Meat Export
Federation protests that &#147;the Mexican cattlemen are trying to stifle
imports&#148; by using inspections as new trade barriers.  But Mexican
officials say the barriers are fully justified by NAFTA: &#147;Now we need to
put together normal measures for nations that do trade &#151; safety standards,
health standards.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#201"><sup>201</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Upward harmonization will be very costly for Mexican entrepreneurs, small
businesses, and consumers.  Harmonization of an assortment of vehicle emissions
standards, engine manufacturing requirements, and fuel standards will force
substantial investment by Mexican motor carriers and drive up their operational
costs close to U.S. levels.<A HREF="trade8.html#202"><sup>202</sup></A>  One California
official revealed
that Mexicans have no choice under NAFTA: &#147;They will have to change to
meet our requirements, or they will not be allowed in
California.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#203"><sup>203</sup></A>  Many U.S. trucking
companies and exporters
have falsely assumed that NAFTA would allow direct shipments to clients in
Mexico, only to find barriers at the border in the form of customs brokerage
fees, complex interliner arrangements, and onerous paperwork
requirements.<A HREF="trade8.html#204"><sup>204</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Higher environmental regulations in Mexico are starting to take their toll on
small businesses, which are being forced to invest more in environmental
compliance.  Demand for pollution control equipment stands at approximately
$1.5 billion in 1994, but is expected to double over the next few years because
of government restrictions.<A HREF="trade8.html#205"><sup>205</sup></A>  Mexico&#146;s
Confederation of
Industrial Chambers expects that NAFTA will force Mexican businesses to
increase their spending on pollution control equipment, and is calling for tax
relief to offset losses in corporate profits.<A HREF="trade8.html#206"><sup>206</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Harmonization is also to be a costly barrier to trade, with regulatory
barriers being erected to compensate for lower tariffs.  The Border Trade
Alliance, a coalition of free trade businesses along the U.S.-Mexico border,
reports that a variety of government-imposed customs fees are being used as
non-tariff barriers against traders, transport companies, and even individuals
crossing the border.  For example, when the U.S. imposed a $30 fee for
phytosanitary certificates, within thirty days Mexico had imposed a $32
phytosanitary fee.  According to the Alliance, some traders fear that NAFTA is
becoming a &#147;fee-trade agreement&#148; in which tariffs are being replaced
with fees that are having the cumulative effect of raising cross-border trading
costs to pre-NAFTA levels.<A HREF="trade8.html#207"><sup>207</sup></A>  A customs broker
in El Paso, Texas
laments that NAFTA is &#147;a managed trade agreement.  Or a preferred trade
agreement.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#208"><sup>208</sup></A><p>

<B>The Greening of Trade Policy: "Sustainable Development" and Global Trade</B><BR>

<b>Global &#147;Free&#148; Trade: Greening the GATT</b><p>
<p>
<u>Historical development:</u><p>
<p>
     GATT was established in 1948 without any significant environmental provisions.
GATT&#146;s primary purpose was to expand trade by reducing tariffs and other
trade barriers.  GATT&#146;s general trade principles include
&#147;most-favored-nation,&#148; which provides that barriers to imported
products should be non-discriminatory (all GATT parties should enjoy equal trading privileges), and &#147;national
treatment,&#148; which requires equal treatment of imports and domestic
products in the application of non-tariff regulations.<p>
<p>
     Several significant features of GATT allow consideration of environmental
issues as they relate to trade.  According to the foremost authority on GATT,
University of Michigan Professor John Jackson, &#147;the GATT relatively easily
accommodates national government environmental regulations that concern the
characteristics of imported products.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#209"><sup>209</sup></A> 
However, an
exception to GATT&#146;s general trade principles is required for many
environmental measures that do not regulate product characteristics, but
instead regulate the process by which they are produced.<p>
<p>
<i>  Article XX:  </i>Defined in Article XX, environmental exceptions to GATT
principles, as qualified in a preamble,<A HREF="trade8.html#210"><sup>210</sup></A> provide
that:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which
would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between
countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on
international trade, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent
the adoption or enforcement by any contracting party of measures:<p>
<p>
. . .(b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;<p>
<p>
. . .(g) relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such
measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic
production or consumption. . .&#148;<p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

 <p>
     When these GATT clauses were written in 1947, they were not intended to cover
broad environmental protection issues at all.  The first was meant to exempt
quarantine and other sanitary regulations,<A HREF="trade8.html#211"><sup>211</sup></A> while
the second was
intended to cover efforts to conserve oil, minerals and other finite raw
materials.<A HREF="trade8.html#"><sup>212</sup></A>  As environmental issues have
become more politicized,
however, GATT has been forced to evolve.  The first consideration of an Article
XX exception came in 1982, when Canada disputed a U.S. ban on imports of tuna.
In that case, both parties agreed that tuna should be considered an
&#147;exhaustible natural resource.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#213"><sup>213</sup></A> 
GATT ruled against the
U.S. primarily because the trade measure was not taken in conjunction with
similar domestic restrictions.<p>
     GATT has come under mounting pressure to broaden its environmental exceptions.
For the most part, GATT has resisted this pressure, interpreting
environment-related exceptions very narrowly for fear that their abuse would
lead to disguised protectionism.<A HREF="trade8.html#214"><sup>214</sup></A>  Under
exception (b), dispute
settlement panels, notably in the first Tuna-Dolphin panel report, have
construed the word &#147;necessary&#148; to mean that the measure must be the
least-GATT-inconsistent measure available.<A HREF="trade8.html#215"><sup>215</sup></A> 
Panels have also
limited the exception to measures taken with regard
to resources within a party&#146;s own jurisdiction, reasoning that parties
should not impose trade barriers simply because other parties have differing
policies within their own jurisdiction.<A HREF="trade8.html#216"><sup>216</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Exception (g), in addition to impeding extra-jurisdictional environmental
measures, has been interpreted to require such measures to be &#147;primarily
aimed at&#148; conservation and to &#147;render effective&#148; complementary
domestic restrictions.<A HREF="trade8.html#217"><sup>217</sup></A>  Environmentalists
contend that such
narrow interpretations could virtually nullify the exceptions by hindering
trade measures taken under multilateral environmental agreements, and by
precluding use of unilateral measures aimed at environmental protection of the
&#147;global commons.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#218"><sup>218</sup></A>  Importantly,
they argue that
regulation of process and production methods are sometimes the only means to
protect global commons resources.<A HREF="trade8.html#219"><sup>219</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     In the second Tuna-Dolphin panel decision in 1994, however, GATT suggested
that greater latitude exists in applying Article XX to resources outside of
national jurisdiction.  This was a dispute over the U.S. secondary embargo of
tuna products from countries which import tuna from countries under the Marine
Mammal Protection Act&#146;s primary embargo.  According to the panel report:
&#147;the Panel could see no valid reason supporting the conclusion that the
provisions of Article XX (g) apply only to policies related to the conservation
of exhaustible natural resources located within the territory of the
contracting party invoking the provision.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#220"><sup>220</sup></A> 
This statement
appears to reverse the first Tuna-Dolphin ruling on
extra-jurisdictionality.<A HREF="trade8.html#221"><sup>221</sup></A>  One commentator calls
the panel
report&#146;s argument &#147;a brave stance for the panel since virtually all
of the trade policy community holds to the opposite
conclusion.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#222"><sup>222</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Shortly thereafter, GATT ruled on a European Union complaint regarding the
U.S. fuel efficiency standards under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy law,
which acted to restrict imports of European automobiles to the U.S.  The most
significant part of GATT&#146;s decision related to the fleet averaging
requirement of the law, which was found to be inconsistent with GATT&#146;s
general trade obligations.  The panel found that the fleet averaging
&#147;clearly served the purpose of fuel conservation, and served to render
effective the [domestic] conservation measure...,&#148; thus meeting the key
requirements of Article XX (g).<A HREF="trade8.html#223"><sup>223</sup></A>  The decision
marks the first
time GATT has ever ruled that an environmental measure was GATT-legal.<p>
<p>
<i>  Technical regulations and standards</i>:  The GATT Standards Code was
adopted at the 1979 Tokyo Round in order to minimize obstacles to trade
resulting from the imposition of technical regulations and product standards.  The Code
encourages use of international standards and scientific justification in order
to avoid conflicts.  Some environmentalists feared that this would lead to
downward harmonization, though little empirical evidence exists that this has
occurred.<A HREF="trade8.html#224"><sup>224</sup></A><p>
<u></u><p>

<u>Demands for Change &#151; Greening GATT:</u><p>
<u></u><p>
     GATT&#146;s unusual historical beginnings have prevented it from addressing
the emerging issue of multilateral environmental protection.  By design, GATT
is relatively non-binding and powerless, lacking an international organization,
a charter, or enforcement provisions.  Originally, GATT was intended to be an
interim arrangement pending ratification of the International Trade
Organization (ITO), through the Havana Charter.<A
HREF="trade8.html#225"><sup>225</sup></A>  GATT was
continued after the failure of the ITO to come into force in 1948, but GATT
itself was never ratified as a treaty.<A HREF="trade8.html#226"><sup>226</sup></A>  
Substantively, GATT was
limited to commercial policy subjects, and did not deal with most of the
ITO&#146;s other objectives such as full employment policies, economic
development, and raw materials.<A HREF="trade8.html#227"><sup>227</sup></A><p>
<p>
     These historical circumstances bequeathed various institutional weaknesses
which have inhibited GATT from accruing excessive regulatory powers over
 world trade.  GATT&#146;s rigid voting procedures make it extremely difficult
to amend.  Formal amendments require unanimous consent of the parties, or in
some circumstances, a two-thirds majority.  Since amendments must be ratified
by over one hundred parties, consensus for broad expansion of GATT powers has
always been elusive.<A HREF="trade8.html#228"><sup>228</sup></A>  According to Jackson,
&#147;during the
history of GATT, it appears that there has never been a Contracting Party vote
that imposed a new obligation on GATT Contracting Parties.&#148;<A
HREF="trade8.html#229"><sup>229</sup></A>
Instead of revision through amendment, GATT has been progressively strengthened
by several protracted negotiating rounds which required ratification by
participating nations, but these rounds have not introduced dramatic changes
with regard to environmental policies.<A HREF="trade8.html#230"><sup>230</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The exercise of GATT&#146;s powers are also limited by its cumbersome dispute
settlement procedures.  GATT&#146;s ability to enforce its rulings against
losing parties has been curtailed by the single-nation veto, which enables any
country to block panel decisions, including the defendant.<A
HREF="trade8.html#231"><sup>231</sup></A>  Thus,
the remedy for violation of GATT provisions, trade sanctions, is almost never
authorized.  Since arbitration procedures are confidential, they have been
relatively immune to environmental special interest pleadings and influence.<p>
<p>
     GATT&#146;s convoluted institutional rules have prevented it from succumbing
to significant environmental policy entanglements.  Because the GATT is
inhospitable to rapid revision, environmentalists have bemoaned the
time-consuming process of creative interpretation that would be required in
order to reverse unfavorable dispute settlement panel precedents.<A
HREF="trade8.html#232"><sup>232</sup></A>
For environmental activists experienced in
&#147;public interest&#148; advocacy, only a comprehensive overhaul of
defective GATT trade rules can accomplish their objective.<A
HREF="trade8.html#233"><sup>233</sup></A><p>
<p>
     According to the World Wildlife Fund&#146;s Von Moltke, a sufficiently rapid
greening of trade can take place only under &#147;a formal treaty establishing
an international organization with authority to act within its charter to
identify emerging issues and bring them to negotiation in a timely manner
without requiring consensus on all details.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#234"><sup>234</sup></A>  For GATT to
embrace a new
environmental agenda, its legal authority over world trading policies would
have to be restored to the level intended for the ITO in the Havana
Charter.<A HREF="trade8.html#235"><sup>235</sup></A><p>
<p>
     A new institution with greater legal authority, the World Trade Organization
(WTO), was proposed during the latest Uruguay Round of
negotiations.<A HREF="trade8.html#236"><sup>236</sup></A>  The WTO accord was signed by
approximately 120
countries on April 15, 1994.  Peter
Suchman, a former Treasury Department trade official under three presidents,
explains that U.S. acceptance of the WTO had little to do with free trade:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The Uruguay Round final provisions on dispute settlement and the WTO represent
a major victory for U.S. negotiators, who had rejected the WTO concept as
proposed early in the Round by Canada and the EC.  The U.S. held out on the WTO
as a means to ensure that its own trade laws, including section 301, would not
be unreasonably limited.  And it worked!<A HREF="trade8.html#237"><sup>237</sup></A><p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
     Jackson describes the WTO charter as &#147;a fairly radical new technique for
changing the GATT,&#148; that would &#147;provide, for the first time, a
definitive legal treaty text to establish the organization, and put it on a
sounder footing for future evolution.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#238"><sup>238</sup></A> 
Although it is
unclear precisely how the new WTO will incorporate environmental standards into
world trading rules, the drafting history of the ITO suggests that the
WTO&#146;s earlier incarnation would have done so.<A
HREF="trade8.html#239"><sup>239</sup></A>  On strictly
environmental grounds, developing countries might not have considered a WTO to
be in their best interests.  However, they assented to the proposal in the
hopes that it would lead to enhanced access to global markets.<p>
<p>
<u>The WTO and Formal Environmental Language:</u><p>
<p>
     According to a report by the U.S. Trade Representative, the United States
considered several key environment-related provisions of early Uruguay Round
drafts to be inadequate, and began to seek substantial revisions in late 1992.
Almost entirely due to efforts by the Clinton administration, the final text of
the Uruguay Round accord incorporated several new environmental features.<p>
<p>
<i>  The preamble</i>: Early drafts made vague reference to the &#147;optimal
use of resources of the word at sustainable levels.&#148;<A
HREF="trade8.html#240"><sup>240</sup></A>  The
U.S. modified this provision in the final text, which now calls for &#147;the
optimal use of the world&#146;s resources in accordance with the objective of
sustainable development, seeking both to protect and preserve the environment
and enhance the means for doing so...&#148;<A
HREF="trade8.html#241"><sup>241</sup></A><p>
<p>
<i>  Standards Harmonization</i>:  The Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary
Measures applies to a wide range of public health measures such as food safety
and pesticide standards, meat inspection rules, and quarantine procedures.  Early
drafts would have required all public health measures to be the &#147;least
restrictive to trade&#148; of available alternatives.<A HREF="trade8.html#242"><sup>242</sup></A>  Countries would be
required to base
their standards on international standards, with higher standards allowed only
with &#147;scientific justification.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#243"><sup>243</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The U.S. feared that it would not be able to maintain standards higher than
international standards (i.e., downward harmonization), and that U.S. measures
might not withstand scientific scrutiny.  The Clinton administration
successfully changed this provision, requiring only that food safety measures
are &#147;not more trade restrictive than required to achieve their appropriate
level of protection, taking into account technical an economic
feasibility.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#244"><sup>244</sup></A>  A footnote elaborates that a
health measure
will not be considered more trade restrictive than required unless there is
another measure significantly less restrictive to trade.  However, the
requirements for the alternative measure are very rigorous.  It must 1) achieve
the level of protection demanded by the importing country; 2) be considered
&#147;reasonably available&#148;; 3) be technically and economically feasible;
and 4) be significantly less restrictive of trade.<A HREF="trade8.html#245"><sup>245</sup></A> 
As the U.S.
Trade Representative explains, the first requirement alone would preclude
virtually any alternative measures that are &#147;demonstrably less effective
in protecting public health (for instance, warning labels are less effective
than product bans, and voluntary labelling is less effective than mandatory
labelling).&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#246"><sup>246</sup></A><p>
<p>
     As with earlier drafts, the final agreement requires nations to harmonize
their food safety and sanitary standards, basing them on international
standards set by international bureaucracies such as the Codex Alimentarius
Commission, a U.N. body.<A HREF="trade8.html#247"><sup>247</sup></A>  Due to U.S. efforts,
a provision
specifically enables countries to &#147;introduce or maintain sanitary and
phytosanitary measures which result in a higher level&#148; of protection than
international standards, provided there is scientific
justification.<A HREF="trade8.html#248"><sup>248</sup></A>  The U.S. insisted that only a
government itself
could determine scientific justification, not dispute settlement
panels.<A HREF="trade8.html#249"><sup>249</sup></A>  No specific provision is made at all for
measures to be
lower than international standards.  To monitor the harmonization process, this
agreement creates a Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary
Measures.<A HREF="trade8.html#250"><sup>250</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The requirement that no measure should be maintained without &#147;scientific
evidence&#148; was also changed, now simply barring measures maintained without
&#147;sufficient scientific evidence.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#251"><sup>251</sup></A> 
The final standards
provisions are so flexible, even the scientifically flawed Delaney Clause,
which sets a zero-risk level for food additives, could not be judged a barrier
to trade.<A HREF="trade8.html#252"><sup>252</sup></A>  The reason: The WTO gives sole
discretion to determine
the appropriate level of protection or health risk to central government
authorities, with little regard for the consequences of such decisions for
trade.<A HREF="trade8.html#253"><sup>253</sup></A>  As the U.S. Trade Representative boasts:
&#147;the mere
fact that a food safety measure may have a disproportionate effect on imports
is not sufficient to qualify it as a disguised restriction on
trade.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#254"><sup>254</sup></A><p>
<p>
<i>  Harmonization of Technical Barriers:</i>  The Agreement on Technical
Barriers to Trade applies to environmental, health, and safety standards, as
well as technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures.  The
agreement calls on
countries to harmonize technical regulations by participating in standardizing
bodies such as the International Standards Organization (ISO).  A Committee on
Technical Barriers to Trade is formed to monitor the harmonization process and
to guard against &#147;downward harmonization.<A
HREF="trade8.html#255"><sup>255</sup></A> The U.S. objected
to early draft provisions which suggested that environmental measures should be
&#147;proportionate&#148; to the risk, and had the provision
deleted.<A HREF="trade8.html#256"><sup>256</sup></A><p>
<p>
     One draft provision barred environmental measures if alternate measures could
accomplish the same objective in a less trade restrictive manner.<A
HREF="trade8.html#257"><sup>257</sup></A>
Fearing this would prevent countries from enforcing stringent environmental standards, the
U.S. pushed to modify the requirement such that environmental measures merely
must not be &#147;more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate
objective.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#258"><sup>258</sup></A>  A legitimate objective is
defined as &#147;. .
.the protection of human health or safety, animal or plant life or health, or
the environment.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#259"><sup>259</sup></A>  This provision makes
clear that any
alternate measures less restrictive to trade would have to fulfill a central
government&#146;s own determination of its &#147;appropriate&#148; level of
protection in satisfying a legitimate objective.<A
HREF="trade8.html#260"><sup>260</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The agreement&#146;s technical standards language prevents standards from
being applied &#147;with the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to
trade.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#261"><sup>261</sup></A>  However, this hopeful language
is mitigated by the
agreement&#146;s definition of a technical regulation, which is one that lays
down product characteristics.  According to trade expert Kenneth Berlin of the
law firm of Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam and Roberts, since the only regulations
covered by the agreement are those that affect product characteristics,
&#147;environmental laws like the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and
regulations promulgated thereunder are not subject to review under the TBT
agreement.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#262"><sup>262</sup></A>  Likewise, the
agreement&#146;s provisions
&#147;do not permit a nation to argue that a market-based incentive is less
trade restrictive than a command and control regulation.&#148;<A
HREF="trade8.html#263"><sup>263</sup></A>
Moreover, the agreement does not require a nation to give any scientific
justification for technical regulations.<p>
<p>
<i>  Dispute Settlement</i>:  The Dispute Settlement Agreement broadens the GATT
language so that arbitration panels will be able to seek scientific and
technical advice from any individual or organization.  Each nation that is
party to a trade dispute must make summaries of its dispute-panel submissions
publicly available.<A HREF="trade8.html#264"><sup>264</sup></A>  In cases involving
environmental issues,
panels may consult with expert review groups regarding relevant scientific and
technical issues, meaning that it is possible for environmental matters to have
greater impact on panel decisions.  These public- participation\transparency
provisions are unprecedented in GATT, and can be used by industry,
environmental, and other special interest groups to influence the WTO.<p>
<p>
     Strict time limits are set for dispute settlement panels to adjudicate
complaints.  The WTO permits cross-retaliation, meaning that countries have
expanded rights 
to impose punitive trade sanctions as a way of enforcing WTO rulings.  These
features will give the WTO more binding authority than GATT.<p>
<p>
<i>  Subsidies</i>:  Government assistance to private businesses is given a
&#147;green light&#148; under the Subsidies Code.  Twenty percent of the cost
of adaptation to environmental regulatory requirements may be subsidized
without the threat of challenge under the WTO.<A HREF="trade8.html#265"><sup>265</sup></A>  
An exemption is
also available for subsidies which are part of a government&#146;s policies
focusing on research and development, and regional assistance.  Assistance for
up to 75 percent of industrial research costs, and 50 percent of development
costs are specifically permitted.<A HREF="trade8.html#266"><sup>266</sup></A>  In the U.S., this
provision
could effect subsidies for environmental technology under the green industrial
policy being promoted by the Clinton-Gore administration.<A

<B>The Greening of Trade Policy: "Sustainable Development" and Global Trade</B><BR>
by James M. Sheehan<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P><P>
<u>Future changes?</u><p>
<p>
     The environmental movement is far from satisfied with current progress in
greening the GATT.  Yet by threatening to sidetrack trade agreements in the
U.S. Congress, it has had a significant impact on environmental provisions in
GATT.  According to a business advisory report to the U.S. Trade
Representative, &#147;U.S. negotiators worked to obtain limited changes now,
while leaving more comprehensive [environmental] reforms to post-Uruguay Round
negotiations.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#268"><sup>268</sup></A><p>
<p>
     At the conclusion of the Uruguay Round on December 15, 1993, trade negotiators
agreed to a Decision on Trade and Environment and designed a work program for
modifying GATT.  Among the objectives of this program was &#147;the adherence
to effective multilateral disciplines to ensure the responsiveness of the
Multilateral Trading System to environmental objectives, including principle 12
of the Rio Declaration.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#269"><sup>269</sup></A><p>
<p>
     An outgrowth of the Decision was the creation of a Committee on Trade and the
Environment (CTE), which will recommend modifications to WTO rules.  The
Committee will consider economic instruments, pollution charges and
environmental taxes, recycling regulations, processes and production methods,
packaging and labelling requirements, and public participation rights.  It may
review any trade-related issue, including &#147;eco-dumping,&#148; carbon
taxes, levies on fossil fuels, and transportation restrictions.<A
HREF="trade8.html#270"><sup>270</sup></A>
Within the CTE, the Clinton administration intends to press the WTO to broaden
its environmental provisions by clarifying &#147;the circumstances under which
GATT rules permit countries to use trade measures to protect the
environment&#148; and also by clarifying &#147;the scope of the exceptions for
environmental measures.<A HREF="trade8.html#271"><sup>271</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Stronger environmental provisions could be established in several ways.
Member countries could vote to 1) waive WTO trade obligations under certain
conditions; 2) adopt authoritative interpretations of WTO obligations and
exceptions; or 3) amend WTO agreements and dispute settlement
rules.<A HREF="trade8.html#272"><sup>272</sup></A>  If the CTE determines that incremental
environmental
reforms of the WTO would be insufficient, it could recommend an entirely new
environmental charter for world trade.<p>
<p>
     The first item in the CTE&#146;s list of priorities is the legal relationship
between multilateral environmental agreements and the WTO.<A
HREF="trade8.html#273"><sup>273</sup></A>  This
relationship is critically important, since it could effectively create new
exceptions to general trade principles, and open the door further to green
protectionism.  Jackson suggests that multilateral treaties (and their process
and production regulations) could be made WTO-consistent very easily by
adopting a waiver of general trade obligations.  The current number of GATT
countries which have signed the Montreal Protocol would be a sufficient number
to sustain a vote for such a waiver.<A HREF="trade8.html#274"><sup>274</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Once exceptions are made for multilateral agreements, the WTO would be able to
consider exempting certain unilateral trade measures as well.  Once the
principle is established that the global commons are in need of protection via trade
policies, inevitably there will arise certain environmental problems that
multilateral agreements do not remedy.  The U.S. argues that there should be
international consensus for using unilateral trade measures as a valid means of
forcing &#147;rogue&#148; countries to sign multilateral environmental
agreements.<A HREF="trade8.html#275"><sup>275</sup></A>  In effect, the U.S. proposal would
obfuscate the
distinction between unilateral and multilateral trade measures, thereby
legitimizing a host of U.S. environmental laws within the WTO, including the
Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Pelly Amendment.<A
HREF="trade8.html#276"><sup>276</sup></A>  <p>
<p>
     WTO provisions on technical regulations and environmental product standards
could have profound effects on world trade.  The most recent set of standards
being developed by the International Standards Organization, the ISO 14000
series, and are scheduled to be implemented in early 1996.<A
HREF="trade8.html#277"><sup>277</sup></A>
Previously, the ISO merely set obscure technical and safety standards.  The ISO
14000 will now set standards for international environmental management
systems, auditing, performance evaluations, eco-labelling and life-cycle
analysis.<A HREF="trade8.html#278"><sup>278</sup></A>  Such standards are used in enforcing
government
regulations and international agreements, and could impose hefty costs on
exporters who must obtain ISO certification for their products to enter
international commerce.  Consequently, the WTO could result in an entirely new
layer of bureaucratic rules and regulations, non-tariff barriers whose costs
will be passed along to consumers.<p>
<p>
     If the WTO is to integrate broader pollution and conservation standards into
world trade, it must also resolve the problem of harmonizing such standards
among many countries at varying stages of economic development.  Many experts
have proposed global minimum environmental standards as a pre-condition for
access
to global markets.  Such standards would include general environmental
objectives and principles, protocols on minimum standards for pollution emissions, and
financing mechanisms.<A HREF="trade8.html#279"><sup>279</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Since the GATT/WTO has little experience in determining appropriate
environmental standards, some cooperation with relevant U.N. institutions such
as the Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Commission on Sustainable Development
(UNCSD) would be required.<A HREF="trade8.html#280"><sup>280</sup></A>  The U.N.
Commission on Global
Governance, the successor to the 1987 World Commission on Environment and
Development, is in the process of designing a comprehensive reform of
international institutions in the U.N. system and the GATT for this purpose.
Among its goals are &#147;multilateral free trade,&#148; &#147;sustainable
development on a global basis,&#148; and solutions to &#147;grave environmental
problems beyond national remedy. . .&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#281"><sup>281</sup></A> 
Greater cooperation
between existing multilateral institutions would likely be more practical than
consolidating their functions in a single body.<A
HREF="trade8.html#282"><sup>282</sup></A><p>
<p>
     According to Jackson, WTO-consistent rules to enforce minimum environmental
standards would ensure increasingly stringent standards.  International
cooperation on minimum standards would discourage deregulatory competition, and
thus reinforce the interplay between environmental lobbyists and government.
Jackson describes how this process would work in the trading system:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
In many cases, domestic leaders find it politically difficult to implement a
preferred course of action unless there is some external pressure that help
them in their domestic advocacy, and also in some cases gives them an
&#145;excuse&#146; for taking that action.<A HREF="trade8.html#283"><sup>283</sup></A><p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
     Integration of environmental and trade policies cannot proceed without the
involvement of non-governmental organizations in the process.  Future change in
the WTO hinges on the degree of public participation in and transparency of the
organizations procedures.  Environmental interest groups have demanded access
to the WTO dispute settlement body, the Committee on Trade and Environment, and
all other aspects of WTO decisionmaking.  Environmental lobbyists describe the
goal of greater transparency as a &#147;battle cry&#148; for participation in
&#147;the formation, negotiation, and implementation of trade policies and
accords.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#284"><sup>284</sup></A>  Jackson illuminates the
motivation of
environmental lobbyists:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
. . .the environmental policy groups, perhaps partly because they primarily
operate on the national scene, have become used to using the processes of
publicity and lobbying pressure on Congress or Parliaments, to which they have
considerable access.  There is, thus, a much broader sense of
&#145;participation&#146; in the processes, which the international processes
have not yet accommodated.  Furthermore, the environmental policy groups...have
a sense of power achieved through successes in the legislative and public
discussion processes.<A HREF="trade8.html#285"><sup>285</sup></A><p>

<H2>Implications of the Greening of Trade</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>The merging of trade with environmental policies can only produce increased
protectionism, regulation and bureaucratic interference in international
commerce.  The historical development of environmental restrictions in the U.S.
offers an appropriate analogy.  For more than a century, environmental regulation was
strictly limited by the American system of federalism.  The Constitution&#146;s
decentralized structure placed wildlife under the exclusive jurisdiction of the
states, notwithstanding the federal government&#146;s superior authority under
the interstate commerce clause.  During the nineteenth century, the Supreme Court ruled that
national environmental regulations were precluded by this exclusive state
jurisdiction.<A HREF="trade8.html#286"><sup>286</sup></A><p>
<p>
     The roots of the federal government&#146;s centralization of power can be
found in an international agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom,
the 1916 Migratory Bird Treaty.  The Supreme Court, in <i>Missouri v.
Holland</i>, used that treaty to establish federal jurisdiction in regulating
the hunting of wild birds.  Later 
Court decisions built upon this decision&#146;s implication that relying on
states for conservation policies was inadequate,<A HREF="trade8.html#287"><sup>287</sup></A>
establishing
federal control over wildlife in interstate commerce.<A
HREF="trade8.html#288"><sup>288</sup></A>  Over time,
these trends permitted a virtually unlimited consolidation of federal power
over environmental matters through a gradual &#147;process of
accretion.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#289"><sup>289</sup></A><p>
<p>
     Federal consolidation would soon contradict the original purpose of the
interstate commerce clause: to free commerce from &#147;stifling
regulation,&#148; according to constitutional scholar Laurence
Tribe.<A HREF="trade8.html#290"><sup>290</sup></A>  The federal commerce power was
intended to create a
&#147;regulatory vacuum&#148; in which competing economic factions would
produce minimal regulation of private commerce by Congress.<A
HREF="trade8.html#291"><sup>291</sup></A>
Indeed, as long as Congress refrained from enacting strict national standards
during the 1940s, &#146;50s and &#146;60s, &#147;states sold themselves as
attractive sites for new industrial facilities at least in part because they
offered low costs, including lax pollution control requirements,&#148; writes
former EPA official Daniel C. Esty.<A HREF="trade8.html#292"><sup>292</sup></A><p>
<p>
     By the 1970s, however, centralized federal power produced a vast system of
heavily bureaucratized national laws and regulations which stifled competition
amongst the states for new investment and jobs.  Like federal wildlife
regulations earlier this century, comprehensive environmental laws were
installed to prevent states from engaging in an inevitable &#147;race to the
bottom&#148; of environmental destructiveness.<A
HREF="trade8.html#293"><sup>293</sup></A>  Major pieces of
restrictive national legislation, such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water
Act, &#147;might otherwise have been impossible to achieve or enforce if
individual states were free to maintain lower standards,&#148; writes
Esty.<A HREF="trade8.html#294"><sup>294</sup></A>  Today, &#147;[T]he entire body of
environmental law and
regulation in the United States rests solely on the authority of the federal
government to regulate interstate commerce (an exception to the general rule
that powers not specifically ceded to the federal government are reserved to
the states).&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#295"><sup>295</sup></A><p>
<p>
     As the American system of federalism has evolved, the states have retained
limited authority to enforce environmental standards, provided they exceed
national standards, though even this auhority is preempted in some cases.  The
primary limit on the stringency of state standards is central government
oversight to ensure that such standards do not obstruct free trade amongst
states, functioning much as the NAFTA and GATT/WTO bureaucracies do
internationally.  In balancing trade and environmental considerations, U.S.
courts have grappled with many of the same issues surrounding the
interpretation of GATT&#146;s Article XX.  In fact, Esty advances U.S. commerce
clause jurisprudence as &#147;a valuable starting point for analyzing how
environmental considerations might be woven into the fabric of the
GATT.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#296"><sup>296</sup></A><p>
<p>
     What this analysis fails to take into account, however, is that centralization
in the U.S. has facilitated the creation of cartels &#151; large-sized business
groupings protected against competition from efficient new entrants.  According
to University of Chicago economist B. Peter Pashigian, &#147;Environmental
rules have not only reduced the number of plants in the affected industries but
have made it more difficult for small plants to compete with
large.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#297"><sup>297</sup></A>  Cartelization on a global scale
would benefit
neither trade nor environmental objectives.<p>
<p>
     On a global level, there is no Constitution or Supreme Court to interpret
international environmental law apart from the GATT/WTO.  International
environmental agreements are implemented only to the extent that individual
governments agree to enforce them.  Economic enforcement of international
environmental standards through trade measures has traditionally been minimal,
in large part due to the free-market orientation of GATT and other trade
agreements.  GATT in particular has provided a free-market safety valve,
allowing countries to escape the more onerous environmental commitments.  The
merging of environmental standards into trade agreements like NAFTA and WTO is
an attempt to close off that safety valve and to allow for enforcement of international
environmental laws through trade policy.  This can only result in more
stringent regulation of world trade; indeed, the evolution of GATT&#146;s trade
and environment jurisprudence is already beginning to resemble the U.S. federal
government&#146;s.<p>
<p>
     To the extent that the greening of trade rules makes international
environmental law more enforceable, it shifts responsibility away from nations,
sub-national units (states), and individuals, creating an even greater distance
between individuals and their governments.<A HREF="trade8.html#298"><sup>298</sup></A> 
Green-trade advocates
seem to view the loss of accountability to international bureaucracies (such as
the WTO) as necessary.  Esty, for example, argues that the global character of
all environmental problems implies that natural resources can only be protected
&#147;by surrendering a bit of national sovereignty and by participating in an
international regime.&#148;<A HREF="trade8.html#299"><sup>299</sup></A><p>
<p>
     In the U.S., environmental trade rules could be used by the federal government
to justify further unfunded mandates on the states, greater infringements on
private property rights, and higher trade barriers.  However, political
centralization of trade and environmental policies will have its most serious
effects in the Third World.  International environmental agreements attempt to
dictate the resource management policies of poorer countries.  Moreover, by
restricting development, international environmental regulations work to
perpetuate Third World poverty.  Such political domination through intrusive
environmental controls is resented by developing countries as
eco-imperialistic.<A HREF="trade8.html#300"><sup>300</sup></A>  Since all the major players
&#151; big
business and environmental lobbyists, the U.S. government, participants in the
WTO Committee on Trade and the Environment &#151; appear to accept the need to
incorporate environmental standards into world trade, the future of free trade
is in doubt.  In the end, competitive trade may depend on greater Third World
resistance to the environmental strictures being imposed on the world&#146;s
poor through trade agreements like the WTO, NAFTA, the Basel Convention, and
others.<p>

point of view since the overall population is rising 2 to 6 percent.  Moreover,
if significant numbers of tuna are caught before they spawn, dolphin protection
measures could actually reduce the tuna population by 30 to 60 percent.<p>

<A NAME="156"></A><sup>156</sup> See GATT Secretariat, pp. 30-31. The GATT
Secretariat generally
discourages environmental trade measures as discriminatory trade barriers.  Yet
it maintains that trade measures are acceptable for preventing the undermining
of a multilateral agreement, or to broaden participation in an agreement.  GATT
also endorses foreign aid incentives to developing countries.<p>
<A NAME="157"></A><sup>157</sup> Repetto, pp. 8-9.  Such exceptions to free trade in
GATT were
explicitly rejected during trade negotiations in 1946, when the U.S. attempted
to insert international agreements into the charter of the proposed
International trade Organization, but was rebuffed by Brazil.<p>

to set its own level of environmental protection, it cannot be forced to abide
by NAFTA&#146;s environmental provisions.  &#147;It has often been alleged that
various provisions of NAFTA require the upward harmonization of environmental
standards while preventing such standards from ever being relaxed...such
conclusions are unfounded and without merit.&#148;  Also, &#147;the various
clauses providing for obligations and commitments of treaty signatories are
literally toothless and of little consequence.&#148;<p>

Because the U.S. business community was reluctant to put trade under the
control of a bureaucracy, GATT exists only by virtue of the 1947 Protocol of
Provisional Application, proclaimed by the president without formal
ratification by the Senate.  The Protocol lacks the binding authority of a
treaty; even its name implies a more tenuous legal standing.  See pp. 28-29.<p>

differences.  When the U.N. Conference on Trade and Employment completed the

<H2>Chapter 1: Population, Food, and Income </H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>



<P>World population has more than tripled since 1900, rising from 1.6
billion to 5.3 billion today.<p>
<p>
Global life expectancy more than doubled this century from 30 to 64 years,
while global infant mortality fell from 170 infant deaths per 1,000 births in
1950 to just 60 in 1990.  Rapid population growth has occurred not because
human beings suddenly started breeding like rabbits but because they finally
stopped dropping like flies.<p>
<p>
Despite a tripling of the world&#146;s population in this century, global
health and productivity have exploded.  Today human beings eat better, produce
more, and consume more than ever before in the past.<p>
<p>
The current rate of annual worldwide population growth is down to 1.6 percent
and continues to fall from its 1960&#146;s peak of 2.0 percent.  The average
annual growth rate is 0.4 percent for developed countries and 1.9 percent for
developing regions.<p>
<p>
&#147;Overpopulation&#148; is a problem that has been misidentified and
misdefined.  The term has no scientific definition or clear meaning.  The
problems typically associated with overpopulation (hungry families, squalid and
overcrowded living conditions) are more properly understood as issues of
poverty.<p>
<p>
The total fertility rate for the world as a whole dropped by nearly two-fifths
between 1950/55 and 1990/95-from about 5 children per woman down to about 3.1
children per woman.  Average fertility in the more developed regions fell from
2.8 to 1.7 children per woman, well below biological replacement.  Meanwhile
total fertility rates in less developed regions fell by 40 percent, falling
from 6.2 to 3.5 children per woman.<p>
<p>
Global per capita calorie availability rose by nearly a third between the 1930s
and late 1980s, with per capita food supplies rising by 40 percent in Africa,
Asia, and Latin America.<p>
<p>
Worldwide per capita productivity has surged alongside the population boom.
Between 1950 and 1989, per capita output tripled in Western Europe, North
America and Australia, doubled in India and Pakistan, and increased eightfold
in South Korea and tenfold in Taiwan.  Even parts of Africa may have enjoyed a
near tripling of per capita output between 1913 and 1989.<p>
<p>
Although some blame dwindling natural resources for the reversals and
catastrophes that have recently befallen heavily populated low-income
countries, such episodes are directly traceable to the policies or practices of
presiding governments.<p>

<H2>Chapter 10: Richer is Cleaner--Long Term Trends in Global Air Quality</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>

<P>Richer is cleaner.  Anything that retards economic growth also retards
ultimate environmental cleanup.<p>
<p>
Traditional pollutants like smoke and particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and
fecal coliform bacteria begin to decline when per capita incomes reach $3,280,
$3,670, and $1,375, respectively.<p>
<p>
Empirical evidence indicates that projections using the famous I = PAT
equation, widely publicized by biologist Paul Ehrlich, are dead wrong.  I
represents the cumulative impact on the environment; P, the population; A,
affluence; and T, technology.  Greater economic and technological progress are
necessary preconditions for the solution, rather than the causes, of
environmental degradation.  They make cleaner environments more affordable,
reduce the impacts per unit of production, and help moderate population
growth.<p>
<p>
In the United States, sulfur dioxide emissions per capita are down 60 percent
from the peak in 1920.  Both particulates and carbon monoxide emissions per
capita have declined more or less continuously since World War II-inhalable
particulates down 79 percent since 1940 and carbon monoxide down 53 percent
since 1945.  Volatile organic compounds emissions per capita (contributors to
smog) stayed roughly constant between 1925 and 1970, before they declined; in
1992 they were down 36 percent from the peak. Nitrogen oxide per capita peaked
in 1980.  It is now down about 10 percent from its peak.<p>
<p>
Ambient sulfur dioxide and particulate matter have been declining for at least
the last two decades in most developed countries.<p>
<p>
Ambient sulfur dioxide levels in many world megacities have already declined
significantly from the 1970s.  Cities in the developed world have relatively
low levels. Cities in the developing world have the highest levels.<p>
<p>
Ambient particulate matter is still a problem in most megacities.  Among a
sample of twenty world megacities, the three having low levels were all located
in the developed world (New York, London, and Tokyo).<p>
<p>
The gravest air quality problem in the world is indoor air pollution due to
heating and cooking with coal, wood, and dung or other biofuels in developing
countries.  Indoor particulate levels in poor countries rival those of the
worst acute industrial episodes of the past.<p>

<H2>Chapter 2: Saving the Planet with Pesticides: Increasing Food Supplies</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>

<P>Food is more abundant and cheaper today than at any other time before in
history.  Per capita grain supplies have increased 24 percent since 1950, while
food prices have plummeted by 57 percent since 1980.<p>
<p>
Food production has outpaced population growth since the 1960s.  The increase
in food production in poor countries has been more than double the population
growth rate in recent years.<p>
<p>
The global trouble spots for soil erosion and habitat destruction-the Amazon
rain forest, parts of Africa, and other scattered locations-are experiencing
problems because local agriculture has not taken advantage of high-yield
technologies and efficiencies.  In the case of the rain forest, problems have
been compounded by government subsidies for farming and logging.<p>
<p>
Global increases in average grain yields have lagged recently because affluent
countries are trying to limit their surpluses and because of chaotic conditions
in the former Soviet Union.  By contrast, grain yields in developing countries
rose 32 percent between 1980 and 1992.<p>
<p>
Farmers are not close to reaching the point of diminishing returns in crop
yields.  In fact, the general trend for most crops is sustained growth, often
at high and even accelerating rates of gain.<p>
<p>
Modern high-yield farming is responsible for preserving a great deal of the
world&#146;s biodiversity. If crop yields had remained at levels typical of the
1950s, farmers would have had to plow down an additional 10 million square
miles of wildlife habitat to raise enough food for the current world food
supply.<p>
<p>
For 10,000 years soil erosion has been a major threat to humanity&#146;s
sustainable existence.  Traditional low-yield farming is responsible for the
highest rates of soil erosion.  Two modern soil-saving techniques, conservation
tillage and no-till systems, cut erosion by 65 percent and 98 percent,
respectively.<p>
<p>
The UN&#146;s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that despite
progress, the number of people with inadequate diets increased in the past ten
years, from 540 million to 580 million.  Nonetheless, it should be relatively
easy to boost the vast majority over the threshold of hunger, since 90 percent
of those with inadequate diets are now within 10 percent of having enough
calories for good health.<p>
<p>
The risk to humans and wildlife from agrochemicals is far less than the risk of
losing wildlife to low yields and the  consequent plowing down of more habitat.<P>

<H2>Chapter 3: Global Warming: Messy Models, Decent Data, and Pointless Policy</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>

<P>
The earth&#146;s atmosphere has actually cooled by 0.13 degrees Celsius since
1979 according to highly accurate satellite-based atmospheric temperature
measurements.  By contrast, computer climate models predicted that the globe
should have warmed by an easily detectable 0.4 C over the last fifteen years.<p>
<p>
The scientific evidence argues against the existence of a greenhouse crisis,
against the notion that realistic policies could achieve any meaningful
climatic impact, and against the claim that we must act now if we are to reduce
the greenhouse threat.<p>
<p>
Current computer climate models are incapable of coupling the oceans and
atmosphere; misrepresent the role of sea ice, snow caps, localized storms, and
biological systems; and fail to account accurately for the effects of clouds.<p>
<p>
Temperature records reveal that predictive models are off by a factor of two
when applied retroactively in projecting the change in global temperature for
this century.<p>
<p>
The amount of warming from 1881 to 1993 is 0.54 C. Nearly 70 percent of the
warming of the entire time period - 0.37 C -occurred in the first half of the
record - before the period of the greatest buildup of greenhouse gases.<p>
<p>
Accuracy in land-based measurements of global temperatures is frustrated by the
death of stations, frequent station relocations, and changes in how oceangoing
ships make measurements.<p>
<p>
Although all of the greenhouse computer models predict that the greatest
warming will occur in the Arctic region of the Northern Hemisphere, temperature
records indicate that the Arctic has actually cooled by 0.88 C over the past
fifty years.<p>
<p>
Corrective environmental policies would have a minuscule impact on the climate.
According to its own projections, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change&#146;s own plan would spare the earth only a few hundredths of a degree
of warming by middle of the next century. <p>

<H2>Chapter 4: The Coming Age of Abundance</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>



<P>The objective, scientific evidence available today shows that the prophets of doom were wrong in virtually every prediction they made in the 1960s and 1970s when they forecast increasing natural resource scarcity and rising commodity prices.

<P>Every measurable trend of the past century suggests that humanity will soon be entering an age of increasing and unprecedented natural resources abundance.

<P>Technological improvements and advances in productivity have continually outpaced our consumption of natural resources and have led to the net creation of more resources available to future generations.

<P>Today, natural resources are about half as expensive relative to wages as they were in 1980, about three times less expensive than they were fifty years ago, and roughly eight times less costly than they were in 1900.

<P>In spite of Paul and Anne Ehrlichs projection that mineral supplies would be largely depleted by 1985, proven reserves of virtually all important minerals have skyrocketed since 1950.

<P>The continuing discovery of new mines, technological innovations in mining techniques, and introductions of less expensive or superior substitutes for the use of some minerals have caused most minerals to become less scarce rather than more scarce over the past 100 years.

<P>Although Paul Ehrlich refers to the 1980s as a  catastrophic decade  in terms of consumption, the period witnessed tremendous increases in the supply of almost all raw materials.

<P>A well-publicized book, <I>The Energy Crisis</I>, projected in 1972 that the earth held thirty years left of gas reserves and twenty years left of oil reserves.  Since 1950, however, proven reserves for oil and gas have climbed by over 700 percent.

<P>The very concept of  finite natural resources  embraced by geologists is a flawed way of thinking about the earth and nature.   Natural resources  have value only when humanity invents a use for them.<P>

<H2>Chapter 5: The Causes and Prevention of Cancer</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>

<P>The idea that there is an epidemic of human cancer caused by synthetic
industrial chemicals is false.<p>
<p>
If lung cancer (which is primarily due to smoking) is excluded, cancer death
rates are decreasing in the United States for all other cancers combined.  In
addition, there is a steady rise in life expectancy in the developed
countries.<p>
<p>
Pollution appears to account for less than 1 percent of human cancer, yet
public concern and resource allocation for chemical pollution are very high, in
good part because of the use of animal cancer tests in cancer risk
assessment.<p>
<p>
About half of the chemicals tested, whether synthetic or natural, are
carcinogenic to rodents at the high doses tested in rodents.<p>
<p>
Linear extrapolation from near-toxic doses in rodents to low-level exposure in
humans has led to grossly exaggerated mortality forecasts.  Such extrapolations
cannot be verified by epidemiology.  Furthermore, relying on such
extrapolations for synthetic chemicals while ignoring the enormous natural
background leads to an imbalanced perception of hazard and allocation of
resources.<p>
<p>
Zero exposure to rodent carcinogens cannot be achieved.  Low levels of rodent
carcinogens of natural origin are ubiquitous in the environment. It is thus
impossible to obtain conditions totally free of exposure to rodent carcinogens
or to background radiation.<p>
<p>
Risks  compete with risks:  society must distinguish between significant and
trivial risks.  Regulating trivial risks or exposure to substances erroneously
inferred to cause cancer at low doses can harm health by diverting resources
from programs that could be effective in protecting the health of the public.<p>
<p>
Epidemiological evidence in humans is sufficient to identify several broad
categories of cancer causation for which the evidence is strong and plausible.
Since many of these are avoidable, it is possible to reduce incidence rates of
many types of cancer.<p>
<p>
Tobacco is the most important global cause of cancer and is preventable.
Smoking contributes to about one-third of U.S. cancer, about one-quarter of
U.S. heart disease, and about 400,000 premature deaths per year in the United
States.<p>
<p>
The quarter of the population with the lowest dietary intake of fruits and
vegetables compared to the quarter with the highest intake has roughly twice
the cancer rate for most types of cancer (lung, larynx, oral cavity, esophagus,
stomach, colon and rectum, bladder, pancreas, cervix, and ovary).<p>
<p>
Decreases in physical activity and increases in smoking, obesity, and
recreational sun exposure have contributed importantly to increases in some
cancers in the modern industrial world, whereas improvements in hygiene have
reduced other cancers related to infection.<p>
<p>
Chronic infections contribute to about one-third of the world&#146;s cancer.<p>

<H2>Chapter 6: Forests: Conflicting Signals</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>

<P>Though nearly 75 percent of the total industrial wood production comes
from Northern Hemisphere industrial countries, the temperate forestlands of
this region are expanding.<p>
<p>
The world&#146;s current industrial wood consumption requirements could be
produced on only 5 percent of the world&#146;s total current forestland.<p>
<p>
About one-third of the earth&#146;s terrestrial area remains wilderness.<p>
<p>
Tropical forests cover a land area that is almost exactly the size of South
America.<p>
<p>
Tropical and temperate forests together cover a land area the size of the
Western Hemisphere.<p>
<p>
The rate of conversion of the tropical forests increased from 0.6 percent in
1980 to about 0.8 percent in 1990.<p>
<p>
Fully two-thirds of the deforestation in the United States occurred in the
sixty years prior to 1910 and most of the other third before 1850.<p>
<p>
Although the United States has been the world&#146;s number one timber producer
since World War II, U.S. forests have experienced an increase in volume in the
past fifty years and have maintained roughly the same area over the past
seventy-five years.<p>
<p>
The total area of forest and other wooded land in Europe increased by 2 million
hectares annually between 1980 and 1990.<p>
<p>
The total forest area of the temperate region&#146;s industrialized countries
increased between 1980 and 1990.<p>
<p>
During 1993, an estimated 4 million trees were planted in the United States
each day.<p>
<p>
The forest biomass in the northern Rockies has increased by 30 percent or more
since the middle of the eighteenth century.<p>
<p>
In recent years, private forestlands have accounted for 85 percent of total
tree planting and seeding in the United States.<p>
<p>
The expansion of American forests has been made possible by improved
tree-growing technology, the advent of tree plantations, improved control over
wildfire, and the reversion of many agricultural lands, especially in the South
and East, to forest.<p>
<p>
Deforestation in the Americas was probably greater before the Columbian
encounter than it was for several centuries after.<p>
<p>
The recent proliferation of plantation forests in both the temperate and the
tropical world has helped to deflect harvesting pressure from natural
forests.<p>
<p>
Almost all of the timber harvested in the United States, Europe, and Nordic
countries comes from second-growth/plantation forests.<p>
<p>
Commercial logging is not a major cause of deforestation; expanding agriculture
is.  In temperate countries, which provide over three-fourths of the
world&#146;s industrial wood, reforestation is the rule, while in tropical
countries forestland conversion to agriculture remains common.<p>
<p>
The developed countries in the temperate regions appear to have largely
completed forestland conversion to agriculture and have achieved relative land
use stability.  By contrast, the developing countries in the tropics are still
in a land conversion mode.  This suggests that land conversion stability
correlates strongly with successful economic development.<p>

<H2>Chapter 7: Conserving Biodiversity: Resources for the Future</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>


<P>An estimated 8 to 10 million different species live on the planet.  Of
these, only about 1.5 million have been named.<p>
<p>
Documented animal extinctions peaked in the 1930s, and the number of
extinctions has been declining since then.<p>
<p>
Thirty-nine percent of the extinctions resulted from the introduction of
nonnative species, 36 percent from habitat destruction, and 23 percent from
hunting (for sport and products for sale) and deliberate elimination of a
species.  The remaining 2 percent became extinct for a variety of causes,
including pollution.<p>
<p>
More than 75 percent of the land on every continent except Europe is available
for wildlife.  It is this &#147;undeveloped&#148; land in developing countries
that is of greatest importance to conserving biodiversity over the long term.<p>
<p>
Well over a billion hectares of the earth&#146;s surface have been set aside as
protected areas, representing over 10 percent of the land area.<p>
<p>
Since 1973, only twenty-three species have been removed from the U.S.
Endangered Species list: eight were listed in error a court invalidated the
listing of one, seven recovered, and seven became extinct.  In other words,
there is an equal probability that a species listed on the Endangered species
Act will recover or become extinct.<p>
<p>
Governments and conservation organizations need to begin to promote harvesting
and using wild species rather than stopping such uses.<p>
<p>
Trade in wildlife products is of the same order of magnitude as trade in
forestry and fish products.  In 1986, international trade in primates, ivory,
orchids, reptile skins, fur-bearers, and tropical fish was worth $5 billion.<p>
<p>
To enhance the probability of sustaining the wild harvest or use, the rural
people living in developing countries with wildlife resources must have
sufficient incentives to conserve the resources, free from excessive government
interference.  Environmentalists need to recognize that rural people can be
allies in conservation, and not treat them as environmental criminals.<p>
<p>
Listing species to achieve legal protection is not working.  More land and
marine areas are being designated as protected; however, it is difficult to
assess how effective protected areas are at conserving biodiversity. <p>

<H2>Chapter 8: Water Options for the Blue Planet</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>

<P>U.S. population has increased by 200 percent since 1900; per capita
water usage grew 500 to 800 percent during the same period.<p>
<p>
Global water use has tripled since 1950.<p>
<p>
Water recycling increased more than 400 percent between 1954 and 1985 and is
expected to double again between 1985 and 2000.<p>
<p>
Transferring just 5 percent of agricultural water to municipal uses would meet
the needs of urban areas in the western United States for the next twenty-five
years.<p>
<p>
Estimates show that a 10 percent increase in price would decrease agricultural
water consumption in California by 6.5 percent and cut overall consumption by
3.7 percent in the seventeen U.S. western states.<p>
<p>
Current government policies do not adequately reflect the costs of operation,
maintenance, and capital for water projects and fail to account for the
environmental damage associated with water storage and delivery.<p>
<p>
Special interest groups constitute a formidable political force to block the
efficient allocation of water.<p>
<p>
Inefficient water use prevails in urban areas because consumers do not have to
pay the full cost of the water they use.<p>
<p>
Water overuse adversely affects the environment by reducing water in streams.
Subsidized agricultural drainage water loaded with leached salts and trace
elements was dumped into California&#146;s Kesterson Wildlife Refuge, causing
the death and deformation of many animals, reptiles, and fish.<p>
<p>
Eliminating laws against water marketing and establishing private water rights
would give consumers an incentive to use water more efficiently.<p>
<p>
Removing legal impediments to water markets would allow private firms to enter
the water supply industry and take the burden off the public treasury.  Market
forces could pare demand, boost supply, reallocate water, and end the threat of
water crises.<p>

<H2>Chapter 9: Rescuing the Oceans</H2>
</CENTER>
<H4>Chapter Highlights</H4>

<P>The commercial harvest of ocean fisheries has risen from an estimated 18
million metric tons in the late 1940s to well over 80 million tons today.  an
additional 24 million tons annually is estimated to be taken by local
fishermen.<p>
<p>
After thousands of years of extensive human use, many of the ocean&#146;s
resources have been seriously damaged or depleted by shortsighted practices.<p>
<p>
Out of eighty-one marine fishery stocks examined, fourteen are still considered
to be overexploited, and another thirty-six were being fished at the maximum
capacity, according to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.<p>
<p>
The annual operating costs of the global marine fishing fleet in 1989 were U.S.
$22 billion greater than the total revenues obtained from the sale of fish.<p>
<p>
The worldwide problem of overfishing has its source in the system of open
access and free use, with its norm that only capture confers ownership of the
fish.<p>
<p>
When oceans are part of the commons, users are more interested in extracting
what they can than in stewarding what they cannot own.<p>
<p>
The government has contributed to the overfishing of marine fisheries by
granting to all citizens the right to fish.<p>
<p>
The &#147;open access&#148; treatment of the oceans has allowed superefficient
commercial fishing fleets to deplete the fisheries, in spite of state action to
limit technologies, impose catch quotas, and restrict access to the
fisheries.<p>
<p>
Drift nets, which indiscriminately net and kill any species they entangle, are
an example of the inappropriate measures taken in the absence of property
rights.<p>
<p>
As a first step, individual transferable quotas-a personal right or license,
which may be sold or exchanged, to catch a given quantity of fish-can encourage
better management of fisheries.<p>
<p>
When water-based resources are privately owned, the same legal rights that
enable shopkeepers and homeowners to prevent trespass or property damage can be
used to ward off water resource abuse.<p>
<p>
Attaching property rights to coastal zones would encourage better management of
the fisheries and create legal rights against polluters.<p>
<p>
If coastal property rights are to be effective, they must be clearly defined,
defended against challengers, and transferable.<p>
<p>
The coastal fisheries cooperative associations (FCA) system in Japan is
exemplary of a property rights-based fishing industry. FCA property rights are
sufficient to block potentially harmful or polluting coastal developments.<p>
<p>
In Washington State, where oyster beds may be privately owned, the threat of a
damages suit against terrestrial sources of pollution has protected the state
coastal zones.<p>
<p>
The lobster industry in Maine has developed a fairly effective, if informal,
system of property rights management.  Along the coast, small boat fishermen
strategically place traps within their exclusively owned areas.
Self-enforcement by these fishermen is the common response to interlopers and
trap thieves.<p>
<p>
Aquaculture has great potential to relieve the impact of overharvesting
fisheries while simultaneously increasing the food supply. <p>

<H1>Unsustainable Policies
</H1>
<a href="fred.html">Fred L. Smith, Jr.</A>

<P>April 1996 <a href="publist1.html#update"><i>CEI UpDate</i></A>
<BR><BR>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<P>In March the Presidents Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD), made up of governmental, environmental and business leaders, presented to President Clinton its final report, Sustainable America.  Impressed by this document, the <I>New York Times</I> reported a truce between environmentalists and businessmen over environmental issues.  Apparently, both agree that the GOP freshman are too  radical  and that Congress should not roll back environmental regulation.  

<P>	Ever the font of pro-government conventional wisdom, the <I>Times</I> fails to realize that industry often finds government regulation desirable.  In fact, most lobbying efforts are designed to secure regulation which improves a firms or an industrys competitive advantage over its rivals.  For example, the Archer Daniels Midland Company pressed hard for a rule in the <A HREF="topic.html#air">Clean Air Act</A> that would guarantee a market share for ethanol, despite the lack of clear environmental gains from such a rule.  The book <A HREF="/books.html#politics"><I>Environmental Politics: Public Costs, Private Rewards</I></A> exhibits several examples of such rent-seeking behavior.
<P>
	That said, the PCSD report serves two primary purposes.  First, it gives credence to a whole array of discredited and failed welfare state programs.  For example, the council calls for an  adequate  minimum wage, more federal job training, greater federal involvement in education, more foreign aid, an expansion of Medicaid, more funding of family planning services, greater federal involvement in agriculture, increased daycare programs, etc., all to ensure better environmental protection.
<P>
	Second, the report recommends new environmental programs which would further exacerbate the anti-competitive and anti-growth features of environmental laws.  Particularly objectionable is the recommendation for  extended product responsibility.   Under this system  manufacturers, suppliers, users, and disposers of products share responsibility for the environmental effects of products and waste streams.  
<P> 
	This proposal would lessen rather than expand responsibility.  In the market, the books are cleared at each stage of a products  life-cycle,  allowing each agent to consider the costs of his or her own actions.  Extending liability throughout the life-cycle would force each agent, when determining costs, to consider a whole range of possible costs imposed by others, as well as the associated probabilities.  The result would be a dramatic increase in uncertainty, blurring the lines of responsibility, rampant litigation, and a decrease in risk-taking by entrepreneurs.  Even though the PCSD claims to work toward  economic growth, environmental health, and social justice  many of its recommendations would destroy economic growth without advancing the other two goals.
<P>
	The PCSD has called for extensive use of the  Precautionary Principle.   It states that  Even in the face of scientific uncertainty, society should take reasonable actions to avert risks where the potential harm to human health or the environment is thought to be serious or irreparable.   Many of the most notorious environmental scares --  dioxin, alar, asbestos, etc. --  prompted such precautionary measures.  Governments pursuit of perfect safety in the absence of reasonable scientific certainty  has led to policies that are irresponsible, extremely costly and in some cases, even deadly.
<P>
	Finally the report is completely devoid of any discussion of the institutions   property rights, contracts, and the rule of law   which have made sustainability possible.  This oversight is indicative of the anti-market, pro-government bias throughout the report.
<P>
	There are some redeeming qualities.  The PCSD does call for the elimination of environmentally damaging subsidies.  The report also constitutes a rhetorical move toward the market.  However, in reality it is a thinly veiled excuse for extensive government intervention into the market.  As such it should be rejected.

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>Everyone knows that the United States faces a Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)
crisis.  The nation is throwing away too much and landfill space is running
out.  Everyone also knows that the nation is responding with laudable efforts
to convert waste into energy, to recycle, and to reduce the volume of trash.<p>
<p>
Unfortunately, what &#147;what everyone knows&#148; turns out to be wrong.  The
reality is that:<p>
<p>
<UL>
<LI>MSW presents  a minor national housekeeping problem, not a crisis.<p>

<LI>The responses are for the most part pointless, wasteful and both
environmentally and economically destructive.<p>
</UL>
<p>
In 1990, the U.S. produced about 195 million tons of MSW.  This may sound like
a lot, but the practical import is small.   Compressed to the average
30-pounds-per-cubic-foot density that exists in a landfill, a year's worth of
MSW could be placed on one square mile of land, in a pile less than 500 feet
high.  Given that the nation has 3 million square miles of territory, and that
landfills can be covered over and used for other purposes, finding sufficient
space for MSW disposal is simply not a serious problem.  Already, the
combination of improved transportation combined with the construction of
&#147;megafills&#148; that can handle massive volumes of trash is putting many
problems well on the way to solution.<p>
<p>
One response to the assumption that space is at a premium has been the
construction of 170 incinerators to burn waste and produce energy.
Incineration does not appear to be a particularly efficient method of either
waste disposal or energy production, however, and combining the two functions
does not solve the problems of either.<p>
<p>
Perhaps the most prevalent response to the we-are-running-out-of-space argument
is recycling.  As of 1993, 39 states and the District of Columbia had some form
of recycling law.  Over 5,000 curbside pickup programs were in operation. <p>
<p>
 Most substances in MSW are at least potentially recyclable, and proponents
tend to equate possibility with practicality.  Much recycling makes no economic
sense because the effort uses up resources&#151;capital, energy,
labor&#151;that are worth more than the value of the recycled product.   <p>
<p>
Recycling raises complicated technical and economic issues that do not yield
easily to arbitrary policies cut from ideological cloth.  Three points are
crucial: <p>
<UL>
<LI>Recycling is itself a manufacturing process.  It uses resources of energy,
capital and labor, and produces wastes.  Recycling is not automatically
superior, as a matter of either economics or morality, to the process of
manufacturing a product from original raw material.<p>
<p>
<LI>It is very difficult to generalize about recycling, and careful attention must
be paid to the particular characteristics of individual industries and
products.  Steel, aluminum, glass, paper, plastic, and yard waste each presents
a different set of issues.<p>
<p>
<LI>Recycling requirements have a potential to undermine the quality of industrial
products and processes.<p>
</UL>
<p>
Most of the substances that are commonly recycled&#151;aluminum, steel, glass,
and some paper and plastic&#151;have some value when delivered in pure form to
a manufacturing plant.  The problem is that for most substances this value is
not great because the ordinary raw materials used to make these substances are
plentiful and cheap.  Collecting, sorting and processing trash is expensive,
and the costs far exceed the value of the materials recovered.  The reality is
that municipalities that expand recycling must cut other programs to subsidize
the effort.<p>
<p>
Recycling is sometimes justified by the arguments that there is a need to
conserve such non-renewable resources as iron ore and petroleum and that
recycling paper saves trees:  neither argument is valid.  Most paper is made
from trash wood or from small trees produced on tree farms.  Thus, recycling
paper has little relevance to preserving majestic trees or old forests.  Proven
reserves of most resources are expanding and commodity prices are declining. <p>
<p>
Despite the defects in the arguments underlying MSW policies, governments are
developing a whole new generation of misguided policies.  These include: <p>
<UL>
<p>
<LI>Requirements that products contain an arbitrary percentage of recycled
material.<p>

<p>
<LI>Compulsory source reduction efforts.<p>
<p>
<LI>Efforts to hold manufacturers responsible for ultimate disposition, as
exemplified by Germany's Green Dot program, and Advanced Disposal Fees.<p>

</UL>
<p>
All of these policies have serious flaws.  Recycled content mandates represent
arbitrary quotas imposed without regard to technical or economic realities.
Yet imposing arbitrary quotas is a silly way to run anything.  The system is
also creating a growing administrative apparatus that will burden both industry
and consumers.<p>
<p>
Source reduction diverts attention from the positive benefits of packaging and
can be harmful.  Reduced packaging can increase spoilage waste, for example,
and mandatory source reduction prevents consumers from making choices about
preferred characteristics.  As with other responses to the MSW crisis, the
result is actually destructive.  <p>
<p>
Manufacturers' responsibility programs combine the worst features of all the
other policies and are based on faulty premises.  An examination of the German
program leads to the conclusion that if has few, if any, benefits.  As with
other misguided MSW policies, it diverts investment into uneconomic uses and
undermines the quality and efficiency of important industries.<p>
<p>
The solution to the MSW non-crisis is to recognize that trash disposal is a
commodity, like coal or asparagus, and to treat it accordingly.  The government
could establish a few rules to avoid externalities and cost shifting, and then
let the free market work.   Operating within this framework, waste disposal
companies, truckers, railroads, municipal officials, recyclers, waste
generators and others could all perform their receptive functions.  The result
would be a complex amalgam of regional landfills, short- and long-haul
transportation by truck and rail, incineration, recycling, and source
reduction.  In a few years people would wonder what all the shouting was about.<p>

<H2>Risk Assessment</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Regulators are supposed to make our lives safer by eliminating or reducing our
exposure to certain risky substances and products, such as toxic chemicals,
dangerous food additives, or cars without airbags.  The problem is that the
current federal regulatory process often focuses on minute risks while ignoring
far greater threats to public health and safety.  This approach not only wastes
public and private resources, it diverts attention away from those things about
which people should be most concerned.<p>
	In the last fifteen years, regulatory policy has too often evolved in reaction
to popular panic over sensational fear stories in the media, not in response to
sound science.  As a result billions of dollars are wasted every year in
battling insignificant problems, leaving no money for others that cause far
more harm.  The government needs to do a better job of quantifying risks and
focusing on those risks that require government action, as opposed to those
that do not.  Even the Environmental Protection Agency&#146;s own scientists
have criticized the federal governments approach to risk.<p>
	Consider the example of a hazardous waste site in New Hampshire that was to be
cleaned up under federal law.  After much expense, the site was clean by any
reasonable standard.  The Environmental Protection Agency, however, was
unsatisfied and demanded that the company spend an additional $9.3 million to
make the soil on the site clean enough for children to eat small amounts of
dirt for 245 days of the year.  This might be justifiable if the site was
destined to become a kindergarten playground.  The site in question, however,
was located in the middle of a swamp.  The dirt-eating children were
nonexistent.  Yet federal regulations required that $9.3 million was to be
spent on clean up, even though it would not reduce any risks to human health
whatsoever.  <p>
	Congress should pass legislation to reform the federal government&#146;s risk
assessment and prioritization.  Those reforms should include:<p>
<UL>
<LI>	An open, transparent process for risk assessments to ensure credibility and
identify critical science issues and uncertainties, the population at risk,
exposure scenarios, and known substitution risks;<p>
<LI>	The requirement of a scientific &#147;best estimate&#148; of risks with which
other estimates, and other risks, can be compared;<p>
<LI>	Required analyses of the potential negative impact of proposed risk
regulations on human health and safety.<p>
</UL>
	<P>There are many risks to human health and safety.  Without more accurate risk
assessment and prioritization, taxpayer dollars will continue to be squandered
on questionable programs that do little, if anything, to promote public health,
safety, and environmental protection.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Do government agencies tend to exaggerate risks?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Yes.  Government agencies often exaggerate the risks they are entrusted to
regulate.  That is because government agencies must demonstrate they are needed
to continue to receive taxpayer funds.  This does not mean agencies always
exaggerate the nature of environmental risks; it does mean, however, that
agencies often have a strong incentive to do just that.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Shouldn&#146;t the government be protecting us from all unreasonable
risks?</i><p>
<p>
A:  In a world of unlimited abundance and perfect information, the government
might be able to do that.  But society and the government have limited
resources and different people have different risk-reduction priorities.  The
best course of action is to identify the worst public risks so that limited
resources are directed toward those.  More effective management of risks is
better served by the promulgation of more accurate information on risks than it
is by the blanketing of society with proscriptive government regulations.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Risk assessment sounds like putting a price on life.  How can you put a
price on life?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Life is priceless.  But when we decide to buy a subcompact instead of a
Volvo, we know that our family will be at somewhat greater risk in a car
accident.  This does not mean we are putting price tags on their heads.  It
simply means that there are better things that we could do with our money.
Forcing bureaucrats to perform risk assessments is not forcing them to put a
price on life.  But it will force them to think more like families, and
recognize the trade-offs that are inherent in everyday life. <p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Are there alternatives to federal risk regulation?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Certainly. Many risks that the federal government focuses on do not require
government attention at all.  This is not because these risks do not exist, but
because different individuals and communities are willing to accept different
trade-offs.  Some people wish to spend more money on reducing environmental
risks; other people prefer to spend their money on family, education or
leisure.  These decisions should be left in the hands of those people who the
decisions will affect. Where government involvement is unavoidable, regulation
should be undertaken based upon the best available information and the
regulated risks should be placed within their proper context.

<H2>The Risks of Government Regulation</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>Much of environmental regulation deals with risk &#151; the risk of
pesticides on food, the risk of groundwater contamination, the risk of
industrial emissions, the risk of technological change, the risk of ecological
disruption.  Were Americans not concerned with these and other similar risks,
much of the environmental regulation that is so hotly contested today would not
exist.<p>
	The debate over environmental risk usually proceeds as follows.  The media or
an environmentalist lobbying group claims to have uncovered a new, insidious
threat to human health and the environment.  Almost immediately there is a call
for the enactment of new regulations proscribing the use of some technology or
process, and possibly even calling for the creation of a new government agency.
A risk has been identified, and it must be eliminated.  Through government
regulation the world must be made a safer place.  Opposing a risk regulation
because the costs may outweigh the benefits is tantamount to placing a price
tag on human life.<p>
	This is a typical story.  It is how much environmental policy is developed.
Yet this story line, however familiar, is deceptive, for it ignores the true
nature of risk.  Addressing risk always involves trade-offs; the resources that
are expended to reduce risk in one area cannot very well be used to reduce risk
somewhere else as well.  When regulations focus on smaller risks, at the
expense of more threatening ones, they can do more harm than good.  Regulations
not only impose economic costs, they can also harm human health and safety.<p>
	There <i>are</i> environmental risks, and many of them deserve to be
addressed.  But it is wrong to think that merely because there are risks
without government regulation that there are not risks created by government
regulation.  Indeed, there are risks on both sides of the regulatory equation
&#151; the risk of too little regulation, but also the risk of too much; the
risk of technological development going to fast, but also the risk of it going
too slow.  When we only pay attention to one side of the trade-off between
competing risks, we shortchange ourselves and encourage the formulation of bad
environmental policy.<p>
	Consider the following example.  The threat from asbestos seemed like a good
reason to temporarily shut down schools in Peru, New York. After all, according
to the media and the federal government, asbestos posed an unacceptable cancer
risk when used for most applications. So the Peru Central School District
closed several school buildings for a month, while junior and senior high
school students went to classes 10 miles away in Plattsburgh, NY &#151; classes
that ended at 8:30 at night.<A HREF="#1"><sup>1 </sup></a> <p>
	By the time the asbestos removal was finished, the district had spent $3.5
million, more than 15 percent of its annual budget, on the removal of asbestos.
Then the Environmental Protection Agency, the same agency that had enacted the
asbestos ban, was forced to acknowledge that the threat of asbestos had been
overestimated, and that the risks of improper removal were often greater than
leaving it in place.  What this means is that, if anything, asbestos
regulations may have had an adverse impact on human health.<p>
	While more may have been spent in Peru than in other school districts, the
story is much the same. Across the country, panicked parents and school
administrators urged drastic action to protect their children from the threat
of asbestos, a threat that had been greatly overstated. Nonetheless, defenders
of the initial EPA policy will insist that such policies are justified as
&#147;insurance&#148; policies. After all, they say, what are several thousand,
several million, or even several billion dollars when you are seeking to
protect human life. When put in terms of dollars versus deaths, there is no
contest. Yet as the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stated in
overturning several of the EPA&#146;s asbestos regulations, these rules can
cost much more than money.<A HREF="#2"><sup>2</sup></A><p>
	According to the EPA&#146;s own estimate, these regulations would have
prevented three premature deaths, over a period of thirteen years, at a cost of
between $43 and $76 million per life saved.  Investing that same amount of
money on highway safety, early detection of breast cancer, or infant nutrition
&#151; or simply leaving that money in private hands for the purchase of
life-enhancing goods and services &#151; would have saved more lives.  What is
more, the EPA had even commissioned a study that indicated that asbestos
substitutes might actually increase the number of fatalities.  Yet despite this
evidence, the agency enacted the bans.<p>
	Fortunately, the Fifth Circuit recognized a pernicious regulation when it saw
one, and ruled against the EPA.  &#147;The EPA, in its zeal to ban asbestos,
cannot overlook, with only cursory study, credible contentions that substitute
products actually might increase fatalities,&#148; noted Judge Jerry Smith in
his opinion for the court. &#147;This failure to examine the likely consequence
of the EPA&#146;s regulation renders the ban of asbestos friction products
unreasonable.&#148;<A HREF="#3"><sup>3</sup></A><p>
	This asbestos regulation is not an aberration.   It was overturned, and yet
there remain a host of regulations that are responsible for increasing
mortality. Compelling automakers to make more fuel efficient vehicles forces
individuals into lighter, less-safe cars;<A HREF="#4"><sup>4</sup></A> withholding potentially
life-saving drugs and treatments pending FDA approval risks unnecessary
deaths;<A HREF="#5"><sup>5</sup></A> failure to chlorinate water for fear of minuscule cancer
risks from chlorination can cause thousands more deaths from outbreaks of
cholera and other diseases.<A HREF="#6"><sup>6</sup></A> There certainly may be small risks
created by chlorinating our water.  But these risks are nothing when compared
to the risks posed by bacteria and waterborne disease should water supplies
remain untreated.<p>
 	Similarly, the government may be concerned with the risks posed by minute
traces of pesticides that remain on foods.  But insofar as pesticides increase
food yields and enable more Americans to have balanced, healthy diets, the
risks of fewer fruits and vegetables on  America&#146;s dining room tables
needs to be kept in mind, too.  In 1996, the prestigious National Academy of
Sciences confirmed that the risks of malnutrition are far greater than the risk
of cancer from chemicals in the human diet.<A HREF="#7"><sup>7</sup></A><p>
	State and local governments face the trade-offs between risks in another way.
Local health officials are entrusted to reduce the health threats to their
communities.  When resources are expended in one area, they are not available
to be expended in another.  Thus when federal policy forces a community to
spend thousands of dollars to reduce one risk, other risks remain unaddressed.
In this manner some federal policies actually frustrate efforts to reduce risk.
In some communities significant risks, such as crime, cannot be adequately
dealt with because thousands of dollars are required to be spent addressing
hypothetical cancer risks instead.  For example, for the cost of averting one
premature death from the EPA&#146;s standard for benzene emissions, over three
thousand police officers could be hired in a major city.<A HREF="#8"><sup>8</sup></A>  For the
amount of money spent to avert one premature death under regulati! ons
governing coke ovens, over 470 lives could be saved through the purchase of
lung cancer screenings.  In economics this is known as an opportunity cost, and
it is a real cost of environmental regulation.<p>
	A death is a death, whether caused by workplace exposure to airborne toxics or
by less-effective, asbestos-free brake pads.  When the policies of the federal
government are directly responsible for the additional loss of life, those
policies should be repealed.<p>
	While federal fuel economy standards and FDA drug lag are examples of
&#147;death by regulation,&#148; the federal government is increasingly causing
death by regulation in an indirect manner as well.  While advocates for
increased regulation insist that the burdens of federal rules are more than
compensated for by the benefits they provide, there is one item that they
conveniently leave out of the equation: Burdensome regulations, in and of
themselves, can increase mortality.<p>
	It is an indisputable fact that wealthier societies are healthier societies.
Wealthier societies simply have more wealth to spend on things which improve
the quality of life, from nutrition and health care to bicycle helmets and
automobile child-safety seats. By the same token, societies and communities
with less resources are less safe than they could otherwise be.<A HREF="#9"><sup>9</sup></A><p>
	According to James MacCrae, former acting-administrator of the Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs, &#147;when national income falls, there is
often a significant increase in mortality and a decline in health
status.&#148;<A HREF="#10"><sup>10</sup></A>  For example, a 1984 study by Congress&#146; Joint
Economic Committee found that declines in real per capita income in the early
1970s led to a corresponding increase in total mortality, amounting to as many
as 60,000 additional deaths.<A HREF="#11"><sup>11</sup></A> Other studies estimate that every
loss of between $3 million to $8 million to the economy will result in a
premature death.<A HREF="#12"><sup>12</sup></A>  From a personal standpoint, losing one&#146;s
job is one of the unhealthiest things that can happen to a person due to the
loss of a steady income.  This means that when the economy sours, people die.
The point is that regulations that depress national income &#151; for
whatever reason &#151; create new risks from other less apparent sources.  <p>
	The current economic burden of federal regulations is approximately $670
billion per year, according to the General Accounting Office &#151; nearly
$7,000 per household.<A HREF="#13"><sup>13</sup></A>  Making the conservative assumption that
there is a premature death for every $10 million lost to the economy, this
would mean that federal regulations are responsible for as many as 64,700
premature deaths each year. It should also be no surprise that the vast
majority of these deaths would occur in financially strapped communities, such
as South-Central Los Angeles, where there is less institutional ability to
compensate for economic losses. In a similar fashion, poorer countries are less
able to mitigate the impact of economic declines than wealthier ones.	<p>
	There certainly may be environmental risks which call for increased government
regulation.  But it is always important to remember that just as government
regulation can alleviate risks, it can create them as well.  Just because
environmental risks exist, does not mean that eliminating those risks will
always produce a less risky world.  Risks weigh against other risks, in
everything we do. In this the environment is no different than anything else.<p>

<H2>Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>America&#146;s drinking water systems are capable of efficiently delivering 41
billion gallons of safe water to American homes everyday.  Despite this fact,
the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is in need of reform.  The current law is
too rigid, allows the federal government to impose unneeded and expensive
mandates on local governments, and fails to prioritize risks.<p>
	The SDWA currently requires the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
to establish drinking water standards for 83 specific contaminants.
Additionally, the SDWA requires the EPA to pick an additional 25 contaminants
every three years to regulate.  This mandate applies irrespective of whether
there are additional, identifiable contaminants that pose a human health risk
in America&#146;s water supply.  According to the EPA, the total cost for
implementing the new standards is $1.4 billion a year, nearly all of which is
paid for by local governments.<p>
	Future regulations are expected to cost even more.  For example, the EPA has
proposed to regulate disinfection by-products.  These are the trace amounts of
chlorinated organic chemicals which are formed when the water is disinfected
with chlorine, the most widely used disinfectant.  Under the disinfection
by-products rule the EPA has estimated the cost of compliance at $2.8 billion a
year.  This single rule would triple the compliance cost of the Safe Drinking
Water Act.  Yet the EPA&#146;s own analysis of the disinfection by-products
rule would increase the risk of microbial contamination.  In other words, the
EPA has proposed a $2.8 billion dollar a year regulation on municipalities
which they estimate would increase the microbial contamination of the
nation&#146;s drinking water.<p>
	This combination of extreme rigidity and high cost results in wasteful
regulation.  For example, the city of Columbus, Ohio, spends thousands of
dollars a year to test its drinking water for 43 pesticides it knows it
won&#146;t find.  Indeed, most of the pesticides for which the state of Ohio
must test have never been found in the waters of Ohio.<p>
	The SDWA is premised on the idea that EPA bureaucrats, from thousands of miles
away, are better able than local public health officials to determine the
public health needs of a local community.  This assumption is questionable, at
best.<p>
	To improve the SDWA, a reform package should include the following:<p>
<UL>
<LI>	Scientifically accurate assessments of the risks posed by drinking water
contaminants, independently and in relation to other health risks;<p>
<LI>	Cost-benefit analyses for <i>all</i> regulatory standards and contaminant
levels;<p>
<LI>	Funding for the compliance of mandatory regulatory standards.  If the federal
government sets stringent new standards which will be expensive to implement,
it should either supply funds for compliance with the standard or make it
voluntary;<p>
<LI>	Sufficient flexibility for local water agencies to set standards based on
local needs.<p>
</UL>
	<P>The SDWA is an embodiment of the federal command-and-control, one-size
fits-nobody approach to environmental protection.  As such, it is in need of
reform.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  In Milwaukee in 1993, more than one hundred thousand people became sick
after a parasite infected the water supply.  Shouldn&#146;t the Safe Drinking
Water Act be strengthened to keep what happened in Milwaukee from happening
elsewhere?</i><p>
<p>
A:  No, the Safe Drinking Water Act is part of the problem.  By requiring
municipalities to test and monitor for so many chemicals, (most of which do not
even occur in their local water supplies), the Safe Drinking Water Act diverts
attention and resources away from the most important public health problems in
many communities.  Local water agencies have limited budgets.  When the EPA
forces them to test monitor for obscure contaminants it spreads local
agencies&#146; resources even thinner, increasing the likelihood that a mistake
will occur.  The parasite that infected Milwaukee was called Cryptosporidium.
The EPA had been so busy writing regulations for obscure contaminants that it
had not even developed an approved method to even test for the parasite until
hundreds of thousands became ill in Milwaukee.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  An environmental group recently reported that one out of five Americans
drank water that was inadequately treated for pollutants.  Shouldn&#146;t the
Safe Drinking Water Act be strengthened to ensure that everyone&#146;s water is
adequately treated?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  The current Safe Drinking Water Act is part of the problem.  Regulating
more stringently or writing more regulations will only exacerbate the problem.
Inadequate treatment occurs most frequently when a water agency&#146;s budget
is stretched to the limit.  By forcing municipalities, especially small
municipalities, to test, monitor and treat so many different substances without
providing additional funds creates more problems than it solves.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Will the current proposed legislation in the House and Senate make our
nation&#146;s water safer?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  Yes.  The current legislation will enable local and state governments to
more effectively deal with real water quality issues they face rather than
imaginary risks imposed by the EPA.  In addition the legislation would provide
for a state revolving loan fund to provide communities with the financial
support to upgrade their water systems.  This bill is not perfect, however.
Ideally, Congress would return primary standard setting responsibility to local
communities.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Should the pending legislation exempt the disinfection by-products (DBP)
rule from the new risk  and cost-benefit requirements?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  No.  It is even more important that the DBP rule be required to comply with
the new risk and cost benefit procedures as it is the most costly regulation
that the EPA has ever contemplated, in addition to the fact that the EPA&#146;s
own studies suggest it would increase the risk of microbial contamination.
