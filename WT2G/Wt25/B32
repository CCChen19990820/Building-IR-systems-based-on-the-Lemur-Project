        <p>Knoxville has at least three
        educational software companies in residence -- Campus
        America Inc., Discovery Systems International Inc. and
        The Learning Company Inc., formerly SoftKey and
        HyperGlot. </p>
        <p>Campus America and Discovery Systems make the software
        -- programming that tells computers what to do -- that
        allows schools and corporations to create their own
        curriculum and training materials. </p>
        <p>The Learning Company features foreign language
        software but delves into other categories as well. </p>
        <p>These Knoxville firms believe they are positioned to
        take advantage of the growing trend toward using
        technology, including educational software, for education
        and training. </p>
        <p>Higher education officials surveyed by the Software
        Publishers Association said ''integrating technology into
        instruction'' and ''user support'' are the top technology
        challenges confronting colleges and universities in the
        next two to three years. </p>
        <p>The SPA estimates from $494 million to $565 million
        will be spent on instructional software in the 1996-1997
        school year. </p>
        <p>The total computer and related product expenditures
        for K-12, higher education, industry and government
        training centers in 1996 is estimated at almost $11
        billion. </p>
        <p>Technology is increasingly employed in worker training
        and retraining. </p>
        <p>The American Society for Training and Development says
        employers spent $55.3 billion on employee training in
        1995. </p>
        <p>More employers are using computers to offer their
        employees training for increased proficiency and
        opportunity for advancement. </p>

        <p>Distance learning -- education that takes the
        classroom to the student, increasingly through technology
        -- has been around a long time, but now it is on a ''jet
        take-off ramp,'' said Dennis Miller, a Campus America
        executive. </p>
        <p>Miller, business development executive for The
        Learning Manager, a major Campus America product, is a
        lifelong teacher and training developer. </p>
        <p>Miller looks at instructional technology as an
        alternative delivery system for education. </p>
        <p>Campus America products are especially useful to
        colleges and universities that are trying to respond to
        the needs of far-flung populations and an insurgence of
        non-traditional students, he said. </p>
        <p>Notable increases in higher education enrollment have
        been occurring among people from 24 to 33 years of age.
        That age group is likely to have commitments to jobs and
        family. </p>
        <p>Computer learning can provide them access to education
        within their time constraints. </p>
        <p>Larry Howell, a company founder along with his wife
        Susan, will celebrate the company's 20th anniversary and
        its pioneering spirit on Jan. 1. </p>
        <p>''I believed technology would be pervasive in
        supporting the needs of the learner, both from a records
        management and an instruction management perspective,''
        Howell said. ''That's the vision, and it's all
        happening.'' </p>
        <p>The Learning Manager is a general management system
        that allows instructors to design objectives, link
        learning resources, set up a general course sequence and
        put it all online complete with audio and video. It also
        tracks the students' progress. </p>
        <p>The students can access the courses any time, any
        place and complete the lessons at their own pace. </p>
        <p>For example Pellissippi State Technical Community
        College used Learning Manager to develop a computer
        managed system that begins with diagnostic tests in math
        and chemistry. </p>
        <p>Berta Ward, director of curriculum and instruction,
        said the system identifies weaknesses at the beginning of
        the term, and test results direct them to tutorials to
        build up their skills in areas where they're weak. </p>
        <p>A chemistry pre-test being fully implemented this
        spring can help them decide which course to take,
        including the math skills they need to be successful,
        Ward said. </p>
        <p>Tutorials also support classroom work. </p>
        <p>Instructors can use the system to see how the students
        performed and adapt their lessons to suit students'
        needs. </p>
        <p>''You get targeted instruction based on what students
        don't know,'' Ward said. </p>
        <p>Students with a home Internet connection will be able
        to do the tutorials from home. </p>

        <p>Discovery Systems International Inc. on Gay Street in
        downtown Knoxville makes software that allows teachers to
        create their own coursework and corporations to create
        their own training programs. </p>
        <p>''We're looking at the niche market of people who want
        to create their own courses, but don't want to spend a
        lot of time doing the programming,'' company president
        Janice Tocher said. </p>
        <p>Its main product, Course Builder, was released in May
        1987 by Telerobotics International. </p>
        <p>Course Builder was created by Bill Appleton, founder
        of CyberFlix, the Knoxville interactive movie/game
        company. </p>
        <p>Tocher and Richard Spille, now vice president of
        Discovery Systems, broke off from Telerobotics in Oct.
        1993, taking the Course Builder software with them. </p>
        <p>Their first office was on Oak Ridge Highway, but they
        recently moved downtown because they felt it was more
        central to the business community and it better reflected
        the company's personality. </p>
        <p>Discovery Systems employs five people. </p>
        <p>It sells programs, site licenses and does consulting
        for other companies. </p>
        <p>The company is working with corporate client Glaxo
        Wellcome, a large pharmaceutical company, on a game-style
        training course for 1,000 employees. </p>
        <p>Course Builder, touted as being very easy to use, is
        now installed in classrooms around the country. </p>
        <p>Locally, it is used in about a dozen middle and high
        schools, plus the University of Tennessee and Pellissippi
        State Technical Community College, Tocher said. </p>
        <p>Linda Hemby at Austin-East High School uses it for
        ninth grade English classes. She has developed 500-600
        English instructional programs for students to use on
        computers the school bought with grant money about eight
        years ago. </p>
        <p>Although Austin-East's computers aren't equipped to
        use the sound and video effects the Course Builder and
        other brands of educational software might offer, Hemby
        is excited about what she can do with it. </p>
        <p>''It's the key to the success of our lab,'' Hemby
        said. </p>
        <p>Hemby can tailor the programs to different learning
        levels, and customize instruction still further for
        students that are having trouble with a certain aspect of
        the class -- the use of compound sentences, for example.
        For that student she can provide more individualized
        instruction. </p>
        <p>On a recent visit to her class, the students were
        reading ''Gift of the Magi'' by O. Henry and answering
        questions about the story. </p>
        <p>Hemby added an entertaining maze at the end of the
        program as an incentive to finish with an acceptable
        score. </p>
        <p>Endia Garner got 16 of 17 correct and was delighted to
        get a chance at the maze. </p>
        <p>He got it right. </p>
        <p>A picture of a decorated Christmas tree came up on the
        screen, and a computer Christmas song announced his
        victory. </p>
        <p>Course Builder also allows built-in testing and
        scoring capabilities and recordkeeping. </p>

        <p>HyperGlot, the forerunner of The Learning Company, was
        founded in 1988 by Phil Baggett, a Clarksville native,
        and Martin Rice, a University of Tennessee professor of
        Russian. </p>
        <p>HyperGlot was purchased by The Learning Company in
        1993. In 1995, SoftKey International bought The Learning
        Co. and HyperGlot. </p>
        <p>SoftKey recently changed its name to The Learning
        Company to reflect its leadership in educational
        software. </p>
        <p>Baggett and Rice's first title, ''Learn to Speak
        Spanish,'' is the best-selling foreign language software
        product in the United States, according to PC Data, an
        industry rating service. </p>
        <p>''Learn to Speak Spanish'' offers two interactive
        CD-ROMs and a workbook for about $119. </p>
        <p>The company has about 20 foreign language titles,
        including software for foreign nationals who want to
        learn English. </p>
        <p>Hundreds of schools use Learning Company programs as
        teaching supplements, but its primary target is home
        users, said Natasha Efremenko, vice president for foreign
        languages and productivity for Knoxville. </p>
        <p>All the language titles have a special speech
        recognition feature that allows students to imitate the
        sound of foreign words and get immediate feedback on
        pronunciation. </p>
        <p>The student speaks the word or phrase into a
        microphone, and the program rates the pronunciation on a
        gauge that goes from tourist to native. </p>
        <p>The programs also have dictionaries to look up
        unfamiliar words, the ability to click on the words and
        hear them repeated, games in the foreign language,
        crossword puzzles, a jukebox to listen to native songs
        and other features. </p>
        <p>The foreign language products include ''Travel Talk''
        for tourists and ''Practice Makes Perfect'' for grammar
        and punctuation. </p>
        <p>Knoxville has been the beneficiary of The Learning
        Company's growth and restructuring. Many of the company's
        operations are being consolidated in Knoxville, Efremenko
        said. </p>
        <p>In May, the company announced it was closing support
        offices in Fremont and Atlanta and consolidating them in
        Knoxville. The new technical support center on Parkside
        Drive now employs 116 full-time employees and 40 seasonal
        employees. </p>
        <p>The company has closed development sites in Israel and
        Cambridge, Mass., leaving Knoxville, Fremont, Calif., and
        Minneapolis as its development centers. </p>
        <p>Efremenko said The Learning Company employs about 160
        people in Knoxville and foresees hiring roughly 45
        engineers and artists and 40 quality assurance people in
        the next year. </p>
        <p>She expects total employment here to rise to 260-300
        people in that period. </p>
        <p>Nationwide, the company employs about 800. </p>
        <p>In addition to foreign language software, Knoxville
        will take over research and development of titles such as
        ''Battles of the World'' interactive history of war;
        ''Leonardo,'' the story of Leonardo da Vinci; ''Edison''
        the story of Thomas Edison; and ''Artrageous,'' a
        children's program on art history, artists and art
        how-tos. </p>
        <p>Knoxville is also providing support for ''Landscape
        Architect'' and ''KeyCad Pro,'' which allows users to
        design a house inside and out and do a three-dimensional
        model. </p>
        <p>During its early years, HyperGlot also a lasting
        relationship with Berlitz, a company known for foreign
        language audio tapes. This year the company redeveloped
        the Berlitz Think and Talk software. </p>

        <font size="5">F</font>or just a split second, you could
        almost see Santa Claus, peering around a corner and
        smiling silently to himself. </p>
        <p>About 150 volunteers came to the Jacob Building in
        Chilhowee Park on Friday to begin filling the 3,500 Empty
        Stocking Fund Christmas baskets for the area's needy and
        destitute families. </p>
        <p><img src="../../images/logos/esf.jpg" align="left"
        hspace="6" vspace="6" width="108" height="108">It was an
        occasion of hard work, mixed with seasonal festivity.
        Some of the volunteers wore red stocking caps or brown
        velvet headgear in the shape of reindeer antlers. </p>
        <p>The volunteers included a contingent of about 42
        employees from Union Planters Bank, which annually
        participates in the basket filling. </p>
        <p>Many other volunteers came from Karns, Farragut,
        Fulton and West high schools. </p>
        <p>Union Planters President Chuck Bryant said most of the
        bank's major offices were participating. Many employees
        from branches outside Knox County traveled to Knoxville
        to take part. </p>
        <p>Bank employees are involved in a number of worthy
        causes throughout the year, Smith said, ''and we think it
        is a very fitting way to end the year by assisting the
        Empty Stocking Fund. It is a very worthy cause, and we
        all have a lot of fun doing it.'' </p>
        <p>Steve Hodson, manager of the Greenback branch, said he
        came prepared ''to do anything that needs to be done.'' </p>
        <p>Hodson said he has been involved in similar charities
        in his own area. </p>
        <p>He said he became enthusiastic about helping out in
        such efforts by living in a rural area. </p>
        <p>''On a daily basis, I personally see the type of
        person who needs this type of assistance,'' he said.
        ''That always makes you aware of the needs of others.'' </p>
        <p>The operation continues today, with more volunteers,
        including about 70 to 80 News-Sentinel employees, and
        contingents from Home Federal Bank, Powell and Bearden
        high schools and the Teen Board. </p>
        <p>Home Federal folks were so eager to volunteer, many
        had to be turned away, said Marketing Director Lynn
        Sheeley. </p>
        <p>''We offered 12 to volunteer, and we had two or three
        times that many, so it had to be first-come,
        first-served,'' Sheeley said. </p>
        <p>Food items were hauled to the Jacob Building on trucks
        from Cox and Wright Grocers, K-Va-T Food Stores Inc. and
        I.J. Co. The toys for children came from Star Sales. Most
        of the baskets will be distributed Christmas Eve. Baskets
        to homebound people and other special situations will be
        distributed Monday. </p>

<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>ennessee&#39;s congressional races cost more than $12.5 million this year, with U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson spending the most at about $3.4 million, according to the latest campaign expenditure filings with the Federal Election Commission.
<P>   With Thompson garnering 1,090,045 votes, he spent $3.15 per vote. His race was the only statewide congressional race this year.
<P>   The least expensive seat to retain in Tennessee was Knoxville&#39;s 2nd District, with Republican U.S. Rep. John J. Duncan Jr. spending about $241,000.
<P>   Receiving almost 150,000 votes, Duncan spent about $1.61 per vote.
<P>   By contrast, in 1994, the state&#39;s most expensive campaign year, Gov. Don Sundquist&#39;s campaign spent $8.67 per vote, and his challenger, Nashville Mayor Phil Bredesen, spent $14.30 per vote.
<P>   The 1996 filings this month cover all fund-raising and expenditures through Nov. 25, 20 days after this year&#39;s general election on Nov. 5. 
<P>   The final report covering financial activity through Dec. 31, 1996, which is usually minimal, is due Jan. 31, 1997.
<P>   In 1994, the nine U.S. House races and Thompson&#39;s race against former U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Shelbyville, cost about $16 million. About $7.7 million of that was spent in the Thompson-Cooper race. That worked out to about $4.28 per vote for Thompson and $7.03 per vote for Cooper, who lost 885,998 votes to 565,930 votes.
<P>   And the race for governor in 1994 had Bredesen and Sundquist spending about $16.5 million. Sundquist, having spent about $7 million, got 807,104 votes, and Bredesen, who spent about $9.5 million, got 664,252 votes.
<P>   In other races this year, U.S. Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Chattanooga, spent about $922,000 in defeating Democrat Chuck Jolly, who spent about $420,000 in that 3rd District race that saw Wamp win a second term by getting about 56 percent of the vote.
<P>   In the 4th District, U.S. Rep. Van Hilleary, R-Spring City, spent about $1.1 million in defeating Democrat Mark Stewart, who spent about $584,000. Hilleary won a second term, getting about 58 percent of the vote.
<P>   In the 1st District, Republican Bill Jenkins of Rogersville spent about $450,000 in his successful bid to replace the retiring U.S. Rep. Jimmy Quillen, R-Kingsport.
<P>   The most expensive U.S. House race in the state was in the 6th District in Middle Tennessee. U.S. Rep. Bob Clement, D-Murfreesboro, spent about $1.6 million in defeating Republican Steve Gill, who spent about $1 million.
<P>   In the 2nd District, Duncan spent $241,000 to Democratic challenger Stephen Smith&#39;s $53,000.
<P>   Thompson defeated Democratic lawyer Houston Gordon and garnered the most votes in history. He outpolled former U.S. Sen. Jim Sasser&#39;s 1.02 million votes in 1988 and former President Ronald Reagan&#39;s 990,212 votes in 1984.
<P>   Thompson also outpolled President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in Gore&#39;s home state. They received 909,146 votes.

        To keep 800 jobs feels like a very good Christmas

        <p align="right"><em>-- Executive Director Melissa
        Ziegler Development Corporation of Knox County</em></p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Pam Park, News-Sentinel business
        writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">M</font>ost of the employees of
        Knoxville-based Philips Consumer Electronics Co. will
        stay in Knoxville, but the executive, sales and marketing
        and some administrative functions will move to Atlanta,
        the company president said Friday. </p>
        <p>Robert Minkhorst said about 150 key executives and
        staff from the current corporate headquarters at the
        Strawberry Plains Pike exit off Interstate 40 will be
        going to Atlanta, where Philips is establishing a joint
        sales and service organization for consumer electronics,
        business electronics, consumer communications and key
        modules, which sells products such as modems and CD-ROMs.
        </p>
        <p>Some 700 to 800 mainstream and digital engineers,
        logistics personnel and support staff will stay in
        Knoxville, and the 300-person customer service operation
        will stay in Jefferson City, Minkhorst said. </p>
        <p>Atlanta was chosen for a corporate center because
        electronics companies now have to think internationally
        as well as nationally, and Atlanta is very accessible. It
        is also just a phone call or half a day's drive away from
        the functions remaining in Knoxville, Jefferson City and
        Greeneville, he said. </p>
        <p>Minkhorst said initiative from state and local
        authorities was a big factor in his decision, which was
        finalized at 10 p.m. Thursday. The future of the
        Knoxville headquarters had been uncertain since May when
        news surfaced that Philips was looking for another
        location. </p>
        <p>Minkhorst said Philips began arranging to keep some
        functions in Tennessee after a visit this fall from Gov.
        Don Sundquist and a small local contingent. He called the
        incentive package that was offered ''very interesting,''
        and he also cited Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe's role as a
        coordinator. </p>
        <p>Melissa Ziegler, executive director of the Development
        Corporation of Knox County, said her group is providing
        $200,000 that will likely be used for a fiber-optic
        upgrade for communciations at the Strawberry Plains Pike
        building. </p>
        <p>''In addition,'' said Ziegler, ''we're working to put
        together a package with Philips and the University (of
        Tennessee) and some other folks to try to facilitate a
        digital engineering research center that could be used by
        Philips and the university and other folks to really make
        some state-of-the-art alliances between what UT has and
        what Philips has.'' </p>
        <p>The county's contribution is tied to Philips meeting
        certain standards related to retaining payroll and jobs
        in Knox County, she said. County Executive Tommy
        Schumpert was very involved in the process, Ziegler said.
        </p>
        <p>Regarding the prestige factor involved in the loss of
        a national headquarters, Ziegler said: ''We keep the
        bragging rights to the technology and engineering end of
        the business. My view is that to keep 800 jobs feels like
        a very good Christmas present.'' </p>
        <p>The state is providing about $500,000 worth of
        incentives, but they are not authorized until July 1998.
        That money may be used for training and retraining,
        onsite infrastructure improvements or to support a chair
        of excellence in digital engineering at UT, said Bill
        Dunavant, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of
        Economic and Community Development. </p>
        <p>''This project is very important to the state, and we
        need to do everything we can for existing companies. The
        state and city and county recognize the value of our
        long-term partners, and we want to provide every
        opportunity to ensure their success in Tennessee,''
        Dunavant said. </p>
        <p>Ashe said: ''It was an example of what three levels of
        government pulling together can accomplish, along with
        assistance from the chamber (of commerce).'' </p>
        <p>Knoxville cannot spend money to help Philips directly
        because although much of the Strawberry Plains Pike exit
        area is in the city, the Philips building is not. Pending
        formal City Council approval, the city is prepared to
        spend up to $750,000 improving traffic flow at the
        I-40/Strawberry Plains Pike interchange, however. </p>
        <p>''We will do what we need to do to make the Strawberry
        Plains Pike area transportation easy, which frankly has
        always been part of our plan. We feel this is the new
        Cedar Bluff east,'' said Ashe. </p>
        <p>Georgia reportedly offered tax credits for job
        creation and investment to attract the corporate
        headquarters. Minkhorst would not identify the exact
        location of the Atlanta facility until Philips finalizes
        the lease, but the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said it
        will be located on the north side of Atlanta in a
        technology-oriented suburb called Dunwoody. </p>
        <p>Philips owns the 200,000 square-foot building on
        Strawberry Plains Pike. Other company operations now
        located on Deane Hill Drive, Papermill Drive and the
        Forks of the River Industrial Park may eventually be
        consolidated on the former headquarters property,
        Minkhorst said. </p>
        <p>Minkhorst said he was very anxious to get the
        corporate headquarters location settled by Christmas so
        the employees would not have to deal with uncertainty any
        longer. </p>
        <p>''We just made it,'' he said. </p>

<!--FIRST STORY TEMPLATE-->        <font size="6"><b>Davis gets a kick out of his third
        All-KFL selection . . . Halls lands six</b></font><br>
<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Mark Burgess, News-Sentinel
        sportswriter</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>here's a confidence in Billy Davis
        not seen in your average high school punter. </p>
        <p>While most prep punters live with the ever-present
        fear of a ''shank,'' Davis doesn't fear much of anything.
        </p>
        <p>A two-time All-State selection, Davis is making his
        third consecutive appearance on The News-Sentinel's
        All-Knoxville Football League team. </p>
        <p>For Karns High School's first-year head coach David
        Bankston, Davis' booming, hanging punts were things of
        beauty. He looked on as Davis averaged 45.1 yards a kick,
        including a long of 70. </p>
        <p>''In this one game we were on our own 40-yard line and
        Billy walked over to the coaches,'' Bankston said. ''He
        wanted to know if we were going to take a penalty to give
        him more room to kick or if we wanted him to pooch punt
        it. Can you believe that? Sixty yards away. </p>
        <p>''It's great to know when you're on your own 35- or
        40-yard line you can push the other guys back inside
        their 10.'' </p>
        <p>Davis did exactly that 12 times in the 38 times he
        punted. Six of those went inside the 5. </p>
        <p>''I just worked on my technique and found out I didn't
        have to kill it to get it to go 60 yards,'' Davis said.
        ''Then I worked on accuracy. </p>
        <p>''I went to the Phil Fulmer football camp over the
        summer and coach (Jeff) Leiker (UT graduate assistant
        special-teams coach) helped me out a lot on my drop and
        technique.'' </p>
        <p>With a little more guidance, there's no telling how
        far Davis could take his kicking skills. </p>
        <p>How's this for pressure? </p>
        <p>''I think he could play on Sundays,'' Bankston said,
        hinting that Davis has the potential to one day punt in
        the National Football League. ''He's legitimate. He's
        definitely a Division I punter and he's good enough that
        he could step in as a backup at the kicking position if
        he needed to.'' </p>
        <p>Davis said he has been offered a scholarship to
        Liberty University, but is holding out in hopes that
        North Carolina State or Tennessee may show more interest.
        </p>
        <p>He's joined on the All-KFL team -- for obvious reasons
        -- by a top-heavy collection of Halls Red Devils and Webb
        Spartans. </p>
        <p>Halls and Webb advanced to the state championship game
        in their respective classifications, Webb winning the
        Class 2A title. </p>
        <p>Halls placed six players on the team, including:
        Dustin Johnson (Most Valuable Defensive Player), Justin
        Satterfield, Adam Weaver, John Shephard, Scott Carter and
        Stacy Rutherford. </p>
        <p>Satterfield had 109 tackles as a defensive and 22
        tackles for losses totalling 114 yards. Weaver broke a
        Halls school record with nine interceptions and also had
        18 catches for 416 yards, five TDs and a 23.1 average. </p>
        <p>Shephard did a little bit of everything, intercepting
        six passes, throwing 14 touchdown passes without an
        interception and punting for a 33-yard average. Carter,
        the only junior in the bunch, had 224 carries for 1,728
        yards and 19 touchdowns. Stacy Rutherford is a 6-foot-3,
        300-pound left tackle -- enough said. </p>
        <p>The Webb contingent is led by Offensive Player of the
        Year Matt Huskey. Guard Brendon Wright, tight
        end/defensive end/punter Lloyd Russell, defensive end
        Graham Hunter and defensive back Jared Corby are the
        other Spartans. </p>
        <p>Corby had seven interceptions and returned two of
        those for interceptions. He also was a big-play return
        man and rushed for nearly 1,000 yards. </p>
        <p>Russell had 29 minus-yardage hits and 25 catches for
        619 yards and eight touchdowns. </p>
        <p>Hunter, 6-3, 245, is garnering college attention after
        making 110 tackles. Wright, in addition to being Webb's
        best offensive lineman, had 130 tackles. </p>
        <p>Other offensive linemen are Central's Brandon Lewellyn
        (6-2, 230), Bearden's Stephen Manning (6-1, 235) and
        Karns' Eric Turner (6-3, 230). </p>
        <p>TSD's Gerald Chubb is a repeat KFL performer after
        rushing for a league-high 1,502 yards, 7.5 average per
        carry and 18 touchdowns. </p>
        <p>The Catholic 1A All-State combination of quarterback
        J.R. Sipos and receiver David Fillauer repeated as well.
        Sipos threw for 2,750 yards and 21 TDs. Fillauer caught a
        national-record 122 passes for 1,244 yards. </p>
        <p>Other receivers were Fulton's Jykine Bradley (55
        catches, 943 yards, 17.2 average, 7 TDs, six
        interceptions) and Powell tight end Matt Mercer (29
        catches, 708 yards, 24.4 average, eight TDs, 73 tackles).
        </p>
        <p>Powell's Jordan Bounds is the kicker after nailing
        10-of-15 field goals (a long of 45), 23 extra points and
        hitting 90 percent of his kickoffs into the end zone. </p>
        <p>Austin-East quarterback Chris Lowery and West's
        Dewayne Nelson selected as ''athletes'' on the offensive
        unit. </p>
        <p>The defensive ''athlete'' designation went to Powell's
        Seth Estep. His teammate, Joey Sharpe, made the team as a
        defensive end. </p>
        <p>The rest of the defense was dominated by Bearden, a
        team that allowed an average of only 78 yards rushing and
        55 yards passing a game. </p>
        <p>Desmond Scantling and Chris Morrison were both
        included as linebackers, but Morrison was also a
        1,000-yard rusher. Sam Odum made it as a defensive back
        after making eight interceptions. </p>
        <p>Austin-East junior Ashaundae Fair and Karns junior
        Dustin York were the other linebackers. Fair had 142
        tackles and rushed for more than 800 yards. York had 148
        hits, 33 for negative yardage. </p>
        <p>Selections were made by The News-Sentinel sports staff
        based on nominations and overall performance by players. </p>

<p>REVIEW </p>
<p>FIND A SPOT AT HAVANA CAFE, ENJOY </p>
<p>We have eaten almost everything on the menu at Alex's Havana Cafe and we 
like everything. </p>
<p>My problem is this place has 16 seats inside and about 20 outside. 
It(approaches tiny. And if great crowds of you decide to go all at once, who 
knows what could happen. </p>
<p>I considered the Havana Cafe something of a find when I first happened to 
notice it while heading up Homberg one day near lunchtime. I stopped. I ate. 
I+liked. I took my wife, Anne, back to eat. She liked. Then folks started 
to.call me and let me know they had made the same find. Word does get out. </p>
<p>These good folks have decided to take this small space and fill it with the 
flavors of Cuba. They have kept the menu short and simple. </p>
<p>They have a selection of sandwiches on Cuban bread. This includes the ever 
&amp;famous Cuban sandwich ($4.50), a combination of meats which is then 
grilled.+It is every sandwich junkie's dream. They also have ham and roast 
pork and turkey, but I suggest you go whole hog. </p>
<p>Or perhaps you would prefer to go half hog. The first of five arranged meals 
is half a Cuban sandwich served with black beans and rice. For $5.25 it is a 
treat and makes a great lunch. </p>
<p>Now let me say a word about the role of black beans and yellow rice in 
Cuban food. It is the heart, the center, the mainstay of that cuisine. One of!my 
favorite Cuban restaurants anywhere is a lovely dump called Ces Sibon in 
Key West. It is a rambling collection of rooms where anything you order 
comes with a bowl of black beans and yellow rice.It is good solid food which 
satisfies the body and the soul. </p>
<p>At Havana Cafe, you can go vegetarian and have black beans with rice and a 
salad for $4.95. This is not a bad choice. </p>
<p>If, however, you want something a little more, there are three 
excellent+choices. The first of these is roast pork a la Havana ($6.95). Here, 
roast pork is prepared differently from any which I have had before in Cuban 
restaurants and I like it. The roast pork I know best is cooked enough to pull 
off the bone like pulled barbecue. It has a strong pepper and vinegar 
flavor.Here the pork is roasted with a good herb coating and then sliced. It 
is(covered with a light, sweet, sour, tangy sauce which produces a dish that 
seems significantly lighter than other Cuban pork I have had. </p>
<p>Arroz con pollo ($6.95) is yellow rice and roast chicken and is delightful. It is 
served with fried plantains. This banana like fruit is another staple in Cuban, 
and most Spanish, dishes and is a nice addition. You may want to have a.side 
order of plantains ($2) to go with almost any of the other dishes. </p>
<p>The final dish is roast turkey a la Havana and I would tell you about it except 
that we haven't tried it yet. It gives me something to look forward to. </p>
<p>Now a word about dessert. Coco flan ($2.75) is a fine example of the 
bakedcream custard so associated with Spanish food. It is a very good 
choice. However, you are not limited to that. Try tres leches ($3.95) for 
example. It is a soft, sweet, custardy concoction topped with uncooked (but 
pasteurized).meringue. Anne swears by it. Or you could have coconut rum 
cake or even!cheesecake. Cheesecake? Yes, with a mango-guava sauce 
($2.95). Don't forget where you are. </p>
<p>And don't forget, 16 seats inside and about 20 outside. Of course if 
!everyone else has come here, you are in Homberg Place and close to 
Merlot's.and Eva's and Tuscany and Naples and The Orangery. You 
wouldn't starve. </p>

at!the University of Tennessee. Lambert is also chef on News at Noonday,

<p>REVIEW </p>
<p>; ALTRUDA'S: RELIABLE ITALIAN, GREAT ROLLS </p>
<p>I wrote about Altruda's a long time ago. It was all right. They had really good 
rolls. They gave you a lot of salad. We didn't go back for a long time, even 
though we heard they had a new chef and that the menu had been livened up 
a little and that the red sauce was better. </p>
<p>A lot of people mentioned it to us. We heard that it was really popular. My 
wife, Anne, said several times that we should go. I said, right. We didn't go. </p>
<p>Recently, we found ourselves in the vicinity at just the right time andagain, 
Anne suggested that we go. Going was easier than finding some other places 
to go. I am glad we did. We had a nice time. And the food has gone up from 
all right to pretty good. </p>
<p>First a word about appetizers at Altruda's. They have an interesting looking 
collection, but I remembered that salad and that servings were large.!We 
decided to pass them by. You may make your own decisions in that regard. </p>
<p>I was attracted to the fried tortellini with marinara sauce ($3.95), but passed 
it by. And that was a good decision. You see, they brought us a bowl of 
those rolls. I may be mistaken but these seemed far better than I 
remembered.First, they had a much crispier crust. I like crisp crust. They are 
softinside to absorb the butter and garlic which is in the bottom of the bowl. 
Don't let anybody beat you to the butter and garlic at the bottom of the bowl. </p>
<p>And then they brought that salad. It is about a tub full for three people. And it 
all covered with cheese, and veggies, and good stuff in a crisp, tart,Italian 
dressing. I am not really wild about salad. I ate two plates full. Mistake. But 
more about that later. </p>
<p>We tried three entrees. First was lasagna napoletane ($8.95). Since it 
wasordered for a younger, thinner person, we were able to get a half order. 
A children's portion is available for most items on the menu. This may explain 
the large number of families we saw eating together. The lasagna was good 
and the meat sauce on it was excellent. </p>
<p>Anne chose manicotti alla romana ($8.95). The manicotti was cheese stuffed, 
covered with that same meat sauce and smothered in cheese. It was a 
substantial serving. In both cases, these dishes had a good, fresh taste. 
Thesauce was well prepared and the portions (yes, even the half portion) 
were </p>
<p>generous. </p>
<p>I chose shrimp Altruda ($14.95). In this dish, big, tender shrimp had been 
cooked in a white cream sauce which had lots of herbs (with oregano / 
predominant) and lots of little red pepper flakes. Anne pronounced it hot. 
I!declare it to be warm. It was served over a great mound of linguine. I 
musttell you that I ate all the shrimp, lots of the sauce, an 
unconscionableamount of linquine and had a lot left. If this is typical of the 
several seafood dishes that are served with linguine, then I strongly 
recommend them for the gourmands among you. </p>
<p>Now I know that you want to know about the veal. I know that you want to 
know about us for going to an Italian restaurant and not having at least 
one.kind of veal. After all, Anne always has veal piccata. When she 
orderedsomething else, I just kept my mouth shut. Next time I intend to have 
veal melanzane ($12.40). That is veal with eggplant, ricotta cheese, two 
sauces and cheese. </p>
<p>For dessert, we tried two traditional Italian desserts. First, we tried(cannoli 
($3.25). You know cannoli. A crisp pastry circle is filled with a mixture of 
ricotta and/or cream cheese with chocolate, nuts, etc. At Altruda, chocolate 
chips predominate and it is good. Tartufi ($2.95), which is a frozen chocolate 
mousse, is better. And you can always have cheesecake. </p>
<p>Now how would I summarize Altruda's? It is a dependable, Italian 
restaurant!where you can take the whole family for good food at reasonable 
prices. And you can eat those rolls. </p>

<p>APPLEWOOD GRILL IS NEWEST IN AFINE GROUP !</p>
<p>This is a restaurant hard for me to tell you about. Not because of the 
restaurant itself. It is an excellent example of how to run a big, commercial 
restaurant operation and still give it a personal touch. </p>
<p>The reason it is hard to talk about is that my wonderful wife, Anne, and I 
have come to know Bill and Kay Stokely, who along with their son, own 
Stokely!Hospitality Co., which operates this group of restaurants and we are 
openly prejudiced in their favor.!</p>
<p>We also know the executive chef Mike Brown and lots of the other folks 
associated with this enterprise. They have deepened our prejudice. Given this 
disclaimer, however, I want to talk about the newest member of this 
restaurant group. </p>
<p>As you probably know, waiting lines for the Applewood Farmhouse 
restaurant had gotten to the place that they could run upwards of an hour at 
peak times.(Given this situation, these good folks decided that they would 
expand the complex. The Grill is that expansion. </p>
<p>It has the same sort of feel about it and many of the same entrees. It also has 
some lighter choices for those so inclined. </p>
<p>Let's start with breakfast. I generally do not do breakfast. In fact, I try to 
avoid mornings altogether. But on a recent Saturday morning Anne and I 
had(a late morning appointment in Sevierville and decided that we should give 
these folks a visit. I am glad we did. </p>
<p>Breakfast at the Grill comes in small, medium, and look at all that food. We 
chose the latter. It includes apple juice, apple butter and apple fritters!(but of 
course everything else does as well). After all, we are in an apple orchard 
here. </p>
<p>The Farmhouse special also includes biscuits and butter, gravy, home fried 
(potatoes, fried apples and we aren't to the main event yet. With our eggs 
(they have egg substitutes) we tried bacon (crisp, smoky, good) 
and.something called country ham hash. Our server told us that Bill Stokley 
himself had thought up this dish. Right on, Bill! The best way I can describe it 
would be to say that it is like the best corned beef hash you ever had, but 
made with country ham. Either of these breakfasts is $6.95. Ham or pork 
chops is $7.95 and a bargain at the price. </p>
<p>We have not eaten lunch at the Grill, but thousands do. You can go for a full 
dinner like ham or pork chops with veggies. Or you can take the sandwich or 
salad route - like chicken Caesar salad for $6.95. </p>
<p>We have had dinner at the grill. If you like things with a delicate but very real 
smoke flavor, try the Applewood pork loin ($12.95). Tender pork loin is 
smoked with apple wood (well, what did you expect) and served with a 
spicy-!sweet apple relish. As with all dinners, it comes with your choice of 
about a dozen vegetables. They will let you have any two. </p>
<p>An interesting choice at dinner is trout cakes ($11.95). Flaked mountain!trout 
is mixed with cheese and onion and pan fried crisp on the outside and sweet 
and tender inside. Due to the kindness of strangers we have also tasted(the 
country ham ($10.95) which is more smoke than salt flavored. This won 
Anne's favor. </p>
<p>Now I want to give you the bad news. We have never had dessert at 
Applewood+Farmhouse Grill. It's not that they don't have homemade 
cobbler ($1.50) on which they will put ice cream (for 50 cents more). It is 
just that every time we have eaten here, we have so overindulged on fritters 
and apple butter that dessert was not even a remote possibility. </p>
<p>Now in summary. Yes, this is a big commercial restaurant which does not 
take reservations. Yes, it is a pleasant, homey place for any meal where you 
will get real value in food. Enjoy. </p>

                accessible. No smoking </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now you are probably going to want me to tell you how
        to find the Barrington Inn. No way! </p>
        <p>You need to call to make reservations. When you call,
        they can give you instructions. These folks are only 2
        1/2 miles from exit 412 off Interstate 40, but I don't
        want to take space away from the place and the food to
        give you these details. </p>
        <p>I seldom say anything like this, but it is worth the
        trip to see the Barrington Inn, even if it were not for
        the food. An old farmhouse has been rehabed, expanded and
        made into a bed and breakfast. It is nicely decorated and delightful.
        I wish we had time to spend a few days rocking on the
        front porch or sitting by the fire. However, we just went
        for the food. </p>
        <p>The food is special. The dining room is not large.
        Each dish is prepared to order. This is not fast food;
        this is good food. Be prepared to relax, enjoy the
        attractive setting and eat. </p>
        <p>Our party of four started with two soups and one
        appetizer. Both the alligator chowder ($3.95) and the
        conch chowder ($3.95) were special. In both cases, the
        preparation was light, delicate and tasty. </p>
        <p>This, by the way, is the first indication that these
        good folks once ran a restaurant in Key West. </p>
        <p>For the appetizer, we tried escargot in mushroom caps
        ($8.95). Again, the dish was enhanced by a light touch in
        the kitchen. Good escargot were presented in lightly
        sauteed mushroom caps with just enough garlic butter to be
        interesting. One member of our party was concerned about
        holding out for dessert and so passed on the first
        course. </p>
        <p>All entrees at Barrington are served with a crisp
        house salad with some nicely done salad dressings.
        Homemade bread is a great touch. </p>
        <p>We tried four entrees and were pleased with them. </p>
        <p>Perhaps the first one shows something about the nature
        of this restaurant. One member of our party is prohibited
        from having any butter or cream. We told our waitress of
        this and she was off immediately to the kitchen and came
        back with a list of recipes that could be prepared
        completely free of either. This personal attention added
        much to the meal. </p>
        <p>By the way, this person chose a grilled mahi mahi
        ($16.95) with a good dill sauce on the side. </p>
        <p>Chicken vol-au-vent ($18.95) was a lightly seasoned
        creamed chicken served in a crisp puff pastry. </p>
        <p>I do not remember when I last saw any real seafood
        newburg ($19.95) on a menu. This rich, creamy concoction
        of shrimp, scallops, crabmeat and fish has long been a
        favorite of mine and I was not disappointed in it. There
        had been no updating or slimming down of this classic
        dish. Just first quality seafood in a cream sauce with
        just the right amount of sherry to make it interesting. </p>
        <p>The most enticing entree of the evening is lobster and
        shrimp croustade ($20.95). This dish is spectacular in
        presentation and delicious in taste. A rich mixture of
        shrimp and lobster is enrobed in a fine sauce and then enclosed
        in a lobster-shaped puff pastry. You almost hesitate to
        cut into the dish it is so pretty, but I strongly
        recommend that you do so. Our group decided unanimously
        that this was our favorite. </p>
        <p>Now I have what may be considered by some as bad news.
        When you go visit this nice place (with reservations),
        you may not find any of these dishes. The menu notes that
        changes are made on a monthly basis. However, based on
        our experience, you will get something good. </p>
        <p>A final word about dessert. Despite our best
        intentions, we arrived at dessert time very full. While
        we did not let you down completely, the four of us did
        share one dessert. If you find yourself in this same
        dilemma, I recommend wholeheartedly the creme brulee
        ($6.95). It is a very different presentation of this
        dessert, but a delightful one. The custard was rich, the crust
        (yes, I said crust) was crisp and a good time was had by
        all. </p>
        <p>Did I mention you should have reservations? You should
        or you will not get in. And remember, get directions. </p>

</ul>
<p><font size=2><i>By Walter Lambert</i></font></p>
<p>Some time ago, I told you about the Bayou Bay Seafood House on 
Chapman Highway. I told you how Andy Cantillo of Paulina, La., met 
Cindy Whitfield of Seymour, Tenn., and how they carry on their 
married life together by living in Seymour and doing the cooking of 
South Louisiana. </p>
<p>Since that time we have gotten to know Andy and Cindy and their 
beautiful daughters and like them a lot. This is because we go as 
regularly as we can to have dinner with them. </p>
<p>You folks ask what it is that attracts me to a place and what keeps me 
coming back. Today, I want to talk about this restaurant some as an 
example of how I like to see a restaurant operate and what makes me 
want to keep going back. </p>
<p>First, Andy and Ciny knew exactly what they wanted this restaurant to 
be. They wanted a friendly, relaxed, neighborhood place where you felt 
you take your grandmother or your granddaughter. They took an old 
barbecue place and left the big tables and benches. They added food 
that helped set the mood. Then they kept letting the menu evolve while 
keeping what they started with. </p>
<p>You can still get great oysters at Bayou Bay. You can get them on the 
half shell or you can get Bayou Bay oysters, which are baked with a 
fine homemade crab stuffing. </p>
<p>You can also get them fried. I am not the world's greatest fan of fried 
oysters. Too often these fine examples of seafood are buried under 
masses of second-rate batter and fried to death. Not at Bayou Bay. 
The coating is light and crisp and enhances rather than covers the flavor 
of the oyster. If you go for lunch, get an oyster po' boy sandwich 
($6.95) and you will see what I mean. </p>
<p>But instead of having oysters, these good folks now will let you have 
gator instead. Good pieces of gator are blackened with a strong, but 
not hot, Cajun seasoning and quick cooked to be sure they stay tender. </p>
<p>You may want to try the traditional boiled crawfish ($8.50 for a 
pound). Andy and Cindy thought you might like something a little 
different so they now have soft shell crawfish which they will fry up for 
you. With these little goodies, you don't have to do all that work of 
pulling and getting every little morsel out of that shell. All you need to 
do is put a little sauce on one and pop it into your mouth. </p>
<p>Another real treat is crab claw. Available either hot or cold, the claws 
provide good little nibbling while you discuss the status of the world or 
what you want for dessert. </p>
<p>My favorite entrees at Bayou Bay are still the blackened amberjack or 
the soft shell crab fixed to your specifications. But you will find a regular 
parade of specials on the board at the back of the place. Try a little 
etouffee or red beans and rice or whatever Andy and Cindy are most 
proud of that day. It will be a good decision. And it is likely to be some 
little change for the better since the last time you were there. </p>
<p>Dessert at Bayou Bay has stayed pretty much the same. I am glad. I 
have tasted (yes, tasted) every dessert and you cannot go wrong. You 
will not be surprised the best dessert is bread pudding ($1.95), will 
you? However, Key lime pie is coming on fast and for chocoholics, 
there is Louisiana Bayou mush ($2.95). Ask these folks what it is; my 
blood sugar is going up thinking about it. </p>
<p>There you have it. Decide what you want to do and do it. Keep what 
folks come to depend on, but never, ever decide you are so good you 
don't need to keep making changes. For all this, you can depend on 
Bayou Bay. </p>

<p>BLEU HOUND IS AT TOP OF ITS LINE IN GRILLS </p>
<p>It was a dark and stormy night. </p>
<p>Once before I started that way to tell you about visiting some place in Oak 
Ridge. I don't remember where it was, but I remember it was easily 
forgettable. However, this dark and stormy night did not find us out on a wild 
goose chase. What we found was a very domestic dog house. </p>
<p>As you may have guessed from the name, the Bleu Hound Grille is a 
grill+with just a little twist. And that twist is quality from beginning to end. </p>
<p>I must admit that I was a little put off when someone called me to talk about a 
wonderful new restaurant in Oak Ridge and let it slip in the conversation that 
it was in a converted gas station. Now the potential puns in such a situation 
are almost too much to ignore. But when you see this pretty little building with 
its green, black and white interior, you will know that this was a major 
conversion. </p>
<p>It is not large but it is cheerful and inviting. </p>
<p>On the dark and stormy night when we visited, the place was full. That 
!should tell you something. In case it does not, let me tell you a couple of 
things. </p>
<p>Appetizers are good and big and dinner is going to come with a huge salad 
and a plate full of food. </p>
<p>The lentil soup ($2.95 for a big cup) was thick, rich and flavorful.!Scallops 
Florentine ($6.95) were even better. The scallops had been braised just 
enough to keep their tender texture and were served over a good, fresh, 
creamed spinach. </p>
<p>If I did not mention salads, I should have. They were huge. They were crisp. 
They were properly dressed. We ate them. All. </p>
<p>Entrees were slightly updated classic presentations. Lemon chicken 
($11.95)!was a good chicken breast sauteed with just the right amount of 
lemon juice(and capers. It was a clear first cousin of chicken piccata. It was 
moist, tender and good. </p>
<p>Loin of veal ($13.95) was almost veal Oscar but not quite. Here we have a 
slightly less successful story. The veal was perfect. Good veal, with just a 
dusting of flour, sauteed just right. The crab meat was some fairly good 
crab(claws and the white asparagus was canned. Lose the asparagus and the 
crab.claws would be our advice. The veal is good enough to stand on its 
own. </p>
<p>Both entrees were served with a nice vegetable accompaniment. </p>
<p>I must admit that I peeped over the shoulder of the folks at the next table and 
thought their peppered fettuccine with shrimp ($12.95) looked absolutely 
right. But my wife, Anne, wouldn't let me ask for a bite. She said when we 
had traveled into this cosmopolitan area we must behave ourselves. </p>
<p>All the desserts at Bleu Hound are homemade and the two we had were 
good. I!could tell you all about them, but it wouldn't be of much help to you. 
They change regularly. But I will tell this, our luck with dessert was two out of 
two being better than excellent. </p>
<p>Have I covered the fact that I lost my notes? I sure hope so. And I hope I 
can go have lunch with these folks soon. I want a wood grilled chicken 
Caesar salad. Soon. Reservations are advised. </p>

<p>SECOND INDIAN RESTAURANT IS GOOD NEWS </p>
<p><b><i>Byline: </i></b><i>Walter Lambert</i> </p>
<p>Restaurant: Cafe India </p>
<p>Location: 134 N. Peters Road </p>
<p>Phone: 694-0500 </p>

<p>Life is exceedingly strange. First, we struggled for years to get an Indian 
restaurant that could last more than a week in Knoxville. And now we have 
two, and they are both excellent. Who can figure. </p>
<p>Cafe India is located in the space formerly occupied by Dumplins in the large 
shopping center at the intersection of Kingston Pike and Peters Road. It is 
around on the side near Goody's. </p>
<p>The other is Kashmir Indian Restaurant on 17th Street. We reviewed it last 
summer. </p>
<p>Our first experience at Cafe India was when good friends invited us to go to 
lunch with them. Lunch at the Cafe India on Monday through Fridays is an 
experience. It is a buffet. And if you do not know Indian food, get Sam or his 
charming wife, Daksha to explain the dishes to you. </p>
<p>A combination of salads and cold dishes complement an assortment of spicy 
vegetarian and meat dishes. All this is enlivened by two or three sauces which 
range from cooling to incendiary. The centerpiece of the hot portion of the 
buffet is tandoori chicken. </p>
<p>If you are not familiar with the tandoor oven, you should become familiar. 
This traditional oven depends on superheated air to cook the vegetables, 
bread or meat. This means that food comes out crisp on the outside and juicy 
and tender on the inside. Chicken is coated with a bright red coating held in 
place by soaking the chicken in yogurt before rolling it in the spices and 
cooking it. Have some of it with the traditional raised bread, called naan, 
which is baked on the side of the tandoor oven. You may also want to have 
some lamb and a spoonful or two of dal, a tasty lentil dish. Some rice scented 
with saffron is also a good idea. </p>
<p>Dinner at Cafe India offers the same dazzling array of dishes. More good 
friends took us to dinner, and since they are originally from India and knew 
what they were doing, I placed myself in their hands. What good hands they 
were. </p>
<p>We ate three different appetizers. Samosas ($2) are a beautiful pastry stuffed 
with potatoes and peas and deep-fried. Pakoras ($2) are vegetables dipped 
in a batter that fries golden and crunchy. Both of these are served with an 
assortment of sauces. Be advised that you should check each one in advance. 
Some are cool, some warm and some are hot. All are good if you can stand 
them. Bhajias ($2.50) are spinach dumplings. </p>
<p>Main dishes range in price from $6.99 to $10.99, and we tried an assortment 
of them. Beef korma and lamb ragon were two of the real favorites in our 
group. The beef is in a spicy, creamy sauce, and the lamb is in a sauce 
flavored with rose and lemon. They were followed closely by shrimp masala, 
tandoori chicken and saag paneer, a vegetarian dish made up of cubes of 
homemade Indian cheese in a spinach sauce. </p>
<p>Indian desserts tend to be sweet, strange and good. Gulab jamboon ($2) is 
described on the menu as dry milk and flour balls in rose syrup. That would 
not inspire me to buy them.They are terrific. Also, don't miss the kulfi ($3). 
This is a homemade ice cream and is excellent. </p>
<p>So I guess I just have to credit it to good luck that we go from no Indian 
restaurants to two good ones. And the Cafe India is good luck indeed. </p>

<p>Restaurant: Cafe One Two Three </p>
<p>Location: 123 12th Avenue North, Nashville. </p>
<p>Hours: Dinner, Monday-Saturday, 5:30-11 p.m. </p>
<p>Phone: 615-255-CAFE </p>

<p>Once again, the valiant Lady Vols are about to venture to Vanderbilt to 
vanquish Vandy. Our great team will be off to Nashville and I must carry out 
my sworn duty to tell you about where to eat in that distant city. </p>
<p>This year's choice is The Cafe One Two Three. </p>
<p>This restaurant is in a reconditioned commercial building just off busy West 
End Avenue in Nashville between the Interstate and Vanderbilt. How 
convenient could I make it for you? But if you plan to dine with these folks 
before the game, do make reservations. They tend to stay full and for a very 
good reason. This restaurant, like several others in Nashville, is operated by 
an enterprising gentleman named Jody Faison. If that name is associated with 
a restaurant, I have found that you can depend on it. </p>
<p>On a recent visit, my wife, Anne, and I started with two great appetizers. If 
we were not such nice people we would probably have fought over who 
ordered the better one. Potato acorn squash dumplings ($5.75) were made 
of a potato dough with acorn squash filling. The dumplings had been cut into 
strips to serve. They were scattered with good bacon crumbles and bathed in 
a sage-flavored cream sauce, which was silky in texture and in taste. </p>
<p>Tennessee country ham risotto ($5.95) was a ham flavored risotto formed 
into cakes and fried crisp. It was served with a sauce that combined 
tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and a lot of garlic with fresh basil and butter. In 
both texture and taste, it was a treat. </p>
<p>As wonderful as these were, they left untasted the beer batter onion rings with 
fried green tomatoes that are served with a chili remoulade and peach 
ketchup. It also left us wondering about pan roasted crawdad cake with 
serrano chili sauce. And how about a spinach salad with shiitake mushroom, 
red onions, oranges and country ham. Something to look forward to. </p>
<p>Anne, feeling that the sumptious appetizers called for some restraint in the 
entree, chose the winter blue plate ($11.95), which is vegetarian. Portabella 
mushrooms, eggplant, brussels sprouts, parsley and sweet potatoes had been 
grilled or roasted in a way that intensified their natural flavor and then left 
alone. The eggplant and the sweet potatoes were both excellent. The 
portabella mushroom was about 4 inches across and just right. The rest were 
vegetables. But when dipped into the sauce on my entree, became special. </p>
<p>But let me tell you about my entree. Picture a veal porterhouse ($18.95) of 
significant size that has been grilled to perfection. Place it on a plate with a 
generous serving of kale that had been braised to a great, tender, chewy 
consistency. Place next to that a mound of hot, mustardy, red potato salad. 
Then top things off with a sauce which combines caramelized red onions and 
green peppercorns in a light stock reduction. It was a thing of beauty and a 
taste delight. </p>
<p>Now we get to dessert. </p>
<p>I am afraid we have failed you again on this score. When faced with a choice 
of carrot cake, and three kinds of cheesecake (including white chocolate), 
and a triple chocolate pate, we chose a simple creme brulee. It was what it 
was. Nothing special. But nice when you have already seriously overeaten. 
Next time, we will show some reserve and have the chocolate pate. </p>

<p>CAPITOL GRILLE COMPLETES HERMITAGE </p>
<p>I'll bet every one of you saw I was writing about a Nashville restaurant and 
raced out to check if you had missed some scheduled athletic event involving 
the Vanderbilt Commodores and the University of Tennessee. </p>
<p>By now it is customary that I give you some place to eat when you go over to 
watch the Lady Vols work their magic in Nashville. Well, you will have 
to+wait for that. But I just couldn't wait to tell you about the rebirth of a 
significant place to eat in that city.(</p>
<p>As mamy of you know, I make my living representing the University of 
Tennessee in Nashville and Washington. For several years now, I have 
stayed at the Hermitage Hotel. </p>
<p>Despite several attempts to bring back this lovely old hotel, its rebirth started 
out mediocre and drifted downhill. For the last couple of years before!its 
recent rebirth, it was kind of pitiful. Then it was announced that Irby Cooper's 
hotel group had bought it and was going to turn it into a showplace. Sure, we 
cynics thought. Then they started work. Every suite, every nook and every 
cranny was redone. </p>
<p>It should be noted they did this without ever closing the hotel and on 
somedays it was like living in the midst of a construction site. My personal 
favorite was the day workmen who had been locked outside knocked on my 
second floor window to see if they could come through to get back in. </p>
<p>Throughout this construction, Fred Marcum, who is the hard working 
manager,kept saying, &quot;Just wait until the new chef gets here.&quot; Sure, we cynics 
thought. He got there. Was it ever worth the wait. </p>
<p>How does a breakfast of a hominy, potato and country ham hash with 
scrambled eggs sound? How about a smoked chicken quesadilla with black 
beans!spinach and jalapeno jack cheese ($5.25) sound for lunch? Or you 
could have the grilled chicken breast sandwich on focaccia with tomatoes 
arugula, roasted peppers and pesto mayonnaise ($7.50). Or how about a 
club sandwich of smoked turkey, ham, bacon and cheddar cheese on 
sourdough bread ($6.25). Is a picture starting to emerge? </p>
<p>Dinner is sensational. </p>
<p>You might want to start with a rich, creamy soup of roasted onions 
with!Gruyere croutons ($3.95). It is now my favorite soup. You could then 
choose from a whole range of appetizers. Our three favorites are softshell 
crawfish pan-fried with a lemon butter sauce and served on a piece of grilled 
eggplant!and scattered with honey roasted nuts ($7.95). Or perhaps the 
smoked salmon with potato pancakes and watercress salad ($6.95) would 
do. </p>
<p>Or perhaps, you and someone special could share the wood-grilled 
pizza.($8.95) with tomato, spinach, goat cheese and caramelized onions. It 
is+only fair to tell you this pizza is available as an entree at lunch and my wife, 
Anne, has had it as an entree a couple of times at dinner. </p>
<p>I cannot start to tell you about entrees here. Let me give you a couple of 
quick examples. Grilled salmon is served with black-eyed peas, 
leeks,!tomatoes, orzo and potato strands with a warm shiitake mushroom 
vinaigrette ($16.95). It is a flavor avalanche. </p>
<p>Sauteed grouper is served with a lightly sweet vanilla sauce with crawfish 
tails, fresh spinach and sweet potato latkes ($17.50). A smoked pork chop is 
served with asago cheese grits, fresh greens and black-eyed pea salsa</p>
<p>($16.95). </p>
<p>Then there is dessert. Raisin and pecan bread pudding ($4.50) is served!with 
Southern Comfort sauce. Chocolate cake is served warm with vanilla 
icecream and raspberry sauce ($4.75). Banana rum cheesecake has a 
chocolatemacadamia nut crust ($4.75). However, the queen of the desserts is 
creme+brulee Napoleon with caramel sauce ($4.75). Think of crisp layers of 
paper!thin phyllo pastry stacked with a perfect creme brulee and served on a 
warm caramel sauce. </p>
<p>The Capitol Grille makes the return of this grand old lady complete. If you 
listen carefully you might hear the ghost of Dinah Shore who got her first big&amp; 
break singing on the radio from this room. But if you don't, you will get a fine 
meal. </p>

<p>Restaurant: Calhoun's Bar-B-Que and Brew; </p>
<p>Location: Bearden Hill, 6515 Kingston Pike; </p>

<p>CALHOUN'S DOES IT - AGAIN </p>
<p>I need to tell you this right up front. I am in no position to make a(judgment 
for you about beer. I do not drink it much, and I do not like it much. </p>
<p>I do know that brew pubs are springing up like mushrooms in the rainy 
season. There are two or three in Nashville, half a dozen in San Franciso and 
now two in Knoxville. I still haven't gotten to the one downtown, but I am 
going soon. I promise. </p>
<p>But when I saw that Calhoun's had taken over the Mexican restaurant on 
the(top of Bearden Hill, I was anxious to see what they had done. So my 
wife, Anne, and I joined with friends and off we went. </p>
<p>Guess what? They were packed full already. And I think I know why. As 
with all the Calhoun's, these folks have it together. Good food, good service, 
good attitude and good beer (or so I am told). </p>
<p>Now let's say a final world about that beer. All beer served at Calhoun's 
Bar-B-Que and Brew is made in the place. There are three kinds. The 
featured.brew is called Old Thunder Road. You remember that mountain boy 
who was(hauling the &quot;devil's brew&quot; and how he crashed into a sub-station at 
the bottom of Bearden Hill and died. You know, Robert Mitchum played the 
role in the movie. </p>
<p>Anyway, Calhoun's also has golden lager and Cherokee ale. You can get 
a+sampler for $3.25 and have a taste of all of them. We did. I recommend it. </p>
<p>We also got bar-b-quesadillas ($6.25). I highly recommend them. Slivers 
of!chicken and cheese and pepper are cooked crisp in flour tortillas, cut into 
wedges and served with a good (hot) sauce. Good stuff. </p>
<p>We also tried hot soft pretzels with beer cheese dip ($4.95). The pretzels 
were chewy, salty and good. The beer cheese dip was tart, cheesy and 
perfect. </p>
<p>Some things at Calhoun's are almost obligatory. We had them. Bar-B-Que 
ribs at Calhoun's won national honors. They deserve them. A half rack with a 
couple of side dishes is $8.75 or full rack is $14.85. </p>
<p>Prime rib is $13.75 for a great big slice of smoky-flavored prime rib with a 
side dish and a good salad. </p>
<p>Char-grilled shrimp ($7.95 for a half-dozen and $11.95 for a dozen) may not 
(be perfect, but they come close. With just enough spices to bring out the 
flavor and grilled to a turn, they are great. </p>
<p>But the surprise of the evening was the rotisserie chicken. Anne got it as part 
of the ribs and chicken combo ($12.95). Served with a side dish and good 
coleslaw, this combo is a bargain. But back to the chicken. It was spicy and 
juicy and tender and just the way a chicken ought to be. </p>
<p>Now let me tell you about something really nice these folks will do. They will 
sell you this combo for $12.95 and then for $2.75 they will sell you 
more!slaw and another side dish, and you will have plenty - and I do mean 
plenty - for two. Neat, huh? </p>
<p>In case you have been living under a rock for 20 years, Calhoun's is 
famousfor their side dishes as they ought to be. You can get potatoes baked 
or French fried. You can get excellent coleslaw or Smoky Mountain beans 
that are!spicy hot. But then you might get spinach Maria. I sure eat it when I 
visit with these folks. </p>
<p>Now we get to the bad news. </p>
<p>By the time we got to desserts, we had eaten beyond our capacities. We 
didn't eat any. I'm sorry. But on the other trips we have eaten turtle 
cheesecake ($3.50) and Key lime pie ($3.50). They were excellent. </p>
<p>After all, that is the way these folks do things whether on the river or at the 
marina in Lenoir City or at the original on Kingston Pike. You get the idea. 
Go see them. </p>

<p>CHARLIE PEPPERS IS REALLY HOT! </p>
<p><b><i>Byline: </i></b><i>Walter Lambert</i> </p>
<p>Restaurant: Charlie Peppers </p>
<p>Location: 716 20th Street </p>
<p>Hours: Open daily, 11 a.m. to late hours </p>
<p>Phone: 524-8669 </p>
<p>Other: Handicapped accessible; non-smoking section </p>
<p>I really should have told you about Charlie Peppers some time ago, but I 
have a good excuse for my tardiness. It is my wife, Anne's, fault. Now I feel 
so much better. </p>
<p>You see, she does not care for peppery foods. I absolutely love them. Even 
in the best marriage in the world, there is room for some disagreement. </p>
<p>However, I was sure she would find nothing to eat and she would pout and 
then I would be grumpy and who knows what might happen. Forget all that. 
Four of us including the aforementioned Anne, went to Charlie Peppers on a 
recent Sunday night and found that there was something good for all of us. </p>
<p>We started with two appetizers. First, we ordered the warm version of hot 
wings ($4.99). The menu says that it is the Hawkeye's wings, which have 
been peppered up a little. These, we all agreed, had been peppered up just 
enough. I should let you know that two degrees of hotness rank above what 
we had. Eat at your own risk. </p>
<p>We also had southwestern con queso ($4.99). This was a fine blend of white 
cheeses with spinach, bell peppers and garlic. It was flavored with serrano 
peppers, which give lots of taste and not that much burn. We scraped the 
bowl clean. </p>
<p>We tried three different entrees with three distinct tastes and three distinct 
degrees of hotness. Prospector chicken ($7.99) was a fine barbecued 
chicken breast that was covered with ham, cheese, tomato, scallions and 
assorted other good stuff. It was not hot. With pepper I mean. Anne liked it a 
lot. </p>
<p>Buffalo shrimp ($8.99) do not come from buffalo. The shrimp had been 
treated with a nice peppery batter and the same dipping sauce as the similarly 
named wings. The dish was an excellent choice. I personally liked them better 
without the sauce. I doubt that good shrimp in a crunchy, spicy batter needs 
much added to make it good. </p>
<p>With my usual aplomb, I ordered the best dish of the day. Or at least three 
out of four of us thought so. I had chicken rellenos ($7.99). If you are 
accustomed to chile relleno, limp peppers with an undistinguished cheese, 
forget all that. These are big, green, poblano peppers that have been 
hollowed out and stuffed with a combination of finely chopped chicken, beans 
and cheese. They are then baked so the peppers still have a little texture to 
them and the filling is moist and delightful. Since poblanos are somewhere 
near the middle of the hotness range, these will make your head sweat and 
your nose run, but they will delight your tastebuds. </p>
<p>Charlie features a range of side dishes that go from hot to not. We tried 
coyote rice, black beans and southwestern veggies. They ranged from 
adequate (the veggies) to excellent (the rice). </p>
<p>By the time we got to dessert, we had eaten so much that we shared a single 
serving of red velvet cake ($3.29). It was red velvet cake all right. But 
somehow, it seemed anti-climactic after the meal. </p>
<p>I did have one major disappointment at Charlie's though. The lady behind me 
had a sandwich called a jackalope ($5.99). Yes, I am sure of the name. I 
took it directly off the menu. It is vegetarian with eggplant and portabello 
mushroom and hot cheese. It was on a big, dark, good looking bun. But the 
sandwich was not really the disappointment. It was that although I looked 
back three different times at this lady, she never offered me a single bite. She 
just kept raving to her companion about how good it was. I am going back 
for lunch soon and I do not intend to share with anyone. </p>

<p>Restaurant: The Chef Bistro and Baker </p>
<p>Location: 5003 Kingston Pike </p>
<p>Hours: Breakfast, Monday through Saturday, 7:30-10 a.m.; Lunch, 
Monday&amp; through Saturday, 11 a.m.-2:30 p.m.; Dinner, Tuesday through 
Saturday, 6-10 p.m. </p>

it is a small room. </p>
<p>START DAY WITH GREAT BREAKFAST </p>
<p>I am not sure that it is a natural law or anything like that, but I have observed 
that those places really good at dinner generally do not do breakfast well. Or 
just the reverse. </p>
<p>It has to do with body rhythms or something like that. In fact, it often.shows 
up that breakfast will have a completely different character from dinner. </p>
<p>What all this is about is I have now had both dinner and breakfast at The 
Chef Bistro on Kingston Pike, and these good folks have mastered both. </p>
<p>The Chef is a pretty little room in the converted building where the!Bagelry 
used to be. These good folks have kept things simple, and it works. </p>
<p>Dinner is good bistro food, which is strong on quality ingredients with simple, 
tasty sauces. Soups at The Chef have been consistently good. Vegetable 
soup is excellent, and it would go without saying the French onion soup 
would be done just right. </p>
<p>Light, herb-filled vinaigrette dressing on a selection of good greens makes a 
salad what a salad ought to be. Breads at The Chef are homemade and 
superb. The French country bread is by far my favorite. </p>
<p>My wife, Anne, and I have had dinner a couple of times at The Chef and 
have!been pleased with all the entrees we have tried. If you are a steak 
person, try the filet mignon with black pepper-corn sauce ($20.94). This is 
probably as good an example as any of what you find at The Chef. The meat 
is excellent,(cooked to your taste and topped with a sauce that has just 
enough cracked black peppercorns to properly enhance the flavor of the 
good meat. We have not tried flank steak with shallots and green 
peppercorns ($14.95), but it is high on our list for a subsequent visit. </p>
<p>I have eaten fish once at The Chef. I had a nice piece of snapper with a 
saffron mustard sauce ($16.95). The fish had been sauteed lightly and 
served(on a delicate sauce to the advantage of both. We also liked the veal 
with apples ($23.95). Flavored with a little calvados it was just sweet 
enough. </p>
<p>All this leads me to my favorite dish at The Chef. Are you surprised thatit is 
roast lamb ($22.95)? Cooked with the herbs of Provence, it is what should 
be done to lamb. </p>
<p>Dessert at dinner includes homemade napoleons, profiteroles, floating island, 
cheesecake and a whole array of good things. All are about $3.95, and all 
have been good so far. </p>
<p>Now let's talk about breakfast. Let's talk about an omelet with cubes of(good 
ham and a lot of sweet, nutty Swiss cheese that is cooked fluffy and tender. 
And then consider this is just one of four or five choices for omelets. And 
$3.50 is a great price. I think next time I will go for spinach(and cheese. But 
Anne requires me to mention the crepes. As you know, done properly crepes 
are a delight. Done improperly they are a rubbery mess. This one was done 
properly. It was as thin as a crepe should be. And tender andslightly sweet. 
The huge crepe was then folded around sliced bananas and served with real 
whipped cream. If you prefer you can have it with strawberries or even just 
with real maple syrup. And all this for $2.75. Ihave not had lunch at The 
Chef, but with a variety of soups, sandwiches,!quiche and salads, how can 
you go wrong? Please do remember this is a small place and if you are going 
for dinner, reservations are a must. </p>

<p>ChisholmTrail is with trip to chain </p>
<p>Byline: Walter Lambert </p>
<p>Restaurant: Chisholm Trail Steakhouse and Saloon </p>
<p>Location: 7051 Kingston Pike </p>
<p>Hours: Lunch: Monday-Friday, 11 a.m.-2 p.m.; dinner: Monday-Thursday, 
4-10 p.m.; Friday, 4-11 p.m.; Saturday, 11 a.m.-11 p.m.; Sunday, 11

<p>Phone: 584-2001 </p>
<p>Other: Handicapped accessible; non-smoking section. </p>
<p>I know I have repeatedly told you that I do not do chains. Well, I do not. 
Unless I decide to. After all, why have rules if you are never going to break 
them. </p>
<p>Today, I want to talk about a phenomenon which I do not rightly understand. </p>
<p>These days, anything which is low fat, low cholesterol, low sugar, low etc., is 
all the rage. I recently did a one-week television segment on Noonday in 
which I cooked low fat and low sugar for a week, and we were overrun with 
requests for recipes. </p>
<p>In the midst of all this, steakhouses are all the rage again! (You know for a 
while, they were being converted to other things all willy nilly). But now they 
are coming back, and one of the good ones is Chisholm Trail Steakhouse. </p>
<p>It is good because it has the usual assortment of top quality steaks and plenty 
of other good stuff as well. For example, if you want an appetizer that is 
nearly big enough to be an entree, try Bill's buffalo broil ($5.95). Nice pieces 
or real buffalo are put on a skewer and broiled just right. They are then 
served on a bed of the best little French fried onions. Just for fun, they throw 
in a couple of sauces. I recommend this highly. </p>
<p>We also loved the soup. Yes, they have only one soup. It is poblano corn 
chowder. A good rich corn chowder is enlivened with just enough poblano 
peppers to make it interesting. </p>
<p>The steak selection at Chisholm Trail has all the standards. We have tested 
the New York strip ($16.95) and the rib-eye ($15.95). Both were high 
quality beef which had been cooked to taste with no nonsense at all. But let 
me recommend something else to you. The specialty steak at Chisholm Trail 
is the Jesse Chisholm favorite ($15.95). It has become my favorite as well. It 
is a nice filet, flavored with a good chili butter, then topped with roasted 
poblano peppers and jack cheese. It is good stuff. </p>
<p>Now with all entrees, you get to choose two side dishes. They are good. I 
would especially recommend the Caesar salad and the sweet potato 
casserole. These folks too are into flavored mashed potatoes. They flavor 
them with horseradish. Not bad. </p>
<p>But as I said earlier, at Chisholm one is not in any way limited to steak. My 
wife, Anne, chose ranch house ribs ($12.95) on our first visit and enjoyed 
them a lot. They were meaty (which is always nice), tender and coated in a 
barbecue sauce that she thought was wonderful. I thought it was a little sweet, 
but then you know how I am. </p>
<p>I chose shrimp diablo ($9.95) and it was a much better choice. Good big 
shrimp were cooked just enough to be done and then seasoned with some 
sort of spicy, Southwestern tasting spice mixture, just right for my taste. Anne 
thought they were almost too spicy, but you know how she is. They also have 
grilled catfish, but I haven't gotten to taste that yet. </p>
<p>Dessert. I know I am supposed to talk about dessert. But we have eaten at 
Chisholm Trail twice now, and by the time we have gotten to dessert, we 
have been unable to eat any. I abjectly apologize. But big mountain chocolate 
cake looked mighty good. Maybe next time. </p>
<p>Two or three final things about Chisholm Trail. It, like several places I have 
talked about lately, is kid-friendly. You know, place mats to color, a good 
kids menu, including your child's picture in a cowboy hat taken on a saddle. 
They even have a special drink cleverly called ``kid's drink'' served in a 
buckaroo cup. </p>
<p>Also, these folks now do lunch. They have started since we were there and 
we have not had the pleasure of trying it yet. But I bet it will be all right. Even 
if this is a chain. </p>

<p>Restaurant: Cozymel's A Very Mexican Restaurant</p>
<p>Location: 7727 Kingston Pike</p>

p.m.</p>
<p>Phone: 694-9811</p>
<p>Other: Handicapped accessible, nonsmoking section</p>
<p>Well, here we go again. You will remember we visited Macaroni Grill and 
were greatly surprised that this chain restaurant served very good food in a 
fun atmosphere. </p>
<p>Now we have gone to the Mexican cousin of Macaroni, Cozymel's. Same 
story, more spice. So there. Maybe just a couple of more details.</p>
<p>We started with queso flameados de chorizo ($5.49). Personally, I would be 
just as happy not to have my cheese set on fire, but everyone else told me to 
eat up. They were right. We chose the version with chorizo sausage, but if 
you prefer, you can get this good cheese fondue with chicken or shrimp. It is 
hot, gooey, and good on tortillas, which are served with it.</p>
<p>Before we get into entrees, maybe I should tell you that Cozymel's is not 
Tex-Mex. It features dishes that are Mexican and especially those of the 
Yucatan area. This means more fish than you usually think of, but still with a 
wide range of peppers. These folks have it as hot as you want it or as mild. A 
real service is the description of sauces and peppers which is on the back of 
the menu. Pay attention, you can either learn or burn.</p>
<p>A dish that you really need to know about at Cozymel's is pollo rostizado 
($8.95 for a half, $9.95 for a whole). As the name says, this is roast chicken. 
In fact, it is crispy, moist, tender, spit-roasted chicken that has been seasoned 
with a fine herb collection. Like the rest of the entrees at Cozymel's, the 
chicken is served with veggies, black beans and rice, in large quantities. We 
went for the whole chicken and had a great second meal out of it.</p>
<p>My wife, Anne, begged to be steered to something that was not hot. Our 
talented server did exactly that. Camarones Azteca ($10.99) are plump, 
tender shrimp sauteed and served with a delightful, delicate Azteca herb 
sauce, which the menu describes as sour-cream based with fresh pico de 
gallo sauce. It seemed creamy, but not that spicy. Thank goodness, she 
shared. Again, there were all those beans and rice and baked vegetables.</p>
<p>I had what you will probably think of as the least Mexican dish of the evening, 
but it sounds so good in Spanish. Pierna de cordero ($12.99) is a lamb shank 
which has been braised until it is falling off the bone. It is then placed over a 
bed of rice and a mildly hot chile sauce is poured over it. The lamb was 
tender and tasty, and the sauce was exactly what it needed. It is also served 
with rice and black beans.</p>
<p>Desserts at this interesting place are delightful. Flan here is really somewhere 
between a flan and a cheesecake. It is available both in vanilla and chocolate 
and is $3.95. It is creamy, rich, sinful and good. But what you may want to 
try is a pina borrecha that is also $3.95. It is good ice cream on the best 
caramel sauce you have tasted in a long time. It is served with crunchy, 
cinnamon-sugar coated cookies and is a treat. They have other desserts. We 
may try them next time.</p>
<p>A word to those purists among us. So, it is a chain. I dare you to go and not 
enjoy it.</p>

<p><font size=6><strong>Dining At Dolly's</strong></font></p>
<p>You read right. This is about Dollywood. But it is not about rides. It is not 
about shows. It is not even about what an outstanding young woman Miss 
Dolly is.</p>
<p>It is about food.</p>
<p>In fairness, I must tell you a couple of things about me in relation to the food 
at Dollywood. I do not like theme parks. The last two times I have been to 
Orlando, I did not enter the Magic Kingdom in any of its various 
manifestations. I know all about how they are good places to go with kids. I 
am not a kid. I am not married to one. When I last set foot in what is now 
Dollywood, it was Silver Dollar City.</p>
<p>David Colburn, who is executive chef at Dollywood, has done an incredible 
amount of work for any number of charitable causes in this area and I have 
come to have considerable respect for him. I have had any number of things 
cooked by him and I admire his skill as a chef. </p>
<p>Take these things into account as you read the rest of this.</p>
<p>My wife, Anne, and I started our day at Dollywood by having breakfast at a 
great big restaurant called Aunt Granny's. I don't even want to know why 
they call it that, but I'll bet you it relates to something in Miss Dolly's early 
life.</p>
<p>What I do want to tell you is that if breakfast is your most important meal of 
the day, you will do well at Aunt Granny's. We are talking a buffet with fruit, 
melons, sausage, sausage gravy, biscuits and eggs, plain and eggs with 
peppers in them. </p>
<p>We are talking about a line which is kept constantly stocked and hot and 
good. If you leave Aunt Granny's hungry, it is your own fault.</p>
<p>Now this is probably as good a time as any to talk about people at 
Dollywood. We were impressed with everyone from the front gate to the 
parking attendant who showed us the way out. At breakfast we were 
greeted by people who knew about the park, were eager to talk about it and 
who gave us all sorts of good tips about how to spend our day. We found 
this to be the case in every single thing we did all day. It helps a lot and the 
Dollywood folks can be proud of their folks.</p>
<p>For lunch, we decided not to try any of the serveral sit down restaurants. In 
fact, it was Anne who decided, but I didn't argue. Since most food 
opportunities in this park are stand in line and carry it to a table places, we 
decided that is what we should do.</p>
<p>Did we ever pick a winner for lunch! Whatever you do at Dollywood, do 
not miss eating at the smoke house in the old part of the park near the eagle 
sanctuary. In fact, you can get your food and go sit at a picnic table to watch 
the eagles.</p>
<p>If you like sliced brisket or pulled shoulder, ribs or chicken, these folks are 
ready to please. Smoke is the predominate flavor of all the barbecue 
choices. This is real smoke from the cooking of the meat, not something 
from a bottle. Each type of barbecue then gets its own special sauce. My 
advice would be to try the sampler, but be warned, it is a lot of meat and 
fixin's.</p>
<p>We found ourselves in a genuine quandary for dinner. Any number of folks 
told us to be sure to try the Back Stage Cafe. But there is also the brand 
new Silver Screen Cafe with its 1950s movie theme.</p>
<p>This was all settled for us by circumstances. By dinnertime we were so 
exhausted and conveniently located just outside the Silver Screen that it won 
by default.</p>
<p>One of the hottest new ideas is themed restaurants. Lines form around the 
block for Jekyll and Hyde in New York and for Goldfinger in Atlanta. Silver 
Screen is movies, from front door to dessert.</p>
<p>The food is a good selection of salads, sandwiches and pastas. Servings are 
generous. Dessert is terrific. Have a banana split, or even better, have 
caramel cheesecake with great caramel sauce. Watch the floor show and let 
your feet rest.</p>
<p>We found food to be good from morning to night at Dollywood. Next time I 
may go on Thunder Road.</p>

<p>DINING FROM ONE COAST TO THE OTHER </p>
<p><b><i>Byline: </i></b><i>Walter Lambert</i> </p>
<p>I know I should be bringing you a new and exciting place to go eat. I know I 
should tell about some little place hidden away on some back street that will 
fill your life with joy. I know all that. I am just not quite ready yet.</p>
<p>We have a number of places in sight, but all sorts of things have conspired to 
keep me from feeling good about discussing them with you. So be patient.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, my wife, Anne, and I had a couple of adventures last year 
which say a lot about what we look for in food. In August, the two of us 
spent a week in Ogonquit, Maine. In cause you don't know, Ogonquit is 
Gatlinburg by the sea. It is hotels, guest houses, bed-and-breakfast inn, shops 
and restaurants. Lots of restaurants. </p>
<p>They ranged from The Omelette Factory, which was in the basement under 
the laundromat, to the dining room of the Cliff House, where we happened to 
be staying, to Poor Richards, which was located in a house built in the early 
1700s.</p>
<p>All these places, and many others, had one thing in common. The food was 
good. How could lobster be bad? It was never wonderful. It was resort food. 
It was the food of a culture which held you captive and saw to it that your 
experience was good enough that you might come back and that at the very 
least would mention them to others who might be coming.</p>
<p>And then, in December, we made our annual pilgrimage to San Francisco for 
meetings. We ate at places that ranged from a Japanese noodle restaurant, 
where you can get a good dinner for $6, to a great little neighborhood 
Basque restaurant where lunch costs $16. We ate at a neighborhood Thai 
restaurant where dinner for four costs $25, to an upscale Italian trattoria, 
where lunch for two costs $50. In all of this, we stayed away from really 
expensive places like Masa, where dinner without wine goes for $75 a pop. 
With wine, it is $95.</p>
<p>But here, something significantly different from Ogonquit is obvious. While all 
these restaurants were glad to have tourists come in and eat with them, they 
were all designed to be an ongoing part of a city where people live and work. 
They were designed to keep folks coming back, time after time.</p>
<p>In both the fairly expensive Basque and the very cheap Thai restaurants, I 
noticed people were recognized and greeted and told about special items that 
the greeter knew they liked.</p>
<p>``We have duck confit today,'' the young woman at the door of Fringale told 
the two matrons who preceded us. They both ordered it. I, on the other 
hand, had a roasted lamb and eggplant sandwich on seven grain bread, which 
was perfect. Delicious roast lamb slices were combined with grilled eggplant 
slices and drizzled with a first-rate olive oil. Anne had crispy lemon chicken 
with garlic mashed potatoes. A chicken leg and thigh had been marinated in 
lemon juice and roasted crisp to serve with the potatoes. Great. Fresh cherry 
clafouti made a fine dessert.</p>
<p>Lulu's restaurant is worth a mention even in the great San Francisco 
restaurant climate. Someone has finally recognized how we, and a lot of other 
folks I know, eat. All food at Lulu's is served ``family style.'' That means each 
person orders what they want and it is brought to the table on a separate 
plate so everyone can share.</p>
<p>And you will want to share the oven roasted whole portobello mushroom, 
which is served with soft polenta, or the butternut squash gnocchi with fresh 
sage. Entrees are things like pork loin flavored with fennel and served with 
mashed potatoes or grilled halibut with leeks and potatoes.</p>
<p>And again, the regulars at Lulu's were obvious. Even I recognized the TV 
anchorman. The couple at the next table called the server by name and knew 
what they wanted without looking at the menu.</p>
<p>In both Ogonquit and San Francisco, a restaurant community is responding to 
its market. And in Knoxville, the same thing is happening. We will be talking 
about that in the weeks to come.</p>

<p>RISK CROWD FOR GREAT PITA BREAD AT FATOOSH </p>
<p>Byline: Walter Lambert </p>
<p>* Restaurant: Fatoosh: A Middle Eastern Restaurant </p>
<p>* Location: 1903 Cumberland Ave. </p>
<p>* Hours: Hours: Noon to 10 p.m. daily </p>
<p>* Phone: 637-0808 </p>
<p>* Other: Handicapped accessible; no smoking section </p>
<p>Today, we are going to have a lesson in the reviewing of restaurants. First, 
we have a question. What does one do if one goes to a restaurant which 
serves very good food, but is very unlikely to be able to handle large numbers 
of patrons? </p>
<p>Should the reviewer decide not to tell others about the restaurant and thus 
deny them the opportunity to give it a try and deny the hard working 
operators of the restaurant the business they clearly deserve? Or should 
readers be told and large numbers go to give it a try and the restaurant is 
overwhelmed, runs out of food, or the service is too slow? </p>
<p>It is a puzzlement. </p>
<p>Well, I have opted to tell you about Fatoosh. </p>
<p>When five of us dropped in on these good folks recently, we found the owner 
and his wife being cook, waiter, bus person, cashier and dishwasher in this 
nice little restaurant on the strip, which will seat about 40 or 50 people. But 
we had a delightful dinner. </p>
<p>Five of us ate heartily of any number of salads, entrees and desserts for a 
total cost of less than $70. </p>
<p>Let's talk about those salads first. You will remember that in Middle Eastern 
food (the owners of Fatoosh are from Syria) there is a custom of starting with 
a whole array of salads and that are sometimes called massa. The best known 
example of this is hummus. </p>
<p>This mixture of chickpeas, sesame seed butter (called tahini), lemon juice and 
various spices is made into a smooth paste, topped with a little good olive oil 
and served with pita bread for scooping. At Fatoosh, the hummus is fairly low 
in spices but still flavorful. </p>
<p>Baba ghannouj is a similar mixture based on roasted eggplant instead of 
chickpeas. It is my absolute favorite of all these and is perfect as served here. 
It is spicy, but not hot. </p>
<p>I suppose that now is as good a time as any to let you know about one of the 
great strengths of Fatoosh. </p>
<p>The pita bread served is freshly-baked and brought straight from the hot oven 
to the table. It is crusty and chewy and good. It is served with the salads, with 
the entrees and made into sandwiches. It is worth a trip on its own. </p>
<p>We also tried the tabbouleh, couscous, grape leaves and falafel. Each of us 
had our own favorite. Each was served with an appropriate green salad or 
flavorful sauce. For example, the fairly simple stuffed grape leaves came with 
a pungent red pepper puree that brought it fully to life. </p>
<p>I mention sandwiches. Any of the above salads are available as stuffing for 
pita bread for a great sandwich. One very bright thing these folks have done 
is allow you to assemble five of the salads with pita bread for a very satisfying 
meal for $7. And in case you are interested, these are all vegetarian dishes. </p>
<p>However, if you are a meat eater, these good folks can take care of you. 
Grilled chicken breast is marinated and then cooked just right. So is beef 
shish kebab. In both cases, the meat is marinated in a lightly spicy mixture 
before cooking and so is tender, flavorful and moist. </p>
<p>Kafta, which is sort of a lamb meatball with onion and parsley, was the 
favorite of our group. All of these are available as a sandwich for $4.50 or on 
a platter with hummus, green salad, rice and that good pita bread for $7. You 
can't lose either way. </p>
<p>Now we did not get to try the Middle Eastern pizza or the Italian pizza or 
even the various vegetable or meat pies. I mean after all, even we have limits. </p>
<p>We did try the baklava and found it good enough. We tried the basboosa (a 
semolina cake with milk and honey), which was even better. Each is $1.25 
per serving. In fairness, I must tell you that we had eaten so much we had to 
take the dessert home with us and have it later, but it was good. </p>
<p>Now it is up to you. Remember, this is a small, family operated restaurant. 
Don't overrun them. And don't miss the baba ghannouj. </p>

<p>Non-smoking section</p>
<p><em>By Walter Lambert</em></p>
<p>This is a new restaurant. But in a way, it is not that new either.</p>
<p>You see, this plain, good little place in a shopping center on Chapman 
Highway (the one with Food Lion) is operated by the folks who operate 
Canton, west, in the shopping center with Books-a-Million.</p>
<p>Through the years we have talked a couple of times about this dependable 
Cantonese restaurant which has Chinese tidbits called dim sum on Saturdays 
and Sundays and good food everyday. Well, they are still at it.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is neither as big or as fancy as Canton. But the food is just as 
good. While Hong Kong does not have the traditional dim sum days when 
trays of the little dumplings are passed from table to table, it does have a 
selection of appetizers on the menu everyday. In addition to the traditional 
egg roll ($1), it has great curry chicken turnovers, ($1.50 for 2), lighty 
curried pieces of chicken in a flaky pastry. </p>
<p>Hong Kong also has pot stickers at $3.60 for 6. If you have not tried pot 
stickers, please do so. Try them pan fried. That way they will be crisp and 
brown on the bottom and steamed on the top. Sprinkle them with a mixture 
of soy sauce and vinegar and you are in for a treat.</p>
<p>But don't think you are limited to these appetizers. Try the stir-fried beef and 
scallops ($7.50), for example. Now please don't tell me that it makes no 
sense to mix stir-fried slices of beef with scallops and vegetables in a wine 
sauce. I know it doesn't sound sensible, but it sure tastes good.</p>
<p>I would also recommend strongly any of the sizzling rice dishes at Hong 
Kong. In these dishes, thin layers of rice are cooked hot and crisp. Meat, 
seafood, vegetables or some combination of these are mixed on a very hot 
plate and poured over the rice. I personally prefer the Hong Kong version 
($8.50), which is a mixture of shrimp, beef, chicken, pork and vegetables.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has a good version of General Tso's chicken ($6.95) that has 
become so popular. It think it is the combination of hot and sweet that has 
caused this dish to catch on so. Or, if you feel up to it, go all the way to 
Kung Pao chicken ($4.95). This, in case you don't know, is the hot one. 
Peppers, we are talking here. Hot, but good.</p>
<p>You might want to temper either of these with beef and pea pods ($5.50). 
This dish is based on the contrast of slices of quick cooked beef in a brown 
sauce, generously intermixed with crunchy snow pea pods. If I have one 
truly favorite Chinese dish, this is it. Or a good middle ground might be 
Mongolian beef. This dish is based on a combination of stir-fried beef and 
chopped scallions mixed with fried pea starch noodles.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is the sort of restaurant you run to from work. It is where you 
can go and get carry-out quickly. It is where you can go all by yourself for 
lunch or dinner. In honor of that, these folks have combination plates for 
both lunch and dinner. </p>
<p>At lunch, it has unbelievable bargains. How about the Mongolian beef we 
were just talking about with soup, egg roll and fried rice for $3.50 at lunch? 
Can you beat that? Let me recommend hot and sour soup as your soup 
choice if you like spicy and wonton soup if you do not.</p>
<p>More than 20 combination plates are also available for dinner with most of 
them costing $5.45. The most expensive is $6.45.</p>
<p>So you folks who live south and long for good solid Chinese food without a 
lot of fanfare, come on down to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>NEW INDIAN RESTAURANT DESTINED FOR SUCCESS </p>
<p>Let's start with some things you know already. </p>
<p>First, my wife, Anne and I like Indian food a lot. Second, we have had 
several tries at an Indian restaurant in Knoxville. Third, none of them have 
been good enough. </p>
<p>Now let me add a fourth. If the Kashmir Indian Restaurant does not succeed, 
it will be our fault not theirs. These folks have created an excellent Indian 
restaurant. </p>
<p>Kashmir is in a rebuilt house just off Cumberland Avenue on 17th Street. Be 
warned, parking is scarce and difficult, but it is worth the effort. </p>
<p>Indian food varies enormously from place to place within the country and 
from one Indian group to another. Many Indians are completely vegetarian, 
and.you can do that easily at Kashmir. At the same time, others enjoy fish, 
chicken and lamb. That is also possible. </p>
<p>Flavors tend to be complex with arrays of spices used to create curries or 
other sauces. </p>
<p>Appetizers are a regular part of an Indian meal. I would suggest that you.try 
either the vegetarian platter ($4.95) or the non-vegetarian platter.($5.25) as 
an introduction to five kinds of these appetizers. Since our group had five 
good eaters in it, we decided to have one of each. We did not find anything 
we did not like. </p>
<p>The vegetable pakoras (vegetables in a chick pea batter) were a 
clear!favorite as was the fish pakoras (strips of fried fish in the same batter). 
You will get a dish of hot onion chutney and a dish of tamarind sauce which 
is!mildly sweet with these appetizers. It is recommended that you mix them. 
Be</p>
<p>warned, the onion chutney is hot. </p>
<p>Perhaps this is as good a time as any to discuss hotness and Indian 
food.+These good folks know they are cooking for Americans. Therefore, 
they will!prepare almost any dish along a scale which ranges from mild to 
really-and- truly hot. The hottest we had any-thing done was medium. That 
was hot enough, thank you very much. </p>
<p>Now let me list entrees quickly. Chicken tandoori ($7.95) is cooked in 
the(traditional tandoor clay oven. It is medium hot, bright red and light and 
flavorful. Tandoori mixed grill ($9.95) is also an excellent way to taste the 
tandoor flavor. It has both chicken and lamb. </p>
<p>! Lamb sagg ($8.25) is an interesting dish with cubes of lamb in a 
spinach(sauce. At medium, it was hot. It also had a dense, very appealing 
flavor. </p>
<p>Lamb mushroom ($8.25) was in a much lighter sauce with more of a spicy 
than+hot flavor. Chicken chili ($8.25) was tender chunks of chicken breast in 
aspicy red sauce with just enough green chilies to give it some interest. </p>
<p>Finally, the biggest surprise of the evening may well have been shabi paneer 
korma ($7.95). This is a vegetarian dish of homemade cheese with 
fresh+ginger, garlic, onion and tomato. The sauce is creamy, rich and 
delicious. </p>
<p>Two pre-arranged Indian dinners are available with one being vegetarian and 
one not. </p>
<p>All dishes are served with good basmati rice, and I would recommend a 
side(order of raita, a yogurt, cucumber and tomato relish which is wonderfully 
cooling to the taste. </p>
<p>Indian breads are an adventure to themselves. </p>
<p>Dessert at Kashmir is traditional. We had kulfi, Indian ice cream filled+with 
nuts, and kheer, a sweet, rich rice pudding. Both are laced with rose water 
and both are excellent. </p>
<p>Kashmir does not take reservations but should. I predict a wait but I predict 
it will be worth it. </p>

<p>KENG'S: IT'S CHINESE -- AND KARAOKE </p>
<p><b><i>Byline: </i></b><i>Walter Lambert</i> </p>
<p>Restaurant: Keng's Garden</p>
<p>Location: 4921 Homberg Drive</p>
<p>Phone: 588-3839</p>
<p>Hours: Monday-Saturday, 10:30 a.m.-10 p.m.</p>
<p>Sunday, 11:30 a.m.-10 p.m.</p>
<p>Other: Non-smoking section; handicapped accessible</p>
<p>You know that I liked Merlot's a lot. You also know it is gone. We grieve. </p>
<p>Now, we do not grieve quite as much as we did before. Because in this 
space in Homberg place you will find Keng's garden. These good folks, who 
are new to Knoxville, have done a minimum job of redecorating (after all, it 
was a pretty space before), but have put their distinctive stamp on the place. 
It is simple and nice. And the tank of fresh lobsters out front lets you know 
that this is no ordinary Chinese restaurant.</p>
<p>The food at Keng's Garden is basically Cantonese. However, the menu has a 
number of Hunan and Szechuan dishes scattered through it. And we found all 
to be tasty, and some to be more tasty than others.</p>
<p>Our brave little group was in such a good mood that we could not decide if 
we wanted steamed dumplings or fried dumplings. We did the only sensible 
thing. We had an order of each. As you know, these are basically the same 
meat filled dumplings, but the method of cooking is different. The steamed 
dumplings are steamed. However, the fried dumplings are fried on the bottom 
and steamed on the top. Sometimes they are called pot stickers. I call them 
good. You get eight for $4.25.</p>
<p>We then shared four dishes which were very different from each other and all 
good in their own right. I have decided to move from those I liked least to 
those I liked most. It really is not a long trip, but it has some nice stops along 
the way. Seafood war bar ($12.95) is a mix of lobster, crab, shrimp and 
scallops with lots of vegetables in a light sauce. It is relatively bland and 
depends on the flavor of the seafood. It is served on a hot platter and has lots 
of sizzle.</p>
<p>Next we had Hunan triple ($7.95). Thin slices of beef, pork and chicken 
were mixed with fresh vegetables in a sauce that was pure Hunan. This 
cuisine of China is not as well known as Szechuan, but ought to be at least as 
popular with American diners. Hunan sauces are warm, not hot. Peppers are 
used in brown sauces, but they are used in moderation. My tender tongued 
wife, Anne, even found this lightly peppered dish to her taste.</p>
<p>Ranking next was chicken with orange flavor ($7.95). I have long favored 
beef with orange flavor (which is available), but I am not at all sure that I do 
not prefer chicken. This dish is cubes of chicken that have been lightly fried 
and then covered with a rich, brown sauce which has just a trace of orange 
flavor to it. You can actually taste the chicken and the orange. It was exactly 
right. Serving it with bright green steamed broccoli improved both the look 
and the taste of the dish.</p>
<p>Finally, we had a dish that was a special and not on the regular menu. And 
my friends, it was special. </p>
<p>Tender shrimp are coated in the lightest possible batter and fried until just 
barely brown. They are piled on some of that good broccoli we were talking 
about. A sweet, tart mayonnaise-like dressing is then drizzled over the shrimp 
and the whole thing is generously sprinkled with crisp walnuts, which are 
enrobed in a sweet coating. It is called shrimp with walnuts &Ntilde; a far too 
ordinary name for such an extraordinary dish.</p>
<p>This is a Chinese restaurant. For dessert you will get some fruit and a fortune 
cookie. By that time, you will have eaten so much you will not care anyway.</p>
<p>A last word about Keng's Garden. At 10 p.m. Friday, Saturday and Sunday, 
this quiet, sedate Chinese retaurant turns into a karake bar with the biggest 
speakers and TV screen you have seen for a while. If you are ready to show 
your ... talent, come on down.</p>

<p>KIGER'S MENU OFFERS SOLID CHOICES, FINELY PREPARED </p>
<p><b><i>Byline: </i></b><i>Walter Lambert</i> </p>
<p>Restaurant: Kiger's at Willow Point</p>
<p>Location: Highway 33</p>
<p>Hours: 11 am. to 10 p.m. Tuesday - Thursday; 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday 
and Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday. Closed Mondays.</p>
<p>Phone: 579-0020 </p>
<p>Other: Handicapped accessible (but parking lot is not paved). Non-smoking 
section</p>
<p>First let me tell you a little about how to find this place and what it is like. 
Then we can talk about food.</p>
<p>Kiger's is a little restaurant overlooking a marina on Old Maryville Highway. 
The easy way to get there is go out Alcoa Highway to John Sevier Highway. 
Turn onto John Sevier and go to the intersection with Highway 33. Turn right 
on Highway 33 and go about one mile. Be careful, this pretty little place is 
behind a hill and is easy to miss. If you cross the lake and see a marina on 
your right, you have gone too far.</p>
<p>The restaurant has seats for only about 30 people inside. However, it has two 
beautiful decks overlooking the water which seat at least as many people and 
maybe more. While it is small, it is newly redecorated, clean, neat and nice.</p>
<p>I do strongly recommend reservations, because of the size and because its 
fame is spreading rapidly. Each time we go, it is more crowded.</p>
<p>While it is very pretty, that is not what is attracting the crowds. The food is 
doing that. You will not find a whole lot at Kiger's which is new wave or 
going with the latest fad. What you will find is a wide array of good, solid 
choices that allow you to have as large or as small a meal as you want. You 
will further find everything is done nicely.</p>
<p>The appetizers are not listed on the menu, but are tucked away inside a 
napkin marked &Ocirc;&Ocirc;Do not open.'' This is an idea which is so cute I almost 
left. I am glad I didn't. If I had, I would have missed having a fried dill pickle 
($3.95). Yep, a big dill pickle, cut into spears, coated in a beer batter and 
deep fried. It is served with mustard sauce. I hate to be the one to tell you it is 
very good. Be prepared to share. It is a lot of fried pickle.</p>
<p>Hot wings are hot. We got medium and they were plenty hot, even for me. 
An order of 10 with celery and blue cheese dressing is $3.95. </p>
<p>At this point you face a major challenge. You can go with sandwiches, if you 
wish. There is an array of hamburgers ($5.95) with all sorts of toppings, 
grilled ham and cheese ($4.95) and even meatloaf ($4.95). All these 
sandwiches come with the choice of one side item and we need to talk more 
about those later.</p>
<p>The only sandwich I have had at Kiger's came from the children's menu. On a 
recent visit, I decided I wanted a bowl of soup (good tomato tortellini soup) 
and a pimento cheese sandwich. Fine pimento cheese on home baked bread, 
I thought it was a pretty good choice.</p>
<p>You do not need to be limited to sandwiches. Have the chicken marsala 
($12.95). A double chicken breast is sauteed and served with a light, delicate 
marsala wine sauce with some walnuts thrown in. It may have been the nicest 
marsla sauce I have had.</p>
<p>Try Angus mushroom meatloaf ($10.95) if you share my meatloaf obsession. 
Grilled salmon was fresh, moist and good.</p>
<p>All these entrees, served after 5 p.m., come with a house salad (I strongly 
recommend the Parmesan peppercorn dressing) and two side items.</p>
<p>I personally like the fattening side items like broccoli cheese casserole or 
cheddar cheese mashed potatoes. However, if you insist on it, you can get 
steamed veggies and fresh fruit. For $4.95 you can get three of the side items, 
which would make a great lunch.</p>
<p>Finally we come to dessert. Kiger's caramel overload ($3.95) is just what its 
name implies. A caramel-walnut brownie is topped with butter pecan ice 
cream and hot caramel sauce. The seven-layer bar ($2.95) is a smaller 
serving, but equally rich coconut, chocolate, nuts and assorted other good 
things. A little chocolate sauce on top is how they gild this lily.</p>
<p>Kiger's is pretty and has good food. How do you beat that combination?</p>

<p>KING TUT BRINGS EGYPT TO VESTAL </p>
<p><b><i>Byline: </i></b><i>Walter Lambert</i> </p>
<p>Restaurant: King Tut Grill</p>
<p>Location: 4132 Martin Mill Pike</p>
<p>Hours: Monday-Saturday, 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Phone: 573-6021 </p>
<p>Other: Handicapped accessible (but getting in and out may be complicated; 
No smoking</p>
<p>Well, I promised you, so here goes. I promised you a touch of Egypt in 
Vestal and I deliver.</p>
<p>King Tut Grill is located on Martin Mill Pike in the heart of downtown Vestal. 
It is at the intersection of Martin Mill Pike and Old Maryville Pike. Look 
quickly or you will miss it. </p>
<p>When I first went to King Tut, at the suggestion of one of my University of 
Tennessee colleagues, I found it to be a struggling family owned operation 
that needed considerable improvement. Over the intervening time, I have 
been back a couple of times and each time, I found new improvements and 
the same interesting food. Now we put King Tut to the ultimate test; we have 
been to candlelight night, and I am ready to tell you about it.</p>
<p>First, please note. This place is small (or even tiny). It is a long counter, a few 
tables and a row of booths.</p>
<p>It serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, six days a week. And all the work is 
done by Mo Girgis, his wife, Seham, and his daughter, Christina. It is truly a 
mom and pop operation. They will tell you in no uncertain terms that they do 
not use canned or boxed mixes. They do not like to fry anything. But do they 
have some good stuff.</p>
<p>First, at lunch you can get a sandwich or a meat and three. You know things 
from Southern Egypt like grilled ham, pinto beans and real mashed potatoes. 
But you can also get a falafel in a pita ($2.95) and whatever you do and 
whenever you go, do not fail to have an Egyptian salad (99 cents). The 
Egyptian salad is a mixture of tomatoes, cucumber, and other fresh vegetables 
with one of the best dressings I have ever had. It is vinegar and oil with an 
herb mixture which includes cardamom. Who knows what else, but it is good.</p>
<p>If you like you can also have hummus with pita bread or baba ghannouj 
(either is $1.75). These very traditional Middle Eastern dishes are delicately 
flavored at King Tut and make a nice introduction to almost anything.</p>
<p>Now let's talk a little about dinner.</p>
<p>Mo and his crew are into theme dinners and you will find a different one 
every night. I personally think this is a really neat idea. It allows these folks to 
keep the menu small enough they can do it in a kitchen about the size of a 
good sized postage stamp and still have some variety.</p>
<p>Monday is pasta, Tuesday is grill night, Wednesday is Egyptian Night, 
Thursday is chicken night, Friday is seafood and Saturday is the candlelight 
dinner for all you romantics.</p>
<p>We went on Saturday and reservations are a good idea. We went with table 
cloths on the Formica and candles and roses for the ladies. But I should warn 
you that these good folks took unfair advantage of us. They baked 
homemade rolls. We drove up, opened our car door and were overwhelmed 
with the smell of fresh baking yeast rolls. Unfair. And in case you are 
interested, they tasted as good as they smelled. Seham is the maker of these 
delights.</p>
<p>Several straightforward appetizers are offered, but had the aforementioned 
Middle Eastern favorites. We followed this with Egyptian salad. My wife, 
Anne, talked me out of having another salad for an entree. We had chicken. 
Anne had the special which was teriyaki chicken breast ($6.95) and I had 
chicken in buttermilk sauce ($5.95). They both were excellent. I personally 
liked mine best. The buttermilk sauce turned out to be like a tangy gravy and 
I liked it a lot. I sopped up the sauce with one of those good rolls. (In case 
you do not know, ``sopped'' is not an Egyptian word). The meal was served 
with broccoli and twice baked potato and was a real bargain.</p>
<p>Desserts vary at King Tut but are worth your while. Try some Jack Daniel 
Pie or something called a baboosa. Trust me, you will like it. </p>

<p>Handicapped accessible</p>
<p>Back some months, or years maybe, I told you about something called The 
Fountain Room at Litton's Restaurant in Fountain City. You remember it 
was a restaurant within a restaurant. </p>
<p>Well, without my paying sufficient attention, this good little place underwent 
a transformation. First, it got a new chef. You remember Steve Puleo, who 
used to be at a restaurant far down West. Well, he has moved up North and 
in conjunction with the good Litton folks has kept everything good about 
The Fountain Room as it was converted into the Back Room. </p>
<p>Now what do I mean about keeping the good? </p>
<p>Well, all the bread is still home baked and is wonderful. All the desserts have 
that great Litton's touch. It still has top quality meats cooked in a top quality 
way. That sort of stuff has been kept. Well, you may ask, what does that 
leave to change? </p>
<p>Changes start with the appetizers. They have added a great portabello 
mushroom appetizer ($5.95). A great big mushroom is cooked delicately, 
put into a rich soy sauce based sauce and served in all its glory. Or you 
might want to try the crab cake ($5.50) as an appetizer. It is crisp, tender, 
moist and sweet. It is just spicy enough to keep your attention, but simple 
enough to let you taste the crab meat. </p>
<p>The next big change is a whole line of pastas. They range from linguine with 
marinara sauce, fresh basil and Parmesan cheese for $8.95 to sea scallops 
on linguine with herbs, wine and mushrooms for $14.95. </p>
<p>On a recent visit, I chose the pasta special for the day. Think about this for a 
minute. Take a mound of penne pasta and top it with a mixture of andouille 
sausage, Cajun chicken, shiitake mushrooms, leeks and tomatoes. Spice that 
sauce up a little for good measure. Then charge only $12.95 for a massive 
portion and you have got something going. </p>
<p>The rest of my party, good folks but set in their ways, stuck with more 
traditional choices. One had a grilled pork chop ($12.95) which must have 
weighed nearly a pound. It was huge. That, however, is not what made this 
dish special. It was an orange marmalade glaze that was so good and so 
sweet and so salty that none of us would have recognized it without help. </p>
<p>Another member of the party went with fried cold water oysters ($14.95). I 
am not generally given to ordering fried oysters. I think it is very risky to take 
these great delicacies and coat them in a lot of bread and fry them. Too 
often you lose the oyster completely in this process. This is not the case at 
the Back Room. The fried oysters were crisp outside, lightly breaded, and 
tender and juicy inside. </p>
<p>Finally, we arrive at what was the high point of a dinner with lots of high 
points. One of the offerings was a seafood plate ($27.95 on this night, but 
the price varies with what is on the plate). It included fresh sea scallops, big, 
broiled shrimp and the best piece of halibut I have eaten in a long time. It 
had been roasted with a lightly spicy glaze and was excellent. </p>
<p>I don't need to tell you about dessert at Litton's, do I? The best cheesecake 
in town. White chocolate bread pudding? Brownies in flavors which I didn't 
know existed? Well, they have it all. It changes daily, but at Litton's whether 
front room or back, dessert only comes in good and better. </p>
<p>Take my word for it and come on back. By the way, reservations are a 
good idea for the Back Room. </p>

<p>MATTIODA'S GIVES YOU A LITTLE OF A LOT </p>
<p><b><i>Byline: </i></b><i>Walter Lambert</i> </p>
<p>Restaurant: Mattioda's, Mediterranean Fine Dining</p>
<p>Location: 138 West End Ave., Farragut</p>
<p>Phone: 675-4787</p>
<p>Hours: Lunch, Tuesday-Saturday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Sunday brunch, 11 a.m. 
to 2 p.m.; dinner, Tuesday-Thursday, 5 to 10 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 5 
to 10:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Other: Handicapped accissible; non-smoking section</p>
<p>I am not sure just what I expected at Mattioda's. Whatever it was, it was not 
what I got. What I got was more sophisticated, tastier and better than I could 
have hoped.</p>
<p>This restaurant is in the big shopping center at Farragut at West End Avenue. </p>
<p>Now with these folks talking about Mediterranean, you may expect Italian. It 
is not. Or Greek. Wrong again. Or Middle Eastern. Nope. </p>
<p>But in fairness, I must tell you that you will get a little of each. Let me 
illustrate. </p>
<p>One member of our party ordered fattoush ($4.25). Fattoush is a Lebanese 
salad of tomatoes, cucumber and onions with a light herb dressing which is 
then tossed with pieces of toasted pita bread. But at Mattioda's, fattoush is 
the usual salad. It is placed in the center of triangles of bread that turns the 
whole plate into a star. And that sort of sterling presentation was a part of 
every dish.</p>
<p>Roasted portabella mushrooms ($5.95) had a nice, big roasted portabella 
sliced into quarters and served on a roasted bell pepper beurre blanc, which 
brought both color and richness to the dish. It was completed with diamonds 
of crisp fried polenta.</p>
<p>Fairly plain and very tasty oyster fritters ($6.50) were served on a plate 
which had a swirl of olive oil and cilantro-garlic sauce. In every case 
throughout this meal, the dish was as pretty as it was good.</p>
<p>Our group tried three entrees. The first was a special in which halibut and 
salmon had been intertwined and roasted with a light herb sauce. The two 
flavors intertwined as nicely as the two colors of the fish did. Served arranged 
on fresh asparagus and a bed of rice, it was terrific.</p>
<p>Perhaps the dish that best exemplified this restaurant was lemon chicken 
($11.95). Pieces of roasted chicken that had been seasoned with lemon and 
a light herb sauce were wrapped in phyllo dough and baked just right. The 
dough gave it a nice crisp outside, while keeping the chicken moist and tender 
in its second cooking.</p>
<p>Again, presentation was important. The chicken roll was served on a bed of 
couscous with a mixture of fresh vegetables that had been cut into matchstick 
strips and lightly sauteed.</p>
<p>I must tell you that I had great difficulty deciding on an entree. They have both 
soft-shell crabs and rack of lamb. It is not fair. I chose lamb ($18.95). It was 
a wonderful choice. Beautiful Australian lamb chops were coated with a 
rosemary mustard sauce and grilled to taste. I ordered pink. I got pink. They 
were then placed on a generous serving of roasted vegetables and a white 
bean ragout. Then just to gild the lily, a beautiful dollop of red onion 
marmalade topped off the dish.</p>
<p>Dessert at Mattioda's is a further treat. We tried three. If these three are 
typical, you can't go wrong. First, we had chocolate sorbet. We then tried 
one of those chocolate, chocolate things that are all the rage. It was super 
rich, super dark chocolate on a raspberry puree. If you are into those kinds 
of things, it was great. But far better to my taste was ginger walnut tart. A 
thin, rich tart shell was filled with finely chopped walnuts with just the right 
snap of ginger. Good stuff.</p>
<p>Mattioda's is destined to be a favorite with us, and I have a strong feeling that 
it will be with you as well.</p>

<p>Restaurant: The Park Grill </p>

<p>REVIEW </p>
<p>DON'T MISS PARK GRILL THIS FALL </p>
<p>Well, it is that time again. The time when I start thinking about going to 
Gatlinburg. </p>
<p>I know, I know. I am not supposed to say that. I am supposed to say that I 
love to go to Gatlinburg every day, all year, all the time. but I believe that it is 
my patriotic duty to stay out of the way in the summertime and let all those 
tourists from around the world come to Gatlinburg. </p>
<p>Then in the fall and winter, having waited my turn, I go to Gatlinburg. </p>
<p>I wanted to tell you about the new Park Grill so you could go in 
Septemberbefore the October crowd arrives or wait until November when 
they have all gone home. Either way, you will not want to miss the Grill. </p>
<p>Let me hasten to add there is absolutely nothing fancy about The Park Grill. 
Not the place, or the food, or the people. What it is, is a place that knows 
exactly what it wants to be and then goes about being that. </p>
<p>First, The Park Grill looks exactly right to be in Gatlinburg. From the street, it 
looks vaguely interesting. But when you walk into the soaring space inside the 
place with all those big logs reaching up, you know it feels right. </p>
<p>By the way, do not expect me to say much about the decision to dress the 
servers in park rangerlike costumes. After all, nobody is perfect. </p>
<p>And then the food. Again, nothing fancy. Just generous servings of 
good(food. We started with grilled brie ($7.95), which was brie which had 
beengrilled. What made it really nice was the sweet-sharp onion and 
strawberry relish served with it. Chicken quesadillas ($4.95) were a pleasant 
version of this seemingly universal dish with an unexpectedly good salsa. </p>
<p>All entrees at the grill come with a choice of salads. Our group tried two 
varieties and liked both of them. The traditional Caesar (which was only 
semi-.traditional) was my clear favorite. It really had romaine lettuce and a 
real tasting dressing. The California fields salad was all those little tiny leaves 
we get these days with some spouts to make it look even more interesting. 
Basil vinaigrette dressing was perfect with these greens. </p>
<p>Our party was in a beef eating mood and so I can't tell you about 
much!except beef. We tried the prime rib ($18.95 for the big regular cut), a 
New York strip steak ($18.95), and a filet mignon ($18.95). All were high 
qualitybeef which had been cooked just as ordered. The seasoning on the 
prime rib enlivened what can be a fairly bland cut of meat. </p>
<p>The most interesting entree of the evening (ordered by me, of course) was the 
pan fried Cherokee trout ($15.95). I like trout. But beyond that, I feel some 
obligation to eat it when I eat in Gatlinburg. What could be more Gatlinburg 
than trout. </p>
<p>They fillet the trout, coat it with a very light flour batter and saute it until it is 
just done. It is then served with a lemon, butter and caper sauce, which brings 
out the delicate flavor of the fish. I like it. </p>
<p>Before we get to the good stuff, let me urge you to get whatever flavor of 
mashed potatoes they have on any given day. And do eat a lot of bread. It is 
good for you. </p>
<p>With all this, exercise some care, because while The Park Grill does 
everything well, they do desserts spectacularly. Wild berry cobbler ($4.95) is 
about a tub full of sweet, crumb topped cobbler made of strawberries, 
blackberries and blueberries all at the same time. They warm it and put great 
vanilla ice cream on top. </p>
<p>Tennessee mud stack ($5.50) is twin towers of sin. Brownies, two flavors 
of.ice cream and a couple of good sauces combine for something 
approaching(perfection. And then there is Jack Daniels Bread Pudding 
($4.95). You can guess what it has in it. </p>
<p>The Park Grill is a place to take the whole family, relax, and eat to your 
heart's content. But don't say I didn't warn you about the desserts. </p>

<p>REVIEW </p>
<p>Places to eat during Olympics -- or maybe when it's over</p>
<p>Are you heading down I-75 to the Olympics this summer? Do you plan to 
go to Atlanta and back without eating? I should think not.</p>
<p>I will tell you the truth as I see it. Long before Atlanta ever dreamed of 
welcoming the Olympics with folks from countries big and small, it was 
already becoming a world class restaurant town.</p>
<p>In the days when Knoxville was a two restaurant town, my wife, Anne, and I 
would often drive to Atlanta for the weekend with the sole purpose of 
finding something different to eat. And we ate in big and small restaurants, 
famous and not. You can still do that.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions:</p>
<p>For the non-adventurous, go to one of Atlanta's best known restaurants, The 
Varsity, 61 North Ave. </p>
<p>Billed as the world's largest drive-in 40 years ago, the Varsity still makes 
that claim. Only now they make it on the internet. These good folks claim to 
serve two miles of hot dogs, a ton and a half of French fries and 5,000 fried 
pies every day. Who am I to question this? But I guess if you had a stainless 
steel counter 150 feet long always crowded with diners, you might pull this 
off, too. If you want drive-in fare straight out of the 1960s, then head for the 
Varsity.</p>
<p>One word of warning: It is right on the edge of the Olympic Village, and you 
may have to work your way through a phalanx of weight lifters to find the 
spot.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum is Panos and Pauls, 1232 W. Paces Ferry 
Road. This beautiful, elegant, over-decorated restaurant is in a 
run-of-the-mill strip shopping center just off the interstate. The only 
indication of what you will find here is a very reserved sign next to a very 
reserved awning. But inside you will be pampered, stuffed and turned out 
into the night.</p>
<p>The signature dish is fried (yes, fried) lobster. But there are a hundred other 
choices with just a touch of Mediterranean flavor. This place costs a fortune 
but is worth every dollar of it.</p>
<p>The people who own Panos and Pauls own half a dozen restaurants 
throughout the Buckhead section of Atlanta. If they run them, they will be 
good. Atlanta Fish Market, 265 Pharr Road, is one such place. The newest 
is a southwestern place called Nava, 3060 Peachtree Rd. I haven't had the 
opportunity to eat there yet, but Lewis Cosby tells me it is excellent and I 
generally trust his judgment.</p>
<p>Another group of restaurants uniformly dependable is the Peasant Chain. It 
started with the Pleasant Peasant at 555 Peachtree St., near the Fox 
Theater. Try either the original, which is very small, or its big, fancy sister, 
Peasant Uptown, 3500 Peachtree Road, in Phipps Plaza.</p>
<p>The newest addition to this family is the Mick's chain. I keep hearing Mick's 
may be moving into Knoxville, but I am still waiting. When you go to Mick's, 
try the fried green tomato appetizers. Or any of the pastas. My favorite is the 
chicken penne pasta, but that is open to considerable discussion.</p>
<p>Mick's is casual, informal and good. There are several scattered around 
Atlanta, but the original, which is next door to the original Pleasant Peasant, 
is as good a choice as any. The one in Buckhead bills itself as Mick's 
Buckhead Gourmet, 3115 Piedmont Road.</p>
<p>Another of our favorites in Atlanta is Dailey's, 17 International Blvd., N.E. 
(downtown). You have to climb a long, long flight of steps to get there, but 
that way you are ready to go for it at one of the most tempting, 
overwhelming dessert bars in creation. The other food is good, too.</p>
<p>And in Atlanta, there is always something new to look forward to. Someone 
told us about a place called Cafe Tu Tu Tango, 220 Pharr Road. It only 
serves appetizers. And you can try several in a single sitting.</p>
<p>Or you can stand in line at the Cheesecake Factory, 3024 Peachtree Road, 
or have tea at The Ritz Carlton Buckhead, 3434 Peachtree Road.</p>
<p>World class to welcome the world. That's Atlanta.</p>

<p>REVIEW </p>
<p>ROMANO'S MAKES GOOD PIZZAS AND MORE &amp;</p>
<p>Do you remember last August we went off to Tellico Harbor to eat at the 
Captain's Table? Remember Frank Romano and his good Italian food? </p>
<p>Well, guess what? He has opened a place appropriately enough called 
Romano's, where you can get the same good food all the time. </p>
<p>Now you probably want to know why I didn't let you know about this 
sooner. I have no excuse. </p>
<p>But here is the word. </p>
<p>Go down Highway 411 beyond Greenback but not yet to Vonore. There on 
the right you will see a neat little place with a neat big sign welcoming you to</p>
<p>Romano's. </p>
<p>If you are to enjoy this place to its fullest, you will need to be voracious and 
discerning. </p>
<p>Voracious to eat the big portions they will bring you and discerning to know 
what to order next. </p>
<p>Again, as with the Captain's Table, you will need to not be worried about 
how fancy the place is. It is plain. It is good. </p>
<p>When we ate with Frank before, we bragged appropriately about chicken 
brasciola ($9.95). It is still wonderful. </p>
<p>Good chicken pounded thin and rolled with cheese, ham, herbs and assorted 
other good things. </p>
<p>It is then sliced, fried and served with the good homemade red sauce which is 
one of Frank's specialties. I recommend you do not miss it. However, shrimp 
marinara ($9.95) or shrimp scampi ($9.95) will never be a mistake. </p>
<p>You will also remember we loved spaghetti with white clam sauce ($7.95) 
but this time, we tried meat sauce ($7.95) and found it just right. </p>
<p>Frank serves all these good things with salad and side dishes and garlic bread 
which you can smell before you get inside. Altogether it is a treat for the 
gourmands among us. </p>
<p>Despite all these good things which we like a lot, we must most forcefully 
&amp;call your attention to what we decided (that we, by the way, is four adults, 
one 10-year-old and one 1-year-old) was the best part of the meal. </p>
<p>Frank Romano makes pizza. </p>
<p>He makes his own crust. He makes his own sauce. He spreads the 
homemade!sauce on the homemade dough adds other toppings and bakes it 
crisp and hot. </p>
<p>If you feel as I do that good pizza is a rare and wonderful treat, head ondown 
Highway 411. A large pizza is $9.95 with each added topping costing $1.25. 
He has all those toppings we all like including hot peppers. </p>
<p>We ordered a large pepperoni pizza for an appetizer but it was far too much</p>
<p>for that. </p>
<p>Frank has fine, rich, flavorful spumoni which is excellent after so heavy a 
meal. He has homemade cannoli with a rich cream cheese filling which is also 
very nice. </p>
<p>For those of you who still like to get around in your boat, Frank will be back 
at the Captain's Table at the Tellico Harbor Marina about the end of May. </p>
<p>Did I mention he has a children's menu? Though I believe with that good 
pizza, you won't need to worry about what your kids will eat. </p>
<p>This is not a big place, so you may want to call about reservations. But I have 
no reservations at all in recommending it to you. </p>

<p>SARGE'S IS BARBECUE FOR ALL SEASONS </p>
<p>I fully realize barbecue is a very personal thing. I used to judge 
barbecue!cook offs until I made the mistake of joking about someone's 
sauce. After a(while I stopped having the body guards, but I still look over 
my shoulder occasionally. </p>
<p>Now for all you North Carolina, or Memphis, or Arkansas, or wherever 
purists, I don't know how you are going to feel about Sarge's barbecue. It is 
different. For your information, Sarge Jackson is a former army sergeant and 
a former police sergeant, and he and his family operate this nice little place. 
But back to that different barbecue. </p>
<p>Sarge tells me that his barbecue is Virgin Islands-style. I have never been to 
the Virgin Islands and probably will not go, but if they cook like Sarge, it 
might be worth the trip. </p>
<p>Let's get down to cases. Sarge does pork, beef and chicken. It is done with a 
good juicy, smoky flavor in the meat itself. It is then served with a dark, 
slightly sweet sauce, which is heavy with the flavor of cloves. With pork, I 
found it to be one of the best tastes I have experienced in a long time. Ribs 
cooked with this sauce fall apart in your hand and melt in your mouth. Beef 
is!also very good. I personally do not like beef barbecue as well as pork, but 
this was a close second. </p>
<p>Chicken is interesting, and I will let you decide for yourself how you feel 
about it. I found the pulled chicken sandwich with a little coleslaw on it to.be 
absolutely perfect. My wife, Anne, claimed the sauce overpowered the 
chicken a little. </p>
<p>You have lots of choices about how to try this barbecue. What I 
wouldsuggest is that you start with one of Sarge's samplers. He does two. 
The regular has a quarter of a chicken, three or four ribs and three large 
slices!of pork shoulder. You get a small order of any two of beans, slaw or 
potato(salad. It is $8.99, and we have shared one of these for lunch a couple 
of times. </p>
<p>If you want to go whole hog, go for the deluxe sampler which is twice 
as+much of everything for $16.49. It is plenty for three and enough for four. </p>
<p>Sarge will also sell you any of these choices in bulk for you to eat at home. A 
whole chicken is $6.99. Pulled barbecue is $6.49 a pound for the meat.(You 
can get a sliced shoulder dinner for $6.99 or a half side of ribs for $8.99 or... 
well, you get the idea. </p>
<p>Every once in a while, Sarge does Jamaican-style barbecue. I have not had!it. 
I have talked to someone who has. He tells me if you like hot, you will+love 
this. Sarge did tell me he uses Scotch Bonnet peppers in it, and they just 
happen to be the hottest in the world. </p>
<p>Two other things at Sarge's are worth knowing about. </p>
<p>The first is especially appropriate as we approach winter. Sarge 
has(homemade hot tamales. He also has homemade chili. If you talk to him 
just right, he will put one of those hot tamales in a bowl and pour that chili 
over(it. Heaven. If you don't happen to be some sort of Texas purist, that 
is.(These are hot tamales and chili like my mama makes, and that makes it the 
right kind. </p>
<p>Sarge is also the purveyor of the pig burger ($1.69). In case you do not 
know, the pig burger is a seasoned pork hamburger which is smothered in 
onions and served on plain old white bread. </p>
<p>Now let me mention one last way to enjoy Sarge's good barbecue. Before 
-+every home football game, Sarge and his family set up on Stadium Drive 
and sell until they sellout. Watch for them. </p>
<p>And besides all that, they have homemade pies for dessert. </p>

<p>Restaurant: The Shrimp Shack </p>
<p>Location: 8027 Kingston Pike </p>
<p>Phone: 539-1700 </p>
<p>Hours: 4 to 7 p.m. Monday through Thursday; 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Friday 
and Saturday; 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday. </p>
<p>Other: Handicapped accessible; non-smoking section. </p>
<p>CORRECTION from November 4, 1995: Hours for The Shrimp Shack, 
8027 Kingston(Pike, are 4-9 p.m. Monday through Thursday; 11 a.m. to 10 
p.m. Friday and!Saturday; 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday. The hours were 
incorrect in a review in Thursday's News-Sentinel. </p>
<p>PACK UP KIDS AND HEAD FOR THE SHRIMP SHACK </p>
<p>Some time back, I wrote about Altruda's. I noted it had good Italian food 
and was a place where you could take the kids. Lots of you told me you 
appreciated hearing about a place like that. </p>
<p>Well, I have another for you. ( </p>
<p>We had tried Shrimp Shack when it first opened. It was barely all right. 
Several of the shrimp dishes left lots to be desired and if you wanted anything 
except fried fish you were in trouble. </p>
<p>These good folks apparently agreed. When we stumbled in there on a 
recent!Sunday afternoon, with 20-month-old granddaughter, we found a 
friendly, fun sort of place with a whole selection of seafood choices which 
were very good. </p>
<p>Our little group started off by sharing a serving of baked oysters ($6.95). We 
had not planned to share, but when they got to the table they looked 
good+enough that everyone wanted a taste. The bacon, garlic topping made 
them a nice choice. </p>
<p>We then got down to business. I want to call your attention to something. 
Although Shrimp Shack has an extensive listing of fried fish, shrimp,(alligator 
and who knows what all else, we did not eat any of it and had a!great meal. 
Now, do not misunderstand me. I love fried seafood of all kinds and what I 
have tasted here is good. </p>
<p>My point is you have a whole range of healthy choices. </p>
<p>One member of our party had blackened grouper ($11.95), which was great. 
In fact, it was the way blackened fish ought to be. It had a crisp, spicy crust 
and was tender and sweet inside. I should also note it is available at lunch for 
$6.95. If you are not into blackening, the staff will grill this fish or</p>
<p>fry it, if that is what you want. </p>
<p>My wife, Anne, and I, in our usual conservative way, decided to 
split!something called The Shack's favorite trio ($14.95). It consists of grilled 
shrimp, scallops and grouper. </p>
<p>In every case, it was quality seafood that had been grilled just right. In fact, I 
could have eaten all of the generous portion, but I had already agreed to 
share, and I didn't know any way out of it. </p>
<p>With both of these entrees, you can choose from an array of side dishes. I 
would especially recommend the boiled corn (which actually tasted like corn) 
and the coleslaw. For an extra $1.50, they will serve you a baked potato with 
a little of everything on it, but personally, I think that would be overdoing it a 
little. </p>
<p>In addition to all these good things, there is a considerable selection of!salads 
and several pasta dishes. The lunch menu (remember, lunch on Friday, 
Saturday and Sunday only) also looks very good. I am especially enticed by 
the!list of New Orleans style &quot;po boy&quot; sandwiches. In fact, one of these with 
some clam chowder would be all right. </p>
<p>&amp; You probably want to know about dessert. They have it. It varies from 
day+to day. We have tasted only one, Key lime pie, and it tasted like Key 
lime+pie. I should know since I have picked Key limes directly off the Key 
lime tree. </p>
<p>Pack up the kids. (Ours enjoyed her coloring menu.) Go to Shrimp Shack. 
Eat. Enjoy. </p>

<p>FOOD PART OF THE FUN ON CRUISE OF RIVERBOAT </p>
<p>Well, we finally did it. I mean for years, yes, years, people have asked me 
why we never went for a ride on the riverboat. </p>
<p>Thank goodness most folks had forgotten that early in my stint with 
this+column we had gone on a previous incarnation of the riverboat. It had 
been bad. In its best aspect, it never rose to mediocre. The truth is I didn't go 
because I thought it would be deja vu. Wrong. We had a good time. We ate, 
we talked, we laughed, we looked at the scenery, we looked at the water, 
we took pictures, we had a good time..</p>
<p>Now for some details. Would I recommend that you go on the Star of 
Knoxville just for the food? Actually, no I would not. </p>
<p>But when we went on a recent beautiful Sunday afternoon, the food 
was!pretty good. It was well prepared, well organized and generous. The 
service was thoughtful and attentive, and everyone who worked on the boat 
seemed ready to help you have a good time. </p>
<p>Food now on the riverboat is a buffet, whether you go for lunch or 
dinner.!When we went for dinner, we had a good salad with a mixture of 
good greens, lots of sprouts and an assortment of dressings. We had baked 
chicken breasts,beef tips in a mushroom sauce, rice and an assortment of 
vegetables. The chicken was the best of the lot and I had two pieces. </p>
<p>Oh, I forgot the rolls. They were commercial and they were good. I ask you: 
What is there to not like in this? </p>
<p>Dessert was your choice of two kinds of cheesecake. We tried both and we 
liked both. Full bar service is available. </p>
<p>The entire trip takes two hours. Dinner is served immediately after leaving the 
dock which gives you considerable time to listen to the delightful singer (or at 
least it was a delightful singer the night we were there) or to wander around 
the deck. We did some of both. I should tell you that our party consisted of 
four adults and one of our beautiful and brilliant granddaughters!who happens 
to be about 15 months old. She loved it. She wanted to stand by!the rail at 
the front and watch the water go by. And we think she liked the beef because 
she kept banging her spoon against the table and saying &quot;meat.&quot; But that was 
just a guess on our part. </p>
<p>Dinner Sunday through Thursday is $22.95 for adults and $11.95 
for!children. On Fridays and Saturdays, the buffet is somewhat enhanced and 
the tab is $29.95 for adults. </p>
<p>The luncheon cruise each day is $17.95 for adults and $10.95 for children. 
All these prices include the buffet, drink and dessert. </p>
<p>If you just want to go cruising down the river, then by all means go at 3 p.m. 
each day and for $7.95 for adults and $4.95 for children you will get an.hour 
and a half of fun. And when you go by Andy Holt Tower, think of me slaving 
away inside while you look at the beautiful scenery. </p>
<p>And so, after all those years of concern, I had absolutely nothing to 
worry+about. The folks who staff the Star of Knoxville these days have their 
acttogether and the name of their act is fun. Go for a birthday party or an 
anniversary. Eat, drink, laugh, take a picture or two. Stand at the rail 
and(watch the water the way Marley Anne (that's the granddaughter) and I 
did. </p>
<p>And then tell me you aren't glad that you gave it a try. </p>

<p>Restaurant: Sunspot </p>
<p>Location: 1909 Cumberland Ave. </p>

<p>LOOK FOR A SUNNY SPOT NEAR UT (</p>
<p>Sometimes, certain cliches slip into our thinking without our really intending 
them to get there. You know the kind of things I mean. Like!restaurants near 
universities tend to be fast food or funky. You know, like(that. Things like, if 
it's healthy, I don't like it. You know, like that. </p>
<p>Thank goodness, I am free of all that. Which is why it took me three months 
to go into a strange looking little restaurant on the Cumberland Avenue strip 
called Sunspot. </p>
<p>You know that there is no place to park. Well, in fact, you can park in 
the!parking lot in back and go into the door with the sunspot emblem painted 
on!it. You know it will be vegetarian. Well, it is, but only if you want it to be. 
You know that you will feel out of place if you are over 30. Well,.actually, I 
have seen all ages from 9 months to 90 years in this place. </p>
<p>You know, if you don't give these folks a try, you will miss a bet. </p>
<p>At a recent lunch, I had warm chicken salad ($6.95), which was excellent. A 
blackened (just hot enough, just black enough) chicken breast was served 
over a good selection of fresh greens with a Jamaican honey mustard 
dressing. The+chicken was warm with heat and hot with pepper. The 
dressing was cold with heat and warm with pepper. I licked the platter clean. </p>
<p>For dinner recently five of us found a wide range of good things. We started 
with an unusually tasty hot spinach and artichoke dip ($4.25). Now I know 
that this has been done to death. But not in a version which is as creamy and 
cheesy and artichoke and spinach laden as this one. It was good with hot 
bread. It was even better with blue corn chips. You get to choose. </p>
<p>Baked brie ($5.95) was a pleasant brie which had been enclosed in pastry 
and baked. Pretty mundane in and of itself. But it was served with a 
pineapple salsa which absolutely sang with flavor. Pineapple, pepper and 
cilantro were+blended just right. Next time, we are going to try to negotiate 
for just a bowl of that salsa. </p>
<p>Salads at Sunspot are good, simple and pleasant. Salad dressings are 
home.made and are really very good. I recommend any of them, but I think 
the raspberry vinaigrette is all right, the blue cheese-walnut is very good, and 
the Jamaican honey mustard is perfect. Decide for yourself. </p>
<p>Sunspot has a fairly limited menu, but a wealth of specials everyday. We had 
three items from the menu and one from the specials. We were not 
disappointed in a single one of them. </p>
<p>Stuffed pork tenderloin ($11.95 with salad and a side dish) was probably the 
tablewide favorite. Pork tenderloin was stuffed with veggies and served in a 
spicy sauce with a good topping of goat cheese. </p>
<p>The pork chop special ($8.95, I think) was a couple of nice enough 
baked!pork chops with an apple corn bread dressing that could use some 
work. Good idea, mediocre dressing. Spinach and walnut ravioli ($9.95) 
proved that food can be vegetarian and good. </p>
<p>The firebird sandwich was a juicy, grilled chicken breast sandwich with 
cheese and mushrooms. It was served with about a gallon of crisp, curly fries 
which had special appeal to the baby in our group. Just how young is too 
young for French fries? </p>
<p>I should note that a number of dishes are available at Sunspot with meat 
or(without. Based on our experience, I think they would be tasty either way. </p>
<p>Desserts at Sunspot run toward the fat and the rich and the good. Chocolate 
peanut butter pie was nearly perfect. I only ate one bite, but not because I 
wanted to have just one. Pumpkin cheesecake was also very good. </p>
<p>Now let me tell you the good news and the bad. Each day, the folks at 
Sunspot make one sugar free dessert. On the day we went, they had sold 
out. It had been cherry pie. I love cherry pie. And sugar free. </p>
<p>Now the moral of this story is that cliches are useful only in headlines and the 
Sunspot will brighten your day. </p>

<p>TUSCANY IMPROVES WITH NEW MANAGERS </p>
<p>One thing I have learned through the years of writing about restaurants is+that 
folks tend to feel strongly about their favorite restaurant and their least 
favorite restaurant, and to disagree with them is risky. </p>
<p>I found this to be particularly true of Tuscany. </p>
<p>After I wrote about Tuscany, some good long time ago, I received 
several!calls from folks who told me that I had been far too harsh. (In case 
you do+not remember, I like the food but complained about lack of 
organization. I thought a 45-minute wait when I had reservations for a large 
party was excessive). </p>
<p>About the same number of people called to tell me that I was far too kind.</p>
<p>Nobody was neutral about Tuscany. </p>
<p>Then I heard that the restaurant had new owners and a new attitude. Now, I 
believe that those of you who visit will still not be neutral. </p>
<p>I believe that you will share my high regard for the place. </p>
<p>First, let me tell you that any problems with the front have been solved. </p>
<p>We had reservations, in an assumed name of course, and arrived to be seated 
immediately on a night when the place was almost full. We were treated 
graciously from the moment we arrived until we left. We had a server who 
was charming, knowledgeable and attentive. </p>
<p>But, you say, this is about food. And let me assure you, there are no 
problems in food either. </p>
<p>This is trattoria food as its best. Easy, casual, tasty and good are words that 
spring to mind. </p>
<p>We started with the antipasto misto ($7.50). A plate filled with sliced 
sausages, cheese, vegetables (both pickled and fresh) was a delight. You 
might also want to give some thought to a half serving of pasta as an 
appetizer. A number of selections are available. </p>
<p>If you are into salad, try the wilted spinach salad ($5.95). A hot pancetta, 
olive oil and vinegar dressing is poured over the spinach leaves and this is 
then served warm. It will also warm your heart. </p>
<p>One of our entrees came from the menu, and one was a special. </p>
<p>We thought they were both special. Scampi alla Genovese ($16.95) is a 
combination of shrimp and scallops that is cooked in a very light wine sauce 
with just the taste of basil. This dish actually allows you to taste the fresh 
seafood as well as the sauce. An altogether radical idea. </p>
<p>If you happen to be concerned about vampires, you want the 
scampi.bergamasco ($15.95), which is fresh shrimp with an olive oil and 
garlic preparation and is closer to what we have come to know as scampi. I 
prefer the former to the latter. </p>
<p>Our second entree was a special. Be sure to check on them. It was a 
beautiful piece of veal which had been stuffed, rolled and roasted to absolute 
perfection. The meat was tender, the filling just spicy enough and the brown 
sauce just right to bring all the flavors together. </p>
<p>I would like to tell you that we had eaten so much that we passed on dessert. 
That would not be true. </p>
<p>We ate the rich, sweet hazelnut ice cream called semifreddo ($4) and we ate 
the rich, sweet creme caramelle ($4). </p>
<p>I also should tell you that I feel some guilt for having these rich sweet 
desserts. It would be a lie. We loved both of them. </p>
<p>The message in all this is that you may think you know Tuscany. </p>
<p>But if you haven't been there lately, you may be in for a very pleasant 
surprise. </p>

<p><em>By Walter Lambert</em></p>
<p>You think this is all so easy, don't you? Just wander around from place to 
place and then write about it a little bit. Anybody could do it, right? </p>
<p>Well, actually, yes they could. However, it does have some drawbacks. </p>
<p>First you are always on the lookout for new places and you seldom get to 
retry those you really like. </p>
<p>Second, folks do not keep a complete file of everything you have written, 
but they expect you to remember everything. </p>
<p>On the latter, I have a secret. If I always seem to remember, it is because 
my wife, Anne, keeps a neat file. I simply run to it, fumble thorugh and come 
up with the needed info. </p>
<p>Let me tell you about some things which have happened lately that will bring 
you up to date on some places I wrote about some time ago. </p>
<p>Let's start with Kashmir Restaurant. I really do like this place. They spice 
things up just right. They make bread so good that anytime I go I am forced 
to almost single-handedly eat a whole plate of assorted breads. But that is 
not what I started to tell you. What I want you to know is these good folks 
now have a very inexpensive Sunday brunch buffet. </p>
<p>Please understand I am not suggesting you go only for Sunday brunch. Go 
anytime and you will get great food. If you have been concerned about going 
because you do not know Indian food, do not worry. The servers at 
Kashmir will slowly walk you through their extensive menu. Have the 
tandoori chicken and some bread. A lot of bread. </p>
<p>Some time back, we told you about the Dragon Den. This little restaurant is 
in a strip shopping center far down Kingston Pike and is very proud of 
producing food that is both good and good for you. We like it. Recently we 
found they have an innovation we like a lot. </p>
<p>These days lots of folks eat alone. In Chinese restaurants this generally 
means you have a lot of one entree. Not at Dragon Den. Every day, these 
folks have a different set of specials from around $3 to $4.25. But for $4.50 
you can get smaller portions of two or even three of these specials. For 
$4.75 you can get a taste of all of them. Now is that a great idea or what? </p>
<p>For those who are fans of Savelli Deli on Sutherland Avenue, you should try 
their new place on Papermill Road. Old timers will remember this place as 
the Hollywood Restaurant, home of broasted chicken. In case you are 
worried broasted chicken has gone out of your life, worry no more. It is 
alive and well on the Savelli menu. </p>
<p>However, I would suggest you break out and try their superb calzone. A 
small one is $5.99 and it is large. They will put all sorts of stuff into the 
calzone, but we like it best with just the great blend of three cheeses which 
are standard. </p>
<p>Did I mention the pizza? With real crust, homemade sauce, cheese, sausage 
and anchovies over in one corner for me. A little plain one is $7.99 and a big 
one is $10.99. They will add all sorts of stuff if you just ask nicely. </p>
<p>Recently, I had a cold. I felt awful. Anne made me go to Darryl's for lunch. I 
had a big bowl of baked potato soup. I loved it. Do you know what they put 
into it? Baked potatoes, cheese, bacon and stuff. It was just what the doctor 
ordered. </p>
<p>Finally, I need to tell you about one of my favorite lunch places. </p>
<p>It is Colonel's Deli over in that strange little triangle just off Kingston Pike, 
near Knox Plaza shopping center. </p>
<p>I don't want you to think I am too much of a regular or too set in my ways, 
but when I walk in, these nice folks smile, say hello and start to make a 
hoagie on dark bread with mustard only. </p>
<p>It is good every single time. </p>

<p>REVIEW </p>
<p>WEEKEND IN ATLANTA EATERIES WORTH TRIP </p>
<p>In the bad old days in Knoxville when restaurant choices were limited, my 
wife, Anne, and I used to slip away for a weekend and go to Atlanta. </p>
<p>We always said that we went to rest or to shop or some such excuse. We 
went to eat - at new restaurants or old ones. Now that we no longer need to 
do that because of the constantly changing and interesting restaurants here in 
our own home town, we have not gone to Atlanta nearly so much. </p>
<p>However, recently I had to be in Atlanta for a meeting that started late 
Wednesday and ended late Friday. We decided to add on a weekend. 
Restaurants, good, bad and interesting seem to be springing up everywhere. 
And prices still seem to be fairly reasonable. </p>
<p>Let me tell you about a few. </p>
<p>The folks who started the Pleasant Peasant on Peachtree Street a few years 
ago have become an empire. Not only do they have a whole collection of 
Peasants stretching from Atlanta to Washington, D.C., they also have Mick's, 
which is a first-rate middle of the road chain with good pastas and dessertsto 
die for. They also operate a restaurant in downtown Atlanta, Dailey's 
Restaurant and Bar, (International Boulevard, just off Peachtree). Located in 
a couple of old downtown buildings, Dailey's has only one drawback. You 
enter the restaurant up a long flight of stairs. Beautiful, yes. Wheelchair 
accessible, forget it. </p>
<p>The food at Dailey's is consistently innovative and pleasant without going 
overboard. They had a delightful appetizer called a California strudel. Phyllo 
pastry enclosed a mixture of cheeses, artichokes, ham and sun dried 
tomatoes. If you do not plan to share, do not order this appetizer. It is entree 
sized but is nice for two. Stuffed chicken breast filled with cheeses was 
delicious.!I ordered the rack of lamb with a peach and pecan sauce. The 
sauce was tart sweet and the lamb was choice and cooked perfectly. </p>
<p>A pleasant new place is the Kudzu Cafe on Peachtree Street in 
Buckhead.Buckhead has become the restaurant center of Atlanta and seems 
to almost specialize in the strong, middle range restaurant. Buckhead Diner is 
the best example of this. Kudzu cafe does not come up to the diner in overall 
quality, but has a fun menu with good quality food at good quality prices. I 
had a pair of well done soft-shelled crabs for under $15. Anne had pot roast, 
which was tender, flavorful and generous. </p>
<p>While in Atlanta, we had lunch with an old friend from Knoxville at a 
Lebanese/Mediterranean place, Cedars. Located on Lenox Road, this little 
place(has a luncheon buffet for $5.95 that is unbeatable. Good homemade 
chicken vegetable soup, lots of crisp salads, potato salads and pickled 
vegetables led!to two hot entrees with good turmeric rice. Fresh fruit made an 
appropriate dessert. </p>
<p>We also found our way to our favorite dim sum restaurant, which is 
actually+not in Atlanta. It is near the heart of downtown Chamblee in the 
Chinatown shopping center and is called the Oriental Pearl. Strolling servers 
give youthe choice of a seemingly unlimited number of these little dumplings 
and!savory rice dishes and noodles and . . . well, you get the idea. We limited 
ourselves this time and only tried 14 varieties. The total check, by the way, 
was only a little over $30. </p>
<p>Finally, on our 34th wedding anniversary, we got around to visiting the(fabled 
Pano's and Paul's. This restaurant, which is located in a suburban(shopping 
center at 1232 W. Paces Ferry Road, has been the subject of food!writers 
for the past 10 years. It is elaborately decorated and overstaffed..But the 
food is as good as everybody says it is. From a cold tomato and roasted 
Vidalia onion soup through a mixed grill of lamb, veal and beef to a!chocolate 
dessert that combined three different chocolate flavors in a mind bending 
blend, it was a meal to remember. </p>
<p>Maybe going to Atlanta to eat sometimes is not such a bad idea. </p>

        </ul>
        <p>Now before I start talking about food at this nice
        place, I want to stop those of you who might remember
        this restaurant as some other name and remember it less
        than fondly. It became fairly seedy there for a while.
        Now it is the province of a nice young couple who have
        only done new floors, new walls, new ceiling, new tables
        and a new attitude. It is a pretty place where you have a
        nice range of choices. </p>
        <p>First, you may have noticed the billboards about this
        restaurant talking about their Super Buffet. It is very
        nice. General Tsao has been here and left his chicken
        along with string beans (or lovely asparagus on a recent visit)
        and those other things you have come to expect on a good
        Chinese buffet. And at $4.95 for lunch and $6.50 for
        dinner, it is a bargain. </p>
        <p>However, that is not what I want to talk about. I want
        to talk about a nice choice of traditional Chinese dishes
        which are hard to find and which are done very well here
        at Wong Dynasty. First, let me say that when you enter the
        restaurant, you should pay attention to a chalk board
        just inside the front door. Here you will find listed a
        number of dishes which will include the buffet if you
        order them. On a recent night, this included the
        absolutely wonderful salt cooked jumbo shrimp for $9.95,
        Scallops with hot spicy sauce ($8.95) and some other
        choices. If one person in your party orders one of these
        dishes (and is willing to share) and the others at your
        table get the buffet, it will insure a great meal. </p>
        <p>Now let me say a word about a range of other great
        choices which you might want to consider instead of the
        buffet. These folks do a number of Chinese hot pot dishes
        which are uniformly excellent. For years, I have contended
        that my favorite Chinese dish is a traditional, home
        style dish called Lion's Heads. It was called this
        because a base of green cabbage around big meat balls
        looked like the mane on a lion's head. At Wong's, they do
        a pork lion's head hot pot ($6.95) which is a wonder. It
        still may be my favorite, but I am not sure of that. </p>
        <p>Running a close second would be either of the two ways
        mussels are prepared here. Again, we are talking about a
        hot pot. In case you are not familiar with hot pot
        cooking, all the ingredients are placed in a ceramic pot and
        cooked with a tight fitting lid. It arrives at the table
        still bubbling inside and when you raise the lid, it is a
        wonderful experience. Mussels in the shell are cooked
        either with a black bean, ginger sauce ($7.25) or a hot
        pepper sauce ($7.50) and are delicious. The mussels
        themselves are fresh and tender and the sauces enrobe
        them in flavor. So far a fight has not broken out in our
        family over who gets the last mussel, but we have come
        fairly close. They are good. </p>
        <p>Any number of other choices from this special Chinese
        menu are excellent. Four different kinds of the cold
        dishes so prized in Chinese cuisine are available. You
        may want to be very brave and try the cold sea cucumber
        (a kind of jelly fish) ($3.95) or you may want to be more
        conservative with cold drunk chicken ($3.50), but either
        way, it will be an interesting introduction to this
        variety of food. If you want to try a favorite Chinese vegetable
        with your meats, get Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce
        ($4.95). This vegetable is almost bitter in its taste and
        I love it. My wife, Anne, is somewhat more reserved about
        it, but she is about most vegetables. Some fine whole
        fish dishes are also available either steamed or fried. </p>
        <p>The good folks who run Wong Dynasty are more than
        willing to help you decide on what you want to put
        together a traditional Chinese meal. And then when you
        finish, they will bring you a scoop of real ice cream to
        bring you home to the USA again.<font size="2"><strong> </strong></font></p>

        <FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT>OS ANGELES -- &#39;&#39;Beavis and Butt-head&#39;&#39; creator Mike Judge may be laughing all the way to the bank, but he&#39;s very particular about his snicker.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I found a tape recently of myself trying different laughs out,&#39;&#39; says Judge, referring to his animated characters&#39; trademark sound effects. &#39;&#39;I was listening to it, going, &#39;No, don&#39;t go with that one! That one doesn&#39;t work.&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s kind of scary because, boy, if I&#39;d tried a different one -- like the difference between huge success and a day job is &#39;Huh-huh, huh.&#39; &#39;&#39;
<P>   The 34-year-old Judge can go ahead and laugh himself silly. His world-class dummies have become big-screen superstars, with &#39;&#39;Beavis and Butt-head Do America&#39;&#39; climbing toward $60 million in box-office receipts. They&#39;re also still going strong on the small screen as they approach the fourth anniversary, March 8, of the debut of &#39;&#39;MTV&#39;s Beavis and Butt-head.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Plus, Judge has a new animated series, &#39;&#39;King of the Hill,&#39;&#39; created with former &#39;&#39;Simpsons&#39;&#39; writer Greg Daniels, that debuted Sunday on Fox. Not bad for a guy who&#39;s been drawing professionally for a little more than five years.
<P>   Judge, who was born in Ecuador, grew up in Albuquerque, N.M., and now lives in Austin, Texas, always loved animation, but he went to the University of California at San Diego to become an engineer.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Believe it or not, math and physics was the easiest thing for me to get through school with,&#39;&#39; Judge tells reporters gathered for an interview at the Four Seasons Hotel. &#39;&#39;I got, like, B&#39;s and stuff.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Judge says that when he was in high school, guidance counselors told him that if he chose engineering in college, &#39;&#39; &#39;People will beat a path to your door and offer you big money once you have your degree.&#39; I believed it all the way up to when I graduated. Mailed out a hundred resumes and got no responses.&#39;&#39;
<P>   After a brief stint working for a government contractor, Judge decided he&#39;d rather play music. He&#39;d been a trombonist in all-state symphony during high school, but he made his living as a stand-up bassist.
<P>   Judge moved to the Dallas suburb of Richardson in 1988, married wife Francesca in 1989 and made his initial animated film, &#39;&#39;Office Space,&#39;&#39; in 1991. His work first appeared on Comedy Central and at the Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation in La Jolla, Calif.
<P>   In 1992, MTV&#39;s animation showcase &#39;&#39;Liquid Television&#39;&#39; accepted four Judge shorts, including one featuring Beavis and Butt-head. In the fall of that year, the cable network placed an order for 35 half-hour episodes of &#39;&#39;Beavis and Butt-head.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;I never thought of &#39;Beavis and Butt-head&#39; as a lifelong thing, or even a career,&#39;&#39; says the jeans-clad Judge. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s just one short that I did. When they said &#39;35 episodes,&#39; I was going, &#39;How can you make 35 episodes out of these guys? They barely talk.&#39; &#39;&#39;
<P>   Judge says the inspiration for the look of the characters was a high-school classmate.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I started to draw him, and I was drawin&#39; Butt-head&#39;s profile,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;It didn&#39;t really look like the guy, but it started to look like somethin&#39; else, and I just kept kinda goin&#39; in that direction.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Beavis was another attempt, actually, to draw the same guy.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Beavis and Butt-head definitely didn&#39;t inherit the classmate&#39;s personality.
<P>   &#39;&#39;This guy was, like, a straight-A student,&#39;&#39; Judge recalls. But he did have an unusual laugh.
<P>   &#39;&#39;He used to sit in the front of class, in calculus class, and he was always kind of like biting his lip, and he&#39;d go hem-hmm-hmm,&#39;&#39; says Judge, demonstrating the early stages of a Beavis snigger.
<P>   Butt-head&#39;s voice came from Judge&#39;s recollection of how he talked when he had braces in junior high. Beavis&#39; name was borrowed from a jock Judge knew in junior high, Bobby Beavis. His junior-high memories even helped Judge get into the right mind-set when he first started recording dialogue for the shows.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I used to imagine . . . like, people I went to junior high with,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;Now when I do it, I&#39;m just sort of imagining the cartoon; I&#39;m just imagining seeing it on the screen.&#39;&#39;
<P>   One of Judge&#39;s biggest concerns about Beavis and Butt-head&#39;s leap to the movie screen was coming up with a story that was true to their essence. In &#39;&#39;Beavis and Butt-head Do America,&#39;&#39; Judge and co-writer Joe Stillman got the metal-head duo off the couch where they normally sit and monitor music videos by having their television set stolen.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They don&#39;t really care about anything, and they have to be kind of oblivious,&#39;&#39; says Judge, who directed the film and provided the voices of Beavis, Butt-head and other male characters. &#39;&#39;They&#39;re very one-note. So you have to kind of write a story that happens around them.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The thing I always compare them to -- not that it&#39;s on that level -- is the Clouseau movies, Peter Sellers. Clouseau is never aware of what&#39;s goin&#39; on and always a complete idiot, stumbling through the whole movie, but there&#39;s this plot that happens around him. And everything is to service these silly, slapsticky kind of jokes, but it all works.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The supporting cast of &#39;&#39;Beavis and Butt-head Do America&#39;&#39; includes the uncredited voices of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore -- &#39;&#39;since the movie&#39;s low budget and we don&#39;t have however many million you&#39;d have to pay them to be able to advertise with their name, I&#39;m not supposed to say who&#39;s in it,&#39;&#39; says Judge -- and credited performances by the likes of Robert Stack, Cloris Leachman and Eric Bogosian.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Do America&#39;&#39; also features musical contributions from Isaac Hayes, Engelbert Humperdinck, White Zombie, AC/DC and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, whose &#39;&#39;Love Rollercoaster&#39;&#39; was the first single and video from the soundtrack.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There was some pressure to get bands in the movie,&#39;&#39; says Judge. &#39;&#39;I didn&#39;t wanna suddenly have an animated band, like have &#39;em go to a concert or somethin&#39; like that.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The other thing Judge resisted was putting videos in the film.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve done probably 600 videos in the show, so I was kinda ready to not do videos in the movie,&#39;&#39; says Judge.
<P>   Judge says that if there&#39;s a sequel, he already has more ideas on tap.
<P>   &#39;&#39; &#39;Beavis and Butt-head Do Europe,&#39; &#39;&#39; he quips. &#39;&#39;There was a sort of &#39;A Clockwork Butt-head&#39; at one point.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Judge, whose two young daughters aren&#39;t quite at the &#39;&#39;Beavis and Butt-head&#39;&#39; viewing stage yet, says he doesn&#39;t fret about being famous for creating icons of idiocy.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I try not to think about that,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;What&#39;s nice is that Beavis and Butt-head are the famous ones; I never get recognized. My name doesn&#39;t even ring a bell to most people.
<P>   &#39;&#39;But when I start thinkin&#39; about that -- I have a photo in my office that a National Geographic photographer took. It&#39;s this really remote Indonesian island with grass huts -- no plumbing or electricity. There&#39;s this family and this grass hut. And this kid&#39;s got a &#39;Beavis and Butt-head&#39; shirt on.&#39;&#39;

        <FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>hree funny men and a serious woman test the movie waters this week.
<P>   Albert Brooks tries to solve his relationship problems by running home to Debbie Reynolds in &#39;&#39;Mother,&#39;&#39; opening today exclusively at the Commons. Brooks plays a science-fiction novelist who decides, after his second divorce, that the roots of his problems with women lie in his relationship with his mother.
<P>   To the dismay of his widowed mom, played by screen legend Reynolds, the writer moves back into her house. He redecorates his room in its high-school-years splendor, tags along with his mother on errands and generally drives her and himself crazy as he seeks his breakthrough.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Mother&#39;&#39; is the fifth film directed by Brooks, Oscar nominee for best supporting actor in &#39;&#39;Broadcast News,&#39;&#39; and Brooks co-wrote the script with Monica Johnson. The supporting cast includes Rob Morrow and Lisa Kudrow.
<P>   Eddie Murphy combines elements of two of his biggest films in &#39;&#39;Metro,&#39;&#39; opening today at Commons, East Towne Crossing, Farragut and Foothills. He takes his profession from &#39;&#39;Beverly Hills Cop&#39;&#39; and his locale from &#39;&#39;48 HRS.&#39;&#39; and puts them together in this action-comedy directed by Thomas Carter (&#39;&#39;Swing Kids&#39;&#39;).
<P>   Murphy plays a San Francisco police hostage negotiator who matches wits with a psychotic villain (Michael Wincott of &#39;&#39;The Crow&#39;&#39;). Along for the ride are Michael Rapaport as a SWAT rookie, Denis Arndt, Art Evans, Donal Logue and Kim Miyori.
<P>   Nicole Kidman turns back time in &#39;&#39;The Portrait of a Lady,&#39;&#39; opening today at Carmike 10 and Downtown West. Jane Campion (&#39;&#39;The Piano&#39;&#39;) directed this adaptation of Henry James&#39; 1881 novel about a 19th-century young woman who finds herself in the unusual position of being able to make life choices without worrying about financial factors.
<P>   The &#39;&#39;Portrait of a Lady&#39;&#39; cast includes Barbara Hershey, John Malkovich, Martin Donovan, Mary-Louise Parker, Christian Bale, Shelley Winters and John Gielgud.
<P>   Chris Farley has the eye of a potato and the stealth of a hippo in &#39;&#39;Beverly Hills Ninja,&#39;&#39; opening today at Carmike 10, Downtown West, Farragut, Halls, Foothills, Parkway and Tri-County. Farley plays an orphan raised by ninjas in Japan in director Dennis Dugan&#39;s comedy.
<P>   Mistakenly believing himself to be the Great White Ninja, the inept warrior travels to Beverly Hills to aid a damsel in distress, played by Nicollette Sheridan. As he tries to bring down archvillain Nathaniel Parker, he is aided surreptitiously by his ninja brother (Robin Shou of &#39;&#39;Mortal Kombat&#39;&#39;). Chris Rock co-stars.
<P>   Long before Mel Gibson became beloved for his big hair in the &#39;&#39;Lethal Weapon&#39;&#39; trilogy, he was lusted after in leather in the &#39;&#39;Mad Max&#39;&#39; series. The Tennessee Theater is offering &#39;&#39;Mad Max,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;The Road Warrior&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&#39;&#39; as a triple feature on Saturday with start times at noon and 7 p.m.
<P>   Take earplugs to allay your frustration at the bad American-accented dubbing on &#39;&#39;Mad Max.&#39;&#39; Back in 1979, America&#39;s love affair with all things Australian hadn&#39;t started, and some moronic distributor was afraid we wouldn&#39;t be able to understand all 70 lines of dialogue.
<P>   The University of Tennessee Film Committee is showing David Lynch&#39;s &#39;&#39;Dune,&#39;&#39; starring Kyle MacLachlan, today and Saturday. One of Catherine Deneuve&#39;s early triumphs, director Jacques Demy&#39;s romantic musical &#39;&#39;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,&#39;&#39; will be screened on Sunday.
<P>   On Wednesday, Alec Guinness stars in the delightful comedy classic &#39;&#39;The Lavender Hill Mob.&#39;&#39;

        <p><font size="2"><i></i></font><br>
        <FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> lot of things are happening in the local media world, but first let me give you the Reader&#39;s Digest version of the Consumer Electronics Show, which ran Jan. 9-12 in Las Vegas.
<P>    I had the opportunity to go on the dime of Knoxville&#39;s television marketing network, Shop At Home, and if what I saw is any indication of the future, television may become a home pathway to everything.
<P>    Our local stations used to compete among themselves; then came cable and in 1994, the world of mini-satellite TV jumped into the market. In 1997, folks with those little dishes will be able to select packages with 200 channels, but that isn&#39;t all the local stations will be competing with.
<P>    Philips Electronics came up with a way to get the Internet on your television set, by-passing the computer. That market is more volatile than a wild bull in a dynamite factory, and you better believe those people who compete for your viewing time are well aware of it.
<P>    If the Internet excites you and a computer scares you, then Net TV could be the answer. Through Net TV, your television becomes interactive and the world will come right into your living room.
<P>    I have one great story from the show. A buyer said he was making a lot of trips to Japan to select product and felt he should try to learn the language.
<P>    He mastered a few words and thought he would try them out on a Japanese cab driver. He let go with a Japanese phrase, and the cabbie exploded with a long group of words that the buyer did not understand. He then told the driver that he knew only &#39;&#39;a little&#39;&#39; Japanese, and the driver replied in English that he knew &#39;&#39;a little American.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The buyer had assumed the cabbie spoke only Japanese, so he became very excited, saying, &#39;&#39;Oh, you know a little American?&#39;&#39; And the cabbie replied, &#39;&#39;Sure -- Mickey Rooney!&#39;&#39;
<P>    That one story made four days of sore feet all worthwhile.
<P>    A final note about the show -- I have to report that Knoxville&#39;s Shop At Home network is well-known around the country, and CES exhibitors were very excited to get to pitch their products to the network&#39;s execs.
<P>
<P>Quick takes
<P>
<P>    * I had a long talk with Channel 8&#39;s new news director, Mark Shafer, and he gave me a few insights into what is going on at WXKT.  Mark said that when he took over the news division, the staff numbered nine. When the new news team goes on line, there will be more than 50 people on board.
<P>     Mark said the reason Channel 8 has never really competed in the local news market was that the station was understaffed and under-equipped. He told me that everyone who was a member of the old guard has been offered a position with the new station and that they are all very talented people; they were just out-gunned.
<P>    I asked him how he and his wife came to work at the same station, and he said she was hired before him. When Gray Communications bought Channel 8, Mark was hired as their corporate news director to oversee the news divisions of all their properties. His wife, Kim Keelor, was hired as an anchor for Knoxville. Three months after his wife was hired, he was made news director at Channel 8. He also will continue as the corporate news director for the chain while he runs the Knoxville operation.
<P>    Kim Keelor, a graduate of The University of Western Kentucky, has 12 years in the business as both a reporter and anchor. Her new co-anchor, John Gilbert, is a Texas A&M graduate and has worked in television markets from West Palm Beach to Texas as an anchor and a reporter.
<P>    I tried to pin Mark down on when we can watch this new team in action. He said everyone should be on board by mid-February. The station is undergoing extensive equipment renovations, and no one will go on the air until everything is in place. Channel 8 will still have the &#39;&#39;old faces&#39;&#39; if they choose to stay with the station but the overall look will be entirely new, and the market attitude will be very competitive.
<P>    * Channel 6 has expanded its morning news, signing on at 5:30 instead of 6. News Director Martha Dooley said they are the first station to go after the early market and they have had outstanding viewer response in their first few weeks of programming. WATE has more things in the works. I&#39;ll fill you in next week.

<P>   Now comes the post-post-holiday season. That&#39;s the spurt of activity the follows the spell of inactivity that follows the surfeit of holiday activities.
<P>   This weekend&#39;s (and beyond&#39;s) full plate includes:
<P>   * The Verve Jazz Festival featuring Joe Henderson, Charlie Haden and Quartet West, and the Kansas City All-Stars. The concert is 7:30 p.m. today at the Bijou Theatre. Tickets are $32.50 at the Bijou box office and other Tickets Unlimited outlets.
<P>   * The ol&#39; maestro, Kirk Trevor, turns to his beloved Mahler for the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra&#39;s annual showcase concert at 8 p.m. today at the Tennessee Theater. For the first time under Trevor&#39;s baton, the orchestra will serve up Gustav M.&#39;s Seventh Symphony. Also on the program is Schubert&#39;s &#39;&#39;Unfinished Symphony,&#39;&#39; presented in its entirety.
<P>    Tickets are $12, $23, $31, $32 and $42 at Tickets Unlimited outlets. Tickets will be available at the Tennessee Theater box office beginning 90 minutes before the concert.
<P>   * Col. Bruce Hampton and the Fiji Mariners perform at 10 p.m. Saturday at Flamingo&#39;s on Cumberland Avenue. Admission is $7. The Fiji Mermaid is still appearing in the back rooms of pit stops along Route 66.
<P>    * John Alexi&#39;s new two-act play &#39;&#39;Interrogation&#39;&#39; is presented at 8 p.m. today and Saturday at Alexi Studios, 5213 Homberg Drive. It&#39;s a sci-fi piece that the playwright calls a &#39;&#39; &#39;Brave New World&#39;- and &#39;1984&#39;-type took at Big Brother, the Mark of the Beast and the After-Life.&#39;&#39; The play continues Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays through Feb. 22. Admission is $10 Fridays and Saturdays, $8 Thursdays.
<P>   * &#39;&#39;The Man Who Came to Dinner&#39;&#39; has returned for seconds at Theatre Central. The classic comedy, which was on hiatus during the holidays, is presented at 8 p.m. today and Saturday (and Thursday-Saturday through Feb. 1) at Theatre Central, 141 S. Gay St. Admission is $10 Fridays and Saturdays, $5 for students; admission is $5 for all on Thursdays.
<P>   * One of those little traits that makes one distinctly American is the belief that one can never, ever have enough of a good thing.
<P><B>   </B>British sitcom series are made six episodes at a time, and their runs are usually brief. There are only 12 episodes of that perennial fave &#39;&#39;Fawlty Towers,&#39;&#39; and there was a four-year gap between the first half-dozen and the last.
<P>    So when &#39;&#39;Absolutely Fabulous&#39;&#39; became a big hit stateside, the folks at Comedy Central didn&#39;t sit still after the show&#39;s creator called it quits after 18 episodes. They waved money.
<P>    The result is a 90-minute &#39;&#39;AbFab&#39;&#39; movie &#39;&#39;Absolutely Fabulous -- The Last Shout,&#39;&#39; premiering at 8 p.m. Sunday on cable&#39;s Comedy Central, to be followed just two days later by its release on video. &#39;&#39;The Last Shout&#39;&#39; finds Patsy and Edina dealing with the upcoming marriage of the priggish Saffie.

        &#39;&#39;20th Century Blues,&#39;&#39; Marianne Faithfull (RCA Victor)
<P>    If any idea for an album seemed like a natural, this must be it. &#39;&#39;20th Century Blues&#39;&#39; features ragged-voiced rock chanteuse Marianne Faithfull crooning out works by German expatriates Kurt Weill, Bertolt Brecht and Fredrich Hollaender, along with a few other appropriately moody tunes.
<P>    Recorded during a live concert in Paris in the winter of 1995, the albums were dubbed by Faithfull &#39;&#39;An Evening in the Weimar Republic.&#39;&#39; Accompanied only by pianist Paul Trueblood, Faithfull cements her talent as a perfect interpreter of sad and cynical songs.
<P>   Many of the tunes, including the Brecht/Weill numbers &#39;&#39;Alabama Song,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Pirate Jenny&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Mack the Knife&#39;&#39; and Hollaender&#39;s &#39;&#39;Falling In Love Again,&#39;&#39; were actually written in Germany during the Weimar era.
<P>   Others, including Noel Coward&#39;s &#39;&#39;20th Century Blues&#39;&#39; and Harry Nilsson&#39;s &#39;&#39;Don&#39;t Forget Me&#39;&#39; (the latter written in the &#39;70s) simply capture the era&#39;s spirit.
<P>   Selections from &#39;&#39;The Threepenny Opera&#39;&#39; by Brecht and Weill are new translations by Irish playwright Frank McGuinness.
<P>   These versions are considerably grittier and less poetic than more familiar versions of the songs. Still, probably no one since Lotte Lenya has given such a vocal embodiment to these songs&#39; tales of tragedy and corruption.
<P><B>Grade: A-</B>
<P><B></B>
<P>&#39;&#39;Never Never Land,&#39;&#39; Joseph Patrick Moore (Moore Music)
<P>   Former Knoxvillian Joseph Patrick Moore has taken his funky bass to the wilds of Memphis.
<P>   The bassist&#39;s new disc, &#39;&#39;Never Never Land,&#39;&#39; is a likable collection of old-fashioned funk and jazz fusion. The disc also features some of the cream of the Memphis jazz scene.
<P>   Cool tunes, including &#39;&#39;Intuition&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Corner of the World,&#39;&#39; are easy to listen to but are an edge above much of the &#39;&#39;lite&#39;&#39; jazz on the market.
<P>   Moore and the band play with thought and feeling, and every now and then toss in a hot surprise. Some of the best cuts are filled with nice brass work, and soprano saxophonist Jim Spake often stands out in the talented group. The disc may be hard to find, but it&#39;s worth searching for. <B>Grade: B

<P>   In the past two decades, Della Reese has become better known as an actress (most recently on TV&#39;s &#39;&#39;Touched By an Angel&#39;&#39;), but this collection of tracks from the early &#39;60s proves that Reese was a top-notch pop singer.
<P>   In this set, Reese belts out standards that include &#39;&#39;Two Sleepy People,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;I Had the Craziest Dream,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;I&#39;m Just a Lucky So and So&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Guess I&#39;ll Hang My Tears Out to Dry.&#39;&#39; While Reese&#39;s brassy style was on the way out at the time this music was recorded, this music is ripe for rediscovery. <B>Grade: B+

        <FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>ometimes getting fired from a band is a blessing.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It definitely was, but I didn&#39;t really know it at that time,&#39;&#39; says Lou Barlow of his 1989 ouster from the group Dinosaur Jr. Barlow was a founding member of Dinosaur Jr., which was just beginning to gain a national following.
<P>   Today, the group causing a stir is Sebadoh, the band Barlow formed after leaving Dinosaur Jr. Also getting notice is Folk Implosion, a Barlow side project responsible for the modern rock hit &#39;&#39;Natural One.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Sebadoh, which will perform Wednesday, Jan. 22, at the Bijou Theatre, has been compared to Big Star, Kiss, Lou Reed and even Burt Bacharach.
<P>   The group&#39;s early work could be angry and unpredictable. However, with 1994&#39;s &#39;&#39;Bakesale,&#39;&#39; the band cemented its talent for simple, unpretentious pop songs. The album found its way onto scores of critics&#39; best-of-the-year lists.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s funny; in retrospect, I don&#39;t think that was such a great record,&#39;&#39; says Barlow from his Boston home, where he lives with his wife, Kathleen Billus. &#39;&#39;I like it, and I kinda understand why people did -- we kinda cleared things up for the first time. We didn&#39;t throw any curveballs.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Barlow, 30, grew up in Jackson, Mich., and later in Westfield, Mass. As a young teen, he discovered the music of hardcore punk bands the Dead Kennedys, Black Flag and New Order.
<P>    When Barlow and his high school friend Scott Helland decided they wanted to form their own group, they tacked up a flier at Main Street Records in Northampton, Mass. -- &#39;&#39;the one cool record store within 50 miles,&#39;&#39; Barlow says.
<P>   J Mascis, a 16-year-old from Amherst, Mass., answered the flier&#39;s call for musicians.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;d have to drive, like, 16, 17 miles to get together and play,&#39;&#39; says Barlow. &#39;&#39;It was a little tough.&#39;&#39;
<P>   With Barlow on guitar, Helland on bass and Mascis on drums, the trio formed the hardcore band Deep Wound. That dissolved in about a year, and Barlow and Mascis formed Dinosaur (Jr. was added later).
<P>   Mascis switched to guitar and took over lead songwriting. Barlow played bass, and Pat Murphy was recruited to play drums. The group gained a local following and eventually signed with hardcore punk label SST Records.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Dinosaur was just a real hard band -- we were real hard on each other, and it was hard to play that music,&#39;&#39; says Barlow. &#39;&#39;It was loud, and we were young. It was kind of a whole rite of passage.
<P>   &#39;&#39;That was just a whole thing I had to do while I was young was just play really loud music and be really cranky about it. It wasn&#39;t a real enjoyable experience, but it was pretty cool to think that I was able to be a part of that for three albums and that was the way I first got to tour the country and take music seriously as a part of my life.
<P>   &#39;&#39;But J and I just didn&#39;t get along and that sort of blew up in my face after a while.&#39;&#39;
<P>   After being asked to leave Dinosaur Jr., Barlow dove into work with Sebadoh, which he had formed as a side project with bassist Jason Lowenstein and drummer Eric Gaffney. Bob Fay often filled in for Gaffney and eventually replaced him in 1993.
<P>   Barlow says the band&#39;s snowballing acclaim doesn&#39;t put him under any new pressure to perform up to anyone&#39;s expectations.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I guess I&#39;ve always put myself under that pressure, even when we were not making records that were that listener-friendly,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;Even then, I always wanted to keep moving on and keep reaching more people.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Barlow probably reached the most people with the 1995 song &#39;&#39;Natural One,&#39;&#39; which he created with friend John Davis.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We just started recording together on my four-track, and there was something happening that was really special,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;We felt that spark, and we just kind of pursued it. It just sort of all came naturally.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The two dubbed themselves Folk Implosion and set about composing the soundtrack for the film &#39;&#39;Kids.&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Natural One&#39;&#39; became part of that.
<P>   Barlow credits the song&#39;s popularity to its dance rhythm.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s just been kind of swallowed by pop culture,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;I just hear it popping up in bizarre places. I saw it on an inspiration infomercial the other day . . . Those crossover things can happen when you start flirting with dance beats and stuff that could be almost considered party music.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;It was just sort of a studio experiment that came together. We wrote, recorded and mixed it all within seven hours. That&#39;s the most satisfying thing. I&#39;ve always hoped that if I did have a hit that that is the way it would come about -- something that was really just off the cuff. It was a nice way to sort of reaffirm why I started recording music in the beginning -- just if you follow your heart maybe things will actually work out.&#39;&#39;
<P>   As for Sebadoh, Barlow and company will also follow their hearts.
<P>   Barlow says the band&#39;s most recent disc, &#39;&#39;Harmacy,&#39;&#39; is as far as the group wants to go into pop for a while.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We really want to make a record that really lives and breathes and scares people the way our early records did.&#39;&#39;

        <FONT SIZE="+2">K</FONT>noxville actor Stephen Dupree stands 6 feet, 5 inches tall, weighs 235 pounds and speaks with a bass voice that doesn&#39;t allow for whispers.
<P>    His ride is a Harley, and his dogs are 180-pound mastiffs.
<P>    By nature and by choice, the man doesn&#39;t do anything in a small way.
<P>    So in his feature film debut, it seems only right that he&#39;s seen with a naked coed on his right and star of the movie on his left.
<P>    Dupree plays Hustler Magazine&#39;s first photographer in the critically acclaimed film, &#39;&#39;The People vs. Larry Flynt.&#39;&#39;
<P>    He is featured in a pivotal scene in the film biography of adult magazine publisher Larry Flynt. In the scene, Flynt (played by Woody Harrelson) demands that the photographer shoot a nude model with her legs spread. The resulting photos make mainstream adult publishing history.
<P>    That sort of thing wasn&#39;t done in Playboy, and the publishing of such photos in the mid-1970s led to Flynt&#39;s first encounter with the law -- an obscenity charge that ultimately didn&#39;t stick but started the publisher off as an unlikely advocate for First Amendment rights.
<P>    In the R-rated film, the area that so interested Flynt has been reduced to a blur. Dupree says director Milos Forman (&#39;&#39;Amadeus,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Ragtime&#39;&#39;) blurred the shot not to hide the female anatomy but because the woman, Rainbeau Mars, was wearing a guard.
<P>    &#39;&#39;A large part of that (not shooting the scene totally nude) was a concession to the modesty of the young woman,&#39;&#39; he says.
<P>    Another consideration was that the movie &#39;&#39;was never supposed to be about cheap thrills.&#39;&#39; The actor says the scene is necessary as a &#39;&#39;representation of how Hustler got to be the magazine of &#39;wide-open spaces.&#39;
<P>    &#39;&#39;Forman wanted to draw attention away from the mere fact of the young lady&#39;s nudity and put it onto the dialogue and interaction (between Flynt and the photographer) that led to the spread-legs shot,&#39;&#39; he says.
<P>    
<P>    The scene also features Brett Harrelson, Woody&#39;s brother, who plays Flynt&#39;s brother and business partner in the movie.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The People vs. Larry Flynt&#39;&#39; opened in selected markets in late December and opened nationally on Jan. 10. Critics love the film and are already talking about Oscars for it, Harrelson and Courtney Love, who plays Althea Leasure, Flynt&#39;s drug-addicted ex-stripper wife.
<P>   Dupree filmed his scene in Memphis over three days in May 1995. He still hasn&#39;t seen the film and says it&#39;s odd to find himself receiving congratulations and questions about work he did so long ago.
<P>   The actor admits to being a ham but says he doesn&#39;t like to watch himself perform because he&#39;s never happy with the result.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Seeing what I&#39;ve done doesn&#39;t excite me,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;Now, if I get cast in a new Oscar-guaranteed production, I&#39;ll be excited about that. But when the work is done and the paycheck received, I&#39;m not excited anymore.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The West High graduate has been performing since he was a child, when he and his eight siblings would sing at churches with their mother and their minister father. Dupree acted in high school dramatics, then spent 10 years in the Navy.
<P>    Several of his siblings also are performers, including sister Adora Dupree, who belongs to the African-American touring company, Carpetbag Theatre.
<P>    Since leaving the Navy in the early &#39;80s, Dupree has worked off-and-on in TV commercials and on stage. He also had a speaking role in an episode of &#39;&#39;Unsolved Mysteries&#39;&#39; and appears in the yet-to-be-released feature film &#39;&#39;Box of Moonlight,&#39;&#39; which stars John Turturro and was filmed in and around Knoxville.
<P>    Dupree says the acting jobs have been slow coming, and he hopes the success of &#39;&#39;The People vs. Larry Flynt&#39;&#39; will send more work his way. Meanwhile, he supports himself with a technical job at The Learning Company, a Knoxville-based software development and sales company.
<P>    Also appearing in &#39;&#39;The People vs. Larry Flynt&#39;&#39; is David Dwyer, a Maryville actor who has appeared in numerous TV programs, commercials and feature films. He plays a federal marshal in the film.
<P>   A number of Tennesseans appear in the film, which was shot mostly in Memphis. Others with Knoxville connections are Mac Pirkle, artistic director of Tennessee Repertory Theatre in Nashville, and William R. Rice, chancellor of UT-Memphis.
<P>    Both Pirkle and Rice are former Knoxvillians. Pirkle plays a Georgia prosecutor, and Rice is seen as Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist.

		<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->&#39;&#39;Ten Easy Pieces,&#39;&#39; Jimmy Webb (Guardian)
<P>   Jimmy Webb is one of America&#39;s few living classic pop songwriters. While his hit-making stride began during 1967&#39;s Summer of Love, his style and lyrical finesse have links to the great songwriters of the 1930s-50s.
<P>   Webb&#39;s songs have provided hits for Glen Campbell (&#39;&#39;Galveston,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Wichita Lineman,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&#39;&#39;), Richard Harris (&#39;&#39;MacArthur Park,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Didn&#39;t We&#39;&#39;), Art Garfunkel (&#39;&#39;That&#39;s All I Know&#39;&#39;), The 5th Dimension (&#39;&#39;Up, Up and Away&#39;&#39;) and others.
<P>   When Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash teamed up as the Highwaymen, the foursome took its name from the Webb song it recorded.
<P>   But one of the best places to hear Webb&#39;s work has always been on his own albums. Made up primarily of Webb&#39;s thoughtful piano playing and soulful voice, &#39;&#39;Ten Easy Pieces&#39;&#39; is an enlightening re-evaluation of familiar songs.
<P>   Webb&#39;s ability to create songs that are baldly honest and emotional yet lyrically accomplished is his most beguiling quality.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Galveston,&#39;&#39; which opens the disc, may be a product of the Vietnam War (the singer is a soldier hoping he lives to see his lover and his hometown again), but it&#39;s so unaffectedly human that it can&#39;t help but touch listeners in any era.
<P>   Webb often gets under a listener&#39;s skin through modest characters -- from the deserting lover of &#39;&#39;By the Time I Get to Phoenix,&#39;&#39; who imagines what his wife or girlfriend will be doing back home, to the lonely &#39;&#39;Witchita Lineman,&#39;&#39; who hears his lover &#39;&#39;singing through the wires.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Yet, Webb can be grandiose; his AM-radio opus &#39;&#39;MacArthur Park&#39;&#39; was one of the longest songs to ever become a hit.
<P>   When sung by Richard Harris, the song seemed like a complete Broadway musical crammed into 71/2 minutes. Delivered by Webb, with only a piano accompaniment, &#39;&#39;MacArthur Park&#39;&#39; becomes a poetic emotional collapse.
<P>   At his best, as on his gorgeous and artful &#39;&#39;If These Walls Could Speak&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;The Moon&#39;s a Harsh Mistress,&#39;&#39; Webb seems like a desperate man begging for one last chance.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Ten Easy Pieces,&#39;&#39; like Webb&#39;s shamefully overlooked 1993 effort &#39;&#39;Suspending Disbelief,&#39;&#39; is a fine chance for music fans to check out one of music&#39;s most neglected master songwriters. <B>Grade: A</B>
<P><B></B>
<P>
<P>&#39;&#39;2001: A Space Odyssey,&#39;&#39; soundtrack (Rhino/Turner Classic Movies)
<P>   Without a doubt, one of the coolest movie soundtracks of the 1960s accompanied Stanley Kubrick&#39;s trippy film, &#39;&#39;2001: A Space Odyssey.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Kubrick had originally hired veteran soundtrack composer Alex North to score the film. The director used classical works as guide music while he was putting the film together.
<P>   In the end, the guide music, which was perfect in itself, remained: &#39;&#39;Also Sprach Zarathustra&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;The Blue Danube,&#39;&#39; by Richard Strauss and Johann Strauss, respectively; &#39;&#39;Gayane Ballet Suite&#39;&#39; by Russian composer Aram Khachaturian and &#39;&#39;Lux Aeterna,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Adventures&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Requiem for Soprano, Mezzo Soprano, Two Mixed Choirs & Orchestra&#39;&#39; by avant garde composer Gyorgy Ligeti.
<P>   The Strauss music is grand. The Khachaturian evokes the vast loneliness of outer space. And the Ligeti works are nerve-wrackingly weird.
<P>   The soundtrack&#39;s first appearance on CD is supplemented by full-length versions of two of the Ligeti works, a third version of &#39;&#39;Also Sprach Zarathustra&#39;&#39; and a great nine-minute montage of the dialogue of the film&#39;s computer, HAL 9000 -- &#39;&#39;What are you doing, Dave?&#39;&#39;<B> Grade: A</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>&#39;&#39;The Anthology 1965-1967,&#39;&#39; Small Faces (Deram) 
<P>   This collection doesn&#39;t capture the Small Faces at the time that most people know them best. The group (vocalist/guitarist Steve Marriot, bassist Ronnie Lane, drummer Kenney Jones, and keyboardist Ian McLagan) was best known in the United States for their 1967 hit &#39;&#39;Itchycoo Park.&#39;&#39; In later years (with Marriott replaced by Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood), they were known simply as the Faces. 
<P>   This two-disc set captures the fun and fire of a London band still enamored with American blues, but English enough to set a sweet pop ballad to the chorus of &#39;&#39;Angels We Have Heard on High&#39;&#39; (&#39;&#39;In My Mind&#39;s Eye&#39;&#39;). &#39;&#39;The Anthology 1965-1967&#39;&#39; is a great trip back to the innocence and fun of the British Invasion. <B>Grade: A

<P>Music news
<P><B></B>
<P>   * Singer/songwriter <B>Townes Van Zandt </B>died on New Year&#39;s Day. He was 52.
<P>   An Associated Press report said Van Zandt was recovering from hip surgery and died of an apparent heart attack at his home in Smyrna, Tenn.
<P>    Van Zandt&#39;s most famous songs include &#39;&#39;Pancho and Lefty,&#39;&#39; which was a hit for Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard, and &#39;&#39;If I Needed You,&#39;&#39; a No. 1 hit for Don Williams and Emmylou Harris.
<P>   Van Zandt&#39;s most fervent following was among fellow songwriters. Fellow Texans Guy Clark, Steve Earle, Nanci Griffith, Rodney Crowell and Robert Earl Keen listed Van Zandt as a favorite and as an important influence.
<P>   Van Zandt was known for his stark images and sad songs. In an interview several years ago, Van Zandt told me that some songs were so sad that he didn&#39;t want anyone to hear them.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Some are real good ones. Some I&#39;ve written all the way out and reread and thrown away, because they&#39;re real good, but they&#39;re real sad. I figure, &#39;Nobody needs to hear this.&#39; &#39;&#39;
<P>   For a time in the early &#39;80s, all of Van Zandt&#39;s albums were out of print. Today, most of his discs are available. His most recent, &#39;&#39;A Deeper Blue,&#39;&#39; was released on Sugar Hill in 1994.
<P><B></B>
<P>New releases
<P><B></B>
<P>   * Look for new albums later this month by: Bjork, The Oddsand <B>Aphex Twin</B>. In February expect discs from David Bowie, Live, Bad Livers, Eleventh Dream Day, Leo Kottke, Moby, John Lee Hooker, Freedy Johnstonand <B>James.</B> In March, expect new discs from <B>Alison Krauss, Aerosmith, Indigo Girls, Van Morrison, Matthew Sweet, John Hiatt </B>and <B>Ben Folds Five.</B>

        ''Coming About,'' Maria Schneider Jazz Orchestra (Enja) </p>
        <p>A truly great jazz orchestra is a rare and wonderful
        thing. Last week's Grammy-nomination nod for the Maria
        Schneider Jazz Orchestra (for Best Large Jazz Ensemble)
        recognizes one of the finest albums of the year. </p>
        <p>A Minnesota native, Schneider has written for bands
        led by Woody Herman, Mel Lewis and Toots Thielemans. In
        1994, she conducted the Carnegie Hall Jazz Orchestra
        performing her piece, ''El Viento.'' </p>
        <p>On ''Coming About,'' Schneider conducts her own
        18-piece orchestra through an entrancing one-hour-plus
        journey. </p>
        <p>Schneider's compositions and arrangements on the disc
        make inspiring use of her players -- from the subtle
        beauty of Schneider's adaptation of Alex North's ''Love
        Theme from 'Spartacus' '' (featuring some fine tenor sax
        work by Rich Perry) to the eerie funk of her own
        ''Bombshelter Beast,'' which juxtaposes the sound of an
        alarm horn with hot playing by baritone sax player Scott
        Robinson and bassist Tony Scherr. </p>
        <p>Schneider's works gather musical tension like a train
        rolling toward a Volkswagen before coming to riveting
        conclusions. </p>
        <p>Best of all, Schneider doesn't sound as though she's
        simply trying to impress musicians with pretentious
        discord, and by the same token, she doesn't pander to the
        goopy sentimentality found in ''lite'' jazz. </p>
        <p>Her compositions make emotional as well as musical
        sense. Ugly phrases are contrasted with sweet. And
        Schneider isn't afraid to rework a recognized classic,
        such as John Coltrane's ''Giant Steps.'' </p>
        <p>In a year of confounding Grammy nominations, ''Coming
        About'' is one album that truly deserves the honor. <b>Grade:
        A </b></p>
        <p>''Thunderfingers: The Best of John Entwistle'' (Rhino)
        </p>
        <p>During his tenure as bass player with the Who, John
        Entwistle provided some of the best bass work in rock. On
        some songs, such as ''The Real Me,'' Entwistle's bass
        became the thundering lead instrument. </p>
        <p>And Entwistle's own tunes often were a welcome,
        black-humored antidote to the self-conscious compositions
        of Who head songwriter Pete Townshend. </p>
        <p>Entwistle's solo albums were a mixed bag of hard rock,
        '50s-inspired rock 'n' roll and sick humor. </p>
        <p>''Thunderfingers'' does a fine job of culling superior
        works, with healthy doses from Entwistle's best album,
        ''Whistle Rymes,'' and good numbers from other discs.
        Included are ''Rollerskate Kate,'' a parody of '50s
        teen-tragedy songs that substitutes roller skates for a
        crashed car; ''The Window Shopper,'' a thoughtful song
        from a voyeur's point of view; and the fine angry-divorce
        number ''I Feel Better.'' </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, other Entwistle tracks seem less
        charming than they did during the '70s. Despite the
        bass-master's lack of pretense, he never quite achieved
        the peaks of bandmate Townshend. <b>Grade: B</b> </p>
        <p><strong>Concerts </strong></p>
        <p>* In addition to the <b>Jimmy Buffett </b>show
        scheduled for March 1 at Thompson-Boling Arena, announced
        on Page One today, three other concerts have been
        announced this week: </p>
        <p><b>Leftover Salmon</b> will perform at 8 p.m. Tuesday,
        Feb. 11, at the Bijou Theatre. Tickets are $12 and go on
        sale Friday, Jan. 17. <b>Michael Hedges</b> will appear
        at 8 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 20, at the Bijou. Tickets are
        $17.50 and go on sale Monday, Jan. 13. <b>Soul Coughing </b>will
        play at 8 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 26, at the Bijou. </p>
        <p>Rumors abound of Knoxville dates for <b>No Doubt </b>and
        <b>Reba McEntire/Brooks and Dunn </b>in the spring. </p>
        <p>Music news </p>
        <p>* A couple of local bands have new releases. </p>
        <p><b>Gran Torino's </b>CD ''Live at the Chameleon Club''
        contains five tracks recorded at the Atlanta club late
        last year. The disc is available at local record stores.
        To order by mail, send $13 to: Gran Torino, 4150 Ridgeway
        Lane, Knoxville, Tenn. 37919. The band will perform at 10
        p.m. Friday, Jan. 17, at Flamingo's. Admission will be
        $7. </p>
        <p>The <b>Opposable Thumbs </b>have released the tape
        ''Our Cheapest Chicken.'' The collection, available only
        at the Disc Exchange, costs $6 and covers recordings made
        from 1994 to 1996. </p>
        <p>The Thumbs will be on hold through the next year while
        band mouthpiece <b>Todd Steed </b>spends time in
        Indonesia and drummer <b>David Jenkins</b> and bassist
        Paul Noe are occupied in Nashville. </p>
        <p>* Reports of the demise of <b>David's Music Barn </b>were
        premature. Music Barn owner David West, who announced the
        closing, has now turned the show over to <b>Larry Maples</b>.
        </p>
        <p>Maples says the family-oriented dance and music club
        will reopen Saturday, Jan. 18, with <b>Larry Maples and
        24 &127;Karat Country</b> performing a homecoming show.
        The show will begin at 8:30 p.m., and special guests are
        expected. Ticket prices remain unchanged. </p>
        <p>* <b>Nick Cave's </b>next album, due in February, will
        be a collection of love songs. It follows his gory
        assemblage, ''Murder Ballads.'' </p>
        <p>In addition, the labels 2 13 61 (Henry Rollins' label,
        named for his birthdate) and Thirsty Ear Records will
        co-release for the first time on CD albums by <b>The
        Birthday Party</b>, Cave's band before he formed the <b>Bad
        Seeds</b>. The albums are ''Junkyard,'' ''Hee Haw,''
        ''Prayers on Fire'' and ''Mutiny/Bad Seed.'' They'll be
        available in early February. </p>

        &#39;&#39;20th Century Blues,&#39;&#39; Marianne Faithfull (RCA Victor)
<P>    If any idea for an album seemed like a natural, this must be it. &#39;&#39;20th Century Blues&#39;&#39; features ragged-voiced rock chanteuse Marianne Faithfull crooning out works by German expatriates Kurt Weill, Bertolt Brecht and Fredrich Hollaender, along with a few other appropriately moody tunes.
<P>    Recorded during a live concert in Paris in the winter of 1995, the albums were dubbed by Faithfull &#39;&#39;An Evening in the Weimar Republic.&#39;&#39; Accompanied only by pianist Paul Trueblood, Faithfull cements her talent as a perfect interpreter of sad and cynical songs.
<P>   Many of the tunes, including the Brecht/Weill numbers &#39;&#39;Alabama Song,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Pirate Jenny&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Mack the Knife&#39;&#39; and Hollaender&#39;s &#39;&#39;Falling In Love Again,&#39;&#39; were actually written in Germany during the Weimar era.
<P>   Others, including Noel Coward&#39;s &#39;&#39;20th Century Blues&#39;&#39; and Harry Nilsson&#39;s &#39;&#39;Don&#39;t Forget Me&#39;&#39; (the latter written in the &#39;70s) simply capture the era&#39;s spirit.
<P>   Selections from &#39;&#39;The Threepenny Opera&#39;&#39; by Brecht and Weill are new translations by Irish playwright Frank McGuinness.
<P>   These versions are considerably grittier and less poetic than more familiar versions of the songs. Still, probably no one since Lotte Lenya has given such a vocal embodiment to these songs&#39; tales of tragedy and corruption.
<P><B>Grade: A-</B>
<P><B></B>
<P>&#39;&#39;Never Never Land,&#39;&#39; Joseph Patrick Moore (Moore Music)
<P>   Former Knoxvillian Joseph Patrick Moore has taken his funky bass to the wilds of Memphis.
<P>   The bassist&#39;s new disc, &#39;&#39;Never Never Land,&#39;&#39; is a likable collection of old-fashioned funk and jazz fusion. The disc also features some of the cream of the Memphis jazz scene.
<P>   Cool tunes, including &#39;&#39;Intuition&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Corner of the World,&#39;&#39; are easy to listen to but are an edge above much of the &#39;&#39;lite&#39;&#39; jazz on the market.
<P>   Moore and the band play with thought and feeling, and every now and then toss in a hot surprise. Some of the best cuts are filled with nice brass work, and soprano saxophonist Jim Spake often stands out in the talented group. The disc may be hard to find, but it&#39;s worth searching for. <B>Grade: B

<P>&#39;&#39;Voice of an Angel,&#39;&#39; Della Reese (RCA) 
<P>
<P>   In the past two decades, Della Reese has become better known as an actress (most recently on TV&#39;s &#39;&#39;Touched By an Angel&#39;&#39;), but this collection of tracks from the early &#39;60s proves that Reese was a top-notch pop singer.
<P>   In this set, Reese belts out standards that include &#39;&#39;Two Sleepy People,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;I Had the Craziest Dream,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;I&#39;m Just a Lucky So and So&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Guess I&#39;ll Hang My Tears Out to Dry.&#39;&#39; While Reese&#39;s brassy style was on the way out at the time this music was recorded, this music is ripe for rediscovery. <B>Grade: B+

        </i></font></p>
        <p><font size="5">T</font>he rating is done on a basis of
        one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five being the
        highest: </p>
        <p>-<strong>- DANCE INTO THE LIGHT, Phil Collins
        (Atlantic) </strong></p>
        <p>So much has changed for Phil Collins since his last
        album, 1993's ''Both Sides,'' that he probably believes
        his new ''Dance Into the Light'' is a dramatic career
        departure. </p>
        <p>Since ''Both Sides,'' Collins has divorced, taken a
        new lover, moved to Switzerland and quit the band
        Genesis. </p>
        <p>However, although ''Dance Into the Light'' is more
        upbeat than ''Both Sides,'' it's still the same Phil
        Collins. </p>
        <p>After enough years of service, people in virtually any
        profession hit plateaus. Collins has been on a plateau
        for some time, and despite the changes in his life,
        ''Dance Into the Light'' reflects little growth and only
        a tad of experimentation. </p>
        <p>His best claims to innovation on ''Dance Into the
        Light'' are the African rhythms that surface from time to
        time. But if this is his (decade late) answer to Paul
        Simon's ''Graceland,'' it's so watered down as to be
        inconsequential. </p>
        <p>Collins fails completely with his lyrics, using a
        combination of weak modifications to formula and outright
        cliches. He compounds the mundanity with hollow delivery
        -- weaving from songs about generic liberation to
        devotional tracks to tales of betrayal and hurt. Whatever
        the theme, he knocks out the vocals without conviction. </p>
        <p>Musically, he returns to the sunny pop enthusiasm that
        served him well in the '80s -- and indeed some of the
        better songs (the self-consciously catchy, horn-driven
        title track, the heady-yet-bland ''River So Wide'') would
        fit a retrospective soundtrack for the Me Decade. </p>
        <p>Likewise too familiar is his approach on the more
        subdued material -- when he pines gracefully for lost
        love on ''The Same Moon,'' for example, or when the
        bassline permeates a wash of synthesizers on ''Oughta
        Know by Now.'' Meanwhile, ''Just Another Story'' sounds
        like a script outline for an episode for the long-defunct
        ''Miami Vice.'' </p>
        <p>Most ironic is his recasting of Bob Dylan's ''The
        Times They Are A-Changin' '' in an '80s power-pop mode. </p>
        <p>Stagnation, insincerity and an inordinate number of
        vapid filler tracks cast a dark shadow on ''Dance Into
        the Light.'' </p>
        <p>Rating (five possible): XX </p>
        <p>-<strong>- FITZCARRALDO, The Frames DC (Elektra) </strong></p>
        <p>It's not often a street performer gets a shot at a
        record deal. But The Frames DC -- a group of five former
        buskers based in Dublin, Ireland -- capitalize on their
        second such contract with ''Fitzcarraldo.'' </p>
        <p>After failing with an effort on Island Records -- a
        release Frames' lead singer Glen Hansard calls ''a
        half-baked punk album'' -- Elektra Records gave the band
        another chance. </p>
        <p>The Frames DC cash in with ''Fitzcarraldo,'' a
        well-developed album with only a couple of half-baked
        miscues -- namely cheesy theatrics on ''Angel at My
        Table'' and overbearing whining on ''Denounced.'' </p>
        <p>Although progressive enough to suit modern-rock
        playlists (the track ''Monument'' seems particularly
        contrived for the fickle genre), ''Fitzcarraldo'' is a
        timeless rock album that mostly evades trends. Plus group
        violinist Colm MacConIomaire gives the album a dignified
        lift -- lending personality to the epic title track, for
        example. </p>
        <p>''Fitzcarraldo'' kicks off with a rousing
        ''Revelate,'' which blasts apocalyptic guitar interludes
        between Hansard's emotional verses: He wearily confesses
        ''sometimes it's easy just to hate you,'' and by the end
        of the song is angrily demanding, ''Redeem yourself.'' </p>
        <p>''Giving It All Away'' is another effective mood
        piece, balancing the brooding singer with the
        electromania of edgy guitars. </p>
        <p>Yet the Frames DC are also skilled at simmering songs
        -- ''Evergreen'' is laced with mysticism, ''Red Chord''
        rides Hansard's tragic delivery, ''Your Face'' is an
        unexpectedly tender closer, and before it arches off into
        melodrama, the ponderous ''In This Boat Together'' is an
        excellent overview of an ill-fated couple locked in
        commitment. </p>
        <p>The downcast mood of the album gets tiresome (a la
        Pearl Jam), and the band does have its indiscretions. But
        ''Fitzcarraldo'' ought to keep these Irishmen off the
        streets. </p>
        <p>Rating: XXXX </p>
        <p><strong>-- IMA, BT (Perfecto/Kinetic/Reprise) </strong></p>
        <p>On her 1996 self-produced album, Tori Amos struggled
        with bad judgment, indulging her whims to the detriment
        of the record's focus. </p>
        <p>Now she has aligned herself with a man who makes her
        seem restrained by comparison. </p>
        <p>Brian Transeau, who bills himself simply as ''BT,''
        conspires with Amos on his debut, ''Ima.'' He milks the
        collaboration for nearly 18 minutes over two songs -- a
        spacey dance track, ''Blue Skies,'' and an overblown
        remixed version of the same song (''The Delphinium Days
        Mix'') that first hitches into an electric groove, then
        wraps into a vocal swirl, then degenerates into
        disjointed noise, then drains the life out of the
        singer's vocals as loops are reiterated ad nauseum. </p>
        <p>That's only the beginning of the excess: ''Ima'' is a
        two-disc debut that clocks in at more than 138 minutes. </p>
        <p>One track alone -- ''Sasha's Voyage of Ima'' -- is
        more than 42 minutes. (That's longer than an entire album
        for many acts.) And though there are some viable grooves
        sequenced into the mix, a song like that is more about
        the listener's will to endure than the performer's
        ability to amuse. </p>
        <p>BT's work is good in small doses. He creates a New Age
        genre for Generation X, electronic dance that embraces
        world music and esoteric sound effects. By themselves,
        the high-intensity surrealism of ''Nocturnal
        Transmission'' and the churning ''Deeper Sunshine'' are
        fresh and imaginative. </p>
        <p>Then there's ''Embracing the Sunshine,'' which is a
        potent composite of the first eight tracks of the first
        disc. </p>
        <p>But BT is out of control, not only pounding his
        gimmicks to death, but reviving them on the next track to
        pound them to death again. And it goes on for more than
        two and a quarter hours, which is just stupefying. </p>
        <p>Rating: XX </p>

        <font size="5">T</font>he rating is done on a basis of
        one (X) to five (XXXXX) stars, with five being the
        highest: </p>
        <p>-- ONE FIERCE BEER COASTER, Bloodhound Gang
        (Geffen/Republic) </p>
        <p>''I'm the root of all that's evil, yeah, but you can
        call me Cookie,'' sings Jimmy Pop Ali, lead vocalist and
        overall top dog of the Bloodhound Gang on the group's hit
        single, ''Fire Water Burn.'' </p>
        <p>Singing flatly against what begins as acoustic support
        then erupts into an electrified Weezer-ly chug, Ali
        grinds through an expletive-not-deleted free-for-all of
        irreverence, suggesting Lawrence Welk, Kurt Cobain and
        others are in hell, Emmanuel Lewis is the Antichrist and
        the roof (the roof, the roof) is on fire and should just
        be left to burn. </p>
        <p>The Philadelphia-area band's raunchy ''One Fierce Beer
        Coaster'' was released on Republic Records in September
        but got a major-label break from Geffen, which
        re-released the album (minus two tracks) in December. </p>
        <p>It's sure to offend both humorless PC extremists and
        the religious right, but those likely aren't the target
        demographics for the group anyway. Ali's work -- which at
        a glance might be taken as sexist, racist, homophobic and
        godless -- is ribald parody at its best. Self-effacing
        and admittedly juvenile, Ali is far more clever than he
        lets on. </p>
        <p>For starters, the album is more diverse than it has
        any right to be. From full-tilt punk tracks to slamming
        rap to the funkiest hip-hop/rock concoction since vintage
        Big Audio Dynamite, ''One Fierce Beer Coaster'' is an
        innovative marvel. If it were only an instrumental album,
        it would be worthy. </p>
        <p>But Jimmy Pop Ali at the mike makes this an essential
        album to anyone who can cope with a little distasteful
        humor. </p>
        <p>Confessing to an embarrassing physical shortcoming
        (more than once), he boasts of his compensating sexual
        talents; he embraces nerdom but still tells the world
        where to get off (''I hate people that think that I care
        what they think,'' he says on ''Shut Up''); and he longs
        to be a handsome pseudo-gay man so he can get chicks
        (''Scoring with a supermodel would be easy''). </p>
        <p>That B.A.D.-sounding track, ''Lift Your Head Up High
        (And Blow Your Brains Out),'' is a particular triumph as
        Jimmy Pop Ali leads his chanting band in a mantra against
        self-pitiers, ''Life's short and hard like a
        body-buidling elf/So save the planet and kill yourself.''
        </p>
        <p>This guy even does a blithe braggadocio duet with
        Vanilla Ice on the reverberating ''Boom.'' Talk about
        guts. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Ali's hilarious cultural references bridge
        baby boomers to Generation X: He dreams up a morbidly
        violent ''Gilligan's Island'' scenario on ''Why's
        Everybody Always Pickin' on Me?'', and ''Your Only
        Friends Are Make Believe'' has Mr. Rogers going off on
        his mailman before Ali overtly digs at Duran Duran,
        swiping the chorus melody from DD's ''Hungry Like the
        Wolf'' for his own chorus. </p>
        <p>And in a nod to fans, there's the anthemic ''Going
        Nowhere Slow,'' which is a roll call of 70-odd cities
        where the band likes to play . . . ''but nowhere in New
        Jersey.'' </p>
        <p>That's New Jersey's loss. </p>
        <p>Rating (five possible): XXXX </p>
        <p>-- GOUDS THUMB, Gouds Thumb (Critique) </p>
        <p>Far be it from the Maine-based band Gouds Thumb to
        break modern rock out of its winter of discontent. </p>
        <p>Instead, the four-man group falls in line with the
        genre on a self-titled debut that features overplayed
        instruments, oversung vocals and underdeveloped songs. </p>
        <p>The single ''29'' (which features supporting vocals by
        Matthew Sweet) and ''Beautiful Local'' stand apart from
        other tracks thanks to their memorable refrains. But the
        blustery ''Gouds Thumb'' is primarily an aggressive, yet
        characterless, acting-out by a band indistinguishable
        from hordes of other groups. </p>
        <p>Lead singer Connor, whose emotional range mimics the
        Vedderesque screech-and-groan, handicaps Gouds Thumb with
        disconnected, unenlightening lyrics -- inadequate
        attempts at symbolism that he belts out with plaintive
        importance. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, guitarist Walter Craven, bass player Jeff
        Kral and drummer Bernard Willimann are locked in
        unimaginative drudgery of their own. </p>
        <p>Rarely backing off from the stormy sameness of the
        bulk of tracks, the band gears down twice: once for a
        brush with psychedelia on ''Chemicals'' and again on the
        moany ''Apnea'' (which is reprised at album's end as a
        gratuitous ''hidden'' track). Beyond ''29'' and
        ''Beautiful Local,'' the only saving grace to this album
        is its power. </p>
        <p>The glut of bands like Gouds Thumb is shutting down
        what was once a vivacious offshoot of popular music. And
        the term ''progressive rock,'' once used interchangeably
        with ''modern rock,'' no longer applies. </p>
        <p>Rating: XX </p>
        <p>-- ''ALL THAT: THE ALBUM,'' various acts (Loud) </p>
        <p>''All That: The Album'' is a choice overview of
        today's most promising young R&amp;B acts, but it isn't
        much of a testimonial to the humor in the sketch comedy
        show ''All That.'' </p>
        <p>The album is a promotional vehicle for the program,
        and it includes songs by nine music acts as well as
        excerpts from the youth-oriented Nickelodeon show. </p>
        <p>Those bits from the skits are decidedly feeble. (One
        interlude is nothing but a girl declaring, ''If you don't
        know the difference between baloney and your underwear,
        then I ain't eatin' a sandwich at your house!'') </p>
        <p>On the other hand, the collection of songs -- most of
        them hits from the past couple of years -- is rather
        strong. </p>
        <p>The male band Soul for Real chips in the harmony-rich
        ''Candy Rain,'' for example, while its female
        counterpart, MoKenStef, contributes a sleek ''He's
        Mine.'' </p>
        <p>Teen divas Brandy and Aaliyah are represented by the
        funky ''Baby'' and the jazz-inflected ''Age Ain't Nothing
        But a Number,'' respectively. And though her song gets a
        bit numbing, the silky voiced Faith Evans delivers a fine
        ''You Used To Love Me.'' </p>
        <p>A pair of rap tracks make the cut, too -- Coolio's
        springy ''Fantastic Voyage'' and Naughty by Nature's
        boisterous ''Clap Yo' Hands.'' </p>
        <p>''All That: The Album'' includes two Immature songs --
        the solid new track ''Watch Me Do My Thing'' and the
        plucky, mid-tempo devotional, ''We Got It'' -- and the
        trio TLC also is here twice -- once with the show's
        opening theme and once with the closer. </p>
        <p>To its credit, the album doesn't slip in lesser tracks
        and nobodies. These are all relatively big names on more
        or less equal footing. Although their songs aren't
        overflowing with originality, they're competently
        performed. </p>
        <p>To its discredit, the album slips in undeniably lame
        attempts at humor. </p>
        <p>Rating: XXX </p>

        burgeoning sports card collection better organized,

        <p>Yeah, right. </p>
        <p>What should you really look for in 1997? </p>
        <p>With the NFL playoffs finally under way, quarterbacks <b>Brett
        Favre </b>of the Green Bay Packers and <b>John Elway</b>
        of the Denver Broncos are generating even more interest
        from collectors. Elway and wide receiver <b>Jerry Rice</b>
        of the San Francisco 49ers will end up in the Hall of
        Fame. Remarkably, their cards are still priced in
        reasonable ranges. </p>
        <p>I've never been much of a Dallas Cowboys fan although
        I have enjoyed watching and reading about running back <b>Emmitt
        Smith</b>, who owns a hobby shop in Florida, and
        quarterback <b>Troy Aikman </b>because of their talent
        and character. Their card values have softened slightly
        because of the team's struggles. However, they are still
        collectors' favorites. </p>
        <p>Another Cowboy hasn't fared as well. A year ago,<b> </b>wide
        receiver <b>Michael Irvin's</b> card values were soaring.
        Then, prior to this season, he was arrested on drug
        charges. His latest run-in with the law (accusations of
        holding a woman at gunpoint while a teammate and another
        man raped her) has tarnished his Dallas star again. The
        allegations weaken his position among collectors. If the
        charges are substantiated -- and Irvin has proclaimed his
        innocence -- it could mean the death knell for him as a
        hobby figure. </p>
        <p><b>BASEBALL STUFF: </b>All major card companies have
        released or are getting ready to ship 1997 baseball
        products. One of the coolest is by Upper Deck, which is
        making cards with actual pieces of ''game-worn'' jerseys.
        Popular players such as <b>Ken Griffey</b> of the Seattle
        Mariners are included in the set. The company says you
        can almost ''smell the greatness.'' No sweat. </p>
        <p>Pacific is releasing a 36-card set dubbed ''Latinos en
        Grandes Ligas'' (Latinos of the Major Leagues) that will
        include <b>Andruw &127;Jones</b> and <b>Javier Lopez </b>of
        the Atlanta Braves, <b>Rey Ordonez</b> of the New York
        Mets, <b>Alex Rodriguez</b> of the Seattle Mariners, <b>Mariano
        Rivera </b>of the New York Yankees and <b>Juan Gonzalez </b>of
        the Texas Rangers. </p>
        <p><b>SPACE JAM:</b> Did you get all the Space Jam
        products for Christmas? Let's see. There were pajamas,
        sheets, hats, board games, action figures, talking
        Michael Jordan doll, golfing Jordan, baseball Jordan,
        basketball Jordan, cartoon characters with Jordan,
        trading cards, etc. The Chicago Bulls star, who is
        arguably responsible for igniting the collectibles
        industry, is still the player to get in 1997. </p>
        <p>Buy two of anything with Jordan on it -- one to play
        with, the other to put away and sell at a flea market at
        outrageous profit years from now. (My talking Jordan doll
        is in the closet.) </p>
        <p><b>NEW BOOK:</b> Sports Collectors Digest has issued
        its ''1997 Standard Catalog of Football, Basketball &amp;
        Hockey Cards.'' The catalog includes card prices for 1996
        releases, including obscure ones that are hard to find in
        monthly card price guides. The 750-page book also
        includes a glossary of hobby terms from ''obverse'' (the
        front of the card displaying the picture) to
        ''skip-numbered'' (card set not numbered in exact
        sequence). In an industry of ever-increasing product and

<HEAD><TITLE>COMEBACK CARDS HOT ITEM IN TRADING</TITLE>
<base href="http://www.knoxnews.com/">
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="/images/flag.gif" ALT="The Knoxville News-Sentinel Online" ></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><I>May  5, 1996</I><TD WIDTH=470><H2>COMEBACK CARDS HOT ITEM IN TRADING</H2>

<i>By Maria Cornelius, Assistant Metro Editor</i>
<P>
Collectors know three things impact the value of a players' sports cards: death, election to a Hall of Fame and retirement. Now, a fourth can be added: comebacks.<P>

   The cards of Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls, Ryne Sandberg of the Chicago Cubs and Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers softened in retirement but have peaked collectors' interest again.<P>

   One of the best comeback cards combined Jordan with NASCAR driver Ernie Irvan. Released in 1995 by Upper Deck SP, it features the NBA star who emerged from retirement in 1995 along with the NASCAR star who nearly died after crashing in Michigan in August 1994. The glossy die-cut card is scarce and currently valued at about $75. If you can find it, buy it.<P>

   Magic's cards, which were issued in several late basketball products, have interested collectors again, particularly younger ones who didn't watch Magic during Showtime. He returned this season to the Lakers after abruptly retiring in 1991 after being diagnosed as HIV positive.<P>

   Sandberg, who left the Cubs two years ago for personal reasons, has returned. His rookie card, the 1983 Topps, is valued at $15-$30 and is trading hands.<P>

   Jordan's rookie card, the 1986-87 Fleer, has collectors seeking it again despite the $800-$1,000 price tag. If you don't collect cards, consider starting a collection with Jordan's cards. If you choose to collect only one player, pick Jordan. Jordan's rookie card was available in 1986 by buying packs costing less than a dollar. Imagine if you had bought a boxful of them.<P>

   <B>BASEBALL PRODUCTS:</B> The most popular baseball releases this year are the Topps and Fleer products. Interestingly, both used throwback themes. Topps reprinted Mickey Mantle's 19 Topps cards, generating an unanticipated reaction from collectors. In addition, some packs contain a mail-in card with the opportunity to win an original Mantle card.<P>

   Fleer 96 featured a novel approach -- use thin cardboard. Fleer brought back the original look with complete major league stats on the backs to the delight of pure collectors. The set also contains 600 cards; that means you get the stars and the no-names. Who knows, that 25 cents card of an obscure player could be the hottest card on the market in five years.

<H2>PLAYERS' IMAGES AFFECT CARD VALUES</H2>

<I>By Maria M. Cornelius, Metro Editor</I><P>

The needle on the moral compass of sports card collecting gravitates toward not only star players, but ones of good character. Ken Griffey Jr. of the Seattle Mariners, Frank Thomas of the Chicago White Sox and Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys not only impress collectors with their skills, but their presence off the playing field.<P>

   The charismatic Griffey and Thomas, who both have embraced the public's affection, are two of the hottest players among baseball card collectors. Smith, who recently graduated from the University of Florida after attending school in the off-season, is a favorite among football card collectors.<P>

   Now consider such players as Barry Bonds and Darryl Strawberry. Bonds of the San Francisco Giants also is a phenomenal talent. However, his surly attitude and cockiness on the field has turned off collectors. His quick start offensively this season has increased interest somewhat in his cards, but he's still several notches below Griffey and Thomas in the eyes -- and pocketbooks -- of collectors.<P>

   Strawberry, after stellar seasons with the New York Mets and forgettable ones with the Los Angeles Dodgers, is now in the independent minor leagues. His drug problems and arrest record have made collectors just about forget him.<P>

   Consider Cleveland Indians left fielder Albert Belle, whose obscene explosions are legendary. His cards are extremely popular; however, they are valued slightly below those of Griffey and Thomas, although Belle is on their level in terms of skill.<P>

   With just a little bit of effort, Belle could become a popular player. Belle card collectors are hoping he will.<P>

   The best example of this trend is Rickey Henderson, the longtime left fielder for the Oakland Athletics now playing for the San Diego Padres. Henderson holds the all-time record for most stolen bases, eclipsing the great Lou Brock's mark in 1991. After swiping third base to set the record while with Oakland, Henderson waved the base above his head and pronounced himself the greatest in front of Brock, who was trying to congratulate him. It was a gross display of ego.<P>

   The cards of Henderson, who recently was named one of the greatest left fielders of all time by Sports Illustrated, should be top dollar. One company even produced a card of Henderson holding up third base moments after the steal. You can buy it for 20 cents. It's overpriced.<P>

   <B>ANNUAL SHOW:</B> The annual Father's Day weekend card show will be June 15-16 at East Towne Mall during mall hours. Former University of Tennessee football player Aaron Hayden, now with the San Diego Chargers, will sign autographs for $8, 2-4 p.m. Sunday.<P>

   <B>UPCOMING SHOWS:</B> Oak Ridge, today, Oak Ridge Mall, 333 Main St., noon-5:30 p.m.; Morristown, June 8-9, College Square Mall, 2550 E. Morris Blvd., Saturday, 10 a.m.-9 p.m., Sunday, noon-6 p.m.; Pigeon Forge, June 22-23, Belz Factory Outlet World, third light on Parkway, Saturday, 9 a.m.-9 p.m., Sunday, 9 a.m.-6 p.m.; and Pigeon Forge, June 28-30, Holiday Inn, Friday and Saturday, 9 a.m.-6 p.m., and Sunday, starts at 10 a.m.<P>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>June 30, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>SHULER'S CARD, CAREER ON SAME 
PATH </h2>
<p><em>By Maria M. Cornelius, Metro Editor</em></p>
<p>When the Washington Redskins start pre-season camp July 17 in Frostburg, 
Md., there's one question on lots of sports card collectors' minds. Is this the 
year quarterback Heath Shuler breaks through in the NFL and displays the 
skills that took him from the University of Tennessee to the first round of the 
draft in 1993?</p>
<p>When Shuler started camp for the Redskins before his rookie season, his 
cards debuted at top dollar. Hobby store owners and card vendors sold 
Shuler's cards nearly as quickly as they came in. The Bryson City, N.C., 
native also was a hit among North Carolina and Washington-area collectors.</p>
<p>Now, his cards are either a bust or the biggest bargain on the market. A 
card that sold three years ago for $20 can be had now for a few dollars. 
Several cards are available for under $1. Autographed items, however, still 
do well with a Shuler-signed official NFL football fetching about $100.</p>
<p>Several collectors have remarked that now is the best time to buy Shuler's 
cards. They're affordable and plentiful. He started slow at UT and then led 
the Vols to victory time after time. Just wait, they say. This will be his 
breakthrough season in the NFL, they say. A lot of people with extensive 
Shuler collections are waiting. And hoping.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKING OF WAITING: </strong>Heath who? You hear that occasionally from 
fans still miffed Shuler went early and whose allegiance then turned to the 
splendidly talented Peyton Manning.</p>
<p>Those in the card business in this area can hardly wait until the day Manning 
turns pro, which could come next spring after his junior season. Manning will 
jolt the card market -- think of the throwback cards of him pictured with his 
famous father and ex-Ole Miss and New Orleans Saints quarterback, 
Archie Manning -- in a way that Shuler never could.</p>
<p>Those cards will be top dollar in the Tennessee and Louisiana markets, the 
city where Peyton Manning plays in the NFL and maybe even Mississippi 
unless people there are still peeved over his picking UT over the Rebels. The 
only place to buy them cheaply may be Canada.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKING OF CANADA: </strong>That's where you call to get the 132-card 
1994 Cuban Serie Selectiva baseball team set. So why would you possibly 
want a set in this year of Team USA Olympic fervor? Well, the April debut 
of this column mentioned cards of players to get now while prices were low. 
One was pitcher Livan Hernandez, the Cuban defector signed by the Florida 
Marlins organization. He's now playing for its Class AA ball club in Portland, 
Maine, and is featured in the set. Also in the set is pitcher Osvaldo 
Fernandez of the San Francisco Giants.</p>
<p>The cards can be obtained by calling 1-800-987-3472. It's a toll-free call to 
Cuban Baseball Cards in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
<p>By the way, another player mentioned in that column was Seattle Mariners 
shortstop Alex Rodriguez, whose cards are rising in value as you read this 
and who is this week's Sports Illustrated coverboy as the ``game's next 
superstar.''</p>
<p><strong>UPCOMING SHOWS:</strong> Cleveland, today, Bradley Square Mall, mall 
hours; Pigeon Forge, today, Holiday Inn, Parkway, 10 a.m.-5 p.m.; 
Maryville, July 13-14, Saturday, 10 a.m.-9 p.m., Sunday, 12:30-5:30 p.m.;

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>August 4, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>NEW SHAQ CARD: SIMPLY EN FUEGO! </h2>
<p><em>By Maria M. Cornelius, News-Sentinel Metro Editor</em> </p>
<p>The recent wave of free agents signing with NBA teams will have collectors 
scurrying to get their latest cards in their new uniforms. </p>
<p>Shaquille O'Neal, already a collector's favorite, will become even more 
sought-after in the large media market of Los Angeles. Right now his cards 
are available in his Louisiana State University, Orlando Magic and Olympic 
team uniforms. The first cards to picture him in Los Angeles Lakers' garb 
will be hot sellers. </p>
<p>While O'Neal's cards are top dollar, a former University of Tennessee 
basketball star is still a bargain. Allan Houston, who emerged last season 
from role player to shooter for the Detroit Pistons, recently signed as a free 
agent with the New York Knicks, another large media market team. </p>
<p>Most of Houston's cards at the beginning of the 1995-96 season were 
available for less than $1. With Houston's new contract and pumped-up 
scoring average, his cards should rise steadily. Buy now while they're cheap. </p>
<p>OTHER CHEAP BUYS: John Smoltz of the Atlanta Braves and Mo 
Vaughn of the Boston Red Sox are undervalued in the card market. Smoltz' 
rookie card sells for $2. Other cards can be found in the $1 to $20 range, 
depending on their scarcity. </p>
<p>Vaughn has proven this season that last year's MVP award was not given to 
him merely because of sportswriters' discontent with the surliness of Albert 
Belle. Although his cards sell for a little more than those of Smoltz, their 
value does not reflect his value to the game. Yet. </p>
<p>GOING, GOING, GONE: Three things affect the value of players' cards: 
comebacks, retirements, and election to a Hall of Fame. Kirby Puckett of 
the Minnesota Twins recently announced his retirement from baseball. His 
cards and memorabilia already sold well. They are rising in value quickly. 
Ozzie Smith of the St. Louis Cardinals is a bargain. Collectors have focused 
on new products and players, and the cards of this future Hall of Famer are 
cheap. Find some now and put them away. </p>
<p>SPORTSCENTER FANS: Pinnacle's Select baseball brand features an En 
Fuego set featuring sportscaster Dan Patrick's commentary about the hottest 
24 players in the game. The 25th card in the set features Patrick with 
commentary by his SportsCenter partner, Keith Olbermann. ``En Fuego'' is 
one of several of Patrick's trademark terms, others being the understated, 
``Gone,'' and the eloquent whisper, ``The Whiff.'' Patrick and Olbermann 
are two reasons to stay up late and watch sports news on television. </p>
<p>AUCTION CLUB: There is a group that meets on the second Monday of 
each month at the Candy Factory at the World's Fair Park. The nonprofit 
auction club's next meeting is Aug. 12 at 7 p.m. on the fourth floor. This is a 
good way to sell and acquire cards. </p>
<p>UPCOMING SHOWS: Pigeon Forge, Aug. 9-11, Belz Factory Outlet 
World, Friday, Saturday, 9 a.m.-9 p.m., Sunday, 9 a.m.-6 p.m.; Kingsport,

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>September 1, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>HOUSTON CARD VALUE GOES UP; 
SHULER'S DROPS </h2>
<p><em>By Maria M. Cornelius, News-Sentinel Metro Editor</em></p>
<p>With the University of Tennessee's football season off to an official start with 
a victory Saturday over Nevada Las Vegas, now seems a good time to 
ponder a question recently posed by a co-worker.</p>
<p>Whose cards of former Vols are best to collect in terms of popularity and 
value?</p>
<p>It is not a long list.</p>
<p>Excellent careers do not always beget hobby success.</p>
<p>The best hope was former UT quarterback Heath Shuler, but his recent 
demotion to second-string quarterback for the Washington Redskins takes 
the shine off his star. He's young, though, and has time to develop into an 
NFL player, if not for the Redskins, for some other team. Maybe the 
Houston/Nashville Oilers will trade for him.</p>
<p>Shuler is now officially a bargain on the market. A lot of dealers in the 
Knoxville area are willing to sell his cards and other memorabilia at lowered 
prices. Those of you with extensive Shuler collections, don't give up. His 
time will come.</p>
<p>The next best hobby prospect is former Vol basketball player Allan 
Houston. His cards already are rising in value based on last year's scoring 
surge and his trade to the Knicks in the large media market of New York.</p>
<p>The question about Houston is, given the sour exit of his father, Wade 
Houston, from the university and the moribund shape of the program he left 
behind, will anyone here care?</p>
<p>As with Shuler, collectors should. Houston is on the verge of becoming one 
of the best young players in the NBA.</p>
<p>Several Vols have shown flashes of NFL stardom -- Charlie Garner, James 
``Little Man'' Stewart and Aaron Hayden -- but have not broken through 
among collectors. Carl Pickens of the Cincinnati Bengals has put up 
impressive receiving statistics, but is not one of the more popular players. 
Alvin Harper was doing well in the hobby as a member of the Dallas 
Cowboys, but has sputtered as a Tampa Bay Buccaneer.</p>
<p>Two former Vols in different sports -- Reggie White of the Green Bay 
Packers and Todd Helton, a Colorado Rockies prospect -- have a chance 
for serious hobby success. A Super Bowl appearance would do wonders 
for White's card values. Helton appears headed to the major leagues within 
two years. His cards also are cheap right now. Take that as a hint. Go get 
some.</p>
<p>Probably the best Vol to collect doesn't have any cards yet. When Peyton 
Manning turns pro, the scrambling by collectors will begin.</p>
<p><strong>ENOUGH OF THE VOLS</strong>: Moving on to baseball and Eddie Murray's 
quest to enter one of the most exclusive clubs in baseball. Going into 
Saturday's game, the Baltimore Orioles first-baseman/designated hitter was 
one home run shy of the 500 Club. Only 14 players in major-league history 
have hit 500 or more home runs, and they're some of the best to play the 
game: Mickey Mantle, Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Frank 
Robinson, to cite a few.</p>
<p>Murray, whose surliness is well-documented but whose talent has never 
been questioned, is headed to the Hall of Fame. Years from now, the value 
of his cards will reflect his accomplishments, not his attitude. His cards are 
available and cheap. Another hint. Go find them.</p>
<p><strong>COMING EVENTS</strong>: Pigeon Forge, Friday-Sunday (Sept. 6-8), Holiday 
Inn Parkway -- Friday-Saturday, 9 a.m.-6 p.m., Sunday, 10 a.m.-6 p.m.; 
Knoxville, Saturday, Holiday Inn, Cedar Bluff Road, 10 a.m.-4 p.m.; and 
Knoxville, World's Fair Park, Candy Factory, fourth floor, Sept. 9 (second 
Monday of each month), nonprofit auction club meets.</p>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>T</font>opps, which captivated baseball card collectors last spring with its 
Mickey Mantle reprint cards, will try to capture interest this fall with Joe 
Namath. </p>
<p>Broadway Joe's 10 original Topps cards have been reprinted and distributed 
in 1996 Topps football packs. The cards are seeded about one every 18 
packs. The reprint of the 1965 rookie card is worth about $20; the other 
nine cards of the former New York Jets quarterback sell for about $5 each. </p>
<p>The Mickey Mantle reprints, a 19-card set, sell for about $150. The reprints 
rejuvenated a soft baseball card market -- weakened by the 1994 strike -- 
and rekindled interest in the original Mantle cards. His 1952 Topps card, in 
mint condition, sells for $25,000-$30,000. </p>
<p>Namath's original rookie card sells for about $1,500-$1,600. It remains to 
be seen if the Namath reprints will carry the football market the way 
Mantle's cards carried baseball. The rookie reprint card is garnering the 
most interest both because it was his first card and because Namath posed 
for it in a hospital. </p>
<p>Namath had a knee operation and was still recuperating when the Jets media 
director arrived at the hospital with a jersey and shoulder pads. The picture 
was taken in a hallway as Namath stood against the wall for support. He had 
lost 27 pounds and looks ghostly in the picture with pale skin, a bony jaw 
and sunken eyes. </p>
<p>He's in position to drop back and pass, but looks as if he couldn't throw the 
ball past his face. It's rather macabre, but it's a hit among collectors. </p>
<p>Other Namath-themed cards in 1996 Topps packs include ''Broadway's 
Review,'' a 10-card set detailing Namath's opinions on current star 
quarterbacks. (Don't look for Heath Shuler in this set.) </p>
<p>The set also includes ''Turf Warriors'' insert cards that are printed on texture 
that feels like artificial turf and ''40th Anniversary'' chase cards that feature 
current players on card designs from 1956 to 1995. </p>
<p>BASEBALL PLAYOFFS: The postseason offers young players a chance to 
solidify themselves among collectors and established players to increase their 
fan base because of national television and print media coverage. </p>
<p>A good showing in the playoffs for the following players would improve their 
status in the hobby: Ken Caminiti of the San Diego Padres; Andy Benes and 
Ozzie Smith of the St. Louis Cardinals; John Smoltz, Terry Pendleton and 
Andruwof the Atlanta Braves; Brady Anderson and B.J. Surhoff of the 
Baltimore Orioles; Derek Jeter and Cecil Fielder of the New York 
Yankees; Kenny Lofton of the Cleveland Indians; Todd Hollandsworth of 
the Los Angeles Dodgers; and Ivan Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez of the 
Texas Rangers. </p>
<p>These are young stars and established veterans who still lag behind the 
superstars such as Chipper Jones of the Braves, Mike Piazza of the Dodgers 
and Cal Ripken of the Orioles among card collectors. A good postseason 
can change that. </p>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>T</font>he New York Yankees took the World Series, but in the card 
collectibles industry, there are winners and losers on both teams. </p>
<p>First, the winners for the Atlanta Braves: </p>
<p>John Smoltz proved why he was the best pitcher in the National League this 
year. His cards have been soft for years while his fellow pitchers took Cy 
Young Awards. With his playoff outings, that should change. </p>
<p>Andruw Jones, who introduced himself in the World Series with home runs 
in his first two at-bats, is the hottest player among collectors now. Dealers 
sell the rookie's cards as quickly as they come in. </p>
<p>Now the losers: </p>
<p>Terry Pendleton had the chance to remind collectors why he was once one 
of the best in the game. Instead, he seemed befuddled at the plate and never 
justified manager Bobby Cox's decision to keep using him as a hitter. Mark 
Wohlers, who established himself in the regular season as an outstanding 
closer, didn't have a good series. </p>
<p>Now for the winners among the Yankees: </p>
<p>Bernie Williams, although he didn't hit in the World Series like he did in the 
American League Championship Series, established himself as a top player. 
The 11-year veteran was virtually unknown outside the New York area, but 
is sure to generate interest elsewhere now. </p>
<p>Darryl Strawberry, who surprised everyone by actually playing defense, did 
a lot to make collectors forget about his checkered past. His cards may 
never reach the same level they did when he was the ''Straw that stirred the 
drink'' with the New York Mets, but he should regain some of his lost status. </p>
<p>Derek Jeter's cards were hot before the playoffs began. He established 
himself in the World Series as a clutch hitter, talented fielder and more 
important with collectors, a charismatic player. Jeter has the chance to join 
the popularity level of outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. and shortstop Alex 
Rodriguez of the Seattle Mariners. </p>
<p>For the Yankees, it's hard to pick a loser. They're world champs. Atlanta, 
0-3 at home, hadn't seen the likes of that wipeout since Gen. Sherman 
marched through. If I had to pick one, it would be Dwight ''Doc'' Gooden, 
who didn't make a Series appearance. His cards have been soft for a while; 
that's unlikely to change. </p>
<p>ENOUGH OF BASEBALL: The NBA is ready to trot out its teams, play a 
long regular season and go through the playoffs before again crowning the 
Chicago Bulls as champs. Michael Jordan will reign, as usual, as the most 
popular player among collectors. There might never be another Jordan in 
terms of collectibility. </p>
<p>However, there are rookies worth collecting. Leading the list is Stephon 
Marbury of the Minnesota Timberwolves, who should play right away with 
his buddy, Kevin Garnett, an excellent second-year player. </p>
<p>The second one is Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia 76ers, who will play 
point guard and allow Jerry Stackhouse, one of the last year's hottest 
rookies, to get free to score. Stackhouse, Garnett and Toronto's Damon 
Stoudamire lead the pack among second-year players in terms of whose 
cards to get now. They are still relatively cheap. So were Jordan's when he 
first came out. </p>
<p>BACK TO BASEBALL: Collectors can see some of the most famous 
vintage cards of this century Thursday, 1-8 p.m. at the Wal-Mart at Walker 
Springs Road. The ''A Day at the Park'' Traveling Sports Memorabilia 
Extravaganza includes the Honus Wagner 1909 T-206 tobacco card, the 
rarest sports card ever with a value of $500,000. Other cards include ones 
of Mickey Mantle and Nolan Ryan. It's not just baseball either with cards of 
Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and His Airness. </p>
<p>COMING SHOWS: Knoxville, Thursday, Holiday Inn, Cedar Bluff Road; 
Knoxville, Nov. 11 (second Monday of month), World's Fair Park, Candy 
Factory, fourth floor, nonprofit card auction club, 7 p.m., open to public; 
and Kingsport, Nov. 29-Dec. 1, Kingsport Mall, mall hours. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">T</font>his is the best time of year for
        sports card collectors. And that's not just because it's
        the holiday season, and collectibles and packs and boxes of
        cards make great gifts. </p>
        <p>It's also the time of year when the major sports'
        seasons -- football, basketball and hockey -- converge
        and baseball's spring training is not too far off. </p>
        <p>Besides, the major card companies have 1997 baseball
        card products coming out in December. Topps, which did so
        well last spring with its <b>Mickey Mantle</b> insert
        cards, is reviving the theme and including Mantle and <b>Willie
        Mays</b> cards in the 1997 releases. Topps will insert
        Mays' autographed reprint cards at random in hobby packs,
        but not retail packs. Hobby packs can be bought at any
        area card dealer<b> </b>store. </p>
        <p>The product is due out by mid-December. This would
        make a great stocking stuffer. </p>
        <p><b>MORE GIFT-BUYING IDEAS:</b> In football, the
        players to get are <b>Dan Marino</b> of the Miami
        Dolphins and <b>John Elway</b> of the Denver Broncos. Elway's
        cards softened a bit, but interest is peaking again. Both quarterbacks
        are future Hall of Famers. Their cards are reasonably
        priced now, but they won't be in a few years. Go find
        some. This would make a great present. </p>
        <p>In basketball, the No. 1 player is, as always, <b>Michael
        &127;Jordan.</b> The former University of North Carolina
        Tar Heel leads all hot lists. </p>
        <p>Some of his cards may seem expensive now, but they
        will look like bargains in a few years. A scarce Jordan
        card would make someone's Christmas. </p>
        <p>The hottest hockey player is<b> Wayne Gretzky</b> of
        the New York Rangers. </p>
        <p>Like Elway, his cards softened a bit, but his
        long-term value has been established. Look for his cards
        to generate even more interest now that he plays in a
        major market. </p>
        <p>Two other desirable players for collectors are and <b>Joe
        Sakic</b> -- the biggest stars of the Colorado
        Avalanche's march to the Stanley Cup championship last
        season. </p>
        <p><b>THE GIVING SEASON:</b> Most collectors have excess
        cards, duplicates, etc., that end up stored in closets
        and drawers. Think about donating those cards to
        hospitals and charitable organizations to be given to
        children. A shoe box of sports cards can provide hours of
        enjoyment for a bedridden sick child this holiday season. </p>
        <p>The December issue of Beckett Baseball lists addresses
        of hospitals that accept cards. Also check with area
        hospitals to inquire about donations. </p>
        <p><b>COOL NEW PRODUCT:</b> One of the most exciting
        things about collecting is keeping up with the innovative
        ideas of the cards companies. </p>
        <p>Pacific trading card company has released Litho-Cel
        football cards. The litho card shows a player in rather
        dull colors framed in a circle. The cell card, when
        placed over the litho card, brings out the colors. The
        cards are collectible as a set or individually. </p>
        <p><b>BENEFIT SHOW:</b> A sports cards and comics show
        will be Saturday and Sunday at the Tennessee School for
        the Deaf in the Akin Gymnasium, 2725 Island Home Blvd. </p>
        <p>Admission is $1 with all proceeds going to TSD's
        summer camp program for deaf and hearing-impaired
        children across the state. The admission fee includes a
        free collectible item. </p>
        <p>Saturday hours are 9 a.m.-6 p.m.; Sunday, noon-7 p.m.
        Lowell Cunningham, author of the ''Men in Black'' comic,
        will sign free autographs 2-4 p.m. Saturday. </p>
        <p><b>OTHER COMING SHOWS/EVENTS:</b> <b>Kingsport,</b>
        today, Kingsport Mall, Eastman Road and Stone Drive, mall
        hours; <b>Chattanooga,</b> Friday-Sunday, Eastgate Mall,
        mall hours; <b>Knoxville,</b> Dec. 9 (second Monday of
        month), World's Fair Park, Candy Factory, fourth floor, nonprofit
        card auction club, 7 p.m., open to public; <b>Kingsport,</b>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->        <font size="5">T</font>ELLURIDE, Colo. -- Skiing will
        never be cheap but discounts are flying faster than the
        leaves are falling off the aspens in the high country. </p>
        <p>''Across the board, ski areas have had a reality
        check,'' says Mike Shimkonis, spokesman for Telluride, a
        resort popular with stars and the mega-rich. </p>
        <p>Shimkonis says competition for skiers in a flat market
        is more intense than he's ever seen it during his decade
        in the industry. ''We're trying to build loyalty here,''
        says Shimkonis. </p>
        <p>''No one in their right mind should pay a full,
        walk-up window rate,'' he adds. </p>
        <p>Even Aspen, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary
        and will hang onto its Mercedes-Benz image with a
        nation-high $56 lift ticket, is offering a discount card
        for local skiers and reduced lift ticket prices for young
        adults. </p>
        <p>Resorts across the West have similar programs. Some
        are aimed at in-state skiers and cannot be purchased
        without a visit to the resort or nearby cities. Others
        are sold over the phone. Some resorts offer separate
        cards for destination skiers. </p>
        <p>Shimkonis says competition for destination skiers is
        even fiercer than the battle for local skiers. They spend
        more money. </p>
        <p>Shimkonis and Rob McSkimming, director of the dual
        mountain program at Whistler-Blackcomb in British
        Columbia, say skiers should shop around and make sure
        they phone the resorts themselves. </p>
        <p>Telluride, for example, will offer five nights of
        lodging and four days of skiing from Jan. 4 to Feb. 7 for
        $387 per person based on double occupancy. Other resorts
        offer similar packages outside peak periods. </p>
        <p>Skiers who head to Reno, Nev., can get good deals on
        rooms during the winter season, an hour from Lake Tahoe's
        ski resorts. </p>
        <p>Shimkonis says Telluride, working with its local
        resort association, may offer special deals during the
        year if it appears there will be empty beds. </p>
        <p>Not only are ski areas competing on prices, the battle
        to get people on the hill faster also is intensifying.
        Real estate deals such as the sale of land to developers
        for the new $70 million Franz Klammer private club at
        Telluride are helping finance the improvements. </p>
        <p>Resorts also are hoping the much-ballyhooed parabolic
        or hourglass skis will get more new skiers on the slopes
        more often, and keep the aging Baby Boomers on their
        boards. </p>
        <p>Lito Tejeda-Flores, ski instructor and author of
        ''Breakthrough on Skis,'' says the new skis ''are very
        useful in helping skiers feel the sensation of a pure
        carved turn. For the most part, they are not that much
        fun for very strong skiers . . . .'' </p>
        <p>Vail, which battles Whistler-Blackcomb for bragging
        rights on lift capacity, spent $30 million this past
        summer on on-mountain improvements to make itself over.
        Its high-speed capacity from the base area has increased
        50 percent. </p>
        <p>That includes a faster, heated gondola. Even music is
        provided, and Vail plans to let groups rent their own
        gondola car. </p>
        <p>The resort also will assign a staff member as a sort
        of concierge on a daily flight from Newark, N.J., to
        Eagle County's airport, 30 miles from Vail. The airport
        will offer more than 100 non-stop flights a week this
        winter. </p>
        <p>It's too early to tell what impact Vail's planned
        merger with neighboring Summit County resorts will have
        this season. If approved by the Justice Department, a
        joint ticket allowing skiers to choose among Vail, Beaver
        Creek, Breckenridge, Keystone, or Arapahoe Basin is a
        possibility. </p>
        <p>Whistler-Blackcomb, where some skiers claim they can
        get 50,000 feet of vertical in one day, has substituted a
        gondola for a covered high-speed quad involved in an
        accident that claimed two lives last year. The U.S.
        dollar has remained strong against the Canadian, making
        the resorts a good deal for Americans, says McSkimming. </p>
        <p>Telluride is opening a free, public transit gondola
        that will connect the town, Mountain Village and an
        outlying parking lot. The aim is to cut down on vehicle
        traffic, clean up the air pollution that afflicts many
        mountain towns and give it a sort of European flavor. </p>
        <p>''In order to have the best resort in America we need
        something like this,'' says Telluride President Jim
        Wells. </p>
        <p>Park City, Utah, has replaced its four-person,
        high-speed Prospector Chair with the six-person
        Silverlode, the first of its kind in the Rockies. The
        lift is so fast ''Park City guests will have to put on
        goggles on the ride up,'' says resort President Phil
        Jones. </p>
        <p>Deer Valley has replaced the fixed grip Wasatch and
        Carpenter lifts with a high-speed quad. It also appears
        to take the title of highest lift ticket price: $55 for a
        ticket bought at the window during Christmas Week. </p>
        <p>Powder hounds will look long and hard to find a better
        price deal than Grand Targhee, Wyo., on the other side of
        the Grand Tetons from Jackson Hole. Targhee has installed
        its first high-speed quad. Last year it got more than 600
        inches of snow but had only 117,000 skier days, roughly
        what Vail and Whistler-Blackcomb draw during the
        Christmas season. </p>
        <p>''People love Targhee for the snow, but all the snow
        in the world doesn't do any good if you can't access it.
        People don't tolerate long lift lines and long lift rides
        any more,'' says Targhee's Bobby Foster. </p>
        <p>Loveland, within a snowball's distance of Interstate
        70 and 45 minutes from Denver, is celebrating its 60th
        year of operation by replacing one of its double chairs
        with a fixed-grip quad. </p>
        <p>Big Sky in Montana, whose skier days increased 25
        percent last year with the addition of a tram, is
        replacing an aging gondola with a faster quad. </p>

		<strong>Photos by Wynne Brown and Hedley Bond</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4">I</font>n September my husband, Hedley
        Bond, and I hauled our horse to Utah so I could do the
        Outlaw Historical Endurance Ride. The five-day 265-mile
        event goes through the Aquarius Plateau, the Escalante
        River canyon, Little Desert and part of the new Escalante-Grand
        Staircase Monument recently set aside by President Clinton. </p>
        <p>This endurance ride is not like most. According to the
        brochure, the trail offers an experience that is ''way
        beyond the comfort zone.'' For many of the riders who
        come from around the world, the primary goal is to be an
        ''Outlaw:'' one rider who completes all five days on the same
        horse. </p>
        <p>My goal was to ride as much as Salazar could handle
        without being overstressed -- be it one day or five. He's
        15, considered middle-age for a horse, and is a
        particularly easygoing Arabian. We have 11 years of
        endurance riding experience together. He travels well: He unloaded
        willingly every four to five hours all the way
        cross-country and camped in a corral that attaches to the
        trailer. The front of the trailer has living quarters for
        us. </p>
        <p>Arriving </p>
        <p>The last 50 miles to Teasdale winds across the great
        red spine of the Escalante mountains, up and down deep
        scarlet clefts, through patches of aspens just turning
        gold at 9,500 feet. It's glorious -- and a valuable sneak
        preview of this rugged high country I'm about to ride. </p>
        <p>Endurance riding is partly about overcoming fear. Fear
        of falling off a cliff. Fear of getting lost for hours --
        or maybe days. Fear of skulking home and having to say,
        ''I couldn't do it.'' </p>
        <p>I sure hope Salazar and I are ready for this. </p>
        <p>At noon, we pull onto a windy hilltop in Teasdale and
        see a banner announcing the ''Outlaw Historical Endurance
        Ride.'' We immediately run into the only other
        Southeastern riders, Jim Barnett and his son, Duane.
        Twelve states are represented, and top international
        riders are here from Brazil, Hungary, Germany, France and
        Canada. </p>
        <p>Many endurance riders take a crew who helps them at
        vet checks. I like riding ''solo,'' which pleases Hedley
        who says he is Not a Horse Person. (He is a long-distance
        bike rider and an ex-marathon runner.) At the Outlaw
        Ride, each day's route ends in a different place and Hedley's
        role is to get our rig to each new camp. </p>
        <p>I get checked and vetted in and scramble around
        preparing for a 6 a.m. pre-dawn departure. There's also a
        dusting of new snow on the mountain behind camp. </p>

        </table>At the ride briefing that evening Crockett Dumas talks
        about the area's history and the local outlaws (including
        Butch Cassidy). He and his wife Sharon are from Vadito,
        M.M., and have been running this ride since 1977, and
        they advertise it as the ''Ultimate Endurance Adventure.''
        President Clinton's decision to change this area to wilderness
        may mean the last year for the ride in this location,
        which adds a special poignancy.
        <p>Sharon goes over the trail, reminding us that there's
        no access for emergency vehicles. The veterinarians warn
        riders with low-altitude horses to monitor our animals
        carefully. </p>
        <p>We'll leave at 6 a.m. following Crockett at a
        controlled trot. Once it's light enough to see the trail
        markings (chalk marks on rocks or branches), riders can
        go at their own pace. </p>
        <p>The group breaks up, and camp is quiet soon after
        dark. </p>
        <p>Day 1 </p>
        <p>Five a.m. comes quickly and we head out single file. I
        spend the day riding with Marilyn Bickley from Park City,
        Utah. </p>
        <p>From the pinon-juniper habitat, we climb steadily
        until we're in aspens, leaves scattered underfoot like
        gold coins and deep blue lakes far below us. The ''Rim
        Trail'' is well-named: we're on a shelf, safe enough, but
        the trees below are such small specks that my stomach lurches
        a little every time I look. We soon run out of ''big''
        words: ''magnificent'' and ''vast'' seem flat. </p>
        <p>The trail gets steeper, and I get off to ''tail,''
        unhooking one rein and hanging onto Salazar's tail as he
        marches over the rocks fast enough that I'm almost at a
        jog. I have no signs of altitude sickness, but I'm out of
        breath. The trail becomes skinnier, steeper, and there's
        snow under trees and in rock crevices. </p>
        <p>The last pull to Boulder Top is a mile-long slope of
        jumbled rock. Salazar takes it at an even pace, always
        on-trail, with me hanging on to his tail for all I'm
        worth. </p>
        <p>The top is a series of flat meadows, </p>
        <p>some four or five miles long and two miles wide, all
        edged with spiky-looking dark firs. The wind whistles
        around my helmet -- I'm grateful for Polartec. </p>
        <p>In late afternoon Hedley meets us, having run 10
        miles. The trail drops off the mountain down a rocky
        escarpment, and Salazar has to pick his way through
        jagged boulders being careful not to jam a hoof. I need
        both hands for balance. In an act of ultimate trust, I
        toss the rein over the saddle, and we work our way down
        the mountain with him in front picking his way and me
        several yards behind him. </p>
        <p>Back into aspens the trail becomes a mudslide. Salazar
        tucks his hindquarters and calmly skis down. I try the
        same thing and end up on my butt. </p>
        <p>The vet check finally appears on top of another cold
        windy hill. Salazar dives into the hay, apples, carrots
        and bran, provided by ride management. The vet checks
        Salazar and Bickley's horse and says they both look
        great. </p>
        <p>Ten miles to go. We climb back on, cold, stiff and
        ready for camp. It's getting close to dark. </p>
        <p>At last the Chriss Lake camp is in sight, and the
        horses perk up. We cross the finish line 12.5 hours after
        starting. Salazar's back is sore, but he's fine to go out
        again the next day. Aside from a headache and being
        bone-tired, the rider half of the team seems OK. </p>
        <p>By 10, Hedley, Salazaar and I are asleep. </p>
        <p>Day 2 </p>
        <p>It's COLD and pitch-dark at 5 a.m., but I'm
        surprisingly limber and ready to ride. </p>
        <p>We cover 6-8 miles of mostly flat terrain with
        ankle-deep red sand. Everyone chats and grizzles
        good-naturedly about yesterday's trail. </p>
        <p>The trail becomes several miles of the dreaded ''slick
        rock,'' which isn't slick at all but is creamy-yellow
        sheets and rolls of sandstone with the texture of sand
        paper. It looks scary, but the horses' feet can grip well
        enough to trot and even canter. </p>
        <p>More miles of sand and juniper to the vet check, which
        is in the Boulder motel parking lot. Hedley says tourists
        have been intrigued all morning (''an endurance what?''). </p>
        <p>The vet checks Salazar's back: ''Looks real good''
        brings relief! </p>
        <p>Jim Barnett and I head out to cross 20 more miles of
        slick rock. An incredible area: An almost alien landscape
        with yellow-white gullies and towers stretching to a
        backdrop of red-orange mountains that fade to blue. We
        slither down into canyons and clamber back out for more
        miles of the same, alternately riding, tailing, leading. </p>
        <p>There is little vegetation, so the trail is marked
        with piles of rocks. The sun beats down off the cliff
        faces, and it's warm in a T-shirt. All I can hear is the
        wind, which never stops, and the grating of Salazar's
        shoes on the soft rock. </p>
        <p>Fear? </p>
        <p>No. I am deeply, purely happy, and my face hurts from
        smiling. </p>
        <p>After three or four hours, we slide down a rutted
        crevice into the Escalante River canyon. </p>
        <p>Dark red cliffs now tower above us. Flash floods came
        through last week, wiping out the trail and leaving
        thickets of Russian olive, armed with inch-long thorns.
        Wading down the riverbed seems easiest, if circuitous,
        but that route loses its appeal early on when Jim's horse disappears
        to the belly in quicksand. They flounder out, unhurt, and we
        eye the water route suspiciously from then on. </p>
        <p>After an hour or two, we catch up with other riders,
        some bleeding, one missing his glasses, all of us
        wondering: How much more? </p>
        <p>My smile is gone. </p>
        <p>More hours and the canyon walls fade to grayish-brown.
        The river bottom widens to a road. Jim is burnt bright
        red, my lips feel permanently chapped and we drain my
        fourth water bottle. But the horses seem to know we're
        almost done, and they trot strongly through town, now
        more alien to us than the slick rock. </p>
        <p>The days finish line is on the race track of Escalante
        Desert Downs, and Hedley has camp all set up. The vets
        say Salazar is ''a little stiff in front, his back is
        better than yesterday and otherwise he's fine.'' I'm so thrilled
        I forget I'm tired. </p>
        <p>We eat our spaghetti dinner in the grandstand with
        Marilyn, who spent the day recovering from a cold, and
        her friend Moone Willetts, whose mementos from the river
        include a gashed nose, two blackening eyes and a bruised
        chin. </p>
        <p>We laugh, swap tales, drink and eat some more. The
        moon, one day from full, rises over the valley in the
        half-light of dusk. </p>
        <p>What a day. </p>
        <p>What a horse! </p>
        <p>Day 3 </p>
        <p>Today starts with a silent 4-mile ride through the
        Little Desert, honoring endurance riders and horses who
        have died. ''Ghost Riders in the Sky'' plays softly as we
        leave the racetrack. Sparks jump as the horses' shoes
        strike the pavement. </p>
        <p>We head up a stony ridge until the first lights of
        Escalante are below us. The eastern sky begins to gleam,
        spotlit by Venus. All is silent except for the swish of
        hooves through sand, the occasional clink of a metal shoe
        against rock. Salazar trots strong. </p>
        <p>The sun appears and we try to get our antsy horses to
        stand still for a Kodak moment, and another picture is
        filled with equine eartips. </p>
        <p>The group spreads out, and we climb and climb back up
        into the aspens and open slopes. The chalk marks have
        washed off in last week's rain, and Duane Barnett and I
        take a couple of wrong turns. Then we realize his mare is
        lame. He urges me to go on without him, but we stay
        together to Griffin Top, another 11,200 plateau where the markings
        are few and far between, the wind rips - and it's
        sleeting at the vet check. </p>
        <p>Salazar gets the OK to go, and Judy Saunders and Ron
        Savard, from Ontario, and Janin Cameron from California
        welcome another pair of eyes to help hunt for markers. </p>
        <p>Twenty miles to go. </p>
        <p>As the afternoon goes on, I have a sneaking feeling
        that Salazar isn't quite sound. We alternate between
        riding, tailing and leading as the trail rollercoasts
        along the spines of six long red ridges dotted with white
        rock outcrops and bristlecone pines. In the distance are
        vast miles of more red rock country. </p>
        <p>Finally, there's the Canadian crew: ''Only three miles
        to go!'' they tell us. </p>
        <p>We trot a flat sandy trail that winds through the
        rabbitbrush, and within several yards I know something's
        wrong. Salazar is eager but short-strided. I make him
        walk (marvelling that he wants to trot after 165 miles),
        worrying, but also relishing the solitude, the silence,
        the evening light. </p>
        <p>About a mile from camp Hedley meets us, and we finish
        in a time of 11 hours. Once in camp, I realize Salazar
        has ''scratches,'' a form of dermatitis, above his hoofs.
        Although the vet says we can go out the next day, I smear
        on Desitin and decide on a day off. Salazar's done three
        hard travel days, followed by three hard riding days back-to-back. </p>
        <p>Besides, I'd really like to hike Bryce Canyon with
        Hedley. </p>
        <p>Day 4 </p>
        <p>We're camped at Widstoe, a ghost town settled by
        Mormons who were ''droughted out.'' At 5 a.m., there's
        ice on the water buckets. </p>
        <p>The riders mill around, illuminated by lanterns and
        the occasional headlights, then leave in a cloud of dust.
        Hedley and I retreat to the warm camper and a real
        breakfast. We pack up, drive to the next night's campsite
        and get Salazar settled in. </p>
        <p>Bryce Canyon is only 30 minutes -- and a world --
        away. After the solitude and athleticism of the last
        three days, the busloads of overweight tourists make us
        feel like some weird other species. But the canyon itself
        is magnificent. </p>
        <p>Hedley and I walk down past layer upon layer of
        spires, towers and ''hoodoos'' that almost glow in the
        early afternoon light, well worth missing a day of
        riding. </p>
        <p>We head back to camp where Salazar paws the ground
        impatiently. I get the message he's ready to go out
        again, and the vet agrees. </p>
        <p>After dinner, we all stand around a welcome fire,
        laughing, chatting and taking in the lunar eclipse. </p>
        <p>Day 5 </p>
        <p>Today is an easy day, so we don't leave until a
        leisurely 7 a.m.. The moon sinks in front of us as the
        sun rises behind. Many horses get stronger on a multi-day
        ride an, and Salazar is no exception. </p>
        <p>Once we reach the Pahrea River Canyon, I linger,
        wanting this final day to last. We cross and re-cross the
        ankle-deep river -- fortunately free of quicksand. </p>
        <p>The Barnetts catch up and we ride slowly together for
        several miles, enjoying the day. Salazar feels too good
        to walk, so we trot on alone. The canyon widens out, the
        cliffs turn from tan to pink, then shrink to hills. We
        cross the river one last time to the vet check. As I trot
        him out, the vet comments, ''Who's leading who?'' </p>
        <p>Twelve and a half miles to go. </p>
        <p>We come to the old Pahria Movie Set where ''The Life
        and Times of Josie Wells'' was filmed. A handful of
        tourists look disappointed that I'm not wearing chaps and
        cowboy hat. I tip my helmet and trot on through. </p>
        <p>Salazar asks to canter. I'm so proud of both of us it
        brings tears. </p>
        <p>Seven or eight miles later, a lone form appears. Who
        else would be out here in the desert on foot? Salazar
        nickers and, after a celebratory picture (Kodak should
        sponsor this ride), the three of us trot on, Hedley in
        the lead. </p>
        <p>We pass the two French riders and then a Brazilian,
        and then, after 210 miles in five days, Salazar breaks
        into a canter and we cross the finish line, accompanied
        by cheers from the waiting crowd. </p>
        <p>I'm in tears again. </p>
        <p>Eight weeks later and the spell of the Outlaw Trail is
        still with me. </p>
        <p>Visualizing those sandstone cliffs, still hearing the
        wind's whistle at Griffin Top, feeling Salazar asking to
        canter that last mile -- all those memories help put the
        tribulations, and yes, the fears, of ''Real Life'' into
        perspective. Many events fail to live up to their
        billing. But the Outlaw Ride, for me, was truly the
        ''Ultimate Endurance Adventure.'' </p>
        <p>Next year is Hedley's year to pick a trip and I'll
        crew for him. But after that? </p>
        <p>My calendar's marked for Outlaw '98.</p>

        <p>PLEASANT HILL, KY. -- ''By giving hearts to God and
        putting their hands to work, they wrought wonders in this
        land,'' a 19th-century visitor to backwoods Kentucky
        observed of the Pleasant Hill Shakers. </p>
        <p>They cultivated grain fields and fruit orchards and
        built massive stone houses, all in their quest for a
        perfect society. This serene, near-perfect setting
        remains for visitors to enjoy. The rolling bluegrass
        farmland south of Lexington features mile upon mile of
        stacked stone fences, black painted barns, clapboard
        houses and fields crowned with solitary oaks. </p>
        <p>Horses graze without a care. Weathervanes proclaim the
        region's bounty from atop cupolaed barn. Trucks laden
        with bundled tobacco move at a snail's pace along the
        serpentine, two-lane roads. A gray, corrugated metal building
        retains faint lettering marking it as a distillery gone
        dry. </p>
        <p>As in the past, Shaker Village at Pleasant Hill is a
        refuge. Every year, thousands of visitors discover its
        tranquility and beautiful vistas. </p>
        <p>For nearly 30 years, the Shaker Village has operated
        as a living history museum. Collections of Shaker
        furniture and artifacts are on display in 14 buildings
        and working craftspeople and costumed interpreters give demonstrations
        of trades and life in the 1850s. </p>
        <p>The village offers overnight accommodations in 15
        restored buildings. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are
        served daily. Shaker Village is located seven miles
        northeast of Harrodsburg on U.S. Highway 68. </p>
        <p>The Shakers, a religious sect formally called the
        United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing,
        moved into the untamed Kentucky frontier and built the
        community at Pleasant Hill in the early 1800s. They lived
        a communal, celibate life. Brethren and sisters resided
        in separate family dwellings, though they met in common
        houses for meals and worship services. They had separate
        entranceways and staircases for the men and women. </p>
        <p><img src="images/shaker2.jpg"
        alt="During religious ceremonies, they &quot;shook out&quot; their sins."
        align="left" hspace="7" vspace="7" width="250"
        height="256">These industrious people became known
        throughout the South for their fresh produce, </p>
        <p><font size="2"><strong>Joyous hymns and lively, unrestrained
        dances are performed by costumed interpreters so visitors
        can understand the heritage of the Shakers. During religious
        ceremonies, they ''shook out'' their sins. </strong></font></p>
        <p>preserves, seeds, aromatic and medicinal herbs, animal husbandry
        and crafts, such as brooms and straw bonnets. The ''Shaker-made''
        emblem was a hallmark of high quality. Landholdings at Pleasant
        Hill grew to 4,500 acres. In the 1830s it was a thriving
        community of 500 residents. </p>
        <p>Their prosperity was shattered by the Civil War.
        Markets and supply lines for Shaker goods were in
        upheaval, so money became very scarce. Thousands upon
        thousands of war-weary Union and Confederate soldiers were
        fed and outfitted by the generous farmers and craftsmen.
        The pacifist Shakers were dictated by their own law never
        to turn anyone away who needed help. For this they ''got
        nothing but thanky,'' one journal records. Armies on both
        sides conscripted their food, cattle, horses, wagons and boats. </p>
        <p>This Shaker society, as well as other religious sects
        around the country, fell into decline as the century
        waned. In 1910 the Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill closed
        its doors. The land, buildings and possessions were
        auctioned and the Pleasant Hill community along the old
        turnpike became just a small country village called
        ''Shakertown'' until historical restoration began in 1961.
        In 1972, Pleasant Hill was the first historic site
        designated a National Historic Landmark from boundary to
        boundary. It includes 2,700 acres of original land and 33
        restored buildings. </p>
        <p>The legacy of the Shakers was never lost. ''We Make
        You Kindly Welcome'' was the greeting 150 years ago, and
        so it continues. </p>
        <p>The tradition of a Southern country kitchen brings
        many guests to the Trustees House dining room. Sirloin
        steak, filet of sole, country ham and chicken are on the
        menu along with a Shaker dish of the day. An appetizer specialty
        is egg in aspic on anchovy toast and a dessert of renown
        is Shaker lemon pie. Choices of salads and vegetables are
        offered with each entree, and relishes and hot breads are
        brought to the table. The wooden tables are set with
        candles in hurricane shades. </p>
        <p>An outstanding craft heritage continues. Artisans
        using old and new tools engage in broom-making,
        coopering, spinning and weaving. Their items and other
        Kentucky-made crafts are sold at two sales shops. </p>
        <p>Farming, the main livelihood of the Shakers, is
        demonstrated by hand-milking, sheep shearing and use of a
        yoke of oxen and horse-drawn equipment. Behind white
        picket fences, herb gardens are fragrant and colorful
        with lemon balm, lavender, basil, marshmallow,
        loosestrife, horehound, feverfew, angelica, American
        pennyroyal and butterfly weed. </p>
        <p>A self-guided tour includes educational exhibits, such
        as ''Thread of a Culture,'' a Shaker quilt and textile
        display, as well as an award-winning video ''Into a More
        Perfect Order.'' In the 40-room Centre Family Dwelling, a
        visitor can take part in open-hearth cooking or learn to
        bake with a beehive oven. </p>
        <p>At the Meeting House, performers sing the joyous
        Shaker hymns. (Back then, some onlookers, who were more
        straight-laced than the Shakers, called the songs ''dance
        hall music.'') Now visitors can catch a glimpse of Shaker
        religious services. Performers portray the Shakers as
        they whirled and trembled to ''shake off'' their sins. <img
        src="images/shaker3.jpg" align="right" hspace="7"
        vspace="7" width="250" height="204"></p>
        <p>Within the village, handsome limestone, brick and
        clapboard buildings stand to either side of </p>
        <p><font size="2"><strong>Shaker architecture displays an unadorned
        beauty and respect for practicality. </strong></font></p>
        <p>a tree-lined road. The dictums of Shaker architecture
        called for unadorned beauty and respect for practicality. Massive
        brick chimneys are prominent and windows are plentiful
        and symmetrically arranged. Architects credit the Shakers
        for their remarkable ''sense of place'' and it is
        apparent from the masterful craftsmanship that the Shakers'
        quest for perfection set them apart from others. </p>
        <p>The 80 guest rooms in restored structures are
        furnished with Shaker-inspired reproduction pieces,
        handwoven rugs and electrified candles. Interiors are
        painted a vibrant blue, cinnamon red and creamy white and
        decoration is limited to bittersweet sprigs and
        handcrafted wrought iron. The rooms' simplicity is unique
        and very far afield from ornate Victorian furnishings of
        the same era. </p>
        <p>The village also has meeting areas where workshops are
        held on a variety of topic that include nature studies,
        history, quilting, weaving, oval box making, photography,
        farming and herbs. </p>
        <p>Walking trails radiate to the Kentucky River and the
        Shawnee Run Creek. Autumn breezes blow across fields of
        prairie switchgrass, smooth beardstone, sneezeweed and
        wild bergamot. Hedge apples have fallen on the gravel
        path. Wildflowers are making their final showing before a
        first frost. </p>
        <p>A 150-passenger sternwheeler plies the Kentucky River
        from Shaker Landing. Long ago, this busy river stop took
        Shaker goods to New Orleans, La., and Natchez, Miss., and
        smaller towns across the South. Nowadays, tourists climb
        aboard the ''Dixie Belle'' for a leisurely cruise through
        spectacular scenery. The tours run from late April
        through October. </p>
        <p>The historic village is operated by as a non-profit,
        educational corporation and is governed by a board of
        trustees. It receives no government funding. An admission
        fee is charged to tour the village. Children five years
        of age and under are admitted free when accompanied by an
        adult. Winter rates for room accommodations are available
        January through March. </p>
        <p>More than 150,000 people visit Shaker Village each
        year. Special events include Civil War re-enactments,
        craft fairs, harvest festivals, ''The Shakers'' by the
        Louisville Ballet and Christmas tableaux. For
        information, call 606 734-5411. For guest room
        reservations, call 800 734-5611. </p>

        <p>Lobsters are served just about everywhere in coastal

        <p>Lobster are everywhere. Even fast food franchises
        advertise ''Lobster, ff, coleslaw for $5.49.'' Lobster
        emblems decorate license plates and serve as car hood
        ornaments. </p>

        <font size="5">S</font>TRASBOURG, France </p>
        <p>hen the Romans set up a military camp on the Rhine
        River in 12 B.C., they called it Strateburgum, or ''town
        of the roads.'' Throughout the ages, Strasbourg has
        remained a city at the crossroads. </p>
        <p>Because of its central location in Europe, and because
        it lies within reach of Alsace, Strasbourg has been the
        spoils of war between Germany and France for 300 years. </p>
        <p>It started out as a free city under the Holy Roman
        Empire and flourished during the Middle Ages and
        Renaissance. The city became a gathering place for
        artists, intellectuals and politicians. Guttenberg worked
        on his invention of printing here and Napoleon, Goethe
        and Metternich all studied at the university. </p>
        <p>Strasbourg became French in 1681 when Louis IV's
        troops marched into town. It became part of the German
        Empire following the 1870 siege, was returned to France
        in 1918 after World War I, and was occupied by Germany
        from 1940 until 1944 when it was once again returned to
        France. </p>
        <p>The people of this region have changed nationalities
        numerous times, but when asked they say they are
        Alsatian, according to local resident and guide Leslie
        Velkjovik. </p>
        <p>Strasbourg is still a gathering place. Since 1949, the
        city has been the seat of the Council of Europe. Its port
        on the Rhine, which is on the site of the original Roman
        port, is the second largest on the river after Duisberg. </p>
        <p>Because of its location, Strasbourg is an ideal
        stopping off place for Rhine River cruise passengers who
        want to experience the region of Alsace. Rail connections
        are easily made from here to other parts of Europe. </p>
        <p>Although its urban area has a population of 400,000,
        Strasbourg itself remains the small city of its past.
        Walking is the best way to experience the city, and the
        cathedral is the easiest place to start. </p>
        <p>The cathedral was 400 years in the making, and by the
        time it was finished in 1439, its single spire made it
        the tallest building in the Christian world until the
        last century. </p>
        <p>''The city was wealthy during the 1400s, and they
        wanted to build the highest spire in the empire,''
        Velkjovik said. ''Later, when the Germans wanted to add a
        second one, the townspeople refused because the single spire
        had become the symbol of the city.'' </p>
        <p>Work on the cathedral is a never-ending project. The
        statues constantly need care as does the stone exterior
        of the building. During the war, the stained glass
        windows were removed for safekeeping. </p>
        <p>The fun of visiting Strasbourg is to wander the tiny
        streets, looking into shops that sell typical Alsatian
        goods, such as pottery, or sit in an outdoor cafe in one
        of the many small squares. </p>
        <p>The prettiest section of town is La Petite France, a
        five-minute walk from the cathedral. Cars are not allowed
        here and to stroll among the narrow streets is like going
        back in time 300 years. </p>
        <p>Half-timbered buildings are reflected in the calm
        waters of the Ill River, and their overhanging stories
        reach out across the twisty streets. La Petite France was
        the district of millers and tanners; while merchants and tradesmen
        lived near the cathedral. </p>
        <p>Tiny dormer windows were built into the steep roofs to
        provide ventilation for the food and hides that were kept
        in the attics. Basements could not be built because of
        the water table level, so the people built attics
        instead. </p>
        <p>Dining in Strasbourg is a pleasure, partly because
        this is France but also because Alsace is wine country.
        ''Winstub'' restaurants offer regional dishes at
        reasonable prices. They are usually decorated in the
        style of the region, with lace curtains and dark wooden
        interiors. </p>
        <p>Most have a fixed-price menu that includes several
        courses for one price. A typical Alsatian meal might
        include ''choucroute'' (sauerkraut with sausage, potatoes
        and vegetables), quiche, plum pie and wine. </p>
        <p>A night cruise on the Ill and its canal is a fitting
        conclusion to the day. The lighted buildings and churches
        are reflected in the water and now and then a swan glides
        into the path of light. </p>
        <p>Strasbourg is a good starting point for a tour of the
        wine road of Alsace. From Marlenheim to Thann, between
        the Vosges mountains and the Rhine, 25,000 acres of
        vineyards surround scores of villages with half-timbered houses
        lining the streets. </p>
        <p>Wine cellars are open for tasting along the route.
        Wine road tours can be booked at the Tourist Office of
        Strasbourg in the Place Guttenberg. Rental cars also are
        available for those who want to stay longer on the road. </p>
        <p>For more information on Strasbourg and Alsace, contact
        the French Government Tourist Office, 444 Madison Ave.,
        16th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10022; or call Air France at
        1-800-237-2747. </p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><em>September 4, 1996</em><p><font size=4><em><strong>Travel Tips From 
AAA East 
Tennessee</strong></em></font></p>
</td><td valign=top width=470><h2>GET A GRIP!</h2>
<p><strong>PREPARATION</strong> </p>
<p>Learning the art of safe driving in adverse weather requires preparation and 
training. Start with a vehicle that's ready for the rigors of the rainy season: 
good tire tread, firm brakes and streak-free wipers. Add wet-weather driving 
techniques: dealing with reduced visibility and traction, steering, braking and 
skid control. When car and driver are ready, practice in a safe, secluded 
area. The driver who knows what to do in an emergency is more likely to 
stay in control. </p>
<h3>PRE-SEASON CHECK UP </h3>
<p>Rain, slush, and mud are hard on your car. Be prepared for the rainy season 
with a thorough check up. Follow this checklist: </p>
<h3>Battery </h3>
<p>Wet weather places heavy demand on the battery and charging system. 
Recharge or replace weak batteries. Check fluid levels, battery posts, voltage 
regulator and alternator or generator.<br>
</p>
<h3>Ignition System </h3>
<p>Damaged ignition wires, a cracked distributor cap or worn spark plugs can 
make starting difficult or may cause a sudden breakdown.<br>
</p>
<h3>Lights </h3>
<p>Check the headlights, side-marker lights, emergency flashers, parking lights, 
front and rear directional signals, taillights, and brake lights.<br>
</p>
<h3>Brake System </h3>
<p>Check brakes for proper operation. Pulling, a taut pedal or unusual squealing 
or grinding indicate the need for repair. </p>
<h3>Tires </h3>
<p>Traction is the key to good movement, turning and stopping on wet surfaces. 
Good tire tread allows water to escape from under the tires, preventing 
hydroplaning. Consider changing to tires designed for increased traction on 
wet surfaces. Make sure tires are properly inflated to the maximum pressure 
amount shown in the owner's manual or on the door frame. Do not exceed 
pressure shown on the tire sidewall. </p>
<h3>Heating and Cooling System </h3>
<p>Check the radiator and hoses for leaks and cracks. Test defrosters and 
blowers for proper operation. Keep vents free of debris so air circulates 
properly. An air conditioning check ensures both heat and air are available to 
keep windows clear. </p>
<h3>Windshield Wipers and Washer </h3>
<p>Are wipers functioning properly? Blades that streak should be replaced. Fill 
the washer reservoir bottle with a washer solvent. </p>
<h3>Emergency Kit </h3>
<p>Keep these items in your car in case of emergency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flashlight</li>
<li>Traction mats</li>
<li>Small bag of abrasive material-sand, salt or kitty litter</li>
<li>Shovel</li>
<li>Cloth or roll of paper towels</li>
<li>Blanket</li>
<li>Booster cables</li>
<li>Window-washing solvent</li>
<li>Warning devices-flares or triangles</li>
<li>Car phone or citizens band radio</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PREPARING THE DRIVER </h3>
<p>Emergencies, by definition, happen suddenly with little time for evaluation and 
decision-making. You have to be prepared to act quickly to avoid a crash. A 
review of nearly 12,000 collisions found that more than 37 percent of drivers 
involved took no action to prevent or avoid the incident. </p>
<h3>Think caution. </h3>
<p>Get in the right frame of mind before you get behind the wheel. Never drive 
when you're emotionally upset or rushed. Your alertness level automatically 
drops around your regular bedtime. If you must drive at that time, stop each 
hour and walk around or wash your face with cold water. According to traffic 
safety authorities, lack of attention is a major contributing factor to auto 
crashes. </p>
<h3>In the driver's seat. </h3>
<p>Correct seat position puts you in control to perform the gentle, smooth, 
precise movements necessary for safe motoring in inclement weather. Adjust 
your seat so elbows are slightly bent and you can effortlessly reach the 
pedals, operate all controls and turn the steering wheel. Check mirrors and 
environment controls before you start. Don't forget your safety belt.</p>
<h3>Suit up. </h3>
<p>Select clothing that provides comfort and freedom of movement. While heavy 
garments may be necessary outside the car, they can restrict movement 
behind the wheel. Always come to a complete stop in a safe spot before 
removing a coat or gloves. </p>
<h3>DRIVING WHEN VISIBILITY IS POOR </h3>
<p>Regardless of your driving experience, the odds are greater that you'll have a 
collision in wet weather. A hard rain can limit visibility so much you can't see 
the edges of the road, traffic signs or other cars. If you must drive under such 
conditions, it's helpful to have the knowledge and skills to cope. </p>
<h3>A clear view. </h3>
<p>Keep your windshield and windows clean. It's important to clean the inside of 
your windows at least once a week - more often if you smoke. Use your 
defrosters to keep front and rear windshields clean. On a cold day, move the 
heat control to &quot;hot&quot; and let the engine warm up before you turn on the 
defrosters and blowers. This will prevent moisture from collecting on the 
inside of the glass. If the windshield or windows get foggy, open a window 
slightly and turn the defroster fan to a higher speed. Use your air conditioner 
to reduce humidity. </p>
<p>While tinted windows have been promoted to reduce glare from the sun and 
make air conditioning more efficient, they also reduce visibility in inclement 
weather. Consider options to tinted windows - like sunglasses and sun visors. </p>
<h3>A bright idea. </h3>
<p>When you drive on wet streets, mud and dirt splash on your headlights, 
reducing the effectiveness by up to 90 percent. Stop periodically during a 
long trip to clean your headlights. Keep low beam headlights on at all times - 
especially on dark or overcast days. Use low beams and fog lights in fog. </p>
<h3>Recognize a crisis. </h3>
<p>When visibility is so limited you can't see the edges of the road or other 
vehicles at a safe distance, it's time to pull off and wait for the rain to ease up. 
It's best to stop at a rest area or exit the freeway and go to a protected area. 
If the roadside is your only option, pull of the road as far as you can, 
preferably past the end of a guardrail. Vehicles parked at the side of the road 
are frequently struck by other drivers. Respect the limitations of reduced 
visibility and turn headlights off and emergency flashers on to alert other 
drivers. </p>
<h3>SKILLS FOR DRIVING WITH REDUCED 
TRACTION </h3>
<p>Wet roads mean poor traction. Conditions are most dangerous during the first 
10 minutes of a heavy downpour as oil and debris wash away. Knowing how 
to handle poor traction reduces the potential for hydroplaning, skidding or 
getting stuck in the mud. </p>
<h3>Getting out of a tough spot. </h3>
<p>ou need steady pulling and moderate power when traction is poor. The best 
remedy when wheels are stuck in mud or a soft shoulder is to apply power 
slowly. </p>
<ol>
<li>Keep front wheels pointed straight ahead so the vehicle can move in a 
straight line. If you can't go forward, try backing out, steering in the 
vehicle's tracks.</li>
<li>With a manual transmission, shift to second gear to prevent wheel spin. 
Accelerate carefully, giving just enough fuel to keep the engine from 
stalling and ease along gradually until traction improves.</li>
<li>You may have to &quot;rock&quot; your way out, using second gear in manual 
transmissions and low gear in automatic transmissions. Move forward 
until the vehicle stops, then allow it to roll back. Repeat, moving ahead 
a little more each time. Use minimum power to keep the wheels from 
spinning and digging in deeper.</li>
<li>If rocking doesn't work and wheels simply spin, find a way to create 
traction. Traction mats, gravel or kitty litter work best, but you also 
can use cinders, burlap or branches. Shovel a space in front of the 
wheels and spread your materials. Apply power slowly, using second 
or low gear.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Steering clear of collisions. </h3>
<p>You may need to take evasive action to avoid a collision. Steering is 
preferred to braking at speeds above 25 mph because less distance is 
required to steer around an object than to brake to a stop. In wet weather, 
sudden braking often leads to skids. </p>
<p>There are two emergency-steering methods: </p>
<ol>
<li>With hands fixed in the 9 and 3 positions, whip the steering wheel to 
the left or right 180 degrees, followed by a 360 degree countersteer. 
This method is confining in that your arms are locked, leaving you in an 
awkward position to make further fine adjustments that may be 
necessary for skid recovery. Your body leans in the direction the 
vehicle is traveling, forcing you out of an upright position. You also risk 
skidding. This steering method causes rapid weight transfer, and 
sudden weight transfer increases the chance of a skid.</li>
<li>The push-pull-slide method of steering uses your hands, wrists and 
forearms, which are capable of finer control than your upper arms and 
shoulders. Since the arms never cross, your provide continuous 
adjustments in either direction. More controlled steering and reduced 
weight transfer keep you in an upright position and reduce the 
possibility of a skid.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Recognize a water hazard. </h3>
<p>Your car's grip on the road depends on a small area of contact where the 
tires meet the road surface, called the tire's footprint. The amount of water on 
the road, your speed and the condition of your tires affect footprint traction.</p>
<p>-- With only one-twelfth of an inch of water between your tries and the road, 
each of your tires has to displace one gallon of water per second. Good tread 
allows water to escape from under the tires. Proper inflation also increases 
traction. Low tire pressure allows the tread to squeeze together, reducing the 
tire's ability to wipe or channel away water. Tires specifically designed for 
wet weather traction allow more water to escape, keeping the footprint in 
contact with the road surface. </p>
<p>-- Look and listen for signs of hydroplaning: standing water, raindrops 
bubbling on the road or a sloshing sound from your tires. </p>
<p>-- Choose a speed consistent with the amount of water on the road. At 30 
mph or less, properly inflated tires with good tread will maintain contact. Even 
a brand-new tire will lose some footprint contact at 35 mph. At 60 mph, 
water may separate the tire from the road and cause hydroplaning. </p>
<p>Tire Pressure	Hydroplaning Speed </p>
<ul>
<li>16 pounds	41 mph</li>
<li>24 pounds	50 mph</li>
<li>32 pounds	58 mph</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160; -- To reduce chances of hydroplaning, slow down, avoid hard braking or 
turning sharply, drive in the tracks of the vehicle ahead of you and increase 
your following distance. </p>
<h3>Regaining control in a skid. </h3>
<p>Even careful drivers experience skids. You lose traction when braking, 
cornering or accelerating. Skid-control maneuvers -- a calm approach -- will 
help you regain control. </p>
<ol>
<li>Take your foot off the brake if the rear wheels skid due to hard or 
panic braking. Ease off the gas pedal if the rear wheels lose traction 
due to hard acceleration (rear-wheel drive).</li>
<li>Shift to neutral.</li>
<li>Look and steer in the direction you want the front of the car to go.</li>
<li>Just before the rear wheels stop skidding, countersteer until you are 
going in the desired direction. This requires gentle movement of the 
steering wheel to avoid a rear-wheel skid in the opposite direction.</li>
<li>Once the vehicle is straight, return to a driving gear and accelerate 
gently so that engine speed matches road speed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Front-wheel skids are caused by hard braking or acceleration. When the 
front wheels lose traction, you lose steering ability. While this sounds 
dangerous, front-wheel skids are easier to correct because there is no risk of 
the car skidding in the opposite direction. </p>
<p>If the front wheels skid from hard braking, release the brake. If the wheels 
spin from loss of traction due to acceleration, ease off the accelerator 
(front-wheel drive). </p>
<ol>
<li>If the front wheels skid from hard braking, release the brake. If the 
wheels spin from loss of traction due to acceleration, ease off the 
accelerator (front-wheel drive).</li>
<li>Shift to neutral.</li>
<li>If the front wheels have been turned prior to the loss of traction, don't 
move the steering wheel. Since the wheels are skidding sideways, a 
certain amount of braking force will be extended.</li>
<li>Wait for the front wheels to grip the road again. When traction returns, 
you'll regain steering control.</li>
<li>Return to a driving gear and gently steer in the direction you want to 
travel. Gently accelerate until engine speed matches road speed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Somestimes all four wheels lose traction - generally at high speeds under 
adverse conditions.</p>
<h3>Putting on the brakes.</h3>
<p>Stopping on a slippery surface requires more distance, so increase your 
following distance. Focus your attention as far ahead as possible -- at least 
20 to 30 seconds.</p>
<p>The best way to stop on a slippery surface is to use threshold or controlled 
braking and shift to neutral. If you don't have anti-lock brakes, the best way 
to use threshold or controlled braking is the heel-and-toe method. Keep the 
heel of your foot on the floor and use your toes to apply firm, steady pressure 
on the brake pedal. Stop just short of locking the wheels.</p>
<p>If your heel leaves the floor, the ball of your foot pushes the pedal, and the 
wheels lock because you're controlling the brake with your thigh muscles, 
which are incapable of finer control.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove your foot from the brake or accelerator.</li>
<li>Shift into neutral.</li>
<li>Look and steer in the direction you want the front of the car to go.</li>
<li>Wait for the wheels to grip the road again. As soon as the wheels 
regain traction, you will travel in the direction you want to go.</li>
<li>Return to a driving gear and maintain a safe speed.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Putting on the brakes. </h3>

<p>The best way to stop on a slippery surface is to use threshold or controlled

<p>If your heel leaves the floor, the ball of your foot pushes the pedal, and the 
wheels lock because you're controlling the brake with your thigh muscles, 
which are incapable of finer control. </p>
<p>Under the stress of trying to stop quickly, drivers almost inevitably overreact 
and lock the wheels. If this happens, use heel-and-toe action to release brake 
pressure one or two degrees, then immediately reapply it with slightly less 
pressure. </p>
<p>Anti-lock brakes are designed to prevent wheels from locking and retain 
steering control during panic braking. Sensors located at wheels detect 
lock-up. The anti-lock system relieves enough pressure to allow the wheel to 
turn, maintaining steering control. </p>
<p>You should use the heel-and-toe method with anti-lock brakes. Do not 
remove your foot from the brake or pump the pedal. If you apply too much 
pressure and the wheels lock momentarily, you might feel the brake pedal 
pulse back against your foot. Pumping the pedal works against the system by 
providing false information. </p>
<h2>SOME ADDITIONAL TIPS </h2>
<ol>
<li>Avoid driving while fatigued.</li>
<li>Always use your safety belt.</li>
<li>Never warm up a vehicle in an enclosed area such as a garage.</li>
<li>Keep tires properly inflated.</li>
<li>Never mix radial tires with other tire types.</li>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->        <font size="5">D</font>angling visions of fast jackpots
        and retirement riches, Joe Taylor beckoned all comers to
        his massive Ponzi investment scheme. Big or small, it
        mattered little how much they had or how hard it would
        hurt when the scam finally fell. </p>
        <p>Millionaire retailer Robert M. Goodfriend claims he
        gave $7.5 million to Taylor to invest in a four-month
        span in 1995. After Taylor's suicide, he found out his
        friend had distributed it to other investors or spent it
        on a luxurious lifestyle. </p>
        <p>Fortunately for Goodfriend, chairman of Goody's Family
        Clothing Inc., he had a cushion to fall back on. Last
        month, after agreeing to pay back $1.3 million to the
        financial planner's bankrupt limited partnership,
        Goodfriend sold 396,150 shares of company stock for more
        than $5 million, Securities and Exchange Commission
        documents show. </p>
        <p>Fountain City chiropractor Ron Mabry has not been so
        lucky. </p>
        <p>For years he gave money to Taylor, comforted in the
        knowledge he'd be secure in his old age. Taylor stole
        Mabry's money, however, and now he's asking a court to
        reduce alimony and child support payments to his first wife,
        lawyer Jess D. Campbell said. </p>
        <p>Neither Mabry nor Goodfriend wanted to talk about
        Taylor. Another victim is more vocal. </p>
        <p>''Joe Taylor materially altered the lives of a great
        number of people, and the effects will be felt for
        years,'' said Knoxville attorney Dudley W. Taylor, who
        along with law partner Lori Fleishman lost about $1.6
        million. ''Who knows if it'll be five years or 10 years
        or 15 years.'' </p>
        <p>Taylor went through an estimated $50 million to $60
        million in investor funds to operate the Ponzi, one of
        the largest such schemes in recent years, according to
        federal bankrupcty officials. </p>
        <p>Typically, he paid some clients off with the proceeds
        of others and pocketed money for himself and his family.
        He pulled the Ponzi off by playing on people's trust and
        promising -- and sometimes delivering -- returns far
        higher than normal markets yield. </p>
        <p>From 1993 until his suicide Nov. 3, 1995, Taylor used
        Taylor &amp; Associates L.P. to operate the scheme, but
        authorities say it appears he began stealing from clients
        as long ago as the early 1980s. </p>
        <p>More than 150 investors have filed claims against the
        bogus partnership's estate, Taylor's personal estate or
        his legitimate business, Joseph C. Taylor and Associates
        Inc. </p>
        <p>Their purported stakes with him ranged from $6,000 to
        almost $11 million. </p>
        <p>Goodfriend is among the most visible of Taylor's
        victims, but more than a dozen others have made
        million-dollar court claims including Dr. J. MacDonald
        Burkhart. The orthopedic surgeon recently paid $2.42
        million back into the limited partnership's estate and is
        awaiting an eventual payback in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. </p>
        <p>Smoky Mountain Ventures, an investment partnership
        that also involves Burkhart, also has paid back $2.04
        million. </p>
        <p>Mabry, who invested personally and professionally with
        Taylor more than 10 years, went so far as to make him the
        fiduciary in his estate planning and trustee in his life
        insurance matters, lawyers said. </p>
        <p>Taylor testified about Mabry's business affairs in a
        deposition in 1989 for the chiropractor's divorce in Knox
        County Chancery Court. </p>
        <p>''Dr. Mabry doesn't care for details at all; no
        details whatsoever,'' Taylor said. ''He's very poor on
        details.'' </p>
        <p>The details took on great significance when Mabry
        checked his finances after Taylor's death. He now has
        claims totaling $2 million in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. </p>
        <p>A year after his death, Taylor's clients still marvel
        at his ability to charm. He had a way of saying the right
        thing to win their trust. His manner was sunny, his air
        confident. </p>
        <p>When an East Tennessee teacher agreed to withdraw
        about $30,000 in retirement funds to invest with Taylor,
        she said she had to pay a penalty. </p>
        <p>''Don't worry,'' she said Taylor told her. ''We'll
        make it back.'' </p>
        <p>The woman said she first talked with Taylor, whom she
        met through a friend, in March 1995. At the time, he told
        her she didn't have enough money to make it worth his
        while. </p>
        <p>A few months later, however, he called back. Maybe he
        could help her after all, she said he told her. </p>
        <p>Taylor told her her investments did well, but he never
        gave her any paperwork. The woman said it made her
        uneasy. </p>
        <p>By October, she was ready to move her money out. On
        the day before Taylor killed himself, the woman said she
        mailed him a deposit slip with instructions to move her
        funds into a regular bank account. </p>
        <p>Now it's all gone. </p>
        <p>Some unwitting customers were ready to give Taylor
        more money even as his Ponzi teetered on the brink of
        collapse. </p>
        <p>Kenneth M. Seaton, owner of The Grand Resort Hotel
        &amp; Convention Center in Pigeon Forge and the Family
        Inns of America motel chain, was sitting in a West
        Knoxville restaurant waiting to give Taylor money on the day
        the planner killed himself. Seaton recently reached a
        settlement with the limited partnership's bankruptcy
        trustee to repay $2,460,867 he received from Taylor. </p>
        <p>Taylor flim-flammed entire families and networks of
        friends. </p>
        <p>Among those associated with Goody's, other investors
        taken in were Goodfriend's father, Morris Goodfriend,
        Goody's president Harry Call, and longtime friend,
        Knoxville businessman Robert Ivins. </p>
        <p>Newport optometrist Dr. Jack Clark gave Taylor
        hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest for himself
        and for trusts for his son and daughter. His wife, Carol,
        also entrusted money to Taylor from her late mother's
        estate. </p>
        <p>After hearing Knoxville lawyer Lori Fleishman praise
        Taylor, Fleishman's mother, sister and aunt added their
        own money to the pot. Now they're just hoping to recoup
        some of their losses. </p>
        <p>''You don't think I feel really bad about that?''
        Fleishman says now. ''I will make that whole one day.'' </p>
        <p>Many like Fleishman and Dudley Taylor face the
        additional aggravation of having paid federal income
        taxes on phantom investment gains that Taylor told them
        they had made. The pair are suing the United States
        government in U.S. District Court to recover $94,000 in
        overpaid taxes for 1994. </p>
        <p>Money isn't the only thing Joe Taylor stole, Dudley
        Taylor said. </p>
        <p>For days after Taylor died, Dudley Taylor refused to
        believe the financial planner would have treated his
        friends so badly. Now he questions his intuitive ability
        to tell an honest man from a crook. </p>
        <p>''You try to be careful and cautious all your life and
        you end up being taken for a fool,'' he said. </p>
        <p>While the Ponzi wiped out thousands and sometimes
        millions of investor dollars, most clients are managing. </p>
        <p>The East Tennessee teacher said at first she was
        ''torn all to pieces'' when she learned her money was
        gone. </p>
        <p>''I'm surviving,'' she said. </p>
        <p>Lawyer C. Mark Troutman represents several former
        Taylor investors including a Knoxville physician and
        several East Tennessee businessmen. </p>
        <p>''It's not going to take food off their table, but
        you've got people who had their retirement funds with
        him,'' Troutman said. ''It has drastically affected their
        financial futures.'' </p>
        <p>Thomas Jessee, a Johnson City attorney now working on
        behalf of about a half-dozen former Taylor customers in
        the Tri-Cities area, lost money himself in the scam. He
        said most of the people he represents can recover because
        of their relative youth and position. One older man,
        however, lost his entire retirement, he said. </p>
        <p>In 1994, Joe Taylor gave Fleishman a crystal bowl as a
        Christmas gift. She said she keeps it in her kitchen and
        looks at it every day to remind herself ''not to be a
        sucker.'' </p>
        <p>Her 15-month stint as a Taylor client was a costly
        mistake she vows never to make again. He once had her
        convinced she was a millionaire. </p>
        <p>''I'm taking this as a souvenir,'' she said. ''I'm
        young. I'm a professional. In the future, I will be
        paranoid and I will be suspicious when it comes to investments.'' </p>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->        <font size="5">T</font>he names are a familiar rollcall
        of Joe Taylor's most recognizable acquaintances, clients
        and unwitting dupes: Goodfriend, Furrow, Chase and Seaton. </p>
        <p>But there's someone else who, while perhaps not as
        well known as other Taylor associates, broke more bread
        and did more deals with the financial planner than just
        about anyone. </p>
        <p>Harold E. Elkins, 53, is a longtime Knoxville
        accountant who gave millions to and received millions
        from Taylor over the course of a nearly 15-year investor
        relationship. </p>
        <p>Elkins claims he is owed more than $4 million for
        investments he made with the financial planner. He also
        is fighting with Taylor's widow over a life insurance
        policy Taylor assigned to him in 1981. </p>
        <p>The Knox County native is a private man. Elkins, whose
        Fountain City house and Union County office are
        surrounded by large, gated fences, declined through
        attorney Dudley W. Taylor to be interviewed. </p>
        <p>The lawyer said Elkins is just another Taylor victim,
        someone who admired him greatly and was played for a
        patsy. </p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, he ends up being a subject of
        scrutiny,'' said Dudley Taylor, a Taylor client who also
        had worked as his lawyer. ''If you look into the heart of
        Harold Elkins, I think you will find he was the most
        devastated of all the people who dealt with Joe -- after
        (Taylor's) family.'' </p>
        <p>Elkins and Taylor were used to dealing in big money,
        court records show. </p>
        <p>From March 1994 until Taylor died Nov. 3, 1995, Elkins
        gave his friend $1.65 million and got back $5.086
        million, according to court records. Some represented
        returns for two funeral home trusts the accountant oversaw.
        The money all went into and came out of a firm called
        Taylor &amp; Associates L.P., according to an affidavit
        from William T. Hendon, who is overseeing Taylor &amp;
        Associates' now bankrupt estate. </p>
        <p>Court records and an Aug. 27 bankruptcy deposition
        given by Elkins and obtained by The News-Sentinel show
        the two men had a close, casual business relationship. </p>
        <p>Elkins didn't have a regular investment account
        through Taylor with Advanced Financial Planning Corp.,
        the broker-dealer through which a person could make
        well-documented investments with Taylor, according to his
        deposition. </p>
        <p>Instead, he traded with him one-on-one, his deposition
        shows. Often, their arrangement hinged on a simple,
        ongoing promissory note from Taylor to Elkins. </p>
        <p>Elkins, who also had done some work as Taylor's
        accountant, invested his own funds, funds from two
        funeral home trusts and money from friends with Taylor. </p>
        <p>The men met in 1974. Elkins was a CPA working as a
        controller for a food distributor and Taylor was a young,
        up and coming insurance and securities salesman. They
        ended up sharing clients, with Taylor selling the
        insurance and investment opportunities and Elkins doing
        the tax work. </p>
        <p>The accountant began investing with Taylor in the
        early 1980s. He gave Taylor money to buy bulk coins,
        according to his deposition. </p>
        <p>Elkins said he never saw the coins and never knew who
        made the deals with Taylor. He said Taylor told him he
        had a contact who had made a lot of money selling the
        coins at a profit. </p>
        <p>In all, Elkins testified he made 40 to 50 such
        purported investments from the 1980s until Taylor died.
        He said the deals took about 90 days to mature. The
        accountant testified in August that he couldn't recall
        what kind of profit he made on the coins, but he said
        Taylor ''normally delivered . . . what he said he
        would.'' </p>
        <p>Over time, Elkins said he also gave money for Taylor
        to invest in municipal bonds. He estimated he went in
        with Taylor on about 30 such transactions. </p>
        <p>As with the coin deals, Taylor would sign a promissory
        note for the money. After a deal was done, the financial
        planner would periodically give Elkins part of the
        principal or some of the earnings. Then, they would tear
        up the old promissory note and write a new one reflecting
        Elkins' current balance. </p>
        <p>In court papers, Elkins has submitted three notes that
        he claims show his balances with Taylor when he died. The
        notes are purported to cover money due for coins, bonds
        and pawnshops, another investment vehicle touted by
        Taylor. </p>
        <p>Despite a lack of paperwork verifying the deals and
        the fact that Elkins never met the people with whom
        Taylor supposedly made his deals, he said he saw no
        reason to doubt Taylor through the years. </p>
        <p>Even in 1994, when Taylor asked him to help prepare
        tax forms for his limited partnership, Elkins went along.
        At the time, Elkins, named by Taylor as a partner in the
        shell firm, said he suspected Taylor &amp; Associates was not
        a true partnership. </p>
        <p>''I was Joe's friend, and you know, we had been
        friends for 20 years, and he was very persuasive . . .''
        he testified. </p>
        <p>Besides his own money, Elkins also invested funds from
        the prearranged funeral trusts of Stevens Mortuary and
        McCammon-Ammons Funeral Home. The trusts consisted of
        money from funeral home customers who had paid their
        burial expenses up front. </p>
        <p>Elkins was an independent trustee of the funds,
        investing and keeping track of the accounts. </p>
        <p>According to Elkins, Taylor said he invested the
        pre-arranged funeral trust monies in certificates of
        deposit with banks. Just as he did with the accountant's
        personal funds, Taylor signed promissory notes to record
        what each trust invested. </p>
        <p>Taylor also would pass along monthly interest checks
        to Elkins for deposit into the trust accounts. </p>
        <p>The trusts' business with Taylor appeared to be a
        satisfactory arrangement for everyone involved. Elkins
        testified in his deposition that principals at both
        funeral homes knew Taylor and had bought insurance with
        him in the past. </p>
        <p>Elkins said he invested funeral trust money with
        Taylor because the financial planner produced better CD
        returns, as high as 8 percent, than he could get at other
        banks. The accountant said Taylor never produced any
        documents verifying the CD purchases. </p>
        <p>He testified he did not question how Taylor could find
        CD rates that were so much better than local banks. </p>
        <p>''. . .I knew that Joe had all kinds of contacts out
        of town, and I think it was reasonable to expect that he
        could get a better rate out of Knoxville.'' </p>
        <p>When Taylor died, he owed the trusts $260,000 in
        out-standing investments. </p>
        <p>Elkins testified he reimbursed the trusts with his own
        money after the financial planner died. He said he could
        not find the last trust promissory notes from Taylor. </p>
        <p>Along with his individual and trustee investments,
        Elkins also gave Taylor money he had pooled with other
        friends. </p>
        <p>In 1994, he created a limited partnership called
        Tri-Cities Investments. In his deposition, Elkins said
        Tri-Cities was an ''investment vehicle'' that used his
        money and borrowed money from friends to look for
        profitable opportunities. </p>
        <p>Elkins said he invested some Tri-Cities funds with
        Taylor and also bought antique cars and musical
        intruments. </p>
        <p>In his deposition, the accountant said he kept no
        ledgers or sheets showing what monies Tri-Cities had
        invested with Taylor. Elkins said he commingled Tri-Cities'
        funds with his own personal investments on promissory
        notes he got from Taylor. </p>
        <p>He said he also gave notes to his Tri-Cities partners
        when they would invest with him. Once profits came back,
        he said he would cancel a note. </p>
        <p>Today, Elkins said he has promissory notes showing he
        and Tri-Cities are due $2.268 million on purported Taylor
        bond deals and $1.688 million on purported Taylor
        pawnshop deals. </p>
        <p>Elkins said he also has a promissory note for $262,644
        he and Tri-Cities put up for purported Taylor coin deals. </p>
        <p>''. . . I assume it wouldn't include anything other
        than me and Tri-Cities, but, you see, I don't really know
        how much of any of these notes is my money versus
        Tri-Cities because there was no separate accounting made
        for that,'' the accountant said in his deposition. </p>
        <p>Elkins said he only became suspicious that something
        might be wrong with Taylor in the last few days before
        his suicide. </p>
        <p>Taylor confided that he had become ensnared in a bond
        deal for which he was going to suffer a $6.9 million
        personal loss, Elkins said. Authorities say there was no
        bond deal and that Taylor probably was alluding to his
        frantic efforts to reimburse a Kingsport businessman who
        had given him $2 million several weeks before. </p>
        <p>As a favor to Taylor, Elkins took out three cashier's
        checks in late October 1995 totaling $181,000, all made
        out in the Kingsport man's name. Elkins said he was
        ''uneasy'' about the cashier's checks and wanted to find
        out more from Taylor about the businessman. On the
        afternoon of Nov. 2, 1995, Taylor returned his phone
        call. </p>
        <p>To Elkins, he sounded very tired. The accountant
        suggested they have supper. Taylor begged off. </p>
        <p>''I said, 'Well, could we have lunch the next day?'
        And he said, 'Yeah, I think that would work.' He said to
        just give me a call in the morning and we will work it
        out,'' Elkins said. </p>
        <p>The men never spoke again. When Elkins called Taylor's
        office the next morning, he was told Taylor could not be
        located. </p>
        <p>In truth, Taylor was making final burial plans a few
        miles away at a Kingston Pike funeral home. By lunchtime,
        he was dead from a single, self-inflicted gunshot wound
        to the head. </p>

        problems created by his multimillion-dollar Ponzi
        investment scheme likely will live on for years to come. </p>
        <p>A year after his death, former clients still are out
        millions of dollars or are in the process of surrendering
        to a bankruptcy trustee millions that Taylor gave them. </p>
        <p>In addition, more than two dozen court actions related
        to Taylor have been filed in practically any court you
        can think of. </p>
        <p>Taylor's legal legacy is so convoluted that when a
        lawyer who represents one of the more frequently sued
        parties in the matter was asked last week about a
        lawsuit, he replied, ''Hold it. Did he sue me?'' </p>
        <p>The court battles fall into these general categories:
        the federal bankruptcy case involving Taylor's bogus
        limited partnership; litigation over Taylor's legitimate
        corporation; actions involving Taylor's personal estate
        and life insurance policies; lawsuits against Advanced
        Financial Planning Corp., the broker-dealer with whom
        Taylor was affiliated; and suits in state courts from
        Knox to Cocke to Campbell counties over 18 cashier's
        checks totaling $2.5 million that he took from clients
        and gave to Kingsport businessman John F. Miller. </p>
        <p>All the legal fights seek to recover money that
        Taylor's clients put up for investments. </p>
        <p>Today, however, no one can say exactly how much anyone
        will get back or when. </p>
        <p>''We'd like to be able to make one (an interim
        distribution) as soon as possible,'' attorney Robert M.
        Bailey, who is working with bankruptcy trustee William T.
        Hendon to recover money from Taylor &amp; Associates L.P.,
        said last week. </p>
        <p>But Bailey could not give an approximate distribution
        date. </p>
        <p>By far the most active court case involves the
        bankrupt limited partnership. It is in bankruptcy court
        that the greatest efforts are being made to reconstruct
        the financial remnants of Taylor's Ponzi scheme. </p>
        <p>Under bankruptcy law, Hendon can compel Taylor's
        clients to return money he paid out to them, depending on
        the circumstances, for up to three years prior to his
        death. In the case of the limited partnership, some
        clients got more back than they gave the financier, some
        got less and some got nothing at all. </p>
        <p>Hendon is compiling a pool of money that eventually
        will be given back to all Taylor's creditors on an
        equitable basis. So far he has obtained agreements with
        more than 50 former Taylor clients to pay back $20.3 million. </p>
        <p>The trustee and his attorneys are currently
        negotiating other settlements, and he could collect
        millions more before the settlement process ends. </p>
        <p>Hendon also is giving Taylor clients millions of
        dollars of credit for what is known as ''new value''
        under the bankruptcy laws. </p>
        <p>For example, a client who gave Taylor $1 million on
        Oct. 1 and received $300,000 back as a ''profit'' on Oct.
        15. If that client invested an additional $100,000 with
        him on Oct. 22, they would get a ''new value'' credit of $100,000
        and would only have to pay $200,000 to Hendon as a preference
        instead of $300,000. </p>
        <p>The bankruptcy process is going smoothly, in part
        because many of the attorneys representing Taylor's
        former clients are veterans of the long, drawn-out battle
        for the remains of the Southern Industrial Banking Corp. </p>

        Co. conducts bidding in April for the furnishings of Joe Taylor's
        office furnishings at 550 Main Ave. The auction was
        ordered by the Knox County Chancery Court. Sold were
        Taylor's hand-tooled leather-top desk, conference tables,
        executive desks, sofas, chairs and china among other
        decorative items.</strong></font></p>
        <p>''There's a really sophisticated list of creditors who
        hired lawyers who have apparently said, 'Look, if this is
        the way it is, you ought to pay,' '' said J. Michael
        Winchester, a Knoxville lawyer who represents a client in
        the case. </p>
        <p>Lawyers involved in the case have been impressed at
        how well Hendon and his attorneys have handled it. </p>
        <p>''In general for a case of this nature . . . it has
        progressed better than practically any bankruptcy I've
        ever seen,'' said Patricia Foster, the Knoxville-based
        attorney for the U.S. Trustee's office. ''They've done an excellent
        job and it's going extremely well.'' </p>
        <p>If Hendon can't negotiate a settlement with someone
        the issue will be settled in a trial. </p>
        <p>The next step in the case will be to resolve the $113
        million in claims against the limited partnership. </p>
        <p>An estimated $50 million to $60 million actually was
        involved in Taylor's scheme. The claims against the
        bankruptcy estate far exceed that because many of
        Taylor's clients filed claims based on what he told them
        they had in their accounts rather than what they actually
        gave him. </p>
        <p>The wild card in all of this is an appeal by Knoxville
        lawyer Dudley W. Taylor of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Richard
        Stair's order placing the limited partnership in
        bankruptcy. If Taylor -- who represented Joe Taylor and invested
        with him -- prevails, it might end the bankruptcty case
        and send recovery efforts back to square one. No
        distribution, interim or otherwise, can be made until the
        appeal is resolved. </p>
        <p>Another Taylor firm, Joseph C. Taylor &amp; Associates
        Inc., is also the subject of litigation. Taylor conducted
        his legitimate insurance business through it. </p>
        <p>The corporation is in receivership in Knox County
        Chancery Court. </p>
        <p>Some former Taylor clients allege the corporation is
        liable for their losses. They've filed suit. </p>
        <p>In addition, the corporation has submitted its own $29
        million claim against the limited partnership. </p>
        <p>John Weaver, Chancery Court clerk and master, is
        receiver for the corporation. He said the corporation
        filed the claim against Taylor &amp; Associates L.P.
        based on information from clients that Taylor moved investor
        funds out of the corporation and into the partnership. </p>
        <p>Also pending in Chancery Court is Taylor's personal
        estate, where 125 claims totalling more than $300 million
        have been filed. The chances of anyone recovering much
        money from Taylor's personal estate are slim, however,
        because it so far has only about $2.2 million in assets,
        which includes two contested insurance policies valued at
        $950,000. </p>
        <p>The estate represents most of what Taylor's widow,
        Becky, can hope to recover. Since her husband's death,
        she has had to sell personal belongings, move in with
        family members and get a job to cover living expenses. </p>
        <p>Becky Taylor is trying to collect on two life
        insurance policies left by her late husband. </p>
        <p>Taylor originally named his family to be the
        beneficiaries of an $840,000 policy and a $110,000
        policy. An additional $200,000 policy named his corporation
        as the beneficiary. </p>
        <p>But Taylor later assigned the policies to three
        clients as collateral for investments. Becky Taylor is
        suing the clients to get the insurance proceeds. </p>
        <p>More than 30 ex-Taylor clients also have filed
        lawsuits in Knox County Circuit Court against Advanced
        Financial Planning Corp. of Brentwood, Tenn. They contend
        the broker-dealer was tipped before Taylor's death that
        he was engaged in wrongdoing but failed to take
        appropriate action. </p>
        <p>The clients seek millions of dollars in damages from
        Advanced Financial Planning. </p>
        <p>Finally, there are ongoing battles over the 18
        cashier's checks Taylor took from his clients to give to
        businessman Miller the day before his Nov. 3, 1995
        suicide. Those fights may end up in both bankruptcy and
        state courts. </p>
        <p>The clients filed a series of lawsuits seeking to
        either recover their money or prevent various banks from
        honoring the checks once they realized what Taylor had
        done. </p>
        <p>''We filed a lawsuit against Miller claiming he's not
        entitled to the checks because they were, in effect,
        stolen by Taylor and a thief cannot give title to anyone
        else,'' said Knoxville attorney Neal Melnick, who
        represents Knoxville businessmen Mike Thomas and Gary
        Koontz. </p>
        <p>Miller countered by filing lawsuits to force the banks
        to honor the checks. Most of those actions are stayed
        because Hendon is seeking the proceeds of more than a
        dozen of the checks claiming they belong to the limited partnership. </p>
        <p>Until Stair decides to whom they belong no one wants
        to pursue the cases in state court. </p>
        <p>''We want to find out if we got a live cow or a dead
        cow,'' Newport attorney Fletcher Ervin, who represents
        several clients said. ''If we got a live cow, we're going
        to go to war.'' </p>

<p><!--dateline--><br>
<font size=5>T</font>hink positive, Joe Taylor used to tell his friends, and 
good things will come your way. Work hard and success will surely follow. </p>
<p>The Knoxville financial planner carried the can-do message with him even as 
he was about to be exposed as a fraud, even as he was about to take his 
own life. </p>
<p><em>''In business, sometimes prospects may seem darkest when really they 
are on the turn. A little more persistence, a little more effort and what 
seemed hopeless failure may turn to glorious success.'' </em></p>
<p>The quote, written in Taylor's sloppy scrawl, comes from a dog-eared note 
found in his pocket the day he committed suicide outside a Kingston Pike 
funeral home. Ever fond of motivational sayings, Taylor attributed the quote 
to Elbert Hubbard, an early 20th century writer. </p>
<p>A year ago many of Taylor's more than 150 clients hailed him as a hero, a 
man so virtuous you could trust him with your money or your life. </p>
<p>Today, the one-year anniversary of his suicide, they see him as a phony who 
took $50 million to $60 million of their money while playing on their trust and 
greed. </p>
<p>Investors, including some of East Tennessee's most influential business 
figures and professionals, wonder how they could have been so dumb. </p>
<p>With Taylor gone, the only thing left for his former clients is to get whatever 
they can in the courts. Taylor &amp; Associates L.P., the limited partnership 
through which Taylor funneled his Ponzi investment scheme, is in U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court, and numerous other lawsuits are pending in Tennessee 
state courts. </p>
<p>It likely will take years to untangle Taylor's financial fraud. A bankruptcy 
trustee is collecting money from the limited partnership's estate for eventual 
distribution to Taylor's creditors. The FBI continues to investigate the case. </p>
<p>The News-Sentinel spoke with dozens of friends, clients and close 
associates and reviewed hundreds of court documents to try to understand 
what drove Joe Taylor. Members of Taylor's family declined to be 
interviewed. Some clients elected not to talk because they were too 
embarrassed or sickened by their losses. </p>
<p>There also are those, like Knoxville tennis pro Jimmy Pitkanen, a longtime 
friend of the Taylor family, who struggle still with their feelings. To them, Joe 
Taylor was a wonderful husband, father and friend. </p>
<p>To Pitkanen, the Taylor he knew and the man he's read and heard so much 
about in the past year are different people. </p>
<p>''He was just plain flat out one of the nicest guys you'd ever meet,'' he said. </p>

<p><em>''How many a man has thrown up his hands at a time when a little more 
effort, a little more patience would have achieved success.'' </em></p>
<p align=right><strong>-- Page 2 of Taylor's not</strong>e. </p>
<p>Joseph Craig Taylor talked often of his country roots. Even after he hit the 
big time with fancy houses and fancy cars, he spoke proudly of his heritage. 
It was part of what made the man so charming, so easy to approach. </p>
<p>Born Sept. 28, 1949, Taylor grew up on a farm in Jefferson County. In the 
late 1960s, he headed off to the University of Tennessee in Knoxville to get 
a degree in agriculture. </p>
<p>Like many farm boys arriving on campus, he joined the Alpha Gamma Rho 
fraternity, a social and professional group with a common interest in 
agriculture. </p>
<p>In an era when students demonstrated outside the UT Administration 
Building, displayed peace symbols on Shields-Watkins Field and set off tear 
gas bombs at the University Center, Alpha Gamma Rho was an oasis where 
the more conservative students could gather, said Hale Moss, a former 
Alpha Gamma Rho president. </p>
<p>''We did have contact with the other world, but our classes were small out 
there,'' said Moss, who operates a garden and florist center in Mount Juliet, 
Tenn. ''We had our own sense of identity.'' </p>
<p>Taylor quickly made his mark on campus, becoming an officer in the 
fraternity, joining clubs and taking part in student government activities. </p>
<p>Jerry Estes, district attorney general of the 10th Judicial District, was a 
humble freshman from Monroe County when he arrived in 1969. He 
remembers Taylor as a key influence in his decision to join the fraternity. </p>
<p>''He was a very nice, very amicable person, a persuasive person and a good 
salesperson,'' Estes said. ''As I recall, his reputation was not just limited to 
the fraternity.'' </p>
<p>After graduation in 1971, Taylor quickly settled into the business of selling 
insurance and investments and conducting financial planning. By 1972, he 
had secured his state license to sell securities. </p>
<p>The 1970s saw Taylor's business and influence gradually growing not just in 
Knox County but throughout East Tennessee as far north as the Tri-Cities. 
He saw opportunity in small towns, where competition was less intense and 
he could help customers plan for the future. </p>
<p>His clientele came to include important people in the community such as 
lawyers and doctors. </p>
<p>The decade also marked Taylor's marriage to Becky Allen, a Jefferson 
County doctor's daughter and UT graduate. Joe Taylor, sweet on Becky 
since they were young, liked to recount for friends how he was the one who 
had taught her to drive. </p>
<p>As he moved on into his 30s, Joe Taylor had a lot going for him: a loving 
wife, close friends and a hunger for success. He was a man on the move<em>. </em></p>

<p><em>''The line between failure and success is so fine that we scarcely know 
when we pass it -- so that we are often on the line and do not know it.'' </em></p>
<p align=right><strong>-- Page 1 of Taylor's not</strong>e. </p>
<p>If there was one truism about Joe Taylor in the 1980s, it was his hustle to 
make a buck. He could sell you on a mutual fund, a life insurance policy or 
even a limited partnership on a Nashville warehouse. </p>
<p>For a while he even peddled instructional cassettes on the side that told 
people how to get ahead in life. </p>
<p>He worked hard, opening his own business, Joseph C. Taylor and 
Associates Inc., which sold insurance to individuals and companies. </p>
<p>Taylor also continued to sell securities, eventually earning a six-figure income 
as an affiliate with Advanced Financial Planning Corp. of Brentwood, Tenn. </p>
<p>Taylor's client list continued to swell in size and significance. Retailers, 
accountants and even more doctors and lawyers signed up with Joe. </p>
<p>His methods sometimes seemed odd, like the times he wrote out big 
promissory notes to customers on investments or when he signed over his 
own insurance policy benefits as collateral to an investor. </p>
<p>But word on the street and in social circles was that Joe Taylor was a 
stand-up guy. And they were getting confirmations from insurance 
companies, mutual funds and the like that their money was being invested, so 
they saw no reason to worry. </p>
<p>In and out of business, Taylor began attracting a wide circle of friends. He 
and Becky enjoyed the company of Knoxville's social elite, people with 
names like Goodfriend and Haslam. </p>
<p>In later years, he helped raise money for East Tennessee Children's Hospital 
and joined the Webb School's board. </p>
<p>People were struck by his integrity and his dedication to family. While others 
might find petty things to say about their neighbors, Joe seemed never to 
have a bad word for anyone, friends recall. </p>
<p>Pitkanen, the tennis pro, first struck up a friendship with the Taylors in the 
early 1980s when he began teaching older son Ben Taylor how to play 
tennis. </p>
<p>''He had such a good personality,'' Pitkanen said. ''He was always cheerful. 
You never met him when he was down. He had such an enjoyment of life.'' </p>
<p>Taylor wanted to share that zest with everyone. </p>
<p>To Pitkanen, he gave the Holy Bible on tape along with motivational tapes 
and a subscription to the work of inspirational speaker Zig Ziglar. </p>
<p>For Pitkanen's son, he had posters about integrity and perseverance. </p>
<p>Taylor could be generous. </p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, after Ben Taylor joined Cub Scouts, Taylor quietly told 
pack leader J. Michael Haynes he would cover the costs for any boy who 
couldn't afford group activities. </p>
<p>When he heard about a Knox County school boy who needed a prosthetic 
device, Taylor anonymously covered the cost, said Haynes, a lawyer whose 
wife taught at the school the boy attended. </p>
<p>The closeknit nature of the Taylor family made them the envy of their friends. </p>
<p>Taylor taught Ben Taylor and younger brother, Will, both of whom he sent 
to Webb School, right from wrong. </p>
<p>''He always espoused doing the right thing,'' said Knoxville Police Sgt. Jim 
Wilson, who came to know Taylor through his fiancee, Sherry Seay, 
Taylor's longtime assistant. ''In his dealings with his kids he was like that. He 
required them to be respectful and the old-culture thing of 'Yes, sir,' and 
'No, sir.''' </p>
<p>It looked as if Taylor never could stumble. </p>
<p>In retrospect, he began doing things in the early 1990s that were unethical, 
illegal and illegitimate, court records and interviews with associates show. </p>
<p>Clients typically had received official paperwork confirming their accounts 
through Taylor's broker-dealer Advanced Financial Planning Securities 
Corp. Now Taylor began pitching his own securities deals like stocks and 
bond sales for which he produced no paper. </p>
<p>Some customers also began to hear about a limited partnership Joe oversaw 
that supposedly made various investments. </p>
<p>Looking back, clients say they realize the change was a sure sign something 
was wrong. </p>
<p>At the time, however, Taylor had so much good news about their money and 
returns were so high -- sometimes 10 percent in a week or two -- that they 
went along with his strange ways. </p>
<p>By 1993, Taylor's lifestyle had taken a dramatic swing up. </p>
<p>He and Becky sold their house in Fox Den to University of Tennessee 
baseball coach Rod Delmonico, although they continued to live in it while 
paying more than $3,000 a month in rent. </p>
<p>The Taylors bought 3.5 acres for their dream home overlooking Fort 
Loudoun Lake on Westland Drive. </p>
<p>In addition, they bought a lot on tony Daufuskie Island off Hilton Head, 
S.C., close to a home owned by client and friend, Robert M. Goodfriend, 
chairman of Goody's Family Clothing Inc. </p>
<p>In 1994, the Taylors bought a home in The Virginian, a gated community 
outside Bristol, Va. </p>
<p>Becky Taylor saw no need for a $300,000-plus Virginia house, which was 
titled in her name, but Joe said the home could be used as a model show 
place and one day sold for a profit, court records show. </p>
<p>Those who knew Taylor say he became noticeably erratic in 1995. He 
seemed in a constant hurry and could be tough to reach. </p>
<p>He confided to Lori Fleishman, a Knoxville lawyer who recently had begun 
investing with him, that he was getting psychological counseling. </p>
<p>But Taylor's face would shine when he sat down with Fleishman to go over 
her steadily rising investments. Fleishman and law partner Dudley Taylor, 
who also represented Taylor in some legal matters, ended up borrowing 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest with Joe. </p>
<p>''I used to say, 'Joe, you're one of the most well-connected people I've ever 
met,'' Fleishman said. </p>
<p>''He would get a smile on his face from ear to ear and he'd say, 'Thank you, 
thank you.''' </p>
<p>September and October proved a particularly frantic time for Taylor during 
which he called on dozens of customers, pitching an array of deals. </p>
<p>Among those he approached was John F. Miller, a Kingsport businessman 
who had become a client in August 1994. If Miller could come up with $2 
million fast, Taylor could make him a lot of money on a city of Memphis 
bond deal in just eight days. </p>
<p>Miller agreed, approving a wire transfer to Taylor on Oct. 11, 1995, after 
borrowing money from First Tennessee Bank. </p>
<p>The next week, however, the financial planner had bad news. The payoff 
would be late. </p>
<p>On Oct. 27, when Miller still didn't have his money, he told Taylor he 
wanted to cash out all his accounts. Taylor agreed, promising to hand over 
the money by Nov. 2. </p>
<p>Sure enough, Taylor appeared the afternoon of Nov. 2 at Miller's electrical 
construction company in Kingsport. He handed Miller a stack of 18 cashier's 
checks totaling $2.54 million. </p>
<p>According to court documents, Miller noticed the checks bore the names of 
a variety of third-party remitters. </p>
<p>At his request, Taylor agreed to go with him to his bank to make sure there 
would be no problem with the checks. </p>
<p>Miller thought Taylor would return Nov. 3 to give him another cashier's 
check for $323,673. But he never saw the financial planner again. </p>
<p>The next morning, a gloomy, chilly Friday, Taylor, 46, pulled his black 1995 
Mercedes into the parking lot of the Rose Mortuary on Kingston Pike, 
arranged final burial plans for him and Becky, got back in the car, pulled into 
a rear parking lot and shot himself in the head with a 10 mm pistol. </p>
<p>About 3 p.m., a mortuary employee noticed Taylor in the car. </p>
<p>A search by police revealed no suicide note. </p>
<p>In the trunk were several briefcases, a large checkbook and several tapes 
including a talking book version of novelist Jeffrey Archer's ''Honor Among 
Thieves.'' </p>
<p>When authorities checked Taylor's pockets, they found a gold pen and a 
gold money clip containing several credit cards, a Tennessee driver's license 
and three $1 bills. </p>
<p>Also tucked in the money clip was Hubbard's handwritten quote on four blue 
Post-it notes. </p>
<p>To police, it appeared well-worn, as if the owner had taken it out often and 
read it over time. </p>

<p><em>''There is no failure except in no longer trying. There is no defeat except 
from within; no insurmountable barrier save our own inherent 
weakness of purpose. Elbert Hubbard. 1911.'' </em></p>
<p align=right><strong>-- The closing sentences of Taylor's not</strong>e. </p>
<p>Many who once applauded Joe Taylor for making them rich have taken a 
hard fall since his death. </p>
<p>Not only was their purported wealth far smaller than they imagined, but in 
numerous cases everything they had given him, including money they 
borrowed, was gone. And, because of the way bankruptcy laws work, 
those who did receive money from Taylor can expect to pay much of it 
back. </p>
<p>Authorities suspect Taylor used Taylor &amp; Associates L.P. as a Ponzi shell to 
shift money back and forth to investors while pocketing some for himself. He 
appeared to divert at least $3 million in about the last 18 months of his life. </p>
<p>For Taylor's funeral, 29 of his closest friends were named by the family as 
honorary or true pallbearers. Of that number, 18 have paid money back to 
the bankrupt limited partnership or filed claims against it or Taylor's personal 
estate. </p>
<p>Other court fights are brewing. </p>
<p>Wayne Knauss of Corryton is suing to recover $145,000 he gave to Taylor 
July 1, 1994, to invest in municipal bonds. Knauss alleges in his Washington 
County, Va., suit that Taylor used Knauss's cashier's check, marked ''For 
municipal bonds,'' to help pay for The Virginian house. </p>
<p>That house was sold Oct. 25 and the disputed money was placed in escrow 
until Knauss's lawsuit is resolved, said Mark R. Graham, Knauss's lawyer. 
Virginian manager Steve Johnson, a former Taylor investor, declined to 
comment for this story. </p>
<p>Luckier than most, Pitkanen had no investments with Taylor. He said he 
sympathizes with the clients, but it is Taylor's family for whom he worries the 
most. </p>
<p>The Taylor boys lost their dad, who they never can replace, he said. </p>
<p>''It's like you're standing on a 10-story building and somebody pulls the rug 
out from under you and you're in a complete free fall,'' Pitkanen said. </p>
<p>Becky Taylor, 45, has moved from the Fox Den house and is living with 
family. The Westland Drive house, which was partly built at the time of 
Taylor's suicide, is expected to be sold with the proceeds to be divided 
between Becky Taylor and her husband's creditors. </p>
<p>Taylor himself left no explanation for why he committed the massive 
flim-flam. The FBI, the trustee for the bankrupt partnership through which he 
funneled his Ponzi, countless lawyers and dear friends have searched without 
success for the answers. </p>
<p>Several possible scenarios have been offered. </p>
<p>Perhaps he started with a series of small thefts that grew bigger when he saw 
he could get away with it. Clients say it appears now Taylor may have 
started pocketing money years ago from some long-term investors. </p>
<p>White-collar thieves often think they can make up a loss and come to believe 
they deserve what they are taking, veteran investigators say. </p>
<p>Or maybe the former farm boy found the trappings of wealth so irresistible 
he had to have it, even if it meant taking from others. </p>
<p>Or maybe Taylor wanted so badly to be recognized as a great investor and a 
great man that he ended up cheating the very people he most wanted to 
impress. </p>
<p>''I think Joe was just one of those people who got caught up in the game. It's 
unfortunate,'' Sgt. Wilson said. ''He hurt a lot of people who were his real 
good friends.'' </p>
<p>Lawyer Fleishman, who lost hundreds of thousands in the Ponzi, said Taylor 
was a quick study with a talent for playing up to the personalities of the 
people with whom he was talking. </p>
<p>He thought she was a ''goody-goody,'' Fleishman said. Taylor urged her to 
get the tape version of William J. Bennett's ''The Book of Virtues,'' a 1993 
collection of writings on issues such as work, courage and honesty. </p>
<p>She once called him her hero. </p>
<p>''A year ago I would have described him as one of the most ethical people I 
knew,'' Fleishman said. </p>
<p>''I certainly wouldn't say that after the fact. It was all a fraud. It was all a 
fiction.'' </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">J</font>oe Taylor was questioned for more
        than two years by his broker-dealer, Advanced Financial
        Planning Securities Corp., about issues ranging from
        possible insider trading to undisclosed outside business activities
        to loans from a client. </p>
        <p>The Brentwood, Tenn., firm never disciplined Taylor,
        in several cases accepting his explanations without
        verification. </p>
        <p>Now some of Taylor's former clients argue Advanced
        Financial bears responsibility for the losses they
        suffered by investing with Taylor, who ran a $50-$60
        million Ponzi investment scheme before taking his life on
        Nov. 3, 1995. </p>
        <p>Four lawsuits were filed Friday in Knox County Circuit
        Court seeking more than $120 million from Advanced
        Financial Planning Corp., its subsidiaries and two
        principals, Thomas J. Parker and Jack Herndon Jr. </p>
        <p>While lodging numerous charges against Advanced
        Financial, the lawsuits accuse the firm of one grievous
        error -- failing to discuss with a former Taylor
        employee, Belinda Kitts, and clients concerns that Kitts
        had about lack of documentation on investments Taylor
        ''sold'' to clients. </p>
        <p>Kitts raised the issue with an Advanced Financial
        executive in late June 1995. </p>
        <p>From that time to Taylor's death, Robert M. Goodfriend
        gave Taylor $7.5 million -- money the chairman and chief
        executive officer of Goody's Family Clothing Inc. said he
        would not have lost had Advanced Financial ''conducted
        the investigation in a proper manner,'' his lawsuit
        states. </p>
        <p>Contacted last week about the possibility of lawsuits
        against the company, Advanced Financial's Nashville
        attorney, Bob Patterson, responded that no basis exists
        ''in either fact or law to cast blame or assert a claim
        against Advanced Financial Planning.'' </p>
        <p>Patterson said Advanced Financial's supervisory duty
        of Taylor related only to the securities he was buying
        through the broker-dealer. Taylor &amp; Associates L.P.
        was a sham, and Taylor never sold or purchased securities through
        the entity, Patterson added. </p>
        <p>The lawsuits -- including those filed by Dr. Jack
        Clark, a Newport optometrist and his relatives, and
        Jeannette Rogers, a Campbell County resident -- accuse
        the company of negligence in its supervision of Taylor. </p>
        <p>The story of Advanced Financial's relationship with
        Taylor in the two years preceeding his death is detailed
        in correspondence from Advanced Financial to the
        Securities and Exchange Commission, which along with the National
        Association of Securities Dealers launched investigations
        following Taylor's death. </p>
        <p>It began in January 1993 when employees of Employee
        Benefit Services, another subsidiary of Advanced
        Financial Planning Corp., noticed that a balance sheet
        for a pension plan of one of Taylor's clients, Dr.
        Kenneth Freels, a Kingsport dentist, listed an asset
        titled Joseph C. Taylor &amp; Associates Inc. </p>
        <p>Herndon, president and compliance officer of Advanced
        Financial Planning Securities Corp., was notified. </p>
        <p>Taylor told Herndon the balance sheet entry should
        have read ''Tellico Trust contribution.'' </p>
        <p>The trust, according to Taylor, consisted of Loudon
        County property he and several friends purchased. Harold
        Elkins, a Knoxville accountant and Taylor friend and
        client, supplied an accounting of the trust to Advanced Financial.
        An attorney hired by Taylor gave Herndon his opinion that
        the trust was not a security. The trust's participants
        also gave affidavits stating they were not purchasing a
        security. </p>
        <p>Since Taylor's death, however, these investors have
        learned that the property had been titled in Taylor's
        name only and sold in April 1994 for a nearly $600,000
        profit. </p>
        <p>Dr. Freels' Defined Pension Trust has a $345,000 claim
        against the limited partnership, and Freels was among
        those filing lawsuits against Advanced Financial on
        Friday. </p>
        <p>In the same month Taylor sold the Loudon County
        property, Herndon heard from another brokerage house that
        Taylor was depositing checks into a client's account --
        and the checks were bouncing. </p>
        <p>Taylor told Herndon that the client, James Gillespie,
        a Maryville pilot, was a close friend, and the checks
        represented payments on money Gillespie loaned to Taylor
        to fund the buyout of participants in the Tellico trust. </p>
        <p>In July 1994, the brokerage house again complained to
        Herndon that non-sufficient fund checks were being
        deposited by Taylor into the Gillespie account. Herndon
        alerted Taylor of the potential violation of New York Stock
        Exchange rules. His warnings were repeated in a
        subsequent letter. </p>
        <p>Gillespie has a $1 million claim against the Taylor
        limited partnership. He has given the trustee $253,656 in
        preferential transfers. </p>
        <p>Only four months passed before Taylor's unorthodox
        activities again came to Herndon's attention. This time,
        the matter involved the buying and selling on the same
        day of Goody's Family Clothing stock -- for a $2,384.50
        loss -- in Taylor's private account with Morgan Keegan
        &amp; Co. Inc. </p>
        <p>On Jan. 13, 1995, Herndon demanded a written memo from
        Taylor explaining the trades, given the personal
        relationship between Taylor and Goodfriend, who owns a
        majority of Goody's stock. </p>
        <p>Two weeks later, Herndon reminded Taylor about the
        memo. Taylor responded that the trades resulted from
        miscommunication with the Morgan Keegan broker. Herndon
        lectured Taylor regarding potential insider trading issues. </p>
        <p>Now, Taylor was in the throes of his Ponzi scheme,
        snaring millions from clients throughout East Tennessee. </p>
        <p>And the sudden appearance of assets on some client's
        balance sheets caught the attention of office worker
        Kitts. </p>
        <p>She told an Advanced Financial executive her concerns
        over the telephone, and reiterated them in a letter in
        which she enclosed copies of investment summaries and
        balance sheets ''for numerous persons,'' according to the lawsuit
        filed by Goodfriend and Knoxville businessman Robert
        Ivins. </p>
        <p>''Basically, all of the highlighted items are
        investments that Joe 'sold' to investors,'' Kitts wrote.
        ''There are no files or paper work on any of these investments. </p>
        <p>''I would prepare an investment summary or balance
        sheet using the information that we had files on. Joe
        would then add in the values of the investments he
        'handles.' '' </p>
        <p>She also mentioned seeing the name Taylor &amp;
        Associates L.P. </p>
        <p>Among the retirement plans she sent were those for Dr.
        Ronald Mabry, a Knoxville chiropracter who has a $2
        million bankruptcy claim, and Tipton Brown, a Newport
        businessman with a $2.7 million claim. </p>
        <p>The allegations sent Taylor into spin control, and he
        weaved explanations that varied with his audience. </p>
        <p>He retained David Andrew, of the Washington law office
        of Baker, Donelson, Bearman &amp; Caldwell, as his
        attorney. He asked Dudley Taylor, a Knoxville lawyer and
        client, to write a memorandum explaining how and why
        Taylor &amp; Associates L.P. was organized. </p>
        <p>A memo dictated by Dudley Taylor described Taylor
        &amp; Associates L.P. as essentially ''an investment
        club'' for family and friends to invest in some businesses
        and real estate. Joe Taylor had no more control over the
        limited partnership than Dudley Taylor or Fleishman, the
        memo stated. </p>
        <p>Dudley Taylor said last week that he has no
        recollection of providing the memo to Joe Taylor or
        Andrew. He believes now that Joe Taylor convinced a
        secretary in the law firm to fax the memo to him with
        promises that he would follow up later with the lawyer
        and make necessary changes. </p>
        <p>''It was just a hodgepodge of stuff that didn't make
        any sense,'' said Dudley Taylor, adding he later ripped
        it up and did not know until after Taylor's death that it
        had been given to Taylor. </p>
        <p>But Joe Taylor shared the memo with Andrew and
        Advanced Financial to bolster his case. </p>
        <p>On July 24, 1995, Taylor gave a ''straightforward and
        successful presentation'' to Parker and Herndon,
        according to a letter from Andrew dated the next day. </p>
        <p>Upon returning to Knoxville, Taylor told his office
        that the matter essentially was closed. Dudley Taylor was
        going to file paperwork necessary to change Taylor &amp;
        Associates to a general partnership versus a limited partnership
        and no problem existed, he told his employees. </p>
        <p>In a letter dated Oct. 19, however, Herndon reminded
        the broker that 60 days had passed since the meeting and
        Taylor had not satisfied the firm's questions. </p>
        <p>Taylor was supposed to document the assets on clients'
        retirement accounts, how the proceeds were distributed in
        the Tellico trust, the circumstances surrounding a
        promissory note from Taylor to a client, and details
        describing the exact purpose of Taylor &amp; Associates
        L.P. </p>
        <p>It's clear now that Taylor was unable to provide such
        answers. </p>
        <p>Many retirement accounts were actually empty, the
        assets dispersed to other investors or pocketed by him. </p>
        <p>The investors no longer owned, nor ever did, Tellico
        trust property. </p>
        <p>He had given several clients promissory notes to
        evidence the value of their investment accounts, which
        were phony. </p>
        <p>And Taylor &amp; Associates L.P. was a
        multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme. </p>

<p><!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Dateline Here--><br>
<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--> <font size=5>N</font>o one can tell you the exact deal or day Joe Taylor quit being a 
legitimate financial adviser and started cheating his clients. </p>
<p>But a year to the day after his death, one thing is for sure -- from late 1993 
until Nov. 3, 1995, Taylor used his Taylor &amp; Associates L.P. to operate one 
of the largest Ponzi investment schemes in the United States. </p>
<p>He took at least 150 clients for roughly $50-60 million and practically none 
of them suspected something was wrong until after he was dead. </p>
<p>''They didn't have any idea,'' said Thomas Jessee, a Johnson City lawyer 
who invested with Taylor and represents several upper East Tennessee 
clients who also did. ''This was absolutely the biggest shock in their lives.'' </p>
<p>''Every single one of them had an extremely high level of trust with him,'' said 
Mark Troutman, a Knoxville lawyer who represents several Taylor 
investors. </p>
<p>''I've been around some pretty good con artists and I didn't pick up on it at 
all,'' said Ralph Harwell of Knoxville, a highly-regarded criminal defense 
attorney who invested with Taylor just before his death. </p>
<p>No one picked up on it because his clients couldn't believe their friend Joe 
Taylor would ever betray their trust. </p>
<p>While funneling millions of dollars through the limited partnership, Taylor 
never once invested in a single bond, stock or other legitimate opportunity 
on behalf of his clients, bankruptcy authorities say. </p>
<p>The Ponzi scheme gets its name from Charles Ponzi, a Boston financier who 
turned a $150 stake in 1919 into a multimillion fraud involving more than 
20,000 investors by 1920. </p>
<p>The scheme is structurally simple, hard to operate and ultimately doomed to 
fail. It creates the illusion of a highly successful investment strategy by paying 
earlier investors with money brought in by later investors. </p>
<p>An example would be a Ponzi operator who collects $1,000 apiece from 
two investors, promising big returns. He then goes out and recruits even 
more investors, paying off his original dupes while pocketing some of the 
proceeds for himself. The scheme continues until the operator can't find 
enough new investors to support the old ones. </p>
<p>Trust was the engine that drove Taylor's Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>''I think he was a charming gentleman, obviously,'' said Margaret Fugate, a 
Johnson City attorney who knew Taylor and represents at least seven 
investors. ''I think he had to be. He came across to people very honestly.'' </p>
<p>Taylor's investments, at first glance, were plausible. The returns, in hindsight, 
were outrageous, but Taylor always talked of having an inside track. </p>
<p>He pitched everything from stocks and bonds, rare coins, pawn shops and 
limited partnerships investing in land and health-care related companies. </p>
<p>He claimed to have access to stock options in local banks at a time when 
they were being gobbled up at premiums by big bank-holding companies. </p>
<p>He said he had dibs on shares in such hot initial public offerings as Netscape, 
an Internet software developer that was a Wall Street darling. When asked 
how he could secure such an allotment when other Knoxville brokers 
couldn't, Taylor talked of working with Norman Thomas of Equitable 
Securities, whom he said was connected to the J. Peter Grace family. </p>
<p>He told of having people working in Nashville who tipped him when bonds 
were about to be called by Tennessee counties, cities and schools. He 
claimed to know of estates that were looking to sell assets at below cost for 
various reasons. </p>
<p>Getting Taylor to provide any paperwork always was a problem. When 
quizzed by clients on the status of their accounts, he might say the 
paperwork was at the office or out in his car. </p>
<p>He'd rely on clients to give him the amounts they invested, and then whip out 
a calculator and do some figuring, from which they'd make handwritten 
notes. These notes are the only documentation many have. </p>
<p>Customers attributed his lack of record-keeping to the fact that he was 
careening through life at 90 miles an hour. </p>
<p>''I think they thought, the people I've talked with . . . even if they thought that 
it was irregular that they could not get paperwork, that they all attributed it 
more to Joe's disorganization than to his dishonesty,'' Fugate said. </p>
<p>Taylor gave some clients checks post-dated to when the supposed 
investment came to fruition. He'd tell them to hold it until he telephoned that 
the deal was done. Sometimes clients cashed the checks. Oftentimes, they 
told Taylor to take their proceeds and roll them over into another deal. 
Other clients received promissory notes from Taylor detailing the amount 
supposedly in their account. </p>
<p>And by dropping the names of prominent East Tennesseans who he claimed 
as friends and clients, Taylor played to his clients' egos -- convincing them 
he was a broker to the best and brightest, and they were lucky he was their 
broker, too. </p>
<p>His client list impressed Kingsport businessman John F. Miller. </p>
<p>Miller said in a September deposition that he understood Taylor's client list 
included Robert M. Goodfriend of Goody's Family Clothing Inc. and Sam 
Furrow, a Knoxville auctioneer and Mercedes-Benz dealer, were among his 
clients. </p>
<p>''You couldn't have got a better bunch to vouch for you if you were selling 
something than this group. . .'' Miller said. </p>
<p>Taylor tried to control what his clients knew about each other's investments. 
For example, he often would tell one client to keep his or her deal private 
because he wasn't making it available to anyone else. </p>
<p>He told clients what they wanted to hear. </p>
<p>Retired Kingsport lawyer, William Gilley, for example, was interested in 
long-term yields. He gave Taylor a series of at least eight checks, totaling 
more than $400,000, between 1990 and 1995. </p>
<p>Each year Taylor would send him a check for the tax on the ''profits'' his 
account was accruing and once, at Gilley's insistence, he bought him a 
$100,000 treasury bond. Gilley let his supposed investments ride and Taylor 
led him to believe his account was worth more than $1 million in 1995. </p>
<p>Businessman Miller, on the other hand, was interested in quick returns. </p>
<p>He had dozens of transactions with Taylor between Aug. 3, 1994, and Nov. 
2, 1995, sometimes investing more than $1 million a month and often getting 
hefty ''profits'' on his investments. </p>
<p>The key was that Taylor always had more money coming in than he was 
paying out. </p>
<p>''I think some people were ahead, but you'll find that most had more money 
in than they got out,'' said Robert M. Bailey, one of the lawyers representing 
Taylor &amp; Associates L.P. bankruptcy trustee William T. Hendon. </p>
<p>By the last three months of his life Taylor's Ponzi scheme had grown to huge 
proportions. He was taking in millions from ''investors'' throughout East 
Tennessee. </p>
<p>''It's on the same scale as some of the largest (Ponzi schemes) in the 
country,'' said Assistant U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee William Sonnenberg, 
whose office monitors bankruptcy proceedings. </p>
<p>But Taylor was apparently in trouble by the fall of 1995. </p>
<p>In the last 80 days of his life he made 174 deposits totaling more than $52.3 
million into the limited partnership account. At the same time, however, he 
made 322 withdrawls totaling $53.2 million. </p>
<p>Some of his clients also were pressuring him for money. </p>
<p>The final blow may have been Taylor's $2.54 million payment to Miller on 
Nov. 2. On that day only $36,000 was left in the limited partnership account 
to cover clients who believed they had millions safely invested. </p>
<p>Taylor apparently kept up with his scheme in his head, on pieces of scratch 
paper and based on what his clients told him. </p>
<p>It was an impressive feat. </p>
<p>''I've seen Ponzi schemes . . . and this one is amazing to me because of the 
size and breadth of it, the amount of people involved,'' Troutman said. </p>
<p>He said most Ponzi schemes fail quickly because they mushroom so fast the 
operators can't keep up with the lies they told. </p>
<p>''But he seemed to keep up with it. He must have been a highly intelligent 
man to keep up with what he had done,'' Troutman said. </p>

        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">I</font>t's auction day in Maynardville.
        Time to sell some land. </p>
        <p>In the blush light under the big, red sale tent, a
        hulking man, the ''owner,'' works the crowd of
        prospective buyers. He's dressed business casual -- knit
        shirt, gold watch, Olympics cap, penny loafers, no socks.
        If the thick air of an August morning or a bum hip bother
        him, it doesn't show. He slaps backs. Talks kin. Like the
        auctioneer's prattle, his smile rarely takes a break. </p>
        <p>Most everybody here knows and likes this guy. He grew
        up in this rural tapestry of hills and hollows, and got
        famous -- and infamous -- in the nearest big town. Still,
        he hands out a few business cards anyway: ''associate,''
        it says, for a company in Georgia. </p>
        <p>By noon, 56 acres of raw Union County land are sold,
        and they're wrapping up the details on the tailgate of a
        pickup truck. The big man and some friends roll to a
        local eatery, Mildred's Country Cooking, for a satisfying
        round of country ham, soup beans and homegrown tomatoes. </p>
        <p>And why not? C.H. Butcher Jr. was going home with
        $204,000. </p>
        <p>C.H. Butcher Jr. Ex-banker. Ex-pillar of the Knoxville
        establishment. Ex-convict. </p>
        <p>At one time he had it all and was aiming for more,
        piecing together an impressive string of banks in
        Tennessee and Kentucky with his brother Jake. Some even
        dubbed it an ''empire.'' </p>
        <p>But in a hail of bank examiners, FBI agents and
        bankruptcy lawyers, the empire was wrecked in the
        mid-1980s, and the Butcher boys went to prison -- C.H.
        for seven years. It might have broken the spirit of other
        men. </p>
        <p>But Butcher is neither broken nor broke. Although he
        can own nothing of significant value in his own name
        because of staggering debts still pending against him in
        U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Butcher is once again spinning
        million-dollar deals. </p>
        <p>He has done it by salvaging pieces of Butcher family
        land in Union County, by tapping old friends for
        financing, and by letting his new wife wear his familiar
        old hat of president and CEO. </p>
        <p>His base of operations is no longer a glass tower in
        downtown Knoxville, but a bucolic estate north of the
        South's big apple -- Atlanta, Ga. </p>
        <p>''I'm such a small potato here,'' said Butcher in a
        recent interview at his new place. ''I never want to be
        the biggest fish in the pond again. Every s.o.b. in the
        world is trying to catch you.'' </p>
        <p>C.H. Butcher Jr. left behind federal prison and a
        halfway house in Atlanta on Feb. 3, 1993. </p>
        <p>He went straight to work, first as a ''financial
        analyst'' for his attorney, Ed Garland, in Atlanta's
        toney Buckhead suburb, and then on his own ventures with
        his new wife Sheryl Moreland. He had divorced his first
        wife, Shirley, his high school sweetheart, while still in
        prison in 1991. </p>
        <p>He feels good about what he's done since his parole,
        and perturbed that anyone could still, more than a decade
        after the fall of the House of Butcher, be interested in
        his movements. </p>
        <p>''I'm proud of what I've accomplished in the four
        years since I've been out,'' he said. ''I've started a
        brand new life, saved my dad's house, my son's house and
        ranch. I've helped my ex-wife survive. </p>
        <p>''I've violated some rules and regulations in the
        past, but I'm not violating them anymore. Not going to
        get close to it.'' </p>
        <p>Many of those rules and regulations pertained to
        banking. But Butcher is not a banker anymore. He's a real
        estate man. And vicariously, through his wife's
        companies, he is planning subdivisions and trailer parks
        and even a big shopping center in Union County. And in
        Georgia, more subdivisions. </p>
        <p>Trouble, however, quietly swirls all around at least
        one of those Georgia developments. </p>
        <p>Of course, the trouble that swallowed the Butcher
        brothers beginning in 1982 is almost as well-known as the
        music of Roy Acuff and Chet Atkins, two other Union
        County sons. </p>
        <p>From the humble start they got from their daddy,
        longtime Maynardville banker and storekeep C.H. Butcher
        Sr., to their manic bank-buying and mobile-home branch
        openings, to the 27-story glass tower thrust up by C.H.
        Butcher Jr. to define Knoxville's skyline and a $3
        billion enterprise, the Butcher brothers seemed the stuff
        of Horatio Alger. </p>
        <p>When trouble came, the spotlight at first fell on C.H.
        Butcher Jr.'s older brother, Jake. Handsome,
        silver-haired, smoother than his rougher-hewn sibling,
        Jake rebounded from two failed runs for governor in the
        1970s to reel in a World's Fair for Knoxville in 1982. </p>
        <p>The day after the fair closed, 200 bank examiners
        descended on the Butcher chain. They found banks polluted
        with shaky loans to Butcher cronies, paper corporations
        loaded with debt, and a massive shell game in which loans
        were shuffled from bank to bank ahead of examiners, who
        themselves would later take heat for not acting sooner. </p>
        <p>One of the worst bank failures since the Great
        Depression was at hand. The images that followed were
        often bizarre: The Valentine's Day 1983 padlocking of
        Jake Butcher's flagship United American Bank. The run by
        panicked, uninsured depositors on C.H. Butcher Jr.'s
        thrift, Southern Industrial Banking Corp. Court-ordered
        sales of Rolls-Royces and furs and bags of unearthed
        silver coins. C.H. Butcher Jr. in handcuffs. </p>
        <p>And bankruptcies, dozens of them, filed in the wake of
        the banking crisis. </p>
        <p>Only now, after 13 years, is the bankruptcy case of
        C.H. Butcher Jr. coming to a close. Butcher insists he
        turned over all he owns to the trustee appointed to find
        and liquidate his assets. But the trustee and his lawyers
        still suspect a cache of gold out there somewhere --
        literally. </p>
        <p>Popular opinion had fancied Jake and C.H. Butcher Jr.
        as genial competitors, each with his own bank -- Jake
        with United American, C.H. with his City &amp; County
        chain. </p>
        <p>In fact, say bankruptcy lawyers and federal
        investigators, C.H. Butcher Jr. was the real dynamo
        behind both chains, the grit to Jake's gloss. </p>
        <p>Whatever. That's all in the past, C.H. says. He's
        focused now on new challenges, new deals, his wife's new
        companies. </p>
        <p>You might think, after the ordeal of disgrace, of
        prison, losing house and home, that C.H. Butcher Jr., now
        58, might be content to spend the rest of his days in a
        nice day job. </p>
        <p>But could a bullrider be content, say, selling shoes? </p>
        <p>Neal Melnick, a Baltimore bankruptcy attorney brought
        to Knoxville 13 years ago to chase Butcher's scattered
        wealth, understands the ex-banker's plan, and even wishes
        him well. So long as he makes money for his wife's
        companies, and not himself, he's OK. </p>
        <p>''What C.H. is trying to do, through this vehicle, is
        re-enter the business world,'' Melnick said. </p>
        <p>''I mean, let's face it -- C.H. isn't going to
        vegetate at his age and sit around and wonder what if.'' </p>
        <p>Since prison, Butcher has worked deals with his
        bankruptcy trustee, with other court officials and with
        an old business associate, G. Wayne Reeder, to map a
        two-front business plan in Union County and in Georgia. </p>
        <p>The most important deal, however, probably was his
        September 1994 marriage to Sheryl Moreland in Las Vegas.
        Butcher says candidly he's using her good credit to carry
        out his business plan. </p>
        <p>Moreland, a sales executive for Levi Strauss &amp; Co.
        and a romantic interest of Butcher's even before his
        jailing in 1986, is president or chief executive of at
        least six companies. She owns the house and farm where
        she and Butcher live near Canton, Ga. Butcher works for
        her company, United Partners Inc., under a ''business
        consultant and management agreement'' that pays him only
        expenses. </p>
        <p>Butcher does the real work of these companies,
        however. His old friend Reeder, who now appears to be an
        adversary, charges in Georgia court documents that
        Moreland merely plays ''straw man.'' </p>
        <p>The companies are engaged in extensive land deals in
        Tennessee and Georgia: </p>
        <p>* In Union County, Butcher and Moreland cut two major
        deals that allowed them to retain control of much Butcher
        family land. </p>
        <p>In one deal last year, a special company called Red
        Gate LLC, with Moreland its manager, took out a $500,000
        loan from Commercial Bank of Harrogate to buy 11 tracts
        of land, including the 261-acre Red Gate quarterhorse
        farm on Highway 33 south of Maynardville. </p>
        <p>It was a private sale that settled a 13-year court
        fight over the assets of the C.H. Butcher III Trust,
        formed by Butcher Jr. for the benefit of his son.
        Butcher's creditors and bankruptcy trustee targeted the
        trust as a shelter for stashed assets. </p>
        <p>Why, of all people, did Sheryl Moreland and C.H.
        Butcher Jr. end up with this land? And at a price only a
        little more than half what it was appraised at? </p>
        <p>For ''numerous and sundry'' reasons, selling to the
        Butcher family was the best way to head off more
        expensive litigation, said John F. Weaver, the trust's
        receiver and liquidator. The purchase money came from a
        legitimate source, he said, and the deal resulted in
        ''not one unhappy creditor.'' </p>
        <p>The other deal was struck in September 1993 when C.H.
        Butcher Sr., then 91 years old, agreed after a civil
        trial in Union County to surrender 450 acres of family
        land to Butcher Jr.'s bankruptcy trustee, James Martin.
        Martin had claimed the elder Butcher had helped his son
        hide assets. </p>
        <p>The deal allowed Butcher Sr. to keep his house and
        about 50 surrounding acres. The 450 acres of surrendered
        land ultimately was bought by Sheryl Moreland for
        $157,000. She got most of it at a Sunday afternoon
        auction. </p>
        <p>''We bought it cheap. Bought it awful cheap, 50 cents
        on the dollar,'' said Butcher. ''Nobody would bid against
        us,'' he said, apparently out of respect to the old man,
        who'd trod that land for most of a century. </p>
        <p>Now Butcher Jr., through his wife's companies, is
        selling part of their Union County real estate to repay
        the loans Moreland took out, and he's planning big
        developments. A big sign on the south end of the Red Gate
        farm beckons: ''Future home of Red Gate Plaza.'' Butcher
        says he's negotiating with major grocers -- badly needed,
        he figures, in a county with only one -- and with
        Maynardville to run utility lines down Highway 33. </p>
        <p>Across the highway, Red Gate Homes, a graveled mobile
        home sales lot next to his son's house, is now stocked
        and running. In the hollows beyond, down Butcher Lane and
        Possum Valley Road, bulldozers have cleared the way for a
        36-lot subdivision, Red Gate Crossing, and a 165-lot
        mobile home park, Red Gate Court. More housing
        developments are planned elsewhere in the county. </p>
        <p>Allen Lee ''Red Dog'' Hicks, a longtime Butcher gofer
        indicted in 1989 on charges he carried documents for Jake
        Butcher in a scheme to get fraudulent loans from a
        Florida bank, will manage the big mobile home park,
        Butcher Jr. said. </p>
        <p>* In Georgia, C.H. Butcher Jr. turned to an old
        friend, G. Wayne Reeder, for $2 million or more in
        financial backing. </p>
        <p>Butcher, as ''consultant'' to his wife's companies, is
        developing at least two major subdivisions -- an
        apparently thriving community of ''cluster homes'' at
        Cartersville, on the northern fringe of the Atlanta
        megalopolis, and a stalled subdivision called Rio Rancho
        in pine woods in Carroll County, west of Atlanta. </p>
        <p>In August, Rio Rancho's development company, Little
        Tallapoosa Development Inc., whose president is Moreland,
        filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. </p>
        <p>The case reveals a bitter rift between Reeder and
        Butcher. ''Together we can make a lot of profitable
        things happen,'' Butcher wrote Reeder in March 1994. By
        June of this year, Reeder was threatening legal action,
        saying he and his family and associates never intended to
        stake Butcher's ''entry back into the high world of
        wheeling and dealing.'' </p>
        <p>But Reeder has far worse problems than a bum land deal
        in Georgia. In November a federal jury in Rhode Island
        convicted Reeder of looting two failed insurance
        companies of $16.5 million. </p>
        <p>It's hard not to like C.H. Butcher Jr. He has grizzly
        bear size but hound dog charm. He shoots straight about
        his troubled past, about pleading guilty to charges that
        put him in prison: bankruptcy and bank fraud, money
        laundering, income tax fraud. </p>
        <p>In the comfortable, pine-paneled trappings of his
        wife's house in Georgia, where framed memories of happier
        days in Knoxville grace the kitchen, Butcher reckons
        he'll never be able to repay the millions of dollars he
        owes. He says he is working to help his wife, to help his
        son, to eat. </p>
        <p>It's clear that this court-ordered pauper is not poor,
        however. </p>
        <p>He said he can't help what folks might think of that. </p>
        <p>''I'm sure it'll tick some people off that I ended up
        with anything, or the family did,'' he said. </p>

        Sheryl Moreland must never sit down. </p>
        <p>The second wife of former Knoxville banker C.H.
        Butcher Jr. has weathered the breakup of his first
        marriage, the dismantling of his fortune in bankruptcy
        court, his seven years in federal prison. Now she is
        keying his unorthodox rebirth as a dealmaker. </p>
        <p>''The world blew up on me and Sheryl just adopted
        me,'' Butcher says. </p>
        <p>Indeed, when parolee Butcher left an Atlanta halfway
        house on Feb. 3, 1993, he found shelter at the Duluth,
        Ga., home of Moreland and her mother, Olive Fulton. </p>
        <p>Years earlier, in Knoxville, it was Butcher who
        provided Moreland with a place to live. </p>
        <p>Moreland is a native Texan raised around Atlanta. Once
        divorced, a mother of grown children, she is slender and
        blonde with a face punctuated with a radiant smile and
        lines commensurate with her age of 53. </p>
        <p>Moreland met Butcher around September 1983. By that
        time, creditors had forced Butcher into bankruptcy, and
        he and his first wife, Shirley, were ''semi-separated,''
        Butcher said in a recent interview. </p>
        <p>Not long after Moreland and Butcher met, Moreland
        moved into a huge luxury cabin on a Washington Pike tract
        known as the Buffalo Farm. The place was owned by
        California real estate speculator G. Wayne Reeder.
        Butcher worked as a ''consultant'' for one of Reeder's
        companies, Reeder Equity Corp., on deals involving
        millions of dollars in property once owned or controlled
        by Butcher -- deals that drew much scrutiny from
        Butcher's bankruptcy trustee. </p>
        <p>Moreland said in a 1986 deposition with the trustee
        that she basically acted as caretaker for the cabin, and
        paid no rent. </p>
        <p>Butcher's business dealings with Reeder soon drew in
        Moreland, too. Reeder staked a venture involving several
        Butcher associates called Bed Shack, a string of high-end
        mattress boutiques in yuppie Atlanta and Dallas suburbs.
        Moreland said she provided retailing advice, and both she
        and her mother were listed as officers in Bed Shack Inc.
        of Georgia. </p>
        <p>Bed Shack flopped. But Moreland, in later years, would
        lend her name to many other Butcher deals. </p>
        <p>In October 1986, Moreland's name emerged publicly
        after Knox County Jail guards grabbed three letters
        Butcher dropped into a trash can during a shakedown.
        Butcher had been jailed on bankruptcy fraud charges.
        Federal prosecutors, arguing against bail for Butcher,
        told a judge the sexually explicit letters showed
        Butcher, while out of jail to work with his attorneys,
        was having liaisons with Moreland. </p>
        <p>''I love you with my life!'' went one of the letters.
        ''Somehow, C.H., we are going to beat these guys.'' </p>
        <p>In fact, prosecutors were able to pin a 20-year prison
        sentence on Butcher after he pled guilty to bankruptcy
        fraud, bank fraud and other crimes. </p>
        <p>But Moreland and Butcher persevered. They married in
        Las Vegas in September 1994, and now Moreland owns their
        house in Georgia and a growing string of companies that
        Butcher himself can't own -- unless, of course, he cares
        to immediately surrender their assets to his many
        creditors in bankruptcy court. </p>
        <p>The main company is aptly named United Partners Inc. </p>
        <p>Butcher candidly professes dependence on Moreland's
        good credit, and stresses that Moreland is a success in
        her own right. </p>
        <p>A longtime sales executive with Levi Strauss &amp;
        Co., she earns in excess of $100,000 plus expenses, and
        parks a Lexus beside Butcher's cellular-equipped Chrysler
        LHS in her two-car garage. </p>

        post-prison business affairs might include not only land
        developments in his native Union County and in Georgia,
        but a string of pawnshops in Florida. </p>
        <p>Butcher's name surfaced recently in the bankruptcy
        case of Taylor &amp; Associates L.P., the investment firm
        of the late Joseph C. Taylor. Taylor, who committed
        suicide in 1995, used the firm to defraud numerous
        investors of millions of dollars through an elaborate
        Ponzi scheme. </p>
        <p>In a September deposition of Dudley Taylor, a
        Knoxville lawyer and Taylor investor, Butcher and a
        former associate, Memphis lawyer Karl Schledwitz, were
        mentioned in connection with the Florida pawnshops. </p>
        <p>Said Dudley Taylor: ''C.H. had some connection with
        pawnshops. I don't know if he owned them or controlled
        them or just knew of somebody else that had them, but he
        thought they were gold mines, thought it was something
        that either ought to be taken public or that they ought
        to raise some money through some type of private
        financing. . . .'' </p>
        <p>Butcher inquired whether a meeting could be set up
        with the ''financial wizard,'' Joe Taylor, to discuss the
        pawnshop opportunity. Dudley Taylor, in the deposition,
        said Joe Taylor reportedly explained that he was ''in the
        public trust business'' and declined to get involved with
        Schledwitz and Butcher, who both were convicted of
        federal crimes. </p>

        <td valign="top" width="470"><h1>Sheryl Moreland Inc. </h1>
        <p>C.H. Butcher Jr.'s wife, Sheryl Moreland, is chief
        executive of several companies formed to do business in
        Tennessee and Georgia. She heads the companies because
        her husband, who works for Moreland as an ''associate''
        or ''consultant,'' is barred from owning significant
        property himself because of huge debts still pending
        against him from his bankruptcy case. Here are the main
        known companies of Sheryl Moreland. </p>
        <p>* <b>Red Gate Properties LLC</b> -- A Tennessee
        limited liability company formed in December 1994 to
        salvage -- for $500,000 -- 11 tracts of land in Union
        County. The land was in a trust set up for C.H. Butcher
        Jr.'s son, C.H. ''Butch'' Butcher III. Creditors forced
        liquidation of the trust. The purchased tracts included
        the Red Gate quarterhorse farm on Highway 33 south of
        Maynardville. </p>
        <p>* <b>CHB-Three Inc.</b> -- Incorporated in Georgia in
        August 1995, this is the ''operating company'' developing
        the Red Gate farm property and other land in Union
        County, according to Butcher. It is owned by a trust for
        which Butcher Jr. is trustee, the Butcher Grandchildren's
        Trust, but Sheryl Moreland is chief executive officer.
        CHB-Three Inc. has a ''million-dollar net worth,''
        Butcher Jr. says. The company has auctioned land
        recently, and is developing a strip shopping center, a
        mobile home sales lot and park, and two or more
        subdivisions. </p>
        <p>* <b>United Partners Inc.</b> -- Formed in December
        1992 to develop Georgia real estate, including a 200-lot
        ''cluster home'' subdivision called The Village at
        Cartersville. Butcher has a ''consulting contract'' with
        United Partners, whose president is Moreland. </p>
        <p>* <b>Southern Value Homes Inc.</b> -- Formed in
        Georgia in June 1994 to build houses, according to
        Butcher. It is teamed with United Partners Inc. in
        developing The Village subdivision at Cartersville.
        Moreland is president. </p>
        <p>* <b>Little Tallapoosa Development Inc.</b> -- Formed
        in May 1994 to develop a sprawling subdivison west of
        Atlanta called Rio Rancho, on the banks of the Little
        Tallapoosa River. The company filed for Chapter 11
        bankruptcy reorganization in August in Newnan, Ga. An old
        Butcher associate, G. Wayne Reeder, is waging a bitter
        fight to recoup investments in the stalled venture. </p>
        <p>* <b>Rio Rancho Developers LLC</b> -- A limited
        liability company formed in Georgia in May 1995
        ostensibly to support the development of the Rio Rancho
        subdivision. Moreland owns 50 percent of the company, and
        a ''third party'' owns the other half, according to
        bankruptcy papers filed by Moreland. <!-- This document was created using BeyondPress(TM) 2.0.3 -434064. --> </p>

        chronology </h1>
        <p>* <b>Nov. 1, 1982</b> -- The day after the World''s
        Fair ends, banking regulators begin sweeping,
        simultaneous examinations of Butcher banks. A massive
        shell game of bad and ''insider'' loans, shuffled from
        bank to bank ahead of examiners, is revealed. The fall of

        <p>* <b>Feb. 14, 1983</b> -- Jake Butcher's flagship,
        United American Bank in Knoxville, is closed and sold on

        Southern Industrial Banking Corp. start run on the thrift
        to withdraw uninsured deposits. </p>
        <p>* <b>May 27, 1983</b> -- Tennessee banking
        commissioner closes five banks, including C.H. Butcher
        Jr.'s flagship City &amp; County Bank of Knox County,

        <p>* <b>June 24, 1983</b> -- The Federal Deposit
        Insurance Corp. and three banks holding more than $13

        agent James R. Martin as trustee of Butcher Jr.'s
        bankruptcy estate. Martin begins often bizarre 13-year
        odyssey to find and sell off Butcher family assets.
        Baltimore lawyer Neal Melnick imported to help. </p>
        <p>* <b>July 26, 1984</b> -- Sale of Shirley and C.H.
        Butcher Jr.'s home atop Black Oak Ridge, called
        ''Butch-Vue,'' ratified by court for $315,000. </p>

        Clive W. Bare denies C.H. Butcher Jr. discharge from
        bankruptcy, meaning he can't own significant property and
        always will be obliged to repay millions in debt. </p>
        <p>* <b>April 22, 1985</b> -- Jake Butcher pleads guilty
        to stealing more than $17 million from his banks and
        cheating on income tax. He serves six years and eight

        twists in the search for Butcher Jr.'s assets, 4,320

        buried. </p>
        <p>* <b>May 22, 1987</b> -- Federal judge sentences C.H.
        Butcher Jr. to 20 years in prison after he pleads guilty

        <p>* <b>Oct. 9, 1991</b> -- Butcher Jr.'s bid for early
        parole draws furious opposition. ''History will treat
        Butcher as the consumate white-collar criminal,'' says
        Assistant U.S. Attorney Guy W. Blackwell. Bankruptcy
        lawyer Neal Melnick, laboring for years to find Butcher

        difficulty with fabrications.'' </p>
        <p>* <b>Feb. 3, 1993</b> -- C.H. Butcher Jr. freed on
        parole after serving seven years of a 20-year sentence in
        minimum-security federal prison camp and a halfway house

        Atlanta attorney, Ed Garland, and begins 15 years of
        probation. </p>
        <p>* <b>Sept. 1, 1994</b> -- C.H. Butcher Jr. marries
        longtime sweetheart Sheryl Moreland in Las Vegas. She
        employs Butcher under a ''business consultant and
        management agreement'' and together they develop land in
        Tennessee and Georgia. </p>
        <p>* <b>Oct. 16, 1996</b> -- Bankruptcy trustee James
        Martin files request to close the C.H. Butcher Jr.
        bankruptcy case, saying all assets have been converted to
        cash or otherwise disposed of. Creditors get $14.6
        million, but claims against Butcher Jr. still top $92
        million. </p>
        <p>* <b>Aug. 2, 1996</b> -- Little Tallapoosa Development
        Inc., one of many companies headed by Moreland but
        ostensibly run by Butcher, files for Chapter 11
        bankruptcy reorganization in Newnan, Ga. Case reveals
        bitter rift over fate of a west Georgia subdivision
        between Moreland, Butcher and financial backer G. Wayne
        Reeder. </p>
        <p>* <b>Nov. 8, 1996</b> -- G. Wayne Reeder, longtime
        business associate of C.H. Butcher Jr. and financial
        backer of Georgia land deals arranged by Butcher and wife
        Sheryl Moreland, convicted by federal jury in Rhode
        Island of stealing $16.5 million from two insurance
        companies. </p>

        Cobbling a comeback</h1>
        <p>C.H. Butcher Jr., imprisoned and left owing more than
        $85 million following the fall of his Tennessee banking
        empire, is again working million-dollar business deals in
        Tennessee and Georgia. He has done it by salvaging pieces
        of Butcher family land in Union County, by tapping old
        friends for financing, and -- because he can't own
        anything personally due to his obligations in bankruptcy
        court -- by letting his new wife, Sheryl Moreland, wear

        writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">H</font>. Butcher Jr. and his wife, Sheryl
        Moreland, call their wooded estate in Canton, Ga., Red
        Gate Ridge. A massive wood and stone sign marks the
        entrance. A horse head is incorporated into the G. </p>
        <p>The name is a throwback to the Red Gate farm in Union
        County, where Butcher's son still engages in the
        high-dollar game of quarterhorse breeding. </p>
        <p>Red Gate Ridge is both home and headquarters for C.H.
        Butcher Jr. </p>
        <p>Here, he is fashioning a new life -- and a newfangled
        business portfolio. </p>
        <p>It may never match the banking ''empire'' he and
        brother Jake once carved back home in Tennessee, but it
        already has notched million-dollar deals. </p>
        <p>Red Gate Ridge is in Cherokee County, rolling and
        rural horse country just now catching fire as a distant
        ''exurb'' of Atlanta, roughly 35 miles south. </p>
        <p>Feel free to drive into Red Gate Ridge. What began
        essentially as raw land is now a small subdivision with a
        county-maintained road. Butcher worked out the details. </p>
        <p>The new house on the right belongs to Tennel Robinson,
        Butcher's personal accountant and bookkeeper from the old
        banking days. </p>
        <p>Robinson, once sued by Butcher's bankruptcy trustee as
        part of a massive conspiracy to hide assets, now keeps
        the books for the numerous companies headed, at least in
        name, by Butcher's wife. Companies with active land
        developments in Tennessee's Union County, and in Georgia.
        </p>
        <p>Across the way is another house; that's where
        Moreland's daughter lives. </p>
        <p>At the back of the development, behind a brick and
        iron security gate, is the older, two-story house where
        Butcher and Moreland live. </p>
        <p>It's no mansion, certainly not the size of his former
        residence, called Butch-Vue, high atop Knoxville's Black
        Oak Ridge. </p>
        <p>Inside, the kitchen is bright and modern, the living
        room clad in thick wood paneling and filled with heavy,
        overbuilt furniture. </p>
        <p>In October, workers were busy erecting yet another
        house next door. Moreland's mother, Olive Fulton, will
        occupy the upstairs; the new business offices will go in
        the basement. </p>
        <p>Butcher, on a golf-cart tour of the 50-acre estate --
        remarkable for its woods, its plank fences, its serenity
        -- professes deep satisfaction. </p>
        <p>''I couldn't be happier,'' he says. </p>
        <p>Though he is the driving force behind Red Gate Ridge,
        and the companies based here, he doesn't own any of it.
        He can't. </p>
        <p>When his banks failed and his business affairs were
        placed in bankruptcy court in Knoxville in the early
        1980s, the bottom line tallied tens of millions of
        dollars in outstanding debts. </p>
        <p>Those debts have not been forgiven. Any significant
        wealth accrued by Butcher must be surrendered. </p>
        <p>But Butcher is free to make millions, if he can,
        vicariously through his wife and ''her'' companies. </p>
        <p>Butcher's bankruptcy trustee, still suspicious after
        13 years that the once evasive ex-banker might have
        valuable assets squirreled away somewhere, is not unaware
        of Red Gate Ridge. One of his lawyers even dropped by to
        have a look. </p>
        <p>Moreland bought the place from Butcher's Atlanta
        attorney and employer, Ed Garland, by assuming a $200,000
        loan. Garland gave him the job he needed as a parolee out
        of prison. </p>
        <p>Garland dabbles in many real estate and business
        investments, Butcher says. </p>
        <p>In a 1994 deposition, Butcher described his work for
        Garland's firm as ''a financial analyst or a workout
        specialist'' on some of the firm's ''bad investments.'' </p>
        <p>Butcher and Moreland are hoping for few bad
        investments of their own. </p>
        <p>From Red Gate Ridge, they are planning everything from
        a strip shopping center and subdivisions in Union County,
        to a ''cluster home'' community called The Village in
        Cartersville, Ga. </p>
        <p>Under development by United Partners Inc., whose
        president is listed as Moreland, The Village looks to be
        a hit. </p>
        <p>It is designed for long-range commuters with modest
        means but a taste for amenities like a pool and tennis
        courts. </p>
        <p>One Sunday afternoon in October, a steady stream of
        cars pulled up to tour cute model cottages finished in
        faux shutters, plush carpets and pastel interiors. </p>
        <p>Visitors are welcome to take a business card:
        ''Shirley R. Butcher, Interior Design.'' Shirley Butcher,
        C.H. Butcher Jr.'s ex-wife, lives in one of the larger
        new homes on a corner lot in The Village. A Gatlinburg
        mortgage company gave her a $58,000 loan in March,
        according to records at the Bartow County, Ga.,
        courthouse. </p>
        <p>The Village was featured as ''development of the
        week'' in 1995 in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's
        hefty ''Homefinder'' section. A framed clipping hangs
        above Butcher's big wooden desk, tucked into a corner of
        his living room. </p>
        <p>Many other framed mementos hang in this house: A
        picture of Butcher's silver-haired father, C.H. Butcher
        Sr., with trademark stogie and white suit; a photo of
        C.H. Jr. and brother Jake with Jimmy Carter; a panoramic
        shot of Knoxville's 1982 World's Fair, which the Butcher
        brothers so vigorously promoted. </p>
        <p>And there's a glimpse of C.H. Butcher Jr. in federal
        prison in Tallahassee, Fla. </p>
        <p>''I thought the world was over when that picture was
        taken,'' says Butcher. </p>
        <p>The world, for the most part, is looking up for him
        now. </p>

        conviction</b></font>
        <p><font size="2">By Wesley Loy, News-Sentinel staff
        writer</font></p>
        <p><font size="5">W</font>ayne Reeder, like his old
        business associate C.H. Butcher Jr., once lorded over a
        multimillion-dollar empire. Now Reeder is very likely
        headed for the same end as Butcher -- prison. </p>
        <p>Butcher seemed to allude to that in a March 1994
        letter to Reeder. </p>
        <p>''Should you become unlucky and be absent a few
        months, this is one venture that will be in place when
        you return,'' wrote Butcher, hitting up his old friend
        for an investment in a Georgia subdivision. </p>
        <p>On Nov. 8 a federal jury in Providence, R.I.,
        convicted Reeder of stealing $16.5 million from two
        insurance companies. </p>
        <p>Prosecutors argued that Reeder, a Southern California
        real estate investor now living in Texas, along with
        former Texas oilman and banker Charles Christopher, took
        over American Universal Insurance Co. of Providence and
        Diamond Benefits Life Insurance Co. of Arizona in 1988,
        vowing to turn the troubled companies around. </p>
        <p>Instead, they quickly siphoned off millions of dollars
        to, among other things, pay off liens on Reeder's real
        estate holdings, prosecutors charged. </p>
        <p>American Universal would become the largest Rhode
        Island insurer ever to fail. </p>
        <p>Reeder, in his mid-60s, is free pending his March 6
        sentencing. He faces a maximum of 75 years in prison and
        millions in fines for his conviction on five counts of
        wire fraud and five counts of interstate transportation
        of stolen property. </p>
        <p>Reeder's defense attorney was Don Samuel, a partner in
        the Atlanta law firm where Butcher now works as a
        ''financial analyst.'' Butcher said he recommended Samuel
        to Reeder. </p>
        <p>The Rhode Island conviction is the knottiest in a
        coast-to-coast string of troubles for Reeder, whose
        colorful past already included a 1975 tax conviction and
        alleged ties to a violence-plagued bingo operation, a
        savings and loan swindler and even Contra arms sales,
        according to a book on the S&amp;L crisis, ''Inside
        Job.'' </p>
        <p>Reeder was quoted once as saying he first met Butcher
        at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport in the summer of 1983 to
        discuss the purchase of a West Virginia residential
        resort reeling under the weight of loans from Butcher
        banks. </p>
        <p>By this time, Butcher's banking empire was in ruins,
        and his own estate was under assault by a court-ordered
        liquidator in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. </p>
        <p>''To me, he was just a super nice guy who had some
        problems,'' Reeder said at the time. </p>
        <p>The burly Reeder, fond of sucking unlit cigars, was
        known as ''The Garbage Man'' for his habit of buying
        troubled properties and making them profitable. By the
        time he met Butcher, he held a real estate fortune in
        more than a dozen states. </p>
        <p>He and Butcher were a good match. Butcher needed a job
        and a way to salvage property owned by himself, his
        family and friends. Reeder was ready to buy, and soon
        Butcher was a ''consultant'' for Reeder Equity Corp. and
        a related trust purportedly for Butcher's son, C.H.
        ''Butch'' Butcher III. </p>
        <p>Butcher brought Reeder lots of deals, many involving
        property Butcher knew well from having either owned it
        himself or loaned money on it -- from bank buildings and
        a Norris Lake boat dock in Union County to raw land in
        Florida to a 173-acre Knox County tract known as the
        Buffalo Farm. At one time, Reeder even had an option to
        buy the Union County Bank -- the first and last of the
        Butcher chain. </p>
        <p>The compact between Reeder and Butcher drew intense
        scrutiny from a federal grand jury and Butcher's
        bankruptcy trustee, who claimed Reeder Equity and the
        trust were part of extensive efforts by Butcher to hide
        assets and continue a life of luxury. </p>
        <p>Ultimately, the trustee liquidated much Butcher
        property -- including $300,000 in ''missing'' Treasury
        notes Reeder was forced to turn over -- and Butcher went
        to prison for bankruptcy fraud and other crimes. </p>
        <p>Reeder moved on to new ventures -- and troubles. </p>
        <p>In Houston, his two main companies, Hill Top
        Developers and RHI Holdings Inc., are being liquidated in
        U.S. Bankruptcy Court. </p>
        <p>The biggest creditors are the two insurance companies
        Reeder was convicted of looting in Rhode Island. </p>
        <p>Hill Top came up locally in a January 1984 deposition
        of Butcher's ex-wife, Shirley Butcher, who following her
        own stint in prison worked for a Reeder property
        management company collecting bills by telephone on
        timeshare condominiums. </p>
        <p>Hill Top, she said, loaned her $10,000 for ''a little
        corporation'' she wanted to start in Florida -- but never
        did -- to sell office supplies. </p>
        <p>Reeder also has a fight on his hands in California,
        where he is suing his former business associate, William
        Geary. </p>
        <p>Reeder claims Geary absconded with millions of dollars
        in property, some of which is in East Tennessee. </p>

        <p><br>
        <font size="5">V</font>ILLA RICA, Ga. -- In March 1994,
        C.H. Butcher Jr. sent a letter and a proposed ''joint
        venture agreement'' to G. Wayne Reeder, a Southern
        California real estate speculator. </p>
        <p>Butcher was only a year out of prison and needed a
        backer for some business ventures he had in mind. </p>
        <p>He had dealt with Reeder before. In the mid-1980s
        Butcher -- his banking empire in ruins and his personal
        affairs in bankruptcy -- worked as a Reeder
        ''consultant'' on million-dollar deals in East Tennessee
        and Florida. </p>
        <p>''Together we can make a lot of profitable things
        happen,'' Butcher wrote his old friend. </p>
        <p>The proposed joint venture would not involve Butcher
        as a principal, however. It couldn't. Butcher still owed
        many millions from his bankruptcy case, and any wealth he
        generated in his own name would be subject to immediate
        forfeiture to his creditors. </p>
        <p>No, the deal would be between his wife, Sheryl
        Moreland, as president of a company called United
        Partners Inc., and Reeder ''acting on behalf of family,
        friends and associates.'' </p>
        <p>Moreland, under the agreement, ''will be the principal
        spokesman for UPI. C.H. Butcher Jr. will serve as a
        consultant to UPI and bring many opportunities'' to the
        joint venture. </p>
        <p>Butcher, in his letter to Reeder, vouched for his wife
        in the strongest terms: ''I will stake my life on
        Sheryl's honesty and sincerity in our relationship and
        doing the honorable thing if any problems should arise.
        She is battle tested and received A's on all fronts.'' </p>
        <p>Butcher closed the letter: ''As my Dad would say, 'The
        man with the gold sets the rules.' It is your decision
        and your call on how fast and when you want to move
        forward.'' </p>
        <p>Some months later, Butcher sent another letter via
        Federal Express to Reeder spelling out the deal further:
        United Partners Inc. would be a ''shell corporation with
        no assets or liability.'' It would borrow money from
        Reeder's ''friends or family'' and then ''lend to
        different projects,'' taking a percentage of the profit.
        Butcher, as ''consultant'' to United Partners Inc., would
        bring various deals to Reeder for review. </p>
        <p>Reeder signed on, and soon became half owner in a
        venture called Little Tallapoosa Development Inc. </p>
        <p>The main asset of Little Tallapoosa Development Inc.
        was a 240-acre subdivision winding deep into scrub pine
        and red clay near Villa Rica in Carroll County, well west
        of Atlanta. The subdivision, called Rio Rancho, is on the
        banks of a small river, the Little Tallapoosa. </p>
        <p>But this fall, 21/2 years after Butcher began
        negotiations with Reeder, most of Rio Rancho's lots
        remained empty and overgrown. And unlike another suburban
        Atlanta subdivision staked by Reeder for Butcher and
        Moreland, the model home at Rio Rancho was drawing few
        house hunters one sunny day in October. In fact, it was
        deserted. </p>
        <p>Little Tallapoosa Development Inc. filed for Chapter
        11 bankruptcy reorganization and protection from
        creditors Aug. 2 in Newnan, Ga. </p>
        <p>The bankruptcy case sheds much light on Butcher's
        post-prison business affairs, and what now appears to be
        a bitter split between old friends. </p>
        <p>By this summer, Butcher's rosy forecast of six-figure
        profits -- purportedly scrawled out by hand in a rough
        outline in 1994 -- had dissolved into threats of legal
        action from Reeder. </p>
        <p>''To me, this whole thing is real simple,'' Reeder
        wrote Moreland in June. ''Through my ex-wife, former
        business associates, friends, etc., I was able to get you
        and C.H. in excess of $2 million to use for building and
        developing several Georgia properties. Among other
        things, we never had any idea that some of these funds
        would be used to 'jump start' C.H.'s entry back into the
        high world of wheeling and dealing! </p>
        <p>''Well, enough is enough, you and C.H. owe my family,
        friends, etc., a lot of money and they want it back. We
        can attempt to come to a mutual settlement either alone,
        or with lawyers, just let me know.'' </p>
        <p>As it turned out, the matter went to the lawyers. </p>
        <p>The bankruptcy case involves a vexing maze of
        companies -- some connected to Reeder, others to Moreland
        and Butcher -- involved in the Rio Rancho deal. </p>
        <p>The bankruptcy filing was triggered by a foreclosure
        action on the Rio Rancho property by Veredyne Ltd., a
        Delaware corporation headed by Reeder associate Jessie
        Warner. Veredyne loaned Little Tallapoosa Development
        Inc. $300,000 to develop the subdivision, according to
        court records. </p>
        <p>Little Tallapoosa also is, or was, in default on
        another $300,000 loan from the Citizens Bank &amp; Trust
        of West Georgia. </p>
        <p>In early September, attorneys for Moreland and Little
        Tallapoosa filed a motion asking for permission to sell
        Rio Rancho lots ''free and clear of liens and claims.'' </p>
        <p>That drew an angry response from Reeder, who told the
        court the proposed sale was a ''sham'' designed to
        transfer the property at below market prices to an entity
        called Canton Partners -- an ''insider'' controlled by
        Butcher, Reeder said. </p>
        <p>Reeder also informed the court that Moreland, the
        president of Little Tallapoosa, was nothing more than a
        ''straw man,'' or front person, for Butcher. </p>
        <p>''Tallapoosa and all of its business dealings are
        solely controlled by Mr. C.H. Butcher,'' said Reeder. </p>
        <p>Moreland, he added, ''has absolutely no experience
        whatsoever in the area of land development, single family
        home construction, subdivision sales and/or marketing.'' </p>
        <p>The bankruptcy case is still pending. </p>
        <p>Butcher and Moreland, contacted at their home near
        Canton, Ga., declined to discuss the bankruptcy case. </p>
        <p>Reeder, now living in Houston, could not be reached. </p>
        <p>No matter. The Tallapoosa tussle appears to be one of
        his smaller problems anyway. In November a federal jury
        in Rhode Island convicted Reeder of fleecing two
        insurance companies of $16.5 million. </p>

        Epic bankruptcy took C.H. trustee on bizarre trail</font><p><font
        size="2"><i>By Wesley Loy, News-Sentinel staff writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">C</font>.H. Butcher Jr. was in deep
        trouble by the time he met Neal Melnick for the first
        time in 1984. </p>
        <p>Federal authorities had dismantled Butcher's chain of
        banks because of shady loan practices. The FBI and
        federal prosecutors were taking a deep and abiding
        interest in his activities. </p>
        <p>And there was the bankruptcy case. The year before,
        the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. teamed with some
        other creditors to force Butcher's business affairs into
        U.S. Bankruptcy Court. </p>
        <p>That's what brought attorney Melnick to town, to help
        Butcher's bankruptcy trustee hunt down and sell off all
        of Butcher's property -- a fortune he was doing his best
        to hide. </p>
        <p>The meeting happened at a West Knoxville restaurant.
        Butcher and another guy walked in and started working the
        room, saying their hellos. When Butcher got to Melnick's
        table and realized who he was, he shocked Melnick by
        having a seat. He stayed for five hours, until the place
        closed, sipping Old Charter while Melnick drank Jack
        Daniels. </p>
        <p>Butcher oozed confidence. He revealed things Melnick
        had never heard before, like his dealings with a
        high-stakes Indian bingo operation in Arizona. </p>
        <p>And he bragged. </p>
        <p>''He said he had assets it'd take a team of
        Philadelphia lawyers 17 years to find,'' recalls Melnick.
        </p>
        <p>''I couldn't take notes, obviously, but when I got
        back to my hotel I wrote up a three-page memorandum of
        everything I could remember. I was interviewed by the FBI
        the next morning. It was bizarre.'' </p>
        <p>As it happened, Melnick was from Baltimore, not
        Philadelphia. And it didn't take him and his colleagues
        17 years to find Butcher's stuff, only 13. </p>
        <p>But did they find it all? </p>
        <p>Melnick concedes, probably not. </p>
        <p>In October, a document called ''request to close'' was
        at last filed in the epic, ''involuntary'' bankruptcy
        case of C.H. Butcher Jr. </p>
        <p>Today, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Richard Stair Jr.
        is expected to grant that request -- in a courtroom high
        up in the glass and steel skyscraper Butcher himself
        built, owned and finally lost to help pay his debts. </p>
        <p>And so comes the end of a grueling and strange odyssey
        for Butcher's trustee, ex-FBI agent James R. Martin --
        not one for talking much to the media -- and for Melnick
        and the other lawyers who helped him. </p>

                C.H. Butcher Jr.'s bankruptcy estate. He and his
                attorneys Melnick, Moore and Brooks spent 13
                years tracking down and selling Butcher's assets
                including the Plaza Tower in downtown Knoxville.</strong></font></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Their task was to sort through the Byzantine
        world of Butcher's finances. Martin and the others probed
        secret Caribbean bank accounts, waded through a conundrum
        of corporations and trusts, collected tons of buried
        silver coins, learned the intimacies of high-dollar
        quarterhorse breeding, converted Rolls-Royces and fine
        homes into cash, ran a mobile home factory once
        controlled by Butcher, and even sat on the board of the
        Union County Bank -- the first and last of the Butcher
        empire. </p>
        <p>And they wondered -- what ever became of nearly $2
        million in gold? </p>
        <p>Records from the bankruptcy case, tons of them, are
        piled high in a mini-warehouse storage unit, a paper
        monument to the thousands of hours of digging through
        Butcher business -- hours that paid the liquidators
        handsomely. </p>
        <p>The final numbers in the case are impressive: In all,
        $14.6 million will be paid to Butcher's ''unsecured''
        creditors, those who didn't have a legal hold on land,
        cash or some other valuable asset to back up whatever
        dealings they had with Butcher Jr. </p>
        <p>But $85.4 million is still owed, and always will be so
        long as Butcher's creditors choose to pursue the debts.
        That's because Butcher was denied a discharge from his
        bankruptcy case. His debts, in short, are not forgiven,
        which is the bottom line in many bankruptcy cases. </p>
        <p>Of the 70 creditors, the largest are the FDIC, which
        insured deposits in the Butcher banks, and the bankruptcy
        estate of Butcher's failed Southern Industrial Banking
        Corp., a thrift whose failure left hundreds of uninsured
        depositors essentially out of luck. </p>
        <p>Most of the other creditors are bank stockholders who
        swapped their shares to Butcher for a note promising
        future payment that never came. </p>
        <p>Butcher's case was only one of dozens of tedious
        bankruptcies spinning off the tumultuous collapse of the
        $3 billion financial empire he built with brother Jake. </p>
        <p>The other cases included the SIBC bankruptcy, in which
        bitter depositors tried desperately and mainly in vain to
        recoup some of their savings -- life savings, in many
        cases. </p>
        <p>Jake Butcher's affairs were placed in bankruptcy, too,
        though unlike his brother, Jake chose not to play hide
        and seek with his trustee. </p>
        <p>Others in bankruptcy: C.H.'s ex-wife, Shirley, who got
        a three-year prison sentence for helping her husband hide
        assets; and accountant David Crabtree, who worked myriad
        deals for C.H. Butcher Jr. and also did time for
        bankruptcy fraud. </p>
        <p>Surely, though, C.H. Butcher Jr.'s bankruptcy case was
        the granddaddy, offering enough challenges for a roomful
        of CPAs, enough intrigue for a John Grisham novel. </p>
        <p>Some highlights: </p>
        <p>* Martin and his attorneys successfully won ownership
        of something called the ''Shirley R. Butcher Irrevocable
        Trust,'' devised, they charged, to hide assets. Held in
        the trust was $500,000; a Key Biscayne, Fla.,
        condominium; C.H. and Shirley Butcher's massive but
        somewhat tacky Knoxville house called Butch-Vue, atop
        Black Oak Ridge; and a brown 1980 Rolls-Royce. </p>
        <p>Martin and Melnick personally drove that Rolls back to
        Knoxville from Miami -- not as much fun as it sounds,
        says Melnick. </p>
        <p>''Rolls-Royce's are overrated,'' he says. ''They have
        the turning radius of a 747.'' </p>
        <p>* One of the oddest moments came on April 21, 1987,
        when 4,320 pounds of silver coins were hauled to the
        Downtown Island Airport in a U-Haul truck for surrender
        to the FBI. </p>
        <p>The coins -- in muddy and rotting bank bags --
        apparently had been buried for some time. John Gill, then
        U.S. attorney in Knoxville, personally drove the truck
        from the airport to an armored car depot downtown, and
        turned them over to Martin. </p>
        <p>Martin argued in a lawsuit that Butcher, his banking
        empire ''crumbling around him'' in the 1983, asked his
        partners in the silver investment, Arnold and Sara
        Tackett, to turn over his share of coins. They were taken
        to the Red Gate farm at Maynardville, where Butcher's son
        still keeps quarterhorses, and disappeared until the
        surrender. </p>
        <p>The coins ultimately were parceled into canvas
        currency bags specially made up and stamped: ''Property
        of Bankruptcy Estate of C.H. Butcher Jr. $100 face
        value.'' Buyers snapped them up at a Saturday morning
        auction at the Kerbela Temple. </p>
        <p>And Melnick, who now lives in Knoxville, framed an
        empty bag for his office wall. </p>
        <p>* Martin and Melnick made three trips to the Caymans,
        a string of Caribbean islands famous for posh vacations
        and secret bank accounts. </p>
        <p>Among Butcher's Cayman accounts was one containing $2
        million for a corporation formed by Butcher and Crabtree
        called United Southern Ltd. </p>
        <p>Martin and Melnick chased that money long and hard,
        eventually learning that a pair of Atlanta lawyers,
        Robert Schwind and David Hill, were instructed to use the
        money to ''purchase gold coins in such a manner as to
        prevent any tracing of their origin,'' according to a
        lawsuit brought by Martin. </p>
        <p>Ultimately, some $1.6 million was turned to gold,
        which, according to Melnick, Hill claimed he lost to
        robbers at a hotel in Toronto, Canada. Which certainly
        seemed plausible to Melnick. </p>
        <p>''We checked with the Toronto police and they had
        reports of King Kong walking down the street with two
        suitcases of gold,'' he says. </p>
        <p>The exact whereabouts of both the gold and Hill remain
        unknown. </p>
        <p>In January 1986, Martin and Melnick filed a novel,
        56-page lawsuit against Butcher, his wife, father, son
        and many associates outlining a pattern of
        ''racketeering'' to shotgun assets into a network of
        corporations and cronies both before and after Butcher's
        affairs were forced into bankruptcy. The suit resulted in
        millions of judgments against them, judgments that
        ultimately forced Butcher's father, C.H. Butcher Sr., to
        give up much of his family farm in Union County. </p>
        <p>Although Butcher swears he turned over not only his
        silver coins but all his major assets long ago, his
        liquidators still have doubts. When Butcher came up for
        parole in 1989, Melnick wrote the parole commission:
        ''When it suits his purpose and goals, he still has no
        difficulty with fabrication.'' </p>
        <p>And when another of trustee Martin's attorneys, James
        R. Moore, took Butcher's deposition in January 1994, the
        questions were pointed: ''No shell corporations sitting
        around?'' ''No million-dollar quarterhorses out there?''
        ''No contacts with the Cayman Islands?'' </p>
        <p>Butcher ended up serving seven years in prison after
        pleading guilty to bankruptcy fraud, bank fraud and other
        crimes. He bluntly acknowledges his guilt today. </p>
        <p>Why did he fight the bankruptcy trustee so hard?
        Butcher, in a recent interview, said he was caught in a
        squeeze. On one side, federal prosecutors were trying to
        convict him of crimes. On the other side stood the
        liquidators, whose probing questions could only lead to
        trouble. </p>
        <p>''I elected not to cooperate on either side,'' said
        Butcher. </p>
        <p>One asset no one will ever take from Butcher,
        apparently, is his resiliency. He's found ways to get his
        daddy's farm back, and the Red Gate farm, too. </p>
        <p>And though he still owes tens of millions of dollars,
        Butcher, as a ''consultant'' to companies created in his
        new wife's name, is again working million-dollar deals in
        Tennessee and Georgia. </p>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->        <font size="5">J</font>ake Butcher is back in business.
        But not with brother C.H. Butcher Jr., he says. </p>
        <p>''We're brothers and we love each other,'' Jake
        Butcher said in a recent telephone interview. ''We have
        no business relationship whatsoever.'' </p>
        <p><img src="butcher/jake_1217.gif" alt="Jake Butcher"
        align="right" hspace="6" vspace="6" width="150"
        height="225">Jake, 60, works for Capital Toyota and Lexus
        of Chattanooga. He declined to say exactly what he does
        for the dealerships. </p>
        <p>Butcher also is doing some traveling -- to Nashville
        and Atlanta in particular. </p>
        <p>''I consult for a couple of companies on marketing and
        business plans and sales, and some financial consulting. </p>
        <p>''But principally, I hang out here in Chattanooga.'' </p>
        <p>Jake Butcher in many ways overshadowed his younger and
        rougher-cut sibling, C.H., and in the public psyche he
        probably still does. Jake unsuccessfully ran twice as a
        Democrat for governor in the 1970s, entertained President
        Jimmy Carter at his Whirlwind mansion in Clinton, and
        converted a scruffy railroad gulch into a landmark event
        in Knoxville history, the 1982 World's Fair. </p>
        <p>Jake Butcher, handsome and smooth-spoken, was among
        Knoxville's best and brightest. </p>
        <p>And then came the government bust of his United
        American Bank. And prison -- Jake served nearly seven
        years after pleading guilty in 1985 to bank fraud.
        Bankruptcy wiped him out, and today he still owes many
        millions of dollars to creditors. </p>
        <p>He's spending much time with his ex-wife, Sonya, who
        once pursued an Hollywood acting career. She now lives at
        her mother's home in an upscale central Nashville
        subdivision called Whitworth, where homes can cost half a
        million dollars. Jake Butcher sometimes lists this home
        as his address, too. </p>
        <p>Like C.H., Jake comes often to Union County to visit
        his father, 93-year-old Cecil Hilgie Butcher Sr., who
        only this summer closed his Maynardville general store
        because of a broken hip. Dad is no longer able to do
        monthly lunches with the boys at Regas in Knoxville, Jake
        says. </p>
        <p>If Jake Butcher once relished the spotlight, he says
        he's content now to go about his affairs quietly. He
        still professes an interest in politics, saying, ''I know
        most all the players personally.'' But that's only
        because ''you can't get what you're interested in out of
        your system.'' </p>
        <p>He's proud of logging 2,000-plus hours of community
        service -- working with rangers in the Smokies and Big
        South Fork National River and Recreation Area, with
        Special Olympics, and with the Bethel Bible Village
        children's home in Chattanooga. </p>
        <p>He says he's blessed with great health. </p>
        <p>''I really feel like God has forgiven me, and I really
        hope and trust that the people I've offended have
        forgiven me, too.'' </p>

        stud horse. </p>
        <p>That fact, oddly enough, became the topic of heated
        debate in the long and intricate bankruptcy case of
        ex-Knoxville banker C.H. Butcher Jr. </p>
        <p>One major objective of Butcher's bankruptcy trustee
        was to liquidate whatever stake Butcher had in registered
        quarterhorses kept on the family's Red Gate farms in
        Maynardville and Texas. </p>
        <p>Butcher had agreed to pay $810,000 for one such horse,
        Sonny Dee Bar. </p>
        <p>But the horse was never fully paid for, and a court
        fight erupted over whether the horse was owned by Jim
        Martin, as trustee of Butcher's estate, or by Sonny's
        former owner, Dean Landers of Iowa. </p>
        <p>Landers, after an examination of the horse in Texas,
        brought alarming news to the judge: Sonny Dee Bar, still
        in the care of Butcher's horseman son, Butch, possibly
        was at risk of serious disease by contributing his seed
        directly to live mares and not -- according to accepted
        practice in the industry -- a ''dummy'' mare. </p>
        <p>After one court hearing in October 1983, according to
        lawyers for Martin, an enraged Landers suggested he'd
        sooner turn over certain key parts of the stud horse's
        anatomy in a box than give up his hold on the horse. </p>
        <p>As it turned out, Landers got to keep his horse. And
        Sonny Dee Bar kept his, well, you know. </p>

        <font size="5">C</font>.H. Butcher Jr. sprang from rural
        Union County to build a $3 billion banking empire with
        his brother, Jake, only to let banking misdeeds bring it
        all down in the early 1980s. </p>
        <p>Butcher, along with ex-wife Shirley, lost everything,
        including his liberty for the seven years that he
        languished in federal prison. </p>
        <p>He still can't own any significant property because of
        debts he still owes his creditors. </p>
        <p>But his second wife, Sheryl Moreland, can own
        property. And so, with a new wife, new rules and the same
        old ambition and downhome charm, C.H. Butcher Jr., 58, is
        cobbling a comeback in the business world. Here are
        excerpts from an August interview. </p>
        <p><b>News-Sentinel:</b> You're planning a mobile home
        park, a strip shopping center and subdivisions in Union
        County. You've had experience before in this kind of
        stuff, right? </p>
        <p><b>Butcher:</b> That's how I got started before I ever
        got into the banking business -- developing real estate. </p>
        <p><b>News-Sentinel: </b>Your wife, Sheryl Moreland, has
        purchased a lot of Butcher family land in Union County. </p>
        <p><b>Butcher:</b> Yeah, she's a professional on her own
        rights, and fortunately I've been able to tag on her
        credit and she's got excellent credit. And, you know,
        there's two things you've got to have if you're going to
        borrow money. You gotta have collateral and credit. I had
        the collateral, or the family did, but didn't have no
        credit! So we matched the collateral and the credit up
        (laughs). </p>
        <p><b>News-Sentinel:</b> Your bankruptcy case is about to
        close. Obviously, there's still going to be a whopper of
        a figure there that you owe. Is that a burdensome
        thought? </p>
        <p><b>Butcher:</b> Well, really, the bankruptcy closing
        doesn't affect me one way or another. . . . It's really
        just sort of like losing a leg or an arm; you just gotta
        go on without it. That's the way I look at it. And, you
        know, I can't -- I'll never own anything. I'll always
        have judgments against me. Since I know that, I just
        accept that as a fact. </p>
        <p><b>News-Sentinel:</b> But couldn't you conceivably pay
        off your debts if you're successful at what you and your
        wife are doing? </p>
        <p><b>Butcher:</b> There's no way that I could ever be
        successful. It's like the chicken and the egg. How you
        gonna ever get the money to pay 'em off if they won't
        allow you to get it? </p>
        <p><b>News-Sentinel:</b> Yeah, but you can get it
        vicariously, say, through a company that Sheryl Moreland
        runs or your son. </p>
        <p><b>Butcher:</b> Well, that's possible; that's a
        possibility. But, you know, I could never make that kind
        of money again. </p>
        <p><b>News-Sentinel: </b>Do you still have to file a
        monthly report with your parole officer? </p>
        <p><b>Butcher:</b> Yeah, sure do. And I pay $150 a month
        on my fine. </p>
        <p><b>News-Sentinel:</b> How much was that fine? </p>
        <p><b>Butcher:</b> Three or $400,000 -- some astronomical
        number. But based on my income, that's what I gotta pay
        on it. </p>
        <p><b>News-Sentinel:</b> You still work as a financial
        anaylst for Ed Garland's firm, your lawyer in Atlanta? </p>
        <p><b>Butcher:</b> Yeah. Garland pays me $500 a week,
        $2,000 a month. </p>
        <p><b>News-Sentinel:</b> How do you feel about your
        bankruptcy trustee, Jim Martin, and the lawyers he used
        to try to find and liquidate all your property? </p>
        <p><b>Butcher:</b> They just had a job to do. I don't
        have any hard feelings about them. </p>
        <p><b>News-Sentinel:</b> They've made a good deal of
        money on your case, haven't they? </p>
        <p><b>Butcher:</b> Anybody will take a $3 or $4 million
        fee if you give it to 'em. But that's standard procedure,
        the system. No, I have no hard feelings whatsoever. I've
        shot straight with them and, uh, they did a few things to
        placate the U.S. attorney back in the old days. But hell,
        that's been 10 years ago. </p>
        <p><b>News-Sentinel:</b> Of course they would probably
        argue that at least for a while, there was a lot of
        cat-and-mouse going on. </p>
        <p><b>Butcher:</b> Well, there was. That's what I pleaded
        guilty to is bankruptcy fraud. So they ain't no bones
        about that. I pled out; I pled guilty to all the charges
        so, you know, they ain't no reason for me to sit here and
        tell you I wasn't guilty when I pled guilty in open court
        and served seven year. </p>
        <p><b>News-Sentinel:</b> What about the notion that there
        is still some missing gold out there somewhere? </p>
        <p><b>Butcher:</b> That's bull. They know better than
        that. They know where every dollar went. I've told 'em
        where every dollar went. </p>

<BR CLEAR=ALL><HR NOSPACE Size=1><H2>DEATH OF A FRIEND SPURS MEMORIES AND APPRECIATION</H2>

<I>By Ina Hughs, Columnist</i><P>

Old soldiers aren't the only ones who never die. Neither do poets. Knoxville resident Marion Cannon was a soldier-poet of high rank. Her passing last week is a loss to those whose life she touched.<P>

   But ``pass away'' -- a phrase we use to put a touch of poetry in the stark realities of death -- doesn't fit her either. Marion Cannon never minced words, and she certainly did more than pass through this life.<P>

   I knew Marion through her only child, Carol who was a childhood friend. Carol married Knoxvillian Jeff Chapman, an archaeologist who is now director of the Frank H. McClung Museum. When I moved to Knoxville seven years ago, Marion was the only person here I knew very well. She'd moved here six years earlier when Carol was in the final stages of a valiant battle against cancer. When Carol died, Marion stayed in Knoxville to be near her two granddaughters.<P>

   In past years Marion's health deteriorated to the point that death came not as the Grim Reaper but a blessed release. Her spirit lives on not only in her poetry, but in the countless people and causes to which she gave energy. Of her writing, reviewers laud its ``lyrical courage,'' humor, strength of character. Her straightforward approach to both language and life bristles with spunk, and she was afraid of nothing. Not even death.<P>

   Her last book, published by Red Clay Books in 1980, is a multilayered autobiography in poetry. She writes of her childhood, not with fluff and sentiment, but with a sharp eye on how it replays in old age.<P>

   I have two of those poems memorized, one of which goes in part like this:<P>

   I never visit graves .<P>

       It never made much sense to stand and weep<P>

       Beside the stones or lay a wreath<P>

       On grass.<P>

       But yesterday I went. Somehow it seemed important<P>

       To seek the place where I will lie.<P>

       So standing there, in sunlight and in warmth,<P>

       I wept.<P>

       I wept because there's no one living now<P>

       Who can remember<P>

       The child I was.<P>

       That poem was written long years before her daughter's death, before the final two decades of her own life and before she arranged to donate her body to James H. Quillen College of Medicine at East Tennessee State University.<P>

       Marion was something of a rule-breaker, especially ones that need breaking. A staunch civil rights advocate and champion of education, she lived the sermons we so often convince ourselves merely to preach or applaud. During the 60s she led sit-ins and boycotts, and over her lifetime sent countless young people to college who could not otherwise afford to go. She was a generous steward of financial resources, which came in part from the Cannon textile family of North Carolina.<P>

     One afternoon while sitting in her garden at Witch Hill (the name she gave her home in Charlotte), she and I talked about death. I say ``she and I,'' but it was mostly Marion who did the talking. She told me she didn't want any long faces or sad songs. She wanted everybody in party hats. She wanted there to be dancing.<P>

   When her longtime friend, Knoxville developer and renovator Kristopher Kendrick, called to tell me of Marion's death, he said she had told him much the same thing.<P>

   The other of her poems I know by heart is itself a story from her life. She remembers seeing Halley's Comet when she was 5. She was wearing a long white nightgown and watched it from the top of a water tower. She'd just learned to count, and worked hard to figure how old she would be when it came her way again.<P>

   She ``laughed in disbelief:''<P>

   Now I am waiting with impatience<P>

   To see it once again,<P>

   To celebrate that orbit<P>

   That signifies the meaning of eternity.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>HORROR MOVIES ARE FUN TO WATCH, OR ARE THEY SICK?</TITLE>

<TD><H2>HORROR MOVIES ARE FUN TO WATCH, OR ARE THEY SICK?</H2>

<I>By Ina Hughs, Columnist</i><P>

The other night my daughter and I got on my bed and for two hours terrorized ourselves silly watching a scary video.<P>

   The movie was ``Copycat'' -- Holly Hunter and Sigourney Weaver stalking a serial killer.<P>

   I spent at least half of the movie hiding my eyes under the covers.<P>

   Thank goodness it was one of those loosely stitched summer blankets with enough holes in it to let me keep up with the story without actually having to watch the razor go into the flesh.<P>

   Now mind you, my daughter is 28 and I am, well, I am old enough to know that the killers in our closets are mostly of our own making and feed off the imagination.<P>

   But not always.<P>

   The morning after our Let's Pretend horror-fest I read about the two Real Life women whose throats were slit this week as they camped along the Appalachian Trail.<P>

   I've been camping a lot in recent years, a time or two on the AT and once last year in Virginia not too far from where the women were found.<P>

   Part of the ``fun'' of camping is telling stories around the fire. Ask any camper. When the sun goes down and the woods grow dark and deep, going to bed after some of those stories can be downright hilarious. Especially when some clown sneaks around the side of the tent and play likes he or she is the guy with the hook arm who snuck up on those kids parked on lover's lane.<P>

   Or hides in the bath house until you get into the shower, then starts humming the theme music from ``Psycho.''<P>

   Or waits for you to get the sleeping bag zipped up, hips burrowed into the ground just right, and then tells you about the man who had to lie perfectly still all night long, waiting for a copperhead in the bottom of his sleeping bag to crawl out into the morning sun.<P>

   If he'd moved, he would have been dead.<P>

   Or maybe someone sneaks out of the tent and rattles the pots and pans, just to remind you of what happened to those Girl Scout leaders on the Alaskan tundra.<P>

   Being scared can be lots of fun.<P>

   Which makes me wonder:<P>

   What is it about human nature that turns horror into humor, and at what point do tragedy and catastrophe become playthings?<P>

   Years ago our son got for a birthday present from one of his friends a game called ``The Titanic.'' The big cardboard ship sank with each throw of the dice while you fought to get your game piece into a lifeboat. There'd be squeals of delight and high-fives when a lucky throw sent an opponent down into the bowels of the ship. And the band played on.<P>

   Who of us hasn't watched a kid take a Fisher Price airplane and, with great glee, dive bomb it into the sand box, complete with sound effects.<P>

   Yet imagining ourselves or someone we love on the ValueJet that, as a matter of fact, did just that is the stuff of our worst nightmares.<P>

   When exactly does true-life compassion and dead-serious outrage make that leap into entertainment horror?<P>

   If they can make a toy out of the Titanic, how many years before we market a board game with a Lego model of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, complete with plastic-piece bombs and chances to draw?<P>

   Can we turn church-burnings and drive-by shootings into video games?<P>

   Toy stores have aisles and aisles of WWII paraphernalia. Playing ``cowboys and Indians'' is about as much all-American, family-value fun as you can get. Is it just a matter of time before we make merry over Bosnia or turn the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin into a card game?<P>

   I don't know what it was about the mother-daughter camaraderie the other night, two grown women giggling and shivering at the expense of women whose throats were about to be slit on the screen, but I have to confess. It was fun.<P>

   Reading the story in the newspaper the next morning was just the opposite.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>CHILDREN'S SUNDAY GAVE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER NEEDS</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="/images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top><!--IMAGE--><I>June 10, 1996</I>
<TD><H2>CHILDREN'S SUNDAY GAVE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER NEEDS</H2>

<I>By Ina Hughs, Columnist</I><P>

In one of the myths from ancient Shinto tradition, children who cannot walk upright by the time they are 3 years old are done away with by sacrificing them to the gods.<P>

   Most of us find such an idea unthinkable.<P>

   Today there are less blatant, more acceptable ways of ``doing away with'' than drowning or burning. In our world, children often become the sacrificial lambs of political policies, ethnic loyalties or societal complacency.<P>

   ``Children are our most important resource'' plays well in campaign speeches. ``Bless the beasts and children'' makes a nice cross-stitched pillow for the playroom, but read reports from just about every child-watch group, and it's easy to see you and I aren't as spiritually immune to that ancient myth as we might like to think.<P>

   Yesterday in churches and synagogues across the country, congregations observed Children's Sunday, traditionally the second Sunday in June. Through liturgy, prayer and music, people of faith celebrated childhood and blessed the little ones in our midst.<P>

   But what about the Monday-morning life of children, when economic realities and ideological differences play alongside, even compete with, those scripture passages and Sunday sermons?<P>

   Especially children who are not in our midst.<P>

   Especially children who live and move, but have no being.<P>

   There's great paradox in the fact that the abortion issue has become the litmus test of a candidate's family-value quotient. The real test of how much we care about children is not how energetic we are in speaking out for those who might be born, but how much we are willing to risk for those already born; how thoroughly we quiz lawmakers about them, and to what degree we assume responsibility for their future.<P>

   Ethan Taubes, program director for the International League for Human Rights (ILHR), suggests no political instrument currently exists that intervenes on behalf of children in serious situations at the world level. Despite the good offices of the secretary general, Taubes goes on to say, of UNICEF and other like agencies, cross-border problems continue:<P>

   ``These include child soldiers, child refugees, bonded-child labor, female genital mutilation, sale of children, and child prostitution. These problems are endemic and systemic.''<P>

   These are also not issues mentioned, as a rule, during a call to worship in suburbia, even on Children's Sunday. ILHR has proposed setting up a special agency that works as an advocate for children worldwide, a ``roving legal guardian'' to monitor and intervene on their behalf.<P>

   The argument that we already have such agencies, governmental and private, comes to mind immediately, but they aren't enough. Children need a global ``shepherd,'' unaffiliated with local and national governments. To be effective, argue those suggesting the idea, this ombudsman system would have to operate independent of the United Nations because UN-based affiliates cannot function autonomously and faithfully due to red tape and political ramifications.<P>

   Whether we like it or not, says Cynthia Price Cohen, executive director of ChildRightscq'd International Research Institute, we're living in a world community, and we have to create legal and global structures to protect our children.<P>

   Is there any other structure that can deal with the endemic and systemic sources of violence to children? The church, of course, comes to mind, but religious battles are 10 times hotter than political ones and take even more prisoners.<P>

   In Children's Sunday services of the past, I mostly fill my heart with prayers of intercession for the children whose pictures are on my dresser.<P>

   But this year, one of the old familiar lines stuck in my throat -- the simplest, most familiar, of all our Sunday School songs:<P>

   Jesus loves the children of the world.<P>

   Red. Yellow. Black. White.<P>

   They are precious in his sight ... <P>

   I'm not sure you and I can say the same thing.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>JUNE WEDDING MEMORIES FROM A TOT'S PERSPECTIVE</TITLE>

<TD width=470><H2>JUNE WEDDING MEMORIES FROM A TOT'S PERSPECTIVE</H2>

<I>By Ina Hughs, Columnist</I><P>

June, as they say, is the month married girls like to be well-groomed. Check the church calendar or party rental store and there's the proof:<P>

   June is ``wedding month.''<P>

   I don't know how old I was when I went to my first wedding, but living next door to the church where my father was the minister, I went to as many as I could.<P>

   Not that I was invited, mind you.<P>

   Most Saturday afternoons in June, my best friend Sally and I spent standing in the bushes to watch the wedding party line up, the bride hang on to her father's arm for dear life. During the service, we'd sneak into the fellowship hall and scarf down a few petit fours and sample the punch, then race back to the minister's study and hide under the desk.<P>

   That's where newlyweds came after the service, holding on to each other for a few moments of marital bliss before going to the receiving line.<P>

   I reckon we saw dozens and dozens of them over the years kiss there in my father's study, thinking they were all alone. We never got caught, but time came when we were too big to fit under the desk, so we had to limit our spying to when my older sister and her boyfriend said goodnight on the porch steps.<P>

   My aunt was a church organist and I can remember begging to go with her when she played for a wedding. I'd sit on the choir loft steps behind the organ, eye-level with her feet, and watch her dance on the foot pedals to the tune of ``Here Comes the Bride'' -- marveling at what she could do with her heels and toes. All I could do with mine after the church cleared and she let me play while she gathered up her music was (after much practice) to stomp out the first seven notes of The Lone Ranger song.<P>

   DUM da-da DUM da-da DUM ... never could get past that one note.<P>

   Speaking of the Lone Ranger and those ``thrilling days of yesteryear'' -- a reader sent me an excerpt from a 1950s high school home economics textbook, quoting from the chapter titled ``How To Be a Good Wife.''<P>

   1950 would have been about the time Sally and I got out of the Peeping Tom business and took up organ pedals. I don't remember lessons on how to be a good wife from my Home Ec classes. All I remember was sewing -- something I hated and, like organ-pedaling, never got the hang of.<P>

   My daughters were the only girls in the troop whose Girl Scout badges were stapled on. My mending was done from a tool kit. Elmer's glue for hems and electric tape for socks.<P>

   Works like a charm.<P>

   But definitely not something you'd find in a Home Ec book on ``How To Be a Good Wife.'' Here's what they taught back in 1950 as being the way a good wife prepares to greet her husband when he comes home from work:<P>

   `` ... Take 15 minutes rest so you'll be refreshed when he arrives. Touch up your makeup, put a ribbon in your hair and be fresh looking. He has just been with a lot of work-weary people. Be a little gay and a little more interesting. His boring day may need a lift.<P>

   ``Make one last trip through the main part of the house just before your husband arrives, gathering up school books, toys, paper, etc. Then run a dust cloth over the tables. He will feel he has reached a haven of rest and order.<P>

   ``Minimize all noise. At the time of his arrival, eliminate all noise of the washer, dryer, dishwasher or vacuum. Try to encourage the children to be quiet. Be happy to see him. Greet him with a warm smile. Be glad to see him.<P>

   ``Some don'ts. Don't greet him with problems or complaints. Don't complain if he is late for dinner. Have him lean back in a comfortable chair or suggest he lie down in the bedroom. Have a cool or warm drink ready for him. Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes. Speak in a low, soft, soothing, pleasant voice. ... ''<P>

   Come to think of it, I'd like to have me one of those goodly wives myself.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>BAPTISTS' BOYCOTT OF MICKEY MOUSE IS A CHEESY MOVE</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="/images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>June 17, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>BAPTISTS' BOYCOTT OF MICKEY MOUSE IS A CHEESY MOVE</H2>

<I>By Ina Hughs, Columnist</I><P>

Southern Baptists, it seems, are having a lover's quarrel with Mickey Mouse.<P>

   In a show-of-hands vote at the denomination's annual meeting in New Orleans, delegates overwhelmingly agreed to boycott Walt Disney Co. because of its sympathy to gay and lesbian issues in general and the recognition of same-sex domestic partnerships in particular. <P>

   ``I think there is serious question -- that Disney no longer can be trusted with the minds and souls of our children,'' David Caton, president of the American Family Association of Florida, told reporters in defending the Southern Baptist Convention vote. Jimmy Draper, president of the Baptist Sunday School Board in Nashville, said he is going to ask his six grandchildren to stop playing with all their Disney toys. These accusations and the idea of boycotting Disney strike me not only as goofy, but as poor stewardship of time and talent. <P>

   Baptist and other Christians who go along with the pronouncement have to stop watching tennis on ESPN and ``Nightline'' on ABC. Soap addicts must go cold turkey with ``General Hospital'' and ``As The World Turns,'' and some committee will doubtless have to meet and decide if ``Good Morning America'' counts and what to do about people whose boycott includes the daily newspaper -- the Disney-owned Fort Worth Star-Telegram, for instance.<P>

   Think of all the Habitat Houses and Good Samaritan shelters these good folks could be building in the time it consumes just to figure out what to boycott. More than a tithe of their time will be donated in simply investigating day-to-day interactions with Disney-owned companies, many of which don't carry the name.<P>

   If the delegates want to be consistent, since the bone they pick is for allowing non-traditional couples financial benefits, they'll have to boycott -- among others -- Time Warner Inc., Universal Pictures, Colgate toothpaste, Kodak film and Apple Computers. These and hundreds of other large companies recognize domestic partnerships. Not to mention a whole slew of universities, medical complexes and city governments.<P>

   Several years ago, we Christians used the same rhetoric to ``satanize'' mixed-race partnerships. We quoted verses from Scripture ``supporting'' our bias. Remember way back when Jerry Falwell preached how and why racially mixed marriages were ``an abomination?'' Last month he invited Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and his wife, who is white, to speak from his pulpit. ``I changed my mind,'' Falwell told public interviewers when reminded of his past actions. ``I saw the light.''<P>

   The Pharisees worked hard to trick Jesus with their Rule-Bookings, quizzing him on what happens when twice-married men get to heaven and meet both wives at the Pearly Gates. They never ``got it'' that healing on the Sabbath was a better idea than their hard-line rules allowed. They got spiritually stuck in the status-quo, and Jesus told them they were missing the point.<P>

   The biblical ``rules'' and ``understanding'' of marriage, if we insist on being technical and legalistic, include women being sold as property, men having numerous wives and concubines, men marrying their sisters and sisters-in-law and bedding down slaves to keep the family name going. Biblical stlyes of family values included disobedient children being put to death and wives submitting to violent, abusive husbands. At one point, Paul even suggested serious Christian men shouldn't marry at all. Only if they couldn't control their sex drive should they ``take'' a wife.<P>

    We can't read the Bible with a kind of Elmer Fudd mentality or worship it at the expense of its message. The Bible is the word of God moving through a particular history, bringing Good News that overides cultural mindsets and traditions, a message that gives the human race credit for being able to evolve spiritually and, over time, to understand better what it means to be created in the image of a God who is not Rules, but Love.<P>

  The church mice vs. Mickey and Co. is a Scrooge of an idea.<P>

<TD WIDTH=470><H2>GARFIELD TURNS 18; GET HIM LASAGNA WITH 18 CANDLES</H2>

<I>By Ina Hughs, Columnist</I><P>

As Tweety Bird used to say in those old Saturday morning kiddie shows, ``Once a bad ol' puddy tat, always a bad ol' puddy tat.''<P>

   There's not a badder puddy tat around these days than Jim Davis' Garfield, and though he's still just a kid, the little monster comes of age today. On June 19, 1978, the now-famous Garfield first appeared in cartoon form.<P>

   He's 18 years old today. He could vote.<P>

   (The only other news from the animal kingdom that year was the Supreme Court's ruling that the snail darter was protected under the Endangered Species Act and halted the Tellico Dam.)<P>

   Cats have become a fetish with us. There are shelf-loads of books about cats and how they view the world. The other day I came across what must be the most bizarre of them all: a book of devotions for cats. Not for cat-lovers, but for cats. Complete with a text-for-the-day from The Cat Bible and a concluding prayer for folded paws. Kind of like ``The Upper Room'' for your Persian.<P>

   Can you imagine Garfield asking for forgiveness?<P>

   Garfield is certainly no saint, but he's definitely the patron sir of contemporary catdom.<P>

   He's also helped the lasagna industry.<P>

   My family is more of a dog kind of family, but we've learned to keep our opinions to ourselves because, for some people, it's a sin not to love a cat above all other beings, including small children.<P>

   Although I think Garfield probably more than any other cat in history is living, purring proof of a cat's sense of superiority, my pick of the cartoon cat litter is Calvin's friend and confidant, Hobbes. Unfortunately he's gone to the big Cat House in the sky.<P>

   Then there was Felix, the bug-eyed black cat that came to our house in the form of a clock in my daughter Claire's room when she was about 5. Its eyeballs moved and the tail wagged with every tick. At night, the thing lit up like cat's eyes do in the right light, and it spooked Claire so bad we got rid of Felix the Clock at our next neighborhood garage sale. The guy who bought it was a dentist, and last I heard, ol' Felix with his tick-tock eyes was hypnotizing patients during root canals and extractions.<P>

   Since Garfield -- and all cats, for that matter -- was not raised in the if-you-can't-say-something-nice school of thought, I guess it's OK for me to say I'm not a real Garfield fan. If that makes me completely un-American, at least I'm in good company. There is at least one other person loose in the world who shares my opinion: Charlie Daniel, my favorite cartoon character of them all. He calls Garfield the Dennis Rodman of cats.<P>

   Mark Twain, on the other hand, would have loved Garfield. Twain was famous for his admiration and affection for cats and always had several around the house. He even used them in his writings, and even if you don't care for cats, you gotta love the names Twain gave to his: Blatherskite, Sour Mash, Stray Kit, Sin, Satan.<P>

   Twain's daughter Susy once told friends, ``The difference between Papa and Mama is that Mama loves morals and Papa loves cats.''<P>

<i>By Ina Hughs, Columnist</I><P>

The following comes to you as a public service announcement from radio station KJIL in Meade, Kan.:<P>

   Announcer: I'm here with Jimmy Mascorow of the Acme Front Row Pew pew company. Mr. Mascorow, why do you make front row pews?<P>

   Jimmy: Our motto says it all: WHY PAY FULL PRICE FOR A PLACE THAT ONLY SERVES A FEW? NO ONE SITS THERE SO BUY AN ACME FRONT ROW PEW PEW.<P>

   Announcer: Would you explain the qualities of the Acme Front Row Pew pew, please.<P>

   Jimmy: Cheap! Plain and simple. Nothing quality about 'em. They're just for looks, made from hallowcq'd wood-looking plastic stuff, no hymnal holder, no visitor card holder, no cushions, 'cause no one sits in the front pew.<P>

   Announcer: How do you think International Sit-On-The-Front-Pew Sunday June 23rd will affect your business?<P>

   Jimmy: Business aside, this kind of holiday is un-American! ... all the more reason Americans need to stand up ... er ... sit down against this movement and take a st ... st ... st ... SIT for tradition!<P>

   Announcer: What would you say to someone who DOES sit in the front pew at church tomorrow?<P>

   Jimmy: Let's just hope it's not an Acme Front Row Pew pew.!<P>

   Four years ago when the Great Plains Christian Radio execs were starting up station KJIL, their general manager came up with a light-hearted gimmick of declaring the fourth Sunday in June as International Sit-On-The-Front-Pew Sunday.<P>

   Doug Wedekind, production manager at KJIL, told me on the phone about how they decided there was a day for just about everything else, why not a sit-on-the-front-pew Sunday? No one, no matter what church denomination or what part of the country sits on the front row.<P>

   He's right of course. We stand in line for hours and pay out the wazoo for front row seats at concerts and ball games, but no one wants to sit on the front row at church. Don't ask me why.<P>

   Wedekind says its because no one else is sitting there, and no one wants to be all alone on the front row, right there in front of God and everybody.<P>

   Pastors in the KJIL listening audience whose churches have celebrated ``front row'' Sunday all agree how nice it is to have people up close and personal, encouraging the preacher and getting more involved in the service themselves, rather than just taking a back seat and being more of a spectator.<P>

   Over the years more and more churches have taken part in International Sit-On-The-Front-Pew Sunday. Its catchy, light-hearted message has been sent via public service announcements from KJIL across the country. Denominations have put it in their newsletters, and James Dobson mentions it on his popular Focus on the Family Show, a syndicated favorite on Christian radio.<P>

   Wedekind, who attends a small independent country church, says last year his pastor really got into the spirit of things. The theme the International Sit-On-The-Front-Pew Sunday announcement had played off on was the idea that you'll never find any gum stuck under the seat.<P>

   Sunday morning his pastor joked from the pulpit how you can't even trust the Christian media these days: ``KJIL says there's no gum stuck under the front row pews, and I ask all you on the front row this morning to reach down and check for yourselves' ... ''<P>

   And so they did, and came up with a wad of gum the pastor himself put there the night before.<P>

   Wedekind says people sitting up front means everybody moves up in the world. Pretty soon, it's the last row that looms empty.<P>

   So try it tomorrow.<P>

   Take a front seat in church.<P>

   If nothing else, it'll surprise the heck out of your pastor!<P>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>July 3, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>FOOD FOR THOUGHT GIVES 
BELLYACHE AND THE GIGGLES </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, Columnist</em></p>
<p>Here's a bit of food for thought, some nourishing, some not -- though I've 
tried to mention something from each of the food groups:</p>
<p>An article in The Tuscaloosa (Ala.) News reports how Alabama state Sen. 
Charles Davidson -- a Jasper Republican running for Congress -- is telling 
people the Bible justifies slavery, the slavery as practiced by the Old South 
was not only beneficial to blacks but based on good, solid theology and 
blessed by both Old and New Testaments.</p>
<p>``Proving'' his text, Davidson quotes from the Book of Leviticus: ``You may 
acquire male and female slaves from the pagan nations that are around you.'' 
His New Testament ``lesson'' in slavery comes from First Timothy, where 
the writer says slaves should ``regard their own masters as worthy of all 
honor.''</p>
<p>I can't decide whether to count that little rancid morsel as rotten eggs or sour 
milk, but I do know Leviticus also says it's a sin to mix meat and dairy 
products, so I guess I'll just say Davidson sounds a few sandwiches short of 
a picnic.</p>
<p>Sixty-two years ago when Congress defined the structure of the 
communications industry, it had no visions of cable and satellite TV, no 
e-mail or computer shopping, no pocketbook phones. For folks who ``bring 
home the bacon,'' a little arithmetic on how thing$ were in 1934 a$ 
compared to 1996 i$ enough to give you heartburn.</p>
<p>In 1934, for instance, a console radio cost about $50. Programming was 
free. Today a good color television runs about $200 at least, with the cable 
company hitting you up for $14.50 a month, and that's bottom-line basics.</p>
<p>These and other mark-ups help explain why it's getting harder and harder to 
afford food for thought, or anything else for that matter. According to figures 
compiled by researchers at USA Today, the price of a movie ticket 62 years 
ago was 15 cents. Today it's $7.50, not counting bargain matinees and 
``dollar'' theaters. A typewriter was $19.75 and the salary of a U.S. 
Congress member was $8,663. Today nobody much uses typewriters 
anymore, and you couldn't touch a decent word processor, printer and 
e-mail capabilities for less than $1,000.</p>
<p>Congress members are paid $133,600.</p>
<p>But there is a bright side. In 1934 a five-minute phone call from Los Angeles 
to New York was $14.60. Today it's $1.40, not counting the time you 
spend trying to figure out which long-distance company to use.</p>
<p>The other day I was browsing through McKay's Used Books and came 
across a 1979 collection of Ashleigh Brilliant's book, ``I May Not Be 
Perfect But Parts of Me Are Excellent.'' You've doubtless seen his postcard 
one-liners on T-shirts and bumper stickers, and I bet his name is indexed in 
every quotation anthology published in the past 25 years. His mind sits 
somewhere between Far Side and Snuffy Smith:</p>
<p>Whatever became of eternal truth?</p>
<p>Please forgive me if in the heat of battle i sometimes forget which side i am 
on.</p>
<p>In this particular collection, Dr. Brilliant introduces himself for those of us 
who are curious to know what kind of person thinks in such spicy little 
morsels. Yes, Ashleigh Brilliant is his real name, and he has a doctorate in 
philosophy from Berkeley. He's the first to admit to being ``a little weird'' 
and even brags that he lost his 1977 bid for the Santa Barbara City Council 
after conducting his entire campaign in song.</p>
<p>The British (he's English) headmaster who once had him caned at school for 
disrupting the classroom later applied to be his business agent, and he once 
got arrested in South Africa for driving a car with a sign affixed to it that read 
ATTENTION CAR THIEVES -- THIS CAR IS ALREADY STOLEN.</p>
<p>My favorite Brilliant quote:</p>
<p>I try to take one day at a time but sometimes several days attack me at 
once. This is such good food for thought, I'm gonna stick it on my fridge.</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>July 6, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>ONE OF THE JONES GIRLS GETS IN 
HER LICKS ON NAMES </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, Columnist</em></p>
<p>Until 1964 when I married a Hughes-without-the-e, I was a Jones. One of 
the Jones girls, as they say. although I have no idea where that expression 
came from.</p>
<p>My father-in-law used to joke that his family grew up in Southwest Georgia 
and was so poor they couldn't afford an e.</p>
<p>One thing about an unusual name or an unusual spelling is that when you 
come across another just like it, you know you must be kin. Not so with 
Jones.</p>
<p>We are a dime a dozen, and with so many of us around, you'd think there'd 
be a goodly number who distinguished themselves in history. But there 
aren't.</p>
<p>The Random House Biographical Dictionary lists only 16 Joneses in all its 
6,000 entries. The only ones I'd ever heard of are Spike, Casey, James and 
Bobby.</p>
<p>And of course, John Paul.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I had a dachshund named Spike, a parakeet named Casey 
and a brother, uncle, grandfather, nephew and assorted cousins named 
Bobby. My father's name was James, and he had a couple of books 
published, but none titled ``From Here to Eternity.'' In fact, when that James 
Jones' movie came out, my parents wouldn't let me see it because of the way 
Burt Lancaster kissed Deborah Kerr on the beach.</p>
<p>Today that scene wouldn't make a single eyebrow dance, not even my 
mother's.</p>
<p>Of all of the Jones crowd, none of them distinguished himself more than John 
Paul, and this being a patriotic weekend -- as well as the famous naval 
officer's 217th birth anniversary -- I'd like to brag a bit about this famous 
maybe-relative. You remember the story.</p>
<p>On Sept. 23, 1779, sailing off the coast of England in his rather ramshackled 
ship Le Bonhomme Richard, Jones met a convoy of British merchantmen 
under escort of the royal naval ship Serapis commanded by Richard 
Pearson. Outnumbered, out-classed and out-ranked -- his ship battered 
almost to a pulp by 44 hostile guns -- John Paul Jones stubbornly refused to 
give up. Le Bonhomme Richard was listing so badly at one point, Pearson 
invited Jones to surrender. Supposedly that's when Jones made his Trivia 
Pursuit reply:</p>
<p>``I have not yet begun to fight.''</p>
<p>But Jones denied being so clever and quotable. His version of the story is 
that after a few deleted expletives which, roughly translated meant ``No 
way, Jose,'' he just kept on fighting.</p>
<p>Kept on, as every school kid in America knows, until the British frigate all 
but blew apart. Jones took command of the Serapis and sailed it back into 
port as prize.</p>
<p>Page Two of the story, as Paul Harvey would call it, is that Pearson became 
a hometown hero despite the fact that he lost the battle. In honor of his 
bravery under fire, he became Sir Richard Pearson.</p>
<p>When John Paul Jones heard Pearson had been knighted after their battle, 
he remarked, ``Should I have the good fortune to fall in with him again, I'll 
make a lord of him.''</p>
<p>There are 10 columns of Joneses in the Knoxville phone book, including one 
John Paul, but it is by far not the most popular surname. Just a page or two 
earlier, the Johnsons outnumber the Joneses by at least a hundred.</p>
<p>Having a common, easy to remember name can make life less complicated. 
Take Pablo Diego Jose Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomucento Maria de 
los Remedios Cipriano de Santissima Trinidad Ruiz Picasso, for example. If 
he'd signed his whole name to his paintings there wouldn't be room on the 
canvas for anything else. Or, as the secretary-general of the Organization of 
American States explained to a reporter in 1979:</p>
<p>``Galo is my Christian name; Plaza is my father's family name; Lasso is my 
mother's family name. Some call me Mr. Plaza, others Mr. Lasso. In fact 
while I was ambassador for Ecuador in the United Nations, I was called 
Ambassador Plaza, and people thought I was a hotel.''</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>July 8, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>`SOUTHERN' SEEMS A NEBULOUS 
QUALITY, DEFYING DESCRIPTION </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, Columnist</em></p>
<p>Last fall at the Southern Festival of Books in Nashville I attended a seminar 
in which a panel of fiction writers tried to define the common ingredient in all 
Southern writing. What is the definitive mark of a work that makes it 
``Southern?''</p>
<p>Not one of the panelists could answer that question to everyone's 
satisfaction, and when the discussion was opened to a roomful of readers 
and writers, it was pure chaos.</p>
<p>If I had to sum up that meeting, I'd say the closest we got to a definition of 
Southern writing was something Pat Conroy once said.</p>
<p>``My mother, Southern to the bone,'' he explained, ``once told me `All 
Southern literature can be summed up in these words: ``On the night the 
hogs ate Willie, Mama died when she heard what Daddy did to Sister.'' ' . . 
.''</p>
<p>Barbara Bibswanger and Jim Charlton took Mrs. Conroy's words as the title 
of their all-things-Southern book of quotes. ``The Night The Hogs Ate 
Willie'' is a kudzu-like treatment of the South, covering everything and 
anything, chronicling memorable comments about life in the south: Its 
eccentricities, its neuroses, its pageants and pom-poms. Its love affair with 
all things civil -- be it war, manners or disobedience.</p>
<p>Quoting everyone from Edgar Allen Poe to Charles Kuralt, you get the 
scoop on how, as Robert Burns put it in his own dialect, ``ithers'' see us.</p>
<p>There's a three-page chapter on Tennessee cities, but no mention of 
Knoxville. Judging from that chapter, either we are not very Southern, or 
we're not worth mentioning. Memphis and Nashville get all the quotes.</p>
<p>An example: ``Memphis, always a haven for eccentrics and individualism, is 
the only locale I know that actually boasts of its craziness.''</p>
<p>Neither is Knoxville mentioned in the 1,022-page Travellers' Dictionary of 
Quotations. In fact, the whole state of Tennessee rates only one mention in 
that compendium, a poem by Ogden Nash from an essay he wrote titled ``Is 
It True What They Say About Dixie, Or Is It Just The Way They Say It.''</p>
<p>The poem goes like this:</p>
<p>Our Country, south and west of Hatteras</p>
<p>Abounds in charming feminine flatteras.</p>
<p>Sweet talk is scant by Lake Cayuga,</p>
<p>But in Tennessee, they chatta nougat.</p>
<p>That's it. We're squeezed in there between Taos and Texas -- both of which 
out-quote us by a country mile.</p>
<p>``On The Night The Hogs Ate Willie'' has a big chapter on Southern 
barbecue, but is Tennessee mentioned in it? No. Not once.</p>
<p>Only in the area of music is Knoxville specifically mentioned in the whole 
book, and it is the following comment attributed to H.J. Kuntry.</p>
<p>``Country music didn't begin in Nashville. It started up above Knoxville. 
Knoxville should have been Music City. Acuff, Scruggs, Flat, Atkins. They 
knew what it was. Insurance money took it to Nashville, but the memory just 
isn't there. The memory is in those hills and eddies above Knoxville.''</p>
<p>I found only one quote in the whole book that mentions Tennessee by name, 
though I lost count of the times Alabama was talked about. Alabama even 
outscored Tennessee 4-zip in the football chapter.</p>
<p>It was Charles Kuralt who calls us by name, and not all too complimentary:</p>
<p>``What you need for breakfast they say in East Tennessee is a jug of good 
corn liquor, a thick beefsteak, and a hound dog. Then you feed the 
beefsteak to the hound dog.''</p>
<p>My favorite quote in the book is from writer-friend Clyde Edgerton. Clyde 
was on the Southern Festival of Books panel that couldn't define Southern 
writing.</p>
<p>``Because I was born in the South, I'm a Southerner,'' he says. ``If I had 
been born in the North, the West, or the Central Plains, I would be a human 
being.''</p>

BRUSH WITH DEATH </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, Columnist</em></p>
<p>Sunday morning while bulls ran the streets of Pamplona, my mother, 
daughter and I were bringing a load of furniture from Somerset, Va., to 
Knoxville in a 6-foot-by-12-foot U-Haul trailer behind a borrowed Chevy 
Blazer.</p>
<p>Weaving in and out of 18-wheelers and loaded-down campers on a holiday 
weekend is a lot like running with the bulls.</p>
<p>You'd have to be slightly nuts, I think, to play chicken with a bunch of bulls, 
but taking on a herd of stampeding trucks and carloads of people trying to 
beat it home in time to unpack for work come Monday morning -- well, 
that's not for sissies either.</p>
<p>There may not be as much romance in negotiating gasoline trucks and 
moving vans, double-wides and crazy loons in little, almost-always-red 
sports cars who zoom in and out of traffic with a heavy foot and a death 
wish -- but it is the same kind of dance with death that Hemingway wrote 
about.</p>
<p>In fact, I'd rather be hit by a mad bull on the streets of Spain than a diesel rig 
making up time on a hill along Interstate 81 in the rain.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are just inches, inches, between you and total annihilation. 
A sneeze or sideways glance, a kid kicking the seat or a hand reaching for 
the radio dial can be the difference between life and death, causing a chain 
reaction that turns a road trip into a funeral march.</p>
<p>And that's what happened along about Lexington, Va., on my 
run-with-the-bulls Sunday afternoon. Traffic came to a dead halt for two 
hours in both directions while helicopters flew in to pick up the critically 
wounded. Ambulances and fire trucks whizzed by while those of us who 
missed being in harm's way by mere minutes, even seconds, turned off our 
engines and waited. Many got out of cars and swapped tales with other 
travelers caught in the delay.</p>
<p>If I'd taken two more minutes to tell my sister goodbye, it might have been 
my car flattened, my family so mangled in metal that it took the Jaws of Life 
to pull us out, dead or alive.</p>
<p>Reaching up to knock on the door of a trucker in his cab two cars ahead of 
me in line, I yelled up to him over the hiss and grumble of his rig.</p>
<p>``What's the word up ahead?''</p>
<p>``Car flipped . . . ,'' he said literally picking his teeth. ``A real mess. We'll be 
here for hours.''</p>
<p>Next to me a tribe of kids spilled out of a van and started cleaning 
windshields up and down the line of traffic. I heard they made $10.</p>
<p>Behind me a church youth group from New Jersey, on their way to build a 
Habitat for Humanity house near Charleston, W. Va., picked bouquets of 
wildflowers, Queen Anne's lace and purple clover, along the median, while I 
helped their chaperones figure mileage and time they'd have to make up. A 
fellow in a pickup took off his shirt, tossed the keys to his girlfriend and took 
off on a jog: ``Pick me up when you see me,'' he said.</p>
<p>Counting that furniture-haul over the weekend of the Fourth and a trip out to 
the West the week before, I figure I traveled some 5,000 miles these past 
two weeks. Some by car, some by plane, some by bus and even a few turns 
in a golf cart.</p>
<p>As we waited out the traffic jam caused by the accident on I-81, my mother 
reminisced about the trip our family used to make to the beach each summer 
in an old Buick station wagon with real wood sides. We took our own food, 
this being the days before Burger King and Zippy Stops, and though that trip 
can be made today in most of a morning, it was an overnight affair for us in 
those days. We'd stop halfway to spend the night with relatives. Before air 
conditioning and Dramamine, before gas stations got interested in cleaning 
up their rest rooms -- a trip like that could render a whole family 
dysfunctional unless it was spread out over time.</p>
<p>These days we eat breakfast in Knoxville, lunch in Denver, supper in 
Albuquerque -- a lifetime voyage not so long ago.</p>
<p>And though it is twice as far to Virginia and back as our family pilgrimage to 
the beach those long ago summers, I still make it in a day despite a two-hour 
delay that took out a family of five.</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>July 13, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>WHAT KIND OF CAR WOULD JESUS 
DRIVE IF HE CAME BACK </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, Columnist </em></p>
<p>You probably won't hear a sermon preached on the subject tomorrow 
morning, but Knoxville environmentalist Bob Grimac is asking folks to think 
about what kind of car Jesus would drive if he returned to Earth today. </p>
<p>Grimac sent out letters this week to religious leaders, environmental 
advocates and auto dealers asking their opinion. Responses so far suggest 
Jesus wouldn't drive a car at all, but I think that is avoiding the question. </p>
<p>It's true Jesus walked most places back in his day, but that was a different 
time and place. And besides, when he needed to get somewhere fast, and 
when he came to the big city, the Bible indicates he resorted to conventional 
horsepower, so to speak. </p>
<p>However I can honestly say I've never pictured Jesus in an automobile. 
There's something about the concept that is laughable in a vague, soft-core, 
sacrilegious way. I used to listen to Jim and Tammy Bakker tell their PTL 
flock that Jesus would live like a King because he was a King, that he's all 
for the Cadillac lifestyle his Golden Rule kingdom brings to the born again. </p>
<p>Grimac's bothersome question also reminds me of the time I was run off the 
road by a drunk driving a blue pickup truck. Counting my blessings and 
cussing, both at the same time, I tried to get his license number, but all I saw 
was the bumper sticker on his back window: </p>
<p>GOD IS MY COPILOT. </p>
<p>A South Knoxville women answering Grimac's letter says Jesus wouldn't 
ride in cars. He'd take buses and trains, speaking and performing miracles in 
train stations and bus depots. Pretty soon people would start using mass 
transportation in order to ``hang out with Jesus.'' </p>
<p>Grimac -- who himself has never owned a car that cost more than $1,000 
and who rides a bike most places -- said the what-would-Jesus-drive 
question popped out of his mouth one day while talking to a group of 
teenagers razzing him about his lack of enthusiasm for cars in general and 
expensive cars in particular. </p>
<p>``Do you think Jesus would drive a Mercedes or a beat up old Volkswagen 
Bug?'' he asked them in an offhanded way. He decided to turn the question 
into an article for Tennessee Green, the environmental newsletter he edits. </p>
<p>A TVA water quality expert says that although Jesus would prefer to walk, 
that would be impossible. The violent state of politics and religion would 
make Jesus a prime target for an assassin. Chances are he'd have to opt for 
a kind of bulletproof ``Popemobile'' arrangement. </p>
<p>Tim Brown, proprietor of a flower farm in Rockford, says he sees Jesus 
walking everywhere and talking to people he meets along the way. Vehicles, 
says Brown, are isolating, and if you use the air-conditioning, you're isolated 
not only from people but also from ``the breezes and fragrances of the 
natural world.'' </p>
<p>``I can easily picture Jesus hitchhiking,'' Brown says. ``A bearded guy in 
sandals with his thumb out and a gentle smile on his face, willing to trust in 
the generosity of his fellow man.'' </p>
<p>If you have ideas on what kind of car Jesus would drive, let me know, and 
I'll pass them along to Bob Grimac. Send them by July 25 to Ina Hughs, 
Knoxville News-Sentinel, P.O. Box 59038, Knoxville, Tenn., 37950-9038

<HEAD><TITLE>BRINE SHRIMP CAN HORSE AROUND AS SEA MONKEYS</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>July 17, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>BRINE SHRIMP CAN HORSE AROUND AS SEA MONKEYS</H2>

Maybe you didn't notice the T-shirt Alfred William Thomas Rhiner was wearing in a front-page photo in The News-Sentinel this past Friday. Rhiner, charged in the car-jacking and killing of a German tourist, was being escorted from the Gatlinburg Jail to a sheriff's cruiser.<P>

   As Rhiner stood in front of a dark doorway and was flanked by two police officers in dark blue uniforms, his oversized white T-shirt was easy to read:<P>

   A round aquarium with tiny creatures swimming through a coral reef archway and the words ``sea monkeys'' in large bubble print.<P>

   Of course the reason for Rhiner's picture being in the paper makes what he was wearing insignificant -- which means if it got your attention, you, too, must be among the zillions of people who helped make Harold von Braunhut a millionaire.<P>

   I lost count of the times my children licked a stamp and mailed off the order form torn out of a Richie Rich or Superman comic book:<P>

   Order your Sea-Monkeys now. Your chance of a lifetime to own real TIME-TRAVELERS, asleep in biological time-capsules for their strange journey into the future . . . YOUR future.<P>

   Seems my children aren't the only red-blooded American boys and girls who couldn't pass up an offer like that.<P>

    I asked around the newsroom, and most everyone over age 12 at one point owned a sea monkey collection of their own.<P>

   And most agree with the guy who remembers them as being disappointing after the buildup the comic books gave them: ``They didn't look like pets to me. They looked more like intestinal parasites. . . . ''<P>

   The kids at my house weren't that discerning. To them, these amazing creatures were Curious George's aquatic first cousins. They spent hours teaching them tricks and making up first and last names for each one as they evolved from the packages of smelly crumbs the postman brought with a knowing smile.<P>

   ``We got some at home, too,'' the postman told me once. ``Two of ours -- Big Red and Hector -- are over an inch big.'' I figured the man was not normal, but I have since learned Harold von Braunhut developed a whole line of sea monkeys for adults.<P>

   ``Many psychologists believe,'' the ad for ``The Executive Sea-Monkeys for Grownups'' reads, ``that the presence of fish and other live pets in a hectic office produces a calmer, lower stress atmosphere. . . . ''<P>

   Thank goodness my children were oblivious to the list of sea monkey accessories they could have ordered.<P>

   A ``Super Sea-Monkey Race Course,'' for instance. Sea monkeys, the directions explain, swim upstream, so here was a little manual pump you could use to create a kind of Kentucky Derby setup where you and your friends would place bets and play favorites.<P>

   Then there was sea monkey jewelry, including a little bauble filled with water that held up to six live sea monkeys. On a gold chain.<P>

   But the worst of all is something called ``Cupid's Arrow'' Mating Powder -- and here I am quoting from an old catalog -- ``for those shy bachelor Sea-Monkeys who fear marriage, this fabulous formula puts them in the mood for love.''<P>

   Eventually, as the Good Book says, we must put away childish things and face the facts. Sea monkeys were invented in 1960 by Harold von Braunhut, then president of Transcience Corp.<P>

    They are actually brine shrimp, the same kind of thing sold in saltwater aquarium stores to feed marine fish.<P>

   The miracle of sea monkeys is less biological and more in the marketing department.<P>

   ``Executive Sea-Monkeys'' even come with a life insurance policy.<P>

   Maybe Darwin had it backward. Here's at least one case in which we've got the monkeys laughing at us.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>SAND, SEA AND SUN AREN'T REQUIRED FOR THESE BEACH BOOKS</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>July 20, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>SAND, SEA AND SUN AREN'T REQUIRED FOR THESE BEACH BOOKS</H2>

<i>By Ina Hughs, Staff writer</i><P>

Everybody knows what you mean when you refer to a book as a ``beach book.''<P>

    These are the books we read on summertime play-hooky days from rut and routine, a book guaranteed to hook you line and sinker. Folks have been known to risk getting carsick just to finish the last chapters before pulling in the driveway.<P>

   As part of their summer game plan, Davis-Kidd Booksellers did a survey of local and regional folks, with special attention played to the so-called celebrities among us. The store asked what books the celebrities would take if they hit the jackpot and got what every bookseller, writer and bookworm dreams of: a month at the beach with nothing but a beach chair and a bag full of books.<P>

   The question is a little tricky because it's not really an endorsement of the book. You wouldn't take it if you'd already read it, unless you are like a friend of mine who says she reads Anne Morrow Lindbergh's ``Gift From The Sea'' every summer. <P>

   Some celebrities, especially the political kind, chose not to answer the beach book question because it's too personal. To be honest, rather than to use the questionnaire to show off one's intellectual prowess, it would mean admitting sometimes they read for pleasure -- even daffy, no-count, trashy books.<P>

   I was interested in the list because I for one am a year-round beach book bum. I grew up in a family where reading was an addiction. Everyone was either a pusher, a dealer or a hopeless case. I never outgrew the habit.<P>

   As for beach books, we actually did spend all summer at the beach and every afternoon a two-hour Quiet Time was enforced with the same vigor as the no-swimming-without-an-adult rule. At night the grownups sat on the porch, and we sprawled on floor pillows and read until stern voices ordering us up to bed and to TURN OFF THOSE LIGHTS grew even louder than the buzz-sawing of dune creatures outside our windows.<P>

   This was in the dark ages, B.T.V.<P>

   I can mark my summers by which books I read, moving from ``The Five Little Peppers'' through the Lassie and Black Beauty books, into Nancy Drew and Carolyn Keene. Then came light classics like ``The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come'' and ``Last of the Mohicans,'' and of course there were True Confession magazines read undercover, so to speak. <P>

   I spent one whole summer re-fighting World War I, another the Civil. A Russian fiction vacation meant nobody saw much of me at all because all those books are about 8,000 pages long. And so it went until I started packing in books like ``Good Night Moon'' and ``James and The Giant Peach'' for the next generation of genetic readers.<P>

   This summer, though I haven't been to the beach, my beach-book collection covers everything from A.S. Byatt's ``Babel Tower'' to ``Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot.''<P>

   I asked Tom Post, events coordinator and public relations, to talk about books our local celebrities touted and which sold well during their Beach Book promotion. Here's a partial list:<P>

   Sharyn McCrumb's ``She Walks These Hills'' -- part of her group of books about Appalachia; ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' by David Guterson, a literary whodunit set in Puget Sound; Patricia Cornwell's new now-in-paperback, ``From Potter's Field.'' And anything by Cormac McCarthy. Post says it's not just because of the hometown connection: ``People read one Cormac McCarthy, then come back for more.''<P>

   Mixed in with books that seem to be written for vacation reading -- Pat Conroy's ``Beach Music'' and anything by John Grisham -- are some surprises. I was glad to hear one of them is poet Mary Oliver's ``Blue Pastures.'' Yes!<P>

   Two popular beach books I'd not read, not even heard of, are Mary Willis Walker ``Under The Beetle's Cellar'' and ``Rootie Kazootie'' by Lawrence Naumoff. I wrote those names down, and as soon as I finish Maeve Binchy's ``The Glass Lake'' and Rita Mae Brown's ``Dolly'' -- oh, and ``Reviving Ophelia'' . . . ``Sophie's World'' . . .<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>STORMY MEMORIES LEAD TO REALIZATION</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>July 22, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>STORMY MEMORIES LEAD TO REALIZATION</H2>

This past weekend I took a sentimental journey along the coast of Northern Virginia. The Northern Neck, they call it.<P>

   I don't know how it could be in this day of fast cars and long weekends, but that part of Virginia's coastline and riverfront has somehow escaped the bumper-to-bumper, black-socks/blue hair, jaywalking crowds who body-slam into nearby Virginia Beach, Annapolis and Ocean City.<P>

   My family used to live in Mathews County, on Mobjack Bay, and I can remember driving from Richmond, then Norfolk, and later on from outside Washington to visit. The trip took longer in those days, before interstates, cruise controls and radar detectors made the race between work and play less of a headache.<P>

   Last weekend I hunted old haunts and spent a couple of days poking around new ones.<P>

   If I said it once, I said it a thousand times, ``I don't remember it being like this'' -- but I couldn't quite figure out what had changed.<P>

   Other than improved highways and more 7-Elevens, the scenery was much the same. Most everybody had the rugged jaw and strange accent of people who belonged. Part low-country. Part the ``oot'' and ``hoose'' of Virginia-speak. Part Oliver Twist English.<P>

   The same mile after mile of cornfields stretched like tasseled seascapes, high as an elephant's eye, on both sides of the road. The same baby waves tagged the gray shores of rivers and backwaters whose names sound like camp-fire chants sung by those who knew the place best. And first.<P>

   Piankatank. Pamunky. Mattaponi.<P>

   There was the familiar bottom-line smell of life stewing and brewing at low tide, the squiggly lines of a horizon I used to watch as a child melt in vapors coming off the asphalt; the same gossip of sea oats playing ``I've Got A Secret'' as we crunched across pine straw to water's edge.<P>

   At Windmill Point, near White Stone, where the Chesapeake and Rappahannock Rivers meet and marry in a primordial consummation of currents and cloud formations, the buoys sang the same two-part harmony I heard back a lifetime ago aboard a boat tied -- I swear -- by the same rag-tag ropes to the same creosote pier.<P>

   Still, it looked different.<P>

   Only when a storm moved in did I realize the difference was coming from the inside, not the outside. It isn't the place that changed, it's me.<P>

   In the olden days, as my children call my growing-up-at-the-beach years, I didn't appreciate what those 100-plus-year-old live oaks in my front yard had been through, how remarkable old age can be. I was too busy to look up the name of vines whose wild-blue-yonder blooms only hide if you aren't seeking; too mixed up in the camouflage of growing up to see wise old marsh birds studying the way of things and coming to their own conclusions.<P>

   But it was a sudden, come-to-Jesus storm that made me realize these things were nothing new.<P>

   The scenery had changed from the inside.<P>

   Children can, should, look at the storms from a safe perspective, and the fragility and wonder of things are best recognized by those who remember how it felt first of all to take them for granted.<P>

   I guess this is what poets try to say in their careful words, painters work to turn loose on their canvases, conductors lean forward to pull from their musicians. It's basic, this yin and yang.<P>

   The storm's beauty didn't come from the ease and play of harmless spirits. It came from a force so strong the ancients worshiped it: currents that grind and pulse with an energy coming from depths humans cannot even fathom; wind so demanding it not only moves mountains but reconfigures continents.<P>

   I didn't always know that about those summer storms at the beach. Before I'd undone the knot that tied me safe in the harbor of childhood, we used to run outside laughing and dancing when we saw one coming. I'd spread my arms and dive-bomb through changing wind I only imagined might scoop me up and carry me off.<P>

   This time it was different. I didn't want to dance in it.<P>

   Sometimes I even forgot to breathe.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>NEW BOOK PAINTS WORD PICTURES OF NEW MEXICO LAND</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>July 24, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>NEW BOOK PAINTS WORD PICTURES OF NEW MEXICO LAND</H2>

<i>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel writer</i><P>

In her book, ``Canyon of Remembrance,'' Lesley Poling-Kempes tells the story of an artist in an isolated community above Sante Fe and the people who move across the canvas of his life like light and shadow coming off the mesa.<P>

   Those of us who have been to northern New Mexico and discovered in it the landscape of our own souls will find this book to be a souvenir of that journey. For those who leave the high desert with nothing but a deeper appreciation for air-conditioning and the remote control, it is a guided tour of part of the trip their mind's eye missed.<P>

   They say a good painting should tell a story.<P>

   In this case, the story becomes a painting.<P>

   A landscape painting.<P>

   The setting itself is the lead character of the novel, guiding plot, controlling dialogue, and serving as both antagonist and savior of every conflict. This is a place where change is constant, where each vista is a crash course in creation, a composite rendering of man's search for meaning and nature's role in that adventure.<P>

   Kempes-Poling came from New York to Northern New Mexico when she was 17 and has lived in that world all her adult life. She knows it inside out. Or, as she told me on the phone this week, ``I cannot separate what is happening in the land from what is happening inside me.''<P>

   Whitney Slope, Poling-Kempes' character-in-search-of-himself comes to the high desert seeking spiritual and creative energy -- something more and more people are doing these days. They fall in love with O'Keeffe country, come home, pack up, and head west, rushing like pioneers to pan the gold of self-sufficiency, to stake a claim on sacred space, to escape the confines of conservative religion and downsizing politics.<P>

   Poling-Kempes says the love affair doesn't always last:<P>

   ``You have to really work at it. It's never a conquest of the place. You move in it, work in it, respond to it in give-and-take isolation. You have to fall back on your own resources. Maybe that's why people who truly love the land do OK out here.''<P>

   Another of Poling-Kempes' characters in search of themselves is Atencio de Jesus, an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, caught up in a love-hate relationship with his heritage and the land that claims him by birth. It is, in fact, Atencio who brings Slope to his senses. The moment of reckoning comes when Atencio visits the disheartened artist and sees a painting of the view outside the window: a patio wall, the bare sand hill; fluttering clouds under a wide, hot-blue sky.<P>

   ``I have seen this too,'' Atencio says -- his fingers locked together over his stomach, as if holding an old wound. ``I never knew it could be painted. How it feels. I thought paintings were just for how it looks.''<P>

   It is then that Whitney Slope finds the peace of mind we humans spend our lives looking for:<P>

   ``Whitney thought how he stood in the center of the universe . . . how he had by luck or by miracle come to be in a place where art and reality fused into an inseparable matrix that had nothing and yet everything to do with paint and form, canvas and color.''<P>

   The character Whitney Slope is loosely based on real-life artist Jim Harrill, a North Carolinian by birth, and a friend to whom she dedicates her book. Harrill died three weeks after the book came out, and last month at his memorial service, selections from the book were read aloud.<P>

   Like many of the people around Abiquiu, Taos, Espanola, and other high desert communities, Poling-Kempes worries that their simple life and the integrity of the area will be compromised:<P>

   ``People too often try to transplant what they had somewhere else. The fear is this will trample what is here. Hopefully not.''<P>

   There is an ancient saying that the land resonates within everyone who lives on it, everyone who has ever lived on it. It's easier, Poling-Kempes reminds us, to hear those voices and feel that energy in a place that is not so built upon.<P>

<TD WIDTH=470><H2>LORETTA BRADLEY TO FIGHT CHILD SEX ABUSE IN ASIA</H2>

Tomorrow morning at Shiloh Presbyterian Church in East Knoxville, Loretta Bradley will stand before the congregation and hear prayers of support as she prepares for her upcoming trip to the Far East.<P>

   Bradley is one of 24 Presbyterian women selected from across the country for a month-long ``Journey of Caring,'' the first step in a two-year commitment to study the status of children at risk in the United States, Thailand, Cambodia and the Philippines. The project, sponsored by the Presbyterian Church, U.S.A., will help women like Bradley understand the economic, societal and political realities that impact the lives of the world's children.<P>

   One of the major problems the study will explore is child prostitution and the growing number of children forced into the sex markets of the world.<P>

   The information Bradley shared with me on this global crisis was so disturbing I could hardly stand to read it, although it is certainly something we all need to be aware of.<P>

   ``I did not know -- and I hate to say it, but I am a 60-something-year-old grandmother -- but I didn't know there were such things as so-called `child sex tours,' where tour companies send people materials on places they can travel and buy sex from any age person, 7 years old and up. I didn't know that. I didn't think there was such a thing in this world, and that grown people participated in something like that anywhere in the world, much less in this country.''<P>

   Other members of the ``Journey of Caring'' team include a public health nurse from Washington State, a vocational rehabilitation professional from Missouri, a feminist from Michigan, a housewife from Oklahoma, a minister's wife from Connecticut, a Salvation Army volunteer from California, a Native American from Kentucky, a schoolteacher from Texas.<P>

   Bradley, an elder and clerk of session at Shiloh Presbyterian, was selected as a member of the ``Journey of Caring'' task force because of her professional background in welfare and social work. She received her master's degree in social work from The University of Tennessee and has been employed by the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee for 29 years.<P>

   But it is her personal faith and fierce belief in the Golden Rule that inspired her to take on this responsibility and challenge.<P>

   ``I think of my granddaughter, Olivia, who is 8, and my 12-year-old grandson, Bernard. They are such sweet, innocent children, and it disturbs me to think children like them would be sold by their parents into prostitution or mistreated in some kind of abusive activity. That's the hurting thing. If I saw someone doing that to my children, I would have to jump on top of them. I'd have to do something, whatever it took, to stop it. It's a sin to have innocence snatched away just for someone else's folly.<P>

   ``You add those feelings to what the Bible says about being our brother's and sister's keeper, and you see why I am going and what I want to accomplish. Church women should be involved in developing programs and activities that eliminate abuse.<P>

   ``I know what I am getting ready to see will break my heart. What do I need to take on this trip? I need a crying towel. But after I finish using my crying towel, I am going to sit down with these other women who have seen these things with me and we're going to put our hearts and brains to work.''<P>

   Bradley says she is not at all surprised by the support the project received from the Knoxville community, nor does she see her volunteering for it as being particularly heroic:<P>

   ``I knew my background and interest in the welfare and social systems in this city and the type of problems we face fit in with the intent of the study -- that is, to make this a better world for children. I also want to act out my faith, to do and say what I believe. I want to learn what we can do to help relieve the pain and agony of children, here, there. Everywhere.''<P>

   Bless you, Loretta Bradley, and God speed.<P>

SHOULD ENRAGE ALL ADULTS </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, Columnist</em></p>
<p>In ``A Time to Kill,'' the latest movie based on a John Grisham novel, a 
10-year-old black girl is raped and tortured by two white men on the 
backroads of Mississippi. Her father, knowing the men will more than likely 
escape punishment, takes justice into his own hands. He knows the Golden 
Rule isn't color blind in that Deep South town.</p>
<p>The father's only chance in court is an insanity plea. Grief makes us do crazy 
things.</p>
<p>In some cases -- the lawyer defending the enraged father says -- it works 
the other way around. A parent would have to be crazy NOT to ``go crazy'' 
in a case like this.</p>
<p>Put your own child's face on that little girl and what would you do?</p>
<p>We don't have to go to the movies to test ourselves on this question, 
although the ways in which real-life children are being sexually exploited in 
this and other countries is hard to believe and certainly something we'd 
rather not talk about. Truth is not only stranger than fiction, in this case it's 
even more horrific.</p>
<p>The sexual exploitation of children is a growing multibillion dollar industry in 
this and other countries. </p>
<p>The Child Hope organization estimates that in the U.S. an estimated 
125,000 to 200,000 teenage boys and girls become involved in prostitution 
each year, about two-thirds of whom are street youths.</p>
<p>In India, which has the highest incidence of child prostitution in the world, 20 
percent of the 2 million prostitutes in that country are minors. Of the 
125,000 prostitutes in Bombay some, 90,000 are minors.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, the estimate for the number of child prostitutes in Manila 
alone is around 40,000 -- twice UNICEF's 1987 figures.</p>
<p>In Thailand, the Center for Protection of Children's Rights reports there are 
200,000 to 400,000 prostitutes under the age of 16 who work in its 60,000 
brothels. A recent raid of a Bangkok brothel resulted in police finding 18 
girls ages 14-19, and all but one tested HIV-positive. Each girl had sex with 
an average of 17 men a night and earned the equivalent of 80 cents per 
``customer.''</p>
<p>An article in Christian Century magazine recounted the story of a fire in a 
Thailand brothel where firefighters found the bodies of three 15-year-old 
girls still chained to their beds.</p>
<p>``Sex-tour promoters,'' the article explains, ``feel the stereotype that Asian 
women are submissive and have a strong desire to please men. The Austrian 
airline Lauda Air ran an advertisement . . . in its in-flight magazine. A 
post-card-from-Thailand format depicted a Thai girl, nude to the waist, with 
a caption reading: From Thailand with Love. The message on the back 
declared that the writer didn't have much time to spare because `the tarts in 
the Bangkok Baby Club are waiting for us.' In 1992 a San Diego travel 
agency organized `American Fantasy Tours,' which promised easy sex with 
Thai women who `live in harmony with nature, fulfilling their mission to satisfy 
the needs of man' . . . ''</p>
<p>Although illegal in virtually every country in the world, child prostitution is a 
$5 billion industry. Since the expansion of the Mann Act and the passing of 
the 1994 crime bill, it is illegal for U.S. citizens and permanent-resident aliens 
to travel abroad to engage in sexual acts with minors. And yet -- quoting 
from Ron O'Grady's book ``The Child and the Tourist'' -- ``one quarter of 
all visitors abusing children in Asia are American businessmen and military 
personnel.''</p>
<p>It's one thing to sit in a movie and play like the kid up on the screen is your 
own, to feel a rage from somewhere deep and lasting come on so strong you 
can't even sit still.</p>
<p>Too bad statistics don't pack the same punch as make-believe.</p>

PREJUDICE CAN BE OVERCOME </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel Columnist</em></p>
<p>No matter what the weather looks like for the rest of us this morning, it's 
raining over at McGhee Tyson Airport.</p>
<p>Today is the day eight Irish teenagers and their counselors leave after a 
month's stay in Knoxville, and the downpour of tearful goodbyes had 
already started when I met with them Monday in Connie Vincent's home in 
Vonore:</p>
<p>Some 16 teenagers -- eight from Northern Ireland, eight from the Knoxville 
area -- along with their counselors and a few of the host parents, are 
bunched together on sofas, stretched long-legged on the floor, piled on 
pillows propped up against the stone fireplace. The energy level is high, but 
these kids, without exception, are comfortable with one another. Every 
comment has a family-joke, shared-secret dimension that can't be faked but 
comes from feeling familiar and secure.</p>
<p>What is ``wrong'' with this picture?</p>
<p>Back home these kids from Ireland would never even be in the same room 
with one another, certainly never get past the barbs of prejudice and years of 
divisive history.</p>
<p>The program is called the Ulster Project, and of the 26 participating cities in 
the United States, five are in Tennessee: Knoxville, Kingsport, Nashville, 
Oak Ridge and Chattanooga.</p>
<p>The idea is simple. Irish youth, ages 14 to 16, are chosen by their clergy and 
teachers for leadership potential: an equal number of boys and girls, half of 
whom are Protestant and half of whom are Roman Catholic. Churches and 
civic organization in the host city match each Irish youth with one of their 
own kids of the same sex, interest and -- as promised to Irish families 
sending their young people -- the same religious background.</p>
<p>For a month these kids -- Protestant and Catholics together -- live free from 
the socio-political divisions Protestants and Catholics see as the only way of 
life in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>``Where I come from,'' one of the Irish kids tells me, ``just speaking to a 
Protestant can mean you are dropped by your friends, or even beaten up. 
It's the way of things. Forever.''</p>
<p>Father Albert Thomas Waterstone begs to differ with the idea that change is 
impossible.</p>
<p>In 1974, Waterstone, an Anglican priest from Tullamore, Ireland, exchanged 
pulpits with a Roman Catholic priest in Connecticut. Following his return to 
Ireland, and at the request of his Catholic friends in America, he came up 
with a plan based on the idea that if the youth of Northern Ireland -- 
specifically the next generation of Ulster leaders, Protestant and Catholic 
alike -- could find common ground and form friendships, ancient barriers 
could be broken.</p>
<p>He called it the Ulster Project.</p>
<p>And he was right.</p>
<p>The kids in the Vincent's home Monday afternoon can teach us all how 
immature prejudices are.</p>
<p>``We shouldn't let religion divide us,'' says Lorraine Fox, one of the 
college-aged counselors from Derry, where just last month riots between 
Protestants and Catholics made national headlines. ``You see these kids 
together, and they are all the same underneath. Back home, religion is the 
thing that divides us. It marks us and that's that. Hopefully our kids will keep 
their friendship with each other when they go back and will pass along the 
idea that to hate someone, not associate with them because they're a 
different denomination, is a bit silly. Not worth the effort, really.''</p>
<p>Connie Vincent, Ulster Project director for this year's group, calls it the 
ripple effect:</p>
<p>``One kid goes back and tells his community about how Protestants and 
Catholics can not only get along, but can form lasting friendships. Make that 
experience available for enough kids, and you slowly but surely start 
spreading the good news and making headway.''</p>
<p>If you or your church is interested in learning more, write Knoxville Ulster 
Project, P.O. Box 11223, Knoxville, Tenn. 37919.</p>

<TITLE>SCENIC HIGHWAY FINALLY TO REPLACE OLD `WAGON TRAIL'</TITLE>

REPLACE OLD `WAGON TRAIL' </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, News-Senitnel columnist</em></p>
<p>Even if it isn't a clear day, you can still see forever on the Cherohala 
Skyway, East Tennessee's newest tourist attraction.</p>
<p>And when the fog comes after you like a friendly ghost on the run, sweeping 
you up in its arms and dangling you over the edge of the world, you know 
you'll remember your first trip on it forever.</p>
<p>It's nice to have friends in high places. Recently I tagged along with my friend 
Charles Hall, retired mayor and all-around hero of Tellico Plains, on a tour 
of the not-yet-opened scenic highway which -- after 38 years in the making 
-- goes over the river, through the woods and across the mountains from 
Tellico Plains to Robbinsville, N.C.</p>
<p>The idea for the Skyway -- which Charles Hall told me ahead of time ``rivals 
all scenic highways anywhere in the world'' -- came in 1958 during a table 
conversation at a regular weekly meeting of the Tellico Plains Kiwanis Club. 
Business leaders expressed frustration over the need for better roads in the 
area, and -- as Hall tells the story -- Sam Williams laughingly suggested they 
have their own wagon train to go along with the ``wagon roads'' in the area. 
The TV program ``Wagon Train'' was a popular hit at the time, and what 
started out as a joke soon grew into a plan that caught the imagination and 
enthusiasm of the entire community.</p>
<p>On Friday June 27, 1958, the first wagon train began the trip across rugged 
``wagon'' roads from old Fort Loudoun, down into Tellico Plains, and into 
Western North Carolina near Robbinsville.</p>
<p>By 1960, the Wagon Train -- now an event you talked about in capital 
letters -- grew to 105 wagons and 776 horseback riders. Over the years the 
trip has become a Tellico Plains family affair as Hall and others became even 
more enthusiastic about transforming the old wagon roads into a scenic 
highway.</p>
<p>This October, his dream comes true when the Cherohala Skyway opens to 
the public, connecting the Indian Boundary and Citico Wilderness areas with 
the Joyce Kilmer and Slickrock areas across the North Carolina State line 
near Robbinsville. </p>
<p>Some folks think it should be called the Charles Hall Highway, since Hall has 
been the single most influential and energetic leader in its construction, but 
Hall insisted the name honor its original foot travelers and their namesake 
forests through which the Skyway runs: Cherokee and Nantahala.</p>
<p>Rolling its name over in my mind as we drove along, I decided fate had 
decreed Hall's praises be sung anyway, despite what he said. Cherohala 
sounds to me like it could be the Cherokee pronunciation of Charles Hall's 
name.</p>
<p>Nobody on earth knows its every turn and legend better. Hall has learned by 
heart the names of its creeks and hollows, how many miles and 
tenths-of-a-mile between each overlook, exactly where off-shoot timber 
roads lead as they tumble down the mountiansides, or the names of flowers 
that bound across meadows and balds where sunlight and fog play their own 
hide-and-seek summer Olympic games.</p>
<p>Although Charles Hall's name is certainly at the top, there are other names 
on Cherohala Skyway's birth certificate. In 1962 Estes Kefauver worked to 
get federal funds approved for the roadway at a projected cost of $6 million. 
When the Skyway opens this fall, it will be at a cost of about $100 million. 
The names filling in the blanks between those two figures is a roll call of local 
historians, environmentalists, civic and political leaders who worked together 
and ``kept the faith.''</p>
<p>Speaking of which -- in a few months, as you come out of Tellico Plains on 
165, heading toward Bald River Falls and the beginning of the new Skyway, 
you'll see a sign that says GOD'S MOUNTAIN -- 13 miles.''</p>
<p>It's not just a coincidence the God's Mountain community is so close by.</p>
<p>It's prophecy.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago I posed a question Knoxville environmentalist Bob 
Grimac had asked me: ``What kind of car do you think Jesus would drive if 
he were here today?''</p>
<p>It's something, to be quite honest, I'd never thought about, and I had a hard 
time coming up with even a good guess. So I was glad to hear from some 20 
of you readers who sent in answers and comments. Here are a few of those 
ideas:</p>
<p>Jim Devault says there's no question about it. The answer is in the Bible: And 
when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they (the disciples) were all with 
one accord in one place. (Acts 2:1)</p>
<p>Allan Hjerpe e-mailed me a story he once read about Gandhi: ``While the 
British were still running India, the problem of providing Gandhi with security 
was complicated no end by Gandhi's insistence on riding in third-class 
railway carriages and sleeping in the courtyards of the cheapest inns. One of 
the men in charge of Gandhi's security remarked that `You have no idea how 
much it costs to keep the old man in poverty.' ''</p>
<p>James W. Taylor says it's a stupid question because the day Jesus comes 
will be the Day of Judgment. He ``will not be driving a car, performing 
miracles, smelling the flowers, and he will not be hitchhiking. . . . That day 
will be Joy for some, worry and confusion for others.''</p>
<p>Tom Everett sent me an excerpt from ``How to Talk to God When You 
Aren't Feeling Religious'' by Charles Merrill Smith. In a chapter titled 
``Would Jesus Drive a Cadillac?'' Smith writes:</p>
<p>Once I was talking with a Methodist bishop and he related that a friend of 
his -- a prosperous clergyman -- was wrestling with the question, ``Would 
Jesus drive a Cadillac?'' He was, of course, trying to ease his Puritan 
conscience prior to purchasing a Cadillac for himself.</p>
<p>I turned the question back on the bishop. Would Jesus drive a Cadillac? The 
bishop replied that he wasn't sure Jesus would drive a Cadillac, but he sure 
would if he could afford it.</p>
<p>Smith then moves into the question within the question: ``Can a Christian 
drive a Cadillac'' sounds like a frivolous question, but it isn't. If I am a 
serious Christian, how much luxury and opulent living am I permitted to 
enjoy?</p>
<p>Another reader, name withheld, put the question to her family at the dinner 
table. Her daughter said it'd be ``the Rock'' -- a Chevy truck. Her husband 
figured it'd be a church bus, and her son's girlfriend chose a beat-up Ford 
pickup. ``After all, Jesus was a carpenter.''</p>
<p>Then they all changed their minds and decided he wouldn't have a car, but 
would find 12 friends to take him around. From there the conversation 
turned to describing some of those 12 friends and what they'd drive or ride. 
Here's their list:</p>
<p>1. A college kid with a bike, wearing a Greenpeace T-shirt.</p>
<p>2. A motorcyclist: black leather, long hair, beard, tattoo.</p>
<p>3. A Suburban with bumper sticker SCHOOL'S OPEN -- DRIVE 
CAREFULLY.</p>
<p>4. A Winnebago, with their name on the tire cover and a WE'RE 
SPENDING OUR CHILDREN'S INHERITANCE bumper sticker.</p>
<p>5. A Chevrolet station wagon with a SAVE THE BABY HUMANS 
bumper sticker.</p>
<p>6. A Saab convertible proclaiming SUPPORT PRO-CHOICE.</p>
<p>7. A Ford pick-up with a Confederate flag tag on the front bumper and an 
NRA sticker in the rear window.</p>
<p>8. A Black Trans Am with leopard-skin upholstery and a MALCOLM X 
sticker.</p>
<p>9. A Cadillac Seville with an AAA-Plus sticker.</p>
<p>10. A rusty VW ``bug'' with a fading bumper sticker that says MAKE 
LOVE NOT WAR.</p>
<p>11. A Toyota pickup with FEAR THIS DALE EARNHARDT #3 on the 
bumper.</p>
<p>12. A Buick Skylark that says HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS.</p>
<p>In my book, the prize answer came on a postcard signed Justus Brandance.</p>
<p>``A Dodge. Maybe a Plymouth. But certainly a Chrysler.''</p>
<p>Get it?</p>

EARN SPOT IN THE PAPER </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, Columnist</em></p>
<p>From the mail:</p>
<p>I was glad to learn I was not the only mother who let her children bully her 
into ordering sea monkeys. A number of readers called to share their slimy 
stories, and it seems the average life span of all sea monkeys in homes 
across America was about two weeks. Long enough for the smell to start 
getting into the furniture.</p>
<p>One caller said he still remembered the names of his monkeys: Elvis, 
Weasel, Dammit, Popeye, Godzilla. He'd have gone on all day, but I 
suddenly remembered an important meeting I had to go to.</p>
<p>A letter from Janene Satterfield of Louisville says she missed out on the sea 
monkeys, but she can tell us how come nobody ever wants to sit on the front 
pew in church. I happened to mention that is the one thing every 
denomination has in common. People pay big bucks for front-row tickets 
everywhere else, but hey! They wouldn't be caught dead up that close in 
church. Satterfield explains that unwritten commandment:</p>
<p>Thou shalt not sit on the front pew:</p>
<p>``As a Baptist preacher's daughter, I grew up -- literally! -- in church. We 
were there every time the doors swung wide and even when they slammed 
shut. Death and hospitalization were the only acceptable excused absences. 
Most of this church-going was spent in the Front Pew -- to Daddy's right 
when we were little, stage left when we got older. No reason given for the 
move, it just was.</p>
<p>``So, in light of my experience, I can tell you Front Pews are reserved for 
the pastor's wife to smile and nod and so he can see her and be encouraged 
to keep putting it on. A second, just as important reason, is that it lets the 
congregation observe the pastor's `little darling's' behavior. It gives them 
something to discuss over Sunday lunch!''</p>
<p>A more serious ``church'' controversy brought a variety of heated responses:</p>
<p>``Your latest diatribe,'' writes Marilyn Ayers of Loudon, ``this time against 
the Southern Baptist Convention for issuing condemnation for the 
neuvo-Disney Corp., demonstrates that you still just don't get it . . . Disney 
has joined the other major studios in the competition to see just how dirty, 
lewd, perverted, violent and disgusting life can be. With the constant barrage 
of filth spewed out by the entertainment media, it is a wonder more of us 
aren't committing suicide rather than face another day of it.''</p>
<p>Margaret Dickson of Knoxville writes that her sympathies are with Disney 
when it comes to the ``Baptist Inquisition'' -- but she has a different bone to 
pick with Disney: ``Everytime they touch a standard or a classic story, they 
manage to make it into a Saturday morning hit-and-scream cartoon. Disney 
should be indicted for piracy of intellectual property. Can you imagine what 
they'd do with the Piper-at-the-Gates-of-Dawn scene in `Wind in the 
Willow?' Fortunately that is too sensitive a subject, too delicate probably, 
for their grubby hands to touch.''</p>
<p>This last letter wasn't written to me. It's from an old Ann Landers column. 
An anonymous reader sent it to me after one of my ``liberal Democrat'' 
columns with a few nanny-nanny-boo-boo comments scribbled in the 
margins.</p>
<p>Just to prove we Democrats have a sense of humor, I'll pass it along:</p>
<p>``Dear Miss Landers: I am 30 years of age. I have two brothers, one a 
Republican and member of Congress working in Washington, D.C. The 
other is serving a nine-year sentence for repeated rape and arson. My sisters 
are on the streets, and my father is living on their earnings. My mother is 
pregnant by the next-door neighbor . . . </p>
<p>``Recently I met a charming girl. She is an ex-prostitute, single, and the 
mother of three lovely children: one white, one black, and one Chinese.</p>
<p>``My problem is this. Should I tell her about my being a Republican?''</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>August 10, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>KNOXVILLE ARTIST DISCOVERS 
TALENT FOR BIBLICAL HUMOR </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>Try your funny bone on this one:</p>
<p>Little David has been sent to the principal's office, and the principal is 
holding up a slingshot, saying ``You know you can put someone's eyes out 
with this thing?''</p>
<p>The punch line?</p>
<p>Principal Duncan never knew how much of an influence he had on David's 
education.</p>
<p>Knoxville cartoonist Mike Taylor says he doesn't know where these ideas 
come from when they pop into his head, but they have ended up on T-shirts, 
greeting cards, and this May his first cartoon collection, titled ``Soul 
Improvement,'' was published by Peake Road Publishers in Macon, Ga.</p>
<p>Shortly after moving to Knoxville five years ago, Taylor was laid off by the 
company that brought him here.</p>
<p>Call it predestination -- though Taylor is actually Baptist -- he took the 
setback as an opportunity to start his own graphics business, Taylor 
Graphix. In addition to company brochures, ads and logos, he also 
specializes in biblical humor, including a line of cartoon T-shirts and greeting 
cards.</p>
<p>The biblical cartoons started back in '94 when Taylor got a call from his 
brother who wanted some T-shirt ideas for his Christian singing group: ``I 
started with a couple of ideas, and they just kept coming.''</p>
<p>Though he has never seen anyone be offended at his brand of biblical humor, 
at one point early on he stopped and asked himself, ``Am I being 
sacrilegious with this stuff?'' -- so he showed them to the pastors at his 
church, West Park Baptist on Middlebrook Pike and gave them to wife 
Debbie to test out on folks at Christian Academy where she teaches. He got 
rave reviews.</p>
<p>Since then Taylor has sold to several greeting card companies and started 
his own line of T-shirts called ``Crack-Ups.''</p>
<p>Taylor is very sensitive to the sacred aspect of the Bible, but his intent is to 
bring it alive, dust off the characters, give them some spunk: ``Moses, David, 
Noah, Abraham were Godly men and women, sure, but they were normal, 
too, like us. Noah probably really did get seasick.</p>
<p>``I don't do cartoons about Jesus. That way you are talking about a man, but 
you are talking about God, too. I just won't draw that.''</p>
<p>But he does have fun with ``the biggest grand opening in the history of the 
Red Sea Surf Shop franchise'' and a frustrated dentist who looks into a 
mouthful of cavities, saying, ``What's it been, Noah? Four, five, maybe six 
hundred years since you've been to the dentist?''</p>
<p>``I know God has given me a talent, and it's neat to have this book, but the 
best is being able to think up something that makes people laugh out loud.''</p>

THE ``NEWS'' IS FOR REAL </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>Two stories that came in over the wire last week prove at least one of my 
theories about newspapers: Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make 
you laugh.</p>
<p>From the stranger-than-fiction department comes a brief about O.J. 
Simpson's preachy interview in the September issue of Esquire magazine.</p>
<p>The Rev. Juice takes as text, bless our souls, the sorry state of morals in this 
country. We've hit rock bottom, he says. Truth is losing out to greed and 
power. Painting himself as a ``relatively moral guy'' . . . ``relatively'' meaning 
``comparison to,'' not as in what he did to his ex-next-of-kin, both on and 
off the record . . . Simpson goes on to pontificate on the evils of greed and 
self-interest.</p>
<p>``Sleaze has gone respectable,'' he told the magazine. ``Everybody namin' 
names, pointin' fingers, cashin' in on gossip.</p>
<p>``I consider myself a relatively moral guy because of the way I was brought 
up by my mother,'' he says. ``Never before have there been so many 
rock-bottom people. . . . They've lost control of their lives 'cause they got no 
morals.''</p>
<p>He says women are especially corrupt:</p>
<p>``Man, you don't know what it's like to have phone numbers on panties 
thrown over your gate! You add drugs to that aggressive kinda energy and 
you got a bad scene. . . . That's why I didn't want Nicole around girls like 
that.''</p>
<p>This may be a good time to tell my favorite Simpson joke. It starts with my 
asking if you know how he signs onto the Internet.</p>
<p>Slash-backslash-delete-pound-pound-escape.</p>
<p>Speaking of backslashes -- make that backlashes -- here's the latest from 
The Citadel and the not-so-gentlemanish fight to keep their boys away from 
women, and versa vice.</p>
<p>The Citadel finally changed its admissions policy, two days after the U.S. 
Supreme Court ruled excluding females from VMI was unconstitutional. 
Bruce Smith, an Associated Press writer, has been keeping his fingers on the 
pulse of South Carolina's all-male bastion of Southern Whatever, whose 
alums are apt to go into cardiac arrest this fall when three women are 
expected to break into the ranks.</p>
<p>Battle plans to accommodate ``the enemy'' -- my choice of words, not 
Smith's and certainly not The Citadel's -- include adding a new 21-page set 
of regulations to the handbook. Everything from lipstick to latrines, petting to 
protocol. If you allow yourself a little light on a very gloomy fight, there's a 
great situation comedy brewing here.</p>
<p>Women will live in the barracks, but their rooms will have locks on the 
doors. Old rules allow anyone to walk into any room unannounced. As of 
this fall, all cadets have to knock.</p>
<p>Women are prohibited from dating their superior officers. (Can't you see 
some rule-stickler superior dragging in his lawyer saying, ``But it doesn't 
prohibit me from dating her!'')</p>
<p>After those rather reasonable and conventional ground rules, things start 
hitting the funny bone.</p>
<p>No two cadets can occupy the same piece of furniture, such as a bunk or 
chair. Women have ``to have a distinctive haircut'' chosen by the 
commandant of cadets. (Ever seen the cuts some commandants go for in 
their women, like beehives and bouffants? Pul-eeze.) </p>
<p>When cadets visit rooms of members of the opposite sex, doors must be 
fully open, although they may be closed if three or more cadets are present 
and fully awake. (``Sorry, Mom, but I got shipped for dozing off during a 
study session on logarithms.'')</p>
<p>According to the wire story, Citadel officials have asked the state Human 
Resources Office to provide up to six hours of sexual harassment training for 
cadet leaders.</p>
<p>Five women have been accepted at The Citadel in the wake of Shannon 
Faulkner's lose-lose campaign. Kim Messer of Clover and Nancy Mace of 
Goose Creek have paid their room deposits and plan to become Citadel 
cadets on Aug. 24. A third woman is trying to raise money to enroll, the 
school said. The two others turned them down.</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>August 14, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>OLYMPIAN THINKER DWELLS ON 
WORDS, WHO OWNS THEM </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel Columnist</em></p>
<p>Now that the Olympics are over, we can put that perfectly good word back 
in our vocabulary without danger of being sued.</p>
<p>Not that we use every day, but it comes in handy from time to time:</p>
<p>Olympic strength. An olympic formula.</p>
<p>Even the Olympic Peninsula.</p>
<p>As Atlanta prepared for ``the largest sports gathering of the century,'' the 
word o-l-y-m-p-i-c was highjacked from the dictionary. Nothing could be 
sold using the word or symbol without being scrutinized -- with proper 
financial arrangements -- by ``the committee.'' One friend told me a pizza 
parlor in her neighborhood called ``Olympic Pizza'' was told to either change 
the name or cover it up.</p>
<p>I don't know how much of this is exaggeration, and I realize some control 
had to be worked out on what was and was not ``official'' Olympic 
paraphernalia.</p>
<p>But I do know that language can be tricky. Some words start out as one 
thing and end up another. They can go into a court of law with capital-letter 
status and come out mere generic nouns.</p>
<p>Several years ago I got in trouble with the word ``zee-rocks.''</p>
<p>You know. A verb meaning ``to copy.''</p>
<p>Only we can't use it that way. Xerox actually has two r's. One in the middle 
and one you put in a little circle over it, indicating it is a trademark. Same 
with Jello, Velcro, Chap Stick and hundreds of other trade names we use 
incorrectly as common nouns in everyday speech.</p>
<p>The popularity of these brand names has turned them into linguistic short cuts 
for ``powdered gelatin in different flavors that jiggles when you eat it'' and 
``hook and loop fasteners that sound like they are taking off a layer of skin'' 
and ``that goopy stuff that keeps your lips from cracking and falling off at the 
beach or on a hike or after you're gone to work out, and which incidentally, 
you always forget to carry with you so you're always asking around, 
``Anybody got any Chap Stick?''</p>
<p>Actually an Olympic Chap Stick would have been a good idea.</p>
<p>Kleenex is another example. When we're about to sneeze, we don't say, 
``Hand me a disposable, double-ply thing-a-ma-bob to blow my nose.''</p>
<p>We say h-h-anmea-a-a-klee-n-e-ahhh-CHOO.''</p>
<p>Then there is Scotch Tape. If I have said it once, I have said it a thousand 
times:</p>
<p>``Who took my Scotch Tape?''</p>
<p>Especially around Christmas.</p>
<p>I wouldn't care if it was Scotch Brand cellophane tape, Highland Brand 
3710, 3M, or Revco invisible continuous roll adhesive.</p>
<p>Just gimme my dadgum scotchtape back.</p>
<p>You can imagine how silly I felt when I asked the Saturn people if they made 
a Jeep. And Spackle. I am remodeling a house, and the other day went to 
the hardware store looking for ``spackle.'' There is no such generic thing.</p>
<p>Spackle is what the Muralo Company named their surfacing compound. I 
though spackle was, well, spackle. ``Surfacing compound'' doesn't give a 
clue as to how feisty the stuff is to work with.</p>
<p>Spackle and Weed Eater, Windbreaker, Styrofoam -- and Olympic, if you 
want to get technical -- are proper adjectives and should always be followed 
by the noun they modify. That's why in the Bill Cosby commercials they 
always say ``Jello-brand dessert treat.''</p>
<p>Only after you go to court and say, ``Hey! Everyone uses this, and I can 
show you 15,000 examples'' does a company lose exclusive rights.</p>
<p>American Express runs an ad warning folks not to refer to any of its slogans 
or trademark in an ad, or they'll see you in court. If Rogaine used the 
Marlboro Man to conjure up high-testosterone images of hairy chests and 
wavy locks, Phillip Morris would doubtless come after them with a big stick.</p>
<p>Of course, to keep up with all this takes a linguistic marlboro mind of 
olympian skill.</p>
<p>See you in court.</p>

WORSE VERSE, YAY! </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, News-Senitnel Columnist</em></p>
<p>Tomorrow is Bad Poetry Day, set aside for some strange reason as a time 
to gather around friends and read bad poems aloud to each other.</p>
<p>Or better still, ``compose some really rotten verse and send it to your old 
high school English teacher.''</p>
<p>I'm quoting here from the sponsors of Bad Poetry Day, an outfit called The 
Wellness Permission League in Lebanon, Pa. They promote the day as 
``payback'' for all the poetry we were forced the read in school.</p>
<p>Obviously they didn't much like poetry and thought it a waste of time. A lot 
of people might agree, judging from the fact that few poets can make a living 
off their words.</p>
<p>Journalist and author Russell Baker says most people think reading poetry is 
worse than carrying heavy luggage through O'Hare Airport. He himself gave 
it up 30 years ago, at least what he calls ``new'' poetry because, in his 
words, ``it began to read like coded messages passing between lonely aliens 
in a hostile world.''</p>
<p>Probably I'd not have paid much attention to the Bad Poetry Day publicity if 
I hadn't gone through some attic boxes the other day and found a whole 
batch of poems I wrote when I was a kid.</p>
<p>It was just like Russell Baker said. Those poems felt like coded messages 
passing between two aliens -- one, of this world, talking over time to one 
from another. I remembered a joke-poem from those early years:</p>
<p>I'm a poet, and my feet show it.</p>
<p>They are Longfellows.</p>
<p>Why does something like that stay on some scrap of paper in our minds, 
popping up word-for-word thirty years later?</p>
<p>I was a poet all right. A really, really bad one.</p>
<p>Those poems were so awful I'd have taken first prize in tomorrow's 
competition:</p>
<p>Standing on the promontory of death,</p>
<p>Despair slid icy fingers . . . </p>
<p>They got worse.</p>
<p>Most came from The Adolescent Angst school of poetry, but there were a 
few from an earlier period. Judging from the handwriting I'd say late 
elementary. Like this quasi-ballad:</p>
<p>We three went to the beach this summer</p>
<p>Me, my dad and the plumber.</p>
<p>The plumber goes because if it snows,</p>
<p>He can unfreeze the water tank.</p>
<p>We built a boat, but it sank.</p>
<p>That's just the opening verse. There are six more pages, each worse than the 
other. Another, shorter poem I'd titled ``Sick,'' written when I was in the 
third grade. It's dated, like a fine painting, and there are two copies 
paper-clipped together. One in pencil, almost illegible, another typed on my 
father's gray portable Royal. I recognized it in a flash. The bright blue ink. 
The way the white space inside the e's and g's were splotched and made 
little holes in the paper.</p>
<p>Seeing it sent a stab of nostalgia through me, and I heard the steady tap-tap, 
tap-tap-tap of my father typing his sermons as clearly as if it were coming 
from the next room instead of across half a century.</p>
<p>I must have asked him to type out the ``Sick'' poem. Here goes:</p>
<p>Boy I was sick and I mean it, too.</p>
<p>I wasn't so happy, I was really blue.</p>
<p>Wednesday night at three o'clock,</p>
<p>The clock was going Tick Tock, Tick Tock.</p>
<p>All of a sudden I woke up hot.</p>
<p>I had fever, I mean a lot.</p>
<p>My fever was a hundred and four,</p>
<p>And, man, I'm telling you</p>
<p>I didn't want any more.</p>
<p>Plus my throat was sore.</p>
<p>At first they thought I had larengytus</p>
<p>Oscar Wilde once said ``all bad poetry springs from genuine feeling,'' and 
he's right. As a great bad poet, I can vouch for it, but I am sure writing those 
poems wasn't as painful as reading them.</p>
<p>You have my permission to use my poems tomorrow on Bad Poetry Day, 
but do me a favor.</p>
<p>Leave my name out of it.</p>

<HEAD><TITLE>FALL CREEK FALLS WATERSHED AT RISK FROM STRIP-MINING</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="A Publication of News-Sentinel Online"></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>August 19, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>FALL CREEK FALLS WATERSHED AT RISK FROM STRIP-MINING</H2>

<I>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel columnist</I><P>
In his book``Agenda for Tomorrow,'' Stewart Udall, former U.S. secretary of the interior, said mining is like a search-and-destroy mission.<P>

   The image fits, and those of us who care about Fall Creek Falls State Park hate to even imagine what might happen if the Skyline Coal Company ``has its way'' with our park.<P>

   Save Our Cumberland Mountains (SOCM) -- a grassroots, mostly blue-collar organization with about 11 active chapters in East Tennessee and a membership of some 2,000 families all told -- is anxious for people to know what's in store for us if they do not win their petition to prevent any mining in the Fall Creek watershed.<P>

   It's a David-and-Goliath battle, so common in environmental wars. And as often happens, the problem is neither technically complicated nor scientifically debatable. Politics, not good sense or environmental savvy, calls the shots. Here's what is at stake as explained to me by several SOCM members:<P>

   One of the most toxically potent coal seams in the country is the Sewanee seam, which runs throughout much of the southern Cumberland Plateau. Many of SOCM's members live in that area and know what it means to have wells turn orange from acid mine drainage and to deal with economic and aesthetic results of strip-mining.<P>

   The problem with the Sewanee seam is that it is overlaid by a layer of Whitwell shale that contains high amounts of iron pyrites. When exposed to air and water it turns into a sulfuric acid, resulting in a rusty red water that is so toxic it can kill all aquatic life. Even decades after the mining stops and land has been ``restored,'' sulfuric acid continues to run off the disturbed seam. Mining operations along the Sewanee seam have left behind drainage so toxic and enduring that experts call it a ``perpetual pollution machine.''<P>

   Skyline Coal, a subsidiary of the second largest mining company in the world -- Cyprus Amax Minerals -- has leased rights to strip-mine outside the park, but within its watershed.<P>

   What is a watershed? <P>

   If a drop of water falls within a particular area and that drop of water eventually, by the topography of the land, ends up in a particular creek or river, that area is said to be within the creek or river's watershed. In Fall Creek Falls' case, it would be Fall Creek, Cane Creek and Piney Creek, all of which go to form the park's elaborate water activities and falls.<P>

   The precarious but potent effect of disturbing the Sewanee seam is demonstrated from time to time by ugly orange stains seen above the beautiful waterfall that gives the park its name. When the big lake within the park was built, some of the seam was disturbed accidentally.<P>

   In July 1995, SOCM filed a formal petition, according to Section 522 of the Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, asking that the watershed of Fall Creek Falls State Park be designated ``unsuitable for mining,'' in effect putting a KEEP OUT sign on it forever. A public hearing was held in December; a company in Oak Ridge called Lockwood Green contracted to do an environmental impact study.<P>

   When that study is complete, there will be another public hearing.<P>

   The good news is that while the study is going on there can be no strip-mining permits issued for that watershed.<P>

   The bad news is that this, like a lot of environmental standoffs, is a shootout between large companies with friends in high places and smaller, less ``connected'' groups.<P>

   Skyline is a corporate giant, and the political run-off of that reality is as potent as the poisons a strip mine can produce. Should SOCM win, Skyline says they will sue the federal government in a ``takings'' case -- the taking of potential profit from the 30,000 acres already leased.<P>

   If SOCM's struggle interests you, give them a call at 426-9455 or 426-9307. <P>

   The only way to win this petition is to get people across the state to say we do not want the watershed mined.<P>

ADOPTIVE INFORMATION TOPIC </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>It is tempting to pronounce judgment on controversial issues with which we 
have no personal experience. Living through an emotional crisis or 
circumstance tends, I think, to make us more tender-hearted and certainly 
more open-minded.</p>
<p>Most children at one point wonder if they are adopted. I suppose it's a fear 
their parents are keeping something from them or treating them differently 
from a brother or sister. Some even like the idea, the drama of a secret past 
-- at least for a while. Usually the question is fleeting, and often families even 
make jokes about it.</p>
<p>Other than this childish what-if, brief and never really believed, the only 
personal experience I myself have with adoption is recognizing what an 
excruciating act of love it would be to give up a baby. Probably few women 
who ever counted the little toes and watched the quiet breathing of her 
newborn have gotten very far into motherhood without thinking about what it 
would mean to lose a child.</p>
<p>Right now in Tennessee the issues surrounding our ``birthrights'' are a hot 
topic due to lawsuits attempting to overturn adoption laws. The questions the 
courts must decide are: Should adoption records be kept closed, or does 
everyone have the right to investigate his or her own background? What 
happens if a child wants contact with a birth-parent, but the birth-parent 
does not want to be contacted? Or vice versa?</p>
<p>My own children, and yours too, probably, have asked what I would do if 
there'd been a mix-up at the hospital and somewhere out there is my ``real'' 
son or daughter instead of the one I got by mistake. It's another of those 
what-if questions kids ask. I tell them I'd be curious, but nothing or nobody 
could persuade me THEY weren't my real children despite what a birth 
certificate or blood test proved. But all this is hypothetical.</p>
<p>I defer to a reader who knows both sides of the story by heart. She asks her 
name be withheld.</p>
<p>She was a young, unmarried girl in the 1950s when she got pregnant by her 
boyfriend. Most of us who remember the '50s can imagine what happened 
next. He dissolved into the woodwork, and her parents gave her one option. 
Go into hiding, then give the baby up. Which she did.</p>
<p>Years later she married, and soon after was told she was biologically unable 
to have any more children, so she and her husband adopted a little girl. In 
time and with new advances in medicine, she was able to have two other 
natural-born daughters.</p>
<p>Several years ago, she got a phone call from her first child, the son she gave 
up in her girlhood. He's a grown man now, with children of his own. She'd 
never told her daughters about their half-brother, but with devoted support 
from her husband and with everyone working hard, the son's family has been 
absorbed into her family. His adopted parents are dead and his siblings 
estranged. As it happened, his childhood had been chaotic and unhappy.</p>
<p>Her own adopted daughter has not expressed an interest in seeking 
information about her birth mother or father, but, as my reader puts it, should 
she decide to, ``I will help her in spite of my fears that I will be replaced in 
her heart.''</p>
<p>My reader says she has learned a lot about the adoption ``triangle'' and the 
primal, almost mythological, emotions involved on all sides.</p>
<p>``No matter how successfully the birth mother deals with her decision, a 
deep sorrow remains within, coupled with the strong desire to know about 
the child. I have also come to the conclusion that no adopted child feels 
complete, that the fantasy of rejection and the mystery of identity haunt even 
the most stable of adopted children.''</p>
<p>Yet, she writes, ``I am concerned about the right to privacy of all parties. I 
do not believe it to be wise that the adopted child's right to know be given 
such priority that the sensitivities of either the birth parent or the adoptive 
parents and their families become sacrificial.''</p>
<p>``I advocate . . . a system through which adoption information may be 
shared at a suitable age -- 21 seems reasonable -- by mutual consent of 
both the child and the birth parent.''</p>

COME TRUE COMPASSION </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>The Sunday school teacher was telling her class the story of Lot.</p>
<p>``Lot was warned to take his wife and flee out of the city, but his wife 
looked back and turned to salt . . . ''</p>
<p>The children sat in stunned silence.</p>
<p>``Any questions?'' the teacher asked.</p>
<p>``Yes,'' said one little girl. ``I was just wondering what happened to the flea.''</p>
<p>Which all goes to prove children should not just be seen. They should be 
heard. Their tender-hearted honesty can bore holes in our long-faced 
stories, and even make us look at old answers with new insight.</p>
<p>Take 9-year-old Jesse Morgan, for instance. His grandfather, Bill Morgan of 
Knoxville, sent me a poem young Jesse wrote, titled ``I have a Dream,'' and 
I pass it along. Here's Jesse's gift to us, just as he wrote it.</p>
<p>I have a dream for the world that there is peace and no fighting or 
massacring. There would be birds chirping, not screaming to guns hot death. 
There would be no polution or smoke. There would also be no racist or 
sexist people. It would be nice if we could build a porch, which we could sit 
on and drink tea and talk. We should treat our neighbors like out next-of 
kin.</p>
<p>I have a dream for myself that I would feed every hungry thing on the face of 
this earth. I would give people the most grand food. I would also ask the 
president of the U.S. for help. If Bill Clinton says, ``yes,'' I will have help. 
Then I would set it up. First, I will buy food. I would look like a big 
restaurant. People would arrive there. I would feed them many kinds of food 
like Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Asian, Mexican, Australian and 
many others. I would make contact with other kings. I will put a restaurant in 
the kings land. I hope everyone would never be hungry again.</p>
<p>Jesse's letter reminds me of the famous letter 10-year-old Samantha Smith 
wrote in 1982 to Soviet leader Yuri Andropov. In it she popped this 
question: Why do you want to conquer the whole world, or at least our 
country?</p>
<p>Samantha's letter got a personal response from Andropov and an invitation 
to come visit him and tour the Soviet Union as his guest.</p>
<p>Three years later, on August 25, 1985, at age 13, Samantha and her father 
were killed in a plane crash. In tribute to this child whose simple, sincere 
question softened hearts all over the world, an asteroid between Mars and 
Jupiter was named Samantha Smith in her memory.</p>

LUNCH, BUT PARKING . . . </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>The lady on the other end of the phone was spittin' mad. She'd just gotten a 
parking ticket in the Old City, and it wasn't that she couldn't afford the fine 
-- it was the principle of the thing.</p>
<p>``These merchants are sniveling about how people are too snooty or too set 
in their ways to come down and eat in their restaurants or shop in their 
stores. So we go. And either we have to nurse meters or pay lot fees. In 
other words, we have to pay money to park our cars so we can go pay 
more money to shop or eat.</p>
<p>``What do they expect? We got malls and restaurants we have to drive by to 
get there, and they offer free, convenient parking.''</p>
<p>She described in earthy detail how she circled the block and cruised two lots 
before finally finding a spot -- then when she was half out of her car, here 
comes a ``rabid'' attendant yelling at her that the place she had chosen was a 
reserved, monthly spot and she would have to move her car.</p>
<p>So, she and her friend decided ``to heck with visiting the Old City.'' They'd 
go downtown.</p>
<p>She stopped her ranting to take a couple gulps of air.</p>
<p>``Ha!'' she said so loud in the phone it made me jump. ``Did I find a place to 
park downtown?''</p>
<p>I waited for the answer, though I could have guessed.</p>
<p>``Sure. I could pay two, three, four bucks for the privilege of leaving my car 
while I go spend more money in the restaurants and stores folks downtown 
want me to come to. Or IF I wanted to play vulture and cruise around until I 
saw a car leaving a curb, and IF I could whip in before someone else beat 
me to it, I might find meter parking. IF I had enough quarters. Then, of 
course, if I stayed more than 15 minutes in some, an hour in others, I'd have 
to get up from my soup and sandwich and jog down to the meter and feed 
it.''</p>
<p>She took another breath and I held the phone a good two inches from my 
ear, just in case.</p>
<p>``So what did you do then?'' I asked. By now I was hooked by this little 
urban mystery and wanted to know how it ended.</p>
<p>``We went back to the Old City, thinking -- dumb us -- we'd get lucky and 
find a place to park without having to float a loan for it.''</p>
<p>And they did.</p>
<p>It was actually free. Or so they thought.</p>
<p>``We both checked the curb. Granted, it was dirty and cracked, but there 
was no yellow line that we could see. If there'd been one, it had worn off. 
So we gave each other a high five and padded off to eat at one of those 
places we heard was so wonderful . . . and wouldn't we suburbanites just 
give it a chance. Have you ever eaten in any of those places? Which ones? 
Where'd you park?''</p>
<p>I told her I often eat in the Old City and also at nearby Regas, which does in 
fact have a parking lot. Free. But she was on a roll.</p>
<p>This story isn't one of those where everybody rides off into the sunset, 
smiling. The good news is that they loved the restaurant, but the bad news 
begins shortly after they split the bill and left a tip.</p>
<p>``We walked around for a while, went into the shops, even bought some 
earrings and a thing of Godiva chocolates.''</p>
<p>Then one of them had to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>``There was no place to go. We asked in three shops, and either they don't 
go or else they didn't want us to use their facilities.''</p>
<p>They hurried back to their car, and, well, you know the rest. There on her 
windshield was one of those tell-tale manila envelopes.</p>
<p>``If the public library, the restaurants, the stores, the businesses want us to 
come downtown or uptown, to the Old City or the new, they'll have to do 
something about the parking before they see my smiley-face again. No 
wonder so many places have gone out of business.''</p>
<p>Then she hung up, which is just as well, because I didn't know what to say.

HILLARY, ELIZABETH </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>By the time you read this, Hillary Rodham Clinton will have made her first 
lady speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.</p>
<p>It's an important moment because the chatter-box pundits analyzing this 
presidential race are focusing not so much on the two candidates and/or their 
platform, but on the two wives.</p>
<p>Elizabeth vs. Hillary.</p>
<p>Either of whom, judging from their respective resumes and professional 
record, could be -- maybe even should be -- on the ballot instead of their 
husbands.</p>
<p>``We get as many requests for (Hillary) as for the president,'' one aide told 
reporters recently.</p>
<p>I've heard a number of people say, ``If it were Elizabeth instead of Bob, I'd 
vote for Dole.''</p>
<p>Of the two women, of course, Hillary Clinton is the most controversial. You 
either hate her or love her, and according to the polls, the people most apt to 
hate her are white males.</p>
<p>Even the fact that she wanted to keep her maiden name in use was seen as 
``uppity.''</p>
<p>Now Democrats are worried that Elizabeth Dole's stand-by-your-man 
speech in San Diego, done in the slick, talk-show-host style of a Dale 
Carnegie summa cum laude, will upstage any speech Hillary makes. To have 
Hillary gush at Bill and play coochie-coo wife would be out of character. To 
have her speak her own mind would make her seem pushy, masculine.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Dole, like Hillary Clinton, is a bright, attractive, savvy woman 
every bit as capable as her husband. Maybe even more. But she has learned 
something from Hillary's tenure as first lady, and that is that this country does 
not like bright, attractive, savvy women who are as capable as their 
husbands, particularly if those women are in the White House.</p>
<p>Unless of course she plays the come-fetch-sit lap dog, blinking up adoringly 
at her man -- something only Eleanor Roosevelt got by without doing, but 
she's been dead long enough for it to be safe even for white males to 
appreciate her on her own merit, not just as the-wife-of-.</p>
<p>I see her as the first feminist in the White House. Certainly she was ahead of 
her times. When FDR appointed Frances Perkins -- the first woman to hold 
a Cabinet position -- he got in a heap of trouble with some of his advisers. 
The idea of choosing a woman over a whole host of qualified men blew their 
minds. The trade unionist crowd stormed into the president's office and 
challenged the appointment on the spot.</p>
<p>The gossip in Washington the next morning was that Eleanor had put him up 
to it, and when he came out of the meeting she'd been waiting to cheer him 
on.</p>
<p>``It's OK,'' he told her. ``I'd rather have trouble with them for an hour than 
trouble with you for the rest of my life.''</p>
<p>Any historian can tell you the grief Eleanor Roosevelt took from cracks 
about her looks, her causes, her unlady-like posture, her outspoken way.</p>
<p>We prefer first ladies who are seen and not heard. At least not much, and 
only on certain topics.</p>
<p>It was OK for Lady Bird Johnson to take on ``ladylike'' projects like 
planting wildflowers along the nation's highways. Jacqueline Kennedy busied 
herself with fashion and antiques. Betty Ford did the breast cancer alert, 
even though some people thought it a bit crude for a first lady to talk about 
breasts. Especially her own. Nancy Reagan smiled and stayed thin.</p>
<p>Maybe the double message women get today can best be explained by a 
conversation a friend of mine overheard between her 4-year-old niece, 
Victoria, and a friend of hers who had come over to spend the afternoon.</p>
<p>``What shall we play?'' Victoria asked the other little girl. ``Power Rangers 
or Barbies?''</p>

SEEM TO BE FROM ABOVE </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, News-Senitnel columnist</em></p>
<p>This is the kind of story that can turn you into a good ``predestinating'' 
Presbyterian.</p>
<p>Some might call it fate. Others, coincidence or luck. But those who came to 
the Robert Eschman family reunion say it's a miracle.</p>
<p>The story begins in the late 1940s when Robert Eschman, a World War II 
veteran living in Oregon, came on hard times. His wife had abandoned him, 
job prospects were poor. When he came down with yellow fever, he saw 
no other option than to put his four small children up for adoption.</p>
<p>There were 4-year-old twins, Karon Sue and Sharon Lue; 2-year-old 
Robert David; and the baby Michael Patrick, who it would soon be 
discovered, is developmentally disabled.</p>
<p>Two years later, Karon, Sharon and Robert were adopted by Marion and 
Walter Dozler through a Linn County, Ore., agency. The Dozlers wanted 
Michael Patrick as well, but laws that seem outrageous by today's standards 
-- by any standards -- forbade the adoption of a mentally handicapped 
child. The older children, along with two other adopted siblings, grew up on 
the Dozler's farm in Stayton, Ore.</p>
<p>Michael Patrick spent the next 40 years in institutions and group homes.</p>
<p>Today Karon Dozler Boyd, 50, lives in Knoxville and works as a technical 
clerk at Pellissippi State. Her twin sister Sharon lives in Maynardville.</p>
<p>``I never tried to find my biological father while my adopted parents were 
alive,'' says Karon. ``I didn't want to hurt them. My father, Walter Dozler, 
died when I was a freshman in high school and my mother, Marion Dozler, 
passed away six years ago. It was then that I began searching.''</p>
<p>What she didn't know was that Robert Eschman had for four decades trying 
to find out what happened to the children he gave up. As his health declined 
in recent years, it had become an obsession. But there were roadblocks at 
every turn. Records had been sealed, agencies were backlogged, the cost of 
such a search was a problem, and the orphanage the Dozler children came 
from no longer existed.</p>
<p>This past April Karon wrote a letter to Linn County officials asking for help.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, through the efforts of a chaplain at a Veterans Affairs nursing 
home in Vancouver, Wash., where Robert Eschman had been given only a 
few months to live, another letter was written asking the Linn County judicial 
system to grant a dying man his final wish.</p>
<p>The two letters, though addressed to different judges and Karon's having 
been delayed in the mail, arrived on the same day and ended up, quite 
remarkably, on the same clerk's desk. She recognized the name and took 
both letters to the judge who then phoned Karon.</p>
<p>When Karon picked up the phone and heard, ``Is this Karon Dozler?'' she 
thought it was a phone salesmen.</p>
<p>``Yes. What have I won this time?''</p>
<p>``You have won a father,'' the judge told her.</p>
<p>The reunion was planned for the next week. Sharon and Karon would come 
from Tennessee, Bobby and Michael Patrick from Oregon. They would see 
their father for the first time in nearly 50 years. But as they were making their 
travel plans, Robert Eschman, 77, died.</p>
<p>``The chaplain told us it was as if he could at last relax, could let go,'' Karon 
explains. ``He knew his children were OK, that we had happy lives. The last 
thing I heard him say over the telephone was, `Karon Sue I love you,' and I 
said, `I love you, too' . . . .''</p>
<p>The children kept their travel plans, but instead of gathering for a reunion, 
they sat together under the canopy at Willamette National Cemetery in 
Portland.</p>
<p>``I wish we had found each other sooner,'' Karon says. ``But I think we all 
feel a sense of peace, of closure.''</p>
<p>Perhaps the chaplain's words at the funeral write the best caption for this 
story:</p>
<p>``Only God guided this.''</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>September 2, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>LABOR DAY HOLIDAY BACK THEN 
SHARED WITH NEIGHBORS</h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>September has always seemed to me more the month to celebrate the New 
Year than January.</p>
<p>September is the empty-spiral-notebook, sharpened-pencil, 
fresh-chore-chart month of new beginnings.</p>
<p>In some countries and in some religions, it is September, not January, which 
officially starts the New Year.</p>
<p>I am not sure what one is supposed to think about or do to properly observe 
Labor Day -- this happy September Monday when we get a day off that 
doesn't involve buying presents, going to church or remembering to send a 
card.</p>
<p>At one time in my life, Labor Day marked the annual block party. 
Arrangements were made with the police to put up barricades to keep the 
traffic out, and neighbors on both sides of the long block came out for a 
street party. Not only was it a gastronomic free-for-all, with everything from 
homemade peach ice cream to pickled okra, it was a kind of social 
smorgasbord as well -- a bear hug here, an introduction there.</p>
<p>Mamas bounced other people's babies on their laps, neighborhood dogs and 
cats eyed and sniffed each other, and as if by some unspoken rule, it never 
occurred to anybody's children to invite friends other than neighbors over. 
There was something family-reunion-like about those Labor Day gatherings 
-- a once-a-year bonding that crossed generation gaps, political differences, 
family styles and even personal quirks.</p>
<p>We were related, not by blood, but by address. </p>
<p>Even the neighborhood grouch not only came, but was almost pleasant.</p>
<p>Folks who'd moved away planned trips back to the party. For new 
neighbors, it was the equivalent of a receiving line. </p>
<p>Children rode their bikes and did cartwheels in the middle of the street 
without getting ``yelled at'' by their parents, and nobody was called to bed 
until it got so dark even yard lights and camping lanterns couldn't prolong the 
inevitable.</p>
<p>Older neighbors would hold court in their lawn chairs. The men would shoot 
baskets with each other's sons. A pickup game of roller bat might have a 
72-year-old pitcher and a 4-year-old at the plate. Teenagers took young 
kids on free piggyback rides, and the skateboarders in the crowd gave 
lessons to old folks brave enough to risk life and limb.</p>
<p>The women spread out the communion meal of Southern friendship, careful 
to include all the holy elements of that feast: fried chicken, deviled eggs, 
summer tomatoes, iced tea and watermelon, set out on wobbly card tables 
and prayed over by the youngest kid with enough courage to say the 
blessing in front of so many people. </p>
<p>Way into the evening, we'd sit swatting gnats and swapping family stories, 
turning our heads this way and that when the ``Mama, watch!'' or ``Daddy, 
look!'' belonged to us.</p>
<p>It is comforting to know that in scrapbooks and family movies all over the 
country those neighbors who moved into and out of each other's lives are 
still celebrating that happy time in the freeze-frame of a snapshot. I can't 
remember all the names, and some of the faces no longer even seem familiar.</p>
<p>We hear a lot about family values these days, and those Labor Day block 
parties serve in my mind as a kind of parable. There were all sorts of people 
in that neighborhood: old, young, black, white, gay, straight, single, married, 
healthy, handicapped, happy, miserable, successful and struggling, 
church-going, agnostic, popular, unpopular, preachers, prodigals, haves and 
have-nots, liberal, conservative, rich, not-so-rich.</p>
<p>We accepted -- even took for granted -- those differences, and one day a 
year in early September, felt to our bones how nice -- how easy, really -- it 
is to live in harmony.</p>

NEWSPAPER CARRIER LATELY? </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Huighs, News-Sentinel Columnist</em></p>
<p>The name Barney Flaherty probably doesn't ring a bell -- unless, perhaps, 
you belong to that rigorous fraternity of newspaper carriers whose alarm 
clocks go off in the wee hours of the morning, rain or shine, seven days a 
week.</p>
<p>Barney Flaherty was 10 years old when he became the country's first paper 
boy by answering an ad in The New York Sun on Sept. 4, 1883:</p>
<p>To the unemployed -- a number of steady men can find employment by 
vending the paper. A liberal discount is allowed to those who buy to sell 
again.</p>
<p>It is ironic that first in line for the job was not a ``steady man'' but an 
entrepreneurial kid. Many, if not most, carriers have been young boys 
following Barney's lead.</p>
<p>My own children had paper routes, and, let me tell you, it is hard, hard 
work. One Labor Day weekend when my son couldn't get a substitute, I 
took pity and offered to do the route for him. Of course it rained, and of 
course there were a kajillion holiday sale inserts. It's not that I can't walk and 
chew gum at the same time. It's that I can't pedal a bike uphill with 125 
papers in the saddle bags while stopping and starting every driveway to read 
off the wet, soggy, faded computer printout to see if they got one.</p>
<p>It's hard to throw like a girl on a boy's bike.</p>
<p>Dan Mashburn, director of circulation here at The News-Sentinel, says only 
a few papers across the country employ young people and/or their clumsy 
mothers.</p>
<p>``We have some 400 carriers, almost all of whom deliver by car or truck. 
Some who have apartment complexes have to walk, of course, but 
newspapers have gotten so large and bulky you can't handle them on a 
bike.''</p>
<p>Mashburn points out how most cities have dropped afternoon papers and 
having children out on the streets before daylight to deliver morning papers is 
not a good idea:</p>
<p>``Some of the carriers get up at 2 a.m. to begin their work, and the whole 
business has just gotten too complicated for kids to handle. Most of our 
carriers are retirees, housewives, college students, folks like that, and they 
average about 350 weekday papers and 425 Sunday papers.''</p>
<p>Mashburn calls his carriers the unsung heroes and heroines of the newspaper 
business, and it's true. About the only time they get their names in the papers 
they deliver is when it is bad news.</p>
<p>A recent story told of a carrier who was kidnapped, another whose car 
windows were shot out. But, says Mashburn, those incidents are rare. A 
more important story is the woman carrier who found a man unconscious on 
the floor and called for help, another interrupted a robbery, and the store 
clerk said if she hadn't showed up, no telling what would have happened.</p>
<p>For Raymond and Carolyn Perrigo there is more good news than bad in 
being a News-Sentinel carrier. Both are in their 50s. Raymond is disabled 
and Carolyn is self-employed as an antique dealer. Every morning they get 
up at 2:45 to work their route, which includes the area from Northshore 
Drive to Choto Road and the Rivendell subdivision -- about 275 weekday 
customers and 360 Sunday.</p>
<p>``The hardest part,'' says Raymond, ``is Sunday morning because we have 
to come back and get ready to go to Bible class. We can't go back to 
sleep.''</p>
<p>There was this one awful morning when his foot slipped on the brake as he 
reached down for a paper to put in a box and his truck ran into a ditch; and 
during the big blizzard in '93, he missed one day -- but other than those two 
bad memories, he can't think of any real drawback to his job.</p>
<p>``A few folks on our route have special needs, and I put their paper at the 
back door, but I don't mind. I understand, being disabled myself. I treat my 
folks nice, and they treat me nice. Especially at Christmas.</p>
<p>``The best thing about the route is how beautiful and peaceful it is in the 
morning. I love seeing the little animals, and the sunrises! You wouldn't 
believe how beautiful they are.''</p>

<HEAD><TITLE>GRANDCHILDREN, THIS IS A SPECIAL MESSAGE OF LOVE</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><A HREF="/"><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="A Publication of News-Sentinel Online" BORDER=0></A><center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>September  7, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>GRANDCHILDREN, THIS IS A SPECIAL MESSAGE OF LOVE</H2>

About this time last year I took part in a Grandparents Day assembly at Webb School. Although I am not yet myself a grandmother, many of my friends are and I know the special place children hold in the minds and hearts of these once-removed parents. <P>

   Joyce Benziger, a Webb School grandmother, also took part in that assembly, and anything any of the rest of us did on that program was upstaged by her comments. I asked Benziger if I could have a copy of her remarks to pass along to readers on Grandparents Day 1996 -- which, incidentally is Sunday, Sept. 8. She was nice enough to say yes. Here they are, with a few minor alterations to fit the occasion.<P>

   Her remarks read like a love letter from all grandparents to their grandchildren: <P>

   `` . . . There was nothing we could do to hurry up or delay the arrival of all you grandchildren out there. It was an event determined by our own children, a gift, really.<P>

   ``But on that day you were born, we celebrated the occasion which immediately changed our family role from parent to grandparent. Your birth bestowed on us a new title, plus the right to brag on you, to encourage you, to spoil you -- then send you home for correcting -- and to love you fiercely all the time. <P>

   ``Babies are like gemstones added to our family treasure, not to be hoarded but shared by four different grandparents bound up in a special kinship. You are only one-fourth of each of us, yet in you we see that part of ourselves which has been kept hidden in the playhouse attic of childhood memories.<P>

   ``Like the song, you are our sunshine. You have made us happy even when the rain falls on our parade. Your first baby sounds were vowels which grandparents interpreted as a toothless declaration of `I love you,' and they repeated it back. That mutual exchange of affection across two generations expanded as you grew and listened to our stories and songs. <P>

   ``We read your favorite poetry book until you could show us the pictures and repeat the nursery rhymes from memory. You still like to hear us tell about what you did when you were growing up, about your coming down backward on the slide, how you always splashed water out of the wading pool, how Grandpa taught you to use a hammer and saw, about your first trike or bike, baby doll or baseball card.<P>

   ``Grandchildren make us feel that we are just right. We are the right size, we wear the right clothes and shoes, we live in houses that are just right for the family to come for Thanksgiving dinner. Our kitchens usually smell like buttered toast or baked macaroni and cheese. But not junk food. Our spoons and rolling pins were your favorite toys when you learned to cook by stirring cake batter and rolling out ginger cookies. Now you astonish us by microwaving dinner . . . .<P>

   ``As you grow up we are in the stands watching you at sports or in the audience for a play or dance program, listening to a music recital and sometimes helping with homework. Throughout your activities we are re-living our own memories, and you keep us busy filling the gas tank to drive you somewhere. We share your life by listening, talking, laughing with you . . . .<P>

   ``No one wants more for you that we do. Say yes to your future -- without tobacco, guns, or foolish prejudices. Although your lives will have different challenges, this older generation today can tell you the importance of family values that will help guide you morally and spiritually.<P>

   ``We are there to help pick up the pieces when hearts break because things go wrong. Over the years we may have lost our laps for cuddling, yet we still have strong arms and shoulders for big hugs and loud applause.<P>

   ``We remember -- and someday so will you -- that who you are and what you become depends in part on your ancestors . . . that the patina of life's experiences turns  grandparents into `professionals' . . . after all, we are growing up with you -- for the third time!''<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>RANDOM MEMORIES OF OCEAN DAYS WASH IN WITH HURRICANE</TITLE>

<TD WIDTH=470><H2>RANDOM MEMORIES OF OCEAN DAYS WASH IN WITH HURRICANE</H2>

Those of us who know the beaches of North and South Carolina watched the news with queasy excitement as Fran blew through Thursday night. The god of hurricanes answered the prayers muttered under people's breath in Charleston as they sawed plywood and taped windows.<P>

   But the same god threw a dart into the point on the map that holds my summer memories for some 50 years. Wrightsville Beach, N.C., just up from Southport and a little over from Cape Fear -- two names the weather people kept mentioning. In fact, the guy from the National Hurricane Center even mentioned Bolivia, though the percentage of people who have ever heard of Bolivia, N.C. -- let alone been there -- are a couple of zeros right of the dot.<P>

   Bolivia, no offense meant, is not even a wide place in the road on the way up or down U.S. Highway 17 to whichever beach you pick: Myrtle, Garden City, Holden, Long, Carolina . . . and Wrightsville.<P>

   I had to smile when the national news trucks and Yankee reporters lined up outside Cappies Restaurant in Calabash, above North Myrtle Beach. <P>

   About the only excitement Calabash ever sees is a grease fire in one of their deep fat fryers. I once heard there were 32 seafood restaurants there. Heck, I bet there aren't that many full-time residents. I don't know why crab cakes or butterfly shrimp tastes better if it's cooked in Calabash, but ask anybody who has been there: Mouth water at just the word ``Calabash.'' The whole town smells like Wesson oil and fish nets.<P>

    Once when the kids were little, we made one of our annual pilgrimages down from Wrightsville to Calabash. Our daughter, McNair, had not wanted to leave Knuckles, our dog, alone at the beach house. She had cajoled us into taking him along: ``You said it was a family trip. Knuckles is a member of this family same as me.''<P>

   Of course we had to leave the dog in the car with the windows cracked while we did our hush-puppy-fried-oysters thing, and halfway through the meal, McNair decided she was through with her french fries and Jello . . . an aberrant gene somewhere in her makeup had left her hating seafood.<P>

   She decided she would rescue Knuckles and take him for a walk around Calabash. In a few minutes came this commotion outside, a combination of lion roars and tiny yelps. Then I heard McNair.<P>

   ``Heeeeelllllllppppp.''<P>

   People ran to the windows, and we rushed outside and found McNair and Knuckles cowering together on top of the car, while a pack of wild dogs -- some of them as big as our Blazer -- bared their teeth and circled their prey.<P>

   The gene pool finally kicked in, and McNair grew out of her dislike and distrust of food that looks like it belongs in a jar of formaldehyde in a medical school -- but to this day she is afraid of large dogs, especially ones that drool.<P>

   Spencer Christian spent Friday morning giving his ``Good Morning America'' weather report from Bradley Creek, just outside of Wilmington on the Wrightsville Beach road. He could have been in Kalamazoo. All they showed was his face, and it was torture to know he was there at Bradley Creek and not be able to see what was going on at Bradley Creek.<P>

   Why do television reporters do that? Go somewhere for an on-the-scene report, and all that's seen is them standing there telling you where they are.<P>

   The last word I got from Wrightsville is that the waves at Johnny Mercer's pier were 20 feet, but this was from the same TV voice that called Edisto Beach ``a-DIS-tow,'' so I don't know if I can trust him. I guess that means the Coke bottle we hid in the dunes under the pier won't be there next year when we go to dig it up.<P>

   Don't laugh. I've done that since I was 5, and once it was right where I'd put it the summer before.<P>

PORNOGRAPHY? </h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>BOOK BANS GO ON Happy Birthday today to David Herbert Lawrence. 
Who is he?</p>
<p>The ``David Herbert'' might have you fooled, but if I said D.H. Lawrence 
you'd know right away who I was talking about. He would have been 101 
today had he not died in 1930.</p>
<p>Lawrence is the author of the now-classic-but-used-to-be-nasty ``Lady 
Chatterley's Lover'' -- a book I was reprimanded by both my parents and 
English teacher for reading when I was in about the ninth grade.</p>
<p>My parents didn't want me reading it for the same reason they wouldn't let 
me see ``From Here To Eternity'' a few years earlier.</p>
<p>My English teacher said it was inappropriate for high school and guarded the 
school library in case any contraband copies got brought in.</p>
<p>We had two tattered copies that made the rounds and without exception, 
every girl in my class read it cover to cover.</p>
<p>Of course now we don't see much of a problem with D.H. Lawrence. In fact 
most literature courses would include Lawrence in their list of English 
novelists educated people should recognize by name.</p>
<p>As for ``From Here To Eternity,'' it has less to object about than most 
Saturday morning cartoons.</p>
<p>Censorship is always a sticky wicket.</p>
<p>During the 1995-96 school year, there were a record-breaking 475 attacks 
on curricula, library and textbooks used by our public schools across the 
country. Most of the challenges were based on sexual content and one-third 
of the 475 incidents either directly involved national, state or local 
religious-right political organizations, or appeared to be inspired by this 
group. States with the highest number of incidents were California, 
Pennsylvania, Florida, Texas and Ohio.</p>
<p>A list of books considered too ``dirty'' to have in the schools include, almost 
without exception, books considered by educators to be worthwhile 
classics. It's the teachers and librarians, after all, who pick them out.</p>
<p>I taught junior and senior high English for a number of years, and these 
books regularly appeared on summer reading lists in one grade or another -- 
except for Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and Men,'' which was included in the 
curriculum.</p>
<p>The list of most-challenged books include:</p>
<ul>
<li>``I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings'' by Maya Angelou.</li>
<li>``Of Mice and Men'' by John Steinbeck.</li>
<li>``The Catcher in the Rye'' by J.D. Salinger.</li>
<li>``The Canterbury Tales'' by Geoffrey Chaucer.</li>
<li>``The Color Purple'' by Alice Walker.</li>
<li>``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' by Mark Twain.</li>
<li>``Native Son'' by Richard Wright.</li>
<li>``Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret'' by Judy Blume.</li>
<li>``The Chocolate War'' by Robert Cormier.</li>
<li>``Bridge to Terabithia'' by Katherine Paterson.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Volusia County, Fla., parents objected to Angelou's book being read in 
an 11th grade English class because ``it endorsed sexual activity outside of 
marriage, promoted cohabitation, contained homosexuality and was 
anti-religious.'' One parent, insisting racial prejudice had nothing to do with 
it, called it a ``trash book.''</p>
<p>Here in Tennessee, the Tennessee Eagle Forum and a number of parents 
objected to the sex education and disease prevention portions of the 
``Lifetime Wellness Resource Manual'' -- a reference used by high school 
teachers for teaching about male and female reproductive organs. Objectors 
claimed it took an impersonal, clinical attitude towards sex and lists 
abstinence as one of several ways to prevent disease -- not the only way. 
One member in the banning group disliked the notion implied that ``sex is a 
normal, developmental sequence in a maturing individual.''</p>
<p>You don't know whether to laugh or cry, but I do know this: D.H. Lawrence 
is turning over in his grave, and Lady Chatterley is muttering that truth is 
indeed stranger than fiction.</p>

<HEAD><TITLE>LAWSON MCGHEE LIBRARY OUTSHINES ONE IN LARGER CITY</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><A HREF="/"><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="A Publication of News-Sentinel Online" BORDER=0></A><center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>September 14, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>LAWSON MCGHEE LIBRARY OUTSHINES ONE IN LARGER CITY</H2>

On the first page of the just-out Knox County Public Library System's annual report, Library Services Director Patricia L. Watson quotes the futurist John Scharr: ``The future is not some place we are going to but one we are creating.''<P>

   In recent years of budget crunches and allocation cuts, not to mention the ground shift in technology and operational expenses, the Knox County Library System has been like the Little Engine That Could.<P>

   I have been a public library junkie for as long as I can remember.<P>

   My children grew up on the story hours the branch library in our neighborhood held on Wednesday afternoons. Whenever papers were due at school or we were planning a trip, the first place we went was to the library. As a journalist, I depend on the library for reference material and periodicals which would cost me thousands of dollars to purchase myself. I get my name as fast as I can on best-sellers I want to read bad enough not to wait on the paperback, but not bad enough to buy the hard-cover edition.<P>

   Every two weeks I get a new, unabridged book-on-tape that I keep in the cassette player of my car. Whenever I turn on the ignition, a wonderful storyline is picked up and I am off to P.D. James' England or Anne Rivers Siddens' Atlanta.<P>

   It lowers your blood pressure in traffic, I promise you. On long trips, it's a godsend.<P>

   Recently I was visiting friends in another city and needed to do some work over the weekend, so I asked them to drop me and my laptop off at the downtown public library for the morning while they shopped. I was amazed at how much better, how much more accessible and complete Knoxville's Lawson McGhee library is than the one I visited -- even though it was in a larger city.<P>

   After reading this year's annual report for our library system, I realize the reason for this is because Patricia Watson and her staff of unsung heroes really believe what John Scharr said about the forward focus and vision needed to secure the future. Five years ago, for example, the Knox County Public Library System became the second metropolitan library in the state to automate. Over 650,000 items in 17 locations were bar-coded, which for some of the staff meant going from point-zero computer skills to expert.<P>

   Today you can dial into the system from your own computer at home. This past June, the library had its ribbon-cutting celebration for KORRnet -- the Knoxville-Oak Ridge Regional Network, a community-owned freenet for any area residents with a computer and modem (http://www.korrnet.org/). KORRnet volunteers working in tandem with staff help non-profit organizations create their own World Wide Web sites.<P>

   But our library system's track record isn't just measured in bytes and chips.<P>

   For the second consecutive year, Knox County residents have given our public library system the highest rating of any service provided by county government. A survey conducted by the Department of Political Science at UT showed that 61 percent of the population used the library, and of those who used it, 97 percent gave high marks to services and staff. All this on a total operating expenditure of $5,423,711.47, according to the annual report.<P>

   Here what else I learned from the report:<P>

   There are 135,045 registered library cards in the system. During the year, the Reference Department fielded 351,182 questions, and over 42,000 children attended special programs provided by the Knox County Public Library System.<P>

   Through the system you and I own 700,000 books, not including uncataloged paperbacks.<P>

   And even if I put my cassette player on fast forward and read a book a day, it would take me longer than the rest of my life to work my way through the stash of 18,196 audio offerings our library has.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>`HIKE FOR HEALING' IS SCHOOLTEACHER'S CONTRIBUTION TO CANCER RESEARCH</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><A HREF="/"><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="A Publication of News-Sentinel Online" BORDER=0></A><center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>September 16, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>`HIKE FOR HEALING' IS SCHOOLTEACHER'S CONTRIBUTION TO CANCER RESEARCH</H2>

For Ellen Wolfe, ``someday'' has finally come. ``I've been wanting to hike the Appalachian Trail ever since I was a kid growing up in New Hampshire,'' says the former Knoxville public schoolteacher.<P>

    ``This time I'm going to do it.''<P>

   Wolfe, 44, says she planned to hike the trail after graduating from college, but marriage and kids came first.<P>

   ``Someday,'' she told herself. ``When the kids are grown.''<P>

   But then jobs interfered, although she tried to save up enough sick days and vacation to take off. That didn't work either.<P>

   After teaching for nine years in the Knoxville public schools, Wolfe decided it was now or never. So, she quit her job and moved to Cookeville where she is a member of the adjunct faculty of both Tennessee Tech and Volunteer State Community College.<P>

    She has arranged to take six months off next year to hike the Appalachian Trail.<P>

   No more ``somedays.''<P>

   Fulfilling a lifelong personal dream is not the only reason Wolfe wants to do this.<P>

    She is turning the project into what she calls a ``hike for healing'' on behalf of breast cancer.<P>

    She also plans to write a book for children and teachers on where they can access the trail in their area and what to look for.<P>

   ``All of the books I have read about the trail have been for adults, and it is so wonderful and necessary, really, for young people to learn about the outdoors, to appreciate their relationship to things in it. How can they take care of the Earth if they don't experience it?''<P>

   She will begin her trip on March 1, 1997, leaving from Springer Mountain, Ga., and arriving at Mount Katahdin in Maine -- 2,100 miles away -- by mid-August.<P>

   ``In a way you could say I am walking home, so . . . the hike will symbolize the connection between my life in the South where I have lived for the past 25 years and my native New England.''<P>

   She is especially interested in her trip as a teaching project.<P>

   ``I will research and write about accessible sections of the trail where teachers and parents can take their students for authentic geography lessons related to the Geography Standards, knowledge they can use and which will last them a lifetime.''<P>

   But most importantly, says Wolfe, she is using the hike to raise money for breast cancer research, and her project has received the blessing of the Knox County Unit of the American Cancer Society. <P>

   Other than minimum expenses for equipment and supplies, Wolfe will donate all money raised to the American Cancer Society for breast cancer research:<P>

   ``I imagine that you, like me, have seen an increasing number of colleagues, family and friends stricken with breast cancer . . . (it) strikes women of all ages, in all cultures, and of all regions. My grief for their suffering, coupled with an awareness of my risk as a 44-year-old woman grateful for good health, has led me to make this commitment.''<P>

   Her mother had cancer, and three weeks before Christmas last year, her best childhood friend was diagnosed with breast cancer.<P>

   She says she is not a bit afraid of traveling the trail alone.<P>

    Friends from time to time will join her for portions of the hike, and she knows she will meet fellow travelers along the way -- but she sees this as something she wants to do by and with herself, for others.<P>

   It is her way of contributing to the dream that someday breast cancer will be eradicated.<P>

   Donations are tax deductible and payable to Breast Cancer Research Program/American Cancer Society. Checks and correspondence should be mailed to Hike for Healing, 3623 Bartlett Drive, East Lake Estates, Cookeville, Tenn., 38506.<P>

BE; FOR WHICH GIVE THANK</h2>
<p><em>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel Columnist</em></p>
<p>Seems useless to talk about anything but football this week, so here's a little 
pre-game warm up to pass the time before Florida bites the dust.</p>
<p>Tailing back -- Football, as we all probably know, didn't come over on the 
Mayflower, but it is a New World variation on English football, soccer and 
rugby. A Yankee game. Arguably the first game of football as we came to 
know it was in 1869 when Princeton took on Rutgers. Princeton players 
were known for amending the rules as they went along, so by 1880 Yale 
came out with the first book of official rules. Finding nothing in that rule book 
that said the kick-off meant giving the ball to the other team, a Princeton 
kicker once kicked the ball to himself and ran for a touchdown inside a wall 
of arm-linked teammates. Princeton also invented the ``block game'' and 
ended up holding the ball for an entire half. After that, ``kick-off'' was 
redefined, and ``downs'' were invented.</p>
<p>By 1909 football had become so rough it was almost banned because so 
many players were getting themselves killed -- 27 died that year, and 
hundreds were seriously wounded. Boxer John L. Sullivan went on record 
as saying, ``There's murder in that game!''</p>
<p>A sacking, a forward passout and one very offensive score: The all-time 
worst college team may be the Beavers of the California Institute of 
Technology. Although Cal Tech ranks academically at the top of colleges 
and universities in this country, they were in remedial football -- said to be 
the only team where IQs were higher than body weight. The average student 
at Cal Tech has an IQ of 140, something reflected here in their official 
football cheer:</p>
<p>Secant, cosine, tangent, sine</p>
<p>Logarithm, logarithm, Hyperbolic sine</p>
<p>3 point 1 4 1 5 9, slipstick, sliderule,</p>
<p>TECH TECH TECH.</p>
<p>In 1967 so few Cal Tech students tried out for the team, football was 
dropped from the program.</p>
<p>Bad as they were, the worst football defeat was on Oct. 7, 1916, and it 
wasn't a Cal Tech game.</p>
<p>It was big-time Georgia Tech against little Cumberland College. At Tech.</p>
<p>Some of the Cumberland players got cold feet and went ``AWOL'' when 
the train stopped over in Nashville. The final score was 222 to zip.</p>
<p>One Cumberland player, so the story goes, fumbled the ball and yelled to his 
teammate, ``Pick up the ball!'' </p>
<p>``You pick it up,'' his teammate yelled back. ``You're the one who dropped 
it.''</p>
<p>Heisman he wasn't: ``I never made the team. I was not heavy enough to play 
the line, not fast enough to play halfback, and not smart enough to be a 
quarterback.'' So said Richard M. Nixon.</p>
<p>Running back to replay: Vince Lombardi of Green Bay Packers fame is 
often quoted as saying, ``Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing,'' which 
is not exactly the same thing as what he actually said: ``Winning isn't 
everything, but wanting to win is.''</p>
<p>I (as in ``idiot'') formation: An old Joe Namath/ Bear Bryant story as told by 
former Clemson Coach Frank Howard has Bear talking to his troops at the 
beginning of the season:</p>
<p>``This is a class operation,'' he tells them. ``I want your shoes to be shined. I 
want you to have a tie on, get your hair cut and keep a crease in your pants. 
I also want you to go to class. I don't want no dumbbells on this team. If 
there is a dumbbell in the room, I wish he would stand up.''</p>
<p>Namath rose to his feet.</p>
<p>``Joe,'' says Bear, ``how come you're standing up? You ain't dumb.''</p>
<p>Namath replied, ``Coach, I just hate like the devil for you to be standing up 
there by yourself.''</p>
<p>Unsportsmanlike conduct: In 1865 Andrew White became the first president 
of Cornell, and as a strict academician refused permission for their football 
team to travel to a game against Michigan: ``I will not permit thirty men to 
travel four hundred miles to agitate a bag of wind.''</p>
<p>GO VOLS.</p>

<font size=5>I</font>f cleanliness really is next to godliness, a recent study could be used to 
back up claims that we are becoming a nation of heathens. </p>
<p>The breaking news story came this week when the dirty truth was 
announced at the American Society for Microbiology in New Orleans. 
Teams of researchers lurked in the shadows of restrooms across the country 
and discovered only 68 percent of us wash our hands after going to the 
bathroom. </p>
<p>Before the troops went out into the latrines, so to speak, they did a 
telephone survey, phoning thousands of people across the land to ask if they 
washed their hands every time they used the toilet -- and 94 percent said 
they did. </p>
<p>Which should come as no surprise. </p>
<p>If someone asked you that question, can you imagine any other answer than, 
''Yuk. Of course I do'' -- that is, if you didn't hang up first. I hate those 
survey calls and most of the time I'm not as polite as I'd like people to think I 
am. I doubt I'd be very cooperative about such a personal question over the 
phone. </p>
<p>Sounds like dirty-old-man talk to me. </p>
<p>Which reminds me of something that happened when I was a kid. About age 
3 or 4, I guess. </p>
<p>My mother had been trying to teach me how a lady always closes the 
bathroom door when she goes in, even if she's in a hurry. Our bathroom was 
in the downstairs hall and when I ran in from play, it was so easy to forget 
such niceties of proper ''nose powdering.'' </p>
<p>One morning after being scolded for the umpteenth time for not closing the 
door, I was sitting in the yard sulking for being so soundly reprimanded. </p>
<p>Near my house was a large college campus, and the president of the college 
-- a very stern, dignified gentleman -- went for his morning walk around the 
block, which mean he passed by our house that morning just as I plopped 
myself on the grass and mumbled about how mean my mother was. </p>
<p>I decided to do my own survey. </p>
<p>''Do you always close the bathroom door when you go to the bathroom?'' I 
asked Mr. College President as he strolled by. </p>
<p>Years later, when I was a bridesmaid in a college friend's wedding, an 
elderly gentleman came up to me at the reception, smiled a proper smile, 
then leaned over and whispered in my ear: ''Do you always close the door 
when you go to the bathroom?'' </p>
<p>For a minute I felt like what I would have felt like if I'd gotten one of those 
phone calls from some stranger wanting to know if I washed my hands after 
using the toilet . . . </p>
<p>. . . which of course I do. </p>
<p>Sometimes I subconsciously chant the little poem my mother taught me to 
say when she helped with those early-on lessons in hygiene: </p>
<p>Dry hands together, be friends forever. </p>
<p>According to the survey of 6,333 people in five major cities who were 
watched as they used the restroom, women tend to be more tidy, more 
careful about hand-washing. The worst case of forgetfulness was at a Braves 
game in Atlanta where only 64 percent of folks washed their hands. The 
cleanest people were at Chicago's Navy Pier where bathroom monitors 
reported 78 percent had washed. </p>
<p>Several years ago when I went through training as a hospice volunteer, we 
were told the most important thing a person can do to stay healthy is to wash 
his or her hands. It's more important than vitamins, masks or flu shots. </p>
<p>Cheaper, too. </p>
<p>According to the sponsors of ''Operation Clean Hands'' -- which include 
Bayer Pharmaceuticals -- how you wash is as important as when. They pass 
along some tips on how to do it right, which seems silly for something so 
basic, but here they are: Use warm or hot running water, antibacterial soap. 
Wash wrists, palm, back of hands, fingers and under the nails, rubbing hands 
together for at least 10-15 seconds. Dry from forearms towards hands and 
fingertips. </p>
<p>. . . and don't forget to close the door. </p>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>T</font>he woods outside my window have rushed the season a bit, but I don't 
mind. </p>
<p>They've sprayed themselves with the musk and mint of winter's coming. 
Leaves are starting to wrinkle with age. A few have fallen before their time, 
and the rest have turned that last-hurrah, laid-back green of retirement. </p>
<p>In the mornings the river at the bottom of my hill looks gray and moves slow 
under the wisp of fog and dawn's early slow-simmer light. The two herons 
that make beautiful but noisy neighbors have a new, less-lazy lift in their 
takings off, a smoother glide to their landings -- as if they feel in their bones, 
as I do in mine, the spunk of fall. </p>
<p>It's official now. </p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of autumn. </p>
<p>This has been my first summer in my house. Last May I moved from an 
apartment on Middlebrook Pike to a small forty-something basement 
rancher in Louisville, on the water and in the woods. My children say I need 
to name the house, but I'm not all that keen on the idea, mostly because I'd 
never come up with one that said it all. Ivy Hill. Turtle Hollow. Summer 
Trees. Pine Haven. Hidden Haunt. Treehouse. </p>
<p>Nah. It's too hard to decide. They all fit. </p>
<p>Living in the country is like living inside one of those shake-up paperweights. 
Something always seems to be swirling around you. </p>
<p>In summer it's the jitterbug of a jillion leaves, seldom left to their own devices 
because even on hot, still days in town, breezes come up from the water and 
set the woods to dancing. </p>
<p>At night there's the glub, glub of life stirring under the water and along the 
shore, the shadow puppet shows moths and other fluttering creatures 
perform in the porch light and against the moon while everyone's asleep. </p>
<p>People pay psychiatrists big money, invest in all sorts of white-noise 
machines to get the kind of inner quiet that comes from sleeping with the 
windows open in a summertime river-wood. It's like camping on a 
Posturepedic. The whole world turns into a sanctuary, a place more holy 
than any pilgrimage or prayer rug could divine for us. </p>
<p>Even the hum of the cicada, this year louder than I've ever heard it, follows a 
peace piper's score in my woods, by the river. </p>
<p>Now I am going to spend my first fall inside that stained-glass-window 
world. Everything I do I'll do inside the prism of changing light ricocheting off 
the Earth in its autumnal equinox. </p>
<p>Never before now have I paid as much attention to spiders and the transient 
intricacies of their webs. I wish I were that optimistic, that dependable, that 
persistent. Each morning there are new lace houses, freshly spun and 
catching the morning light as it hits the eaves on all sides. We study each 
other, the spiders and I, for long minutes before one of us darts off, then 
meet up again the next day like old friends. A workman the other day told 
me he saw a brown recluse spider, which makes me a little nervous. But 
beauty always comes with a price, so I'll just keep on respecting their 
privacy -- but keep the broom handy just in case. </p>
<p>This week a new member of the family came to share my woods and my 
home with me: </p>
<p>A 9-week-old black lab puppy names Babe. </p>
<p>''Roberta's Gold Ribbon Babe'' is her AKC title. The breeder -- Roberta 
Williams of Sharp Hollow kennels in Sevierville -- tags her pups by putting a 
ribbon around their neck, a different color for each puppy in the litter. The 
''baby'' I fell in love with had a gold tag, and that's how she got her name. </p>
<p>Babe is great company for me on these early morning walks over the river 
and through the woods. It's wonderful to explore the world with someone so 
appreciative of things you and I never even notice, or fail to find joy in, or 
treat as so very ordinary: a hunk of new moss; the way rain feels when it first 
starts up; the shapes and smells of fresh-cut wood; the crunch of gravel; the 
nudges of winter from just around the corner. </p>
<p>And all the other spicy surprises of this new-old season that graces so 
amazingly the woods here in East Tennessee. </p>

<p><!--dateline--><br>
<font size=5>I</font> wonder if Charles Pierce was watching the game Saturday, along with the 
record-setting crowd in Neyland Stadium and Lord only knows how many 
people on their TV sets. </p>
<p>And I am sure the Lord knows, because he was watching from up there 
above the big Kroger blimp. </p>
<p>Too bad he was not wearing orange. </p>
<p>My daughter called from Texas with pure pain in her voice during the half. </p>
<p>''What's the MATTER down there?'' she wanted to know, as if it were our 
fault for not cheering the players on. She called back a few minutes into the 
second half, her voice hopeful. </p>
<p>But I wonder if Charles Pierce was watching. </p>
<p>Pierce has a lead article in this month's issue of GQ magazine which he titles, 
simply, ''Balls.'' </p>
<p>It's about Peyton Manning. </p>
<p>He says Peyton is a shoe-in for the Heisman Trophy this season unless ''he 
gets injured or General Grant comes back through Tennessee.'' </p>
<p>General Grant didn't rise from the grave, although John Sevier and James 
White may have turned over in theirs. It was a gaggle of Gators who came 
storming through Tennessee, not a Union soldier. </p>
<p>Pierce, of course, wrote his piece probably months before this year's Florida 
game, but he talks about last year's Florida game as somewhat of a fluke in 
Manning's career and a case of bad luck for University of Tennessee 
football. Pierce hints it might have been the rain that came in last year's 
second half. </p>
<p>He gives that Florida game one sentence in his article, then moves right along 
to Manning's performance against Ohio State in January's bowl game and, in 
Pierce's words, ''truth be told, marked the beginning of the 1996 season, in 
which Tennessee is nearly as solid a favorite for the national championship as 
Manning is to win John Heisman's trophy.'' </p>
<p>Maybe it was the rain (again), maybe it was the coaching, maybe it was the 
line, maybe it was an off day for Manning. Who knows. </p>
<p>Pierce tells a few stories about how Manning's feet have grown to fit his 
legendary father's cleats, how he considered going to Michigan, how glad his 
dad was he did not: </p>
<p>''I sensed pretty quickly that Peyton wasn't going to Ole Miss,'' Archie 
Manning told Pierce. ''What I was afraid of was that, in running away from 
Ole Miss, he might run away from the entire South.'' </p>
<p>After Pierce puts Manning -- and UT -- up on the fer shure list, the rest of 
the article is about Archie Manning and ''the South'' for which he played: </p>
<p>''It can be fairly said that Archie Manning became a hero to an entire state 
full of people, many of whom didn't deserve the likes of him.'' </p>
<p>Archie Manning's South was the Mississippi of the 1960s, a place where, 
Pierce points out, patrolmen beat up blacks and people blew up little 
children in churches. Drew, Miss., where Archie Manning's father Buddy 
(''big and bluff and well-loved around town'') ran a farm-machinery shop is 
near the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman -- a place of such 
''mythic horror'' it scared so badly young Riley B. King when he went to visit 
an uncle that he moved to Memphis, took up guitar lessons and changed his 
name to B.B. </p>
<p>''There were 20 guys on my football team,'' Archie Manning told Pierce, 
''and six of them came from Parchman.'' </p>
<p>Pierce points out that Archie's was ''the next-to-last Mississippi football 
class to play all four seasons without a black teammate . . .'' and that it was 
Archie, walking into the house on a visit home his junior year, who 
discovered the body of his father. Depressed over ill health and financial 
problems, Buddy Manning put a gun to his head and killed himself. </p>
<p>Pierce concludes his article by saying Archie deserves this ''golden boy'' son, 
that there is sweet irony that his son is a football star in another kind of South 
and that one of his teammates ''is a black kid from Dayton with a great name 
like Peerless Price.'' </p>

				<FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>y column on book banning brought a number of letters from readers, all wanting to express their support of educators who have to wrestle with conservative, special-interest groups and their brand of censorship.
<P>   Stephanie Rawlins, president of the American Library Association&#39;s student chapter at the University of Tennessee, wrote to tell me about various activities on campus this week during Banned Book Week, which runs through Saturday, Oct. 5:
<P>   Rawlins expressed concern over First Amendment rights that are violated when books are pulled from school curriculums and libraries by minority groups who object to sexual content in accepted classics like &#39;&#39;Lady Chatterly&#39;s Lover&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;The Color Purple.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Banned Book Week 1996, by the way, is the 15th annual promotion celebrating the freedom to read. Most bookstores have special displays and information available on freedom of speech, along with actual situations where that freedom has been challenged.
<P>   Paul Sliger -- who describes himself as &#39;&#39;one of the far right&#39;&#39; -- wrote to say, in effect, RIGHT ON, and then asks a question I am still contemplating:
<P>   &#39;&#39;Lord knows I have tried to find something I agree with you on, and I have found it: protection of the First Amendment. Now, will you agree with me (that we need to protect) the Second Amendment? I would like to hear from someone on the radical left as to the limits of the First Amendment. I would assume you would agree that child pornography should not be made available to libraries, etc., just as I believe atomic weapons are not protected by the Second Amendment. What are your thoughts on the &#39;limits&#39; of the First and do you think private citizens have any rights to &#39;bear arms?&#39; . . . My word, Ms. Hughs, is one of the far right about to agree with one of the radical left?&#39;&#39;
<P>   Well. I guess the answer, Mr. Sliger, is sort of, maybe and perhaps. But that&#39;s a start, dontchathink?
<P>   There&#39;s not too much debate on what atomic weapons are and what a gun is. It&#39;s not so cut-and-dried with words. What I consider pornography, child or otherwise, would probably not be what someone &#39;&#39;on the far right&#39;&#39; would define as pornography. I certainly don&#39;t think Mark Twain wrote trashy novels.
<P>   As for the rights of private citizens to carry a gun, I think common sense and a good look at the headlines show we&#39;d be better off if they didn&#39;t. The purpose of a gun is to kill. If guns were outlawed, as the bumper sticker says, only outlaws would kill their children accidentally.
<P>   You want protection? Get a dog.
<P>   I know. I know. It&#39;s more complicated than that.
<P>   Getting back to books, my piece on the Knox County Public Library System brought these comments from Patricia Watson, Library Services director:
<P>   &#39;&#39;We particularly liked your literary allusion to &#39;&#39;The Little Engine That Could&#39;&#39;. It has been a time of rapid change, one in which we feel very fortunate to have been supported by friends and users . . . by the County Executive, and by the County Commission.
<P>   &#39;&#39;With ominous mutterings of tax revolt abounding, we need that support even more. It is vitally important that the community be reminded that &#39;non-mandated&#39; does not equal &#39;unnecessary.&#39;
<P>   And from Mary Rayson, president of Friends of the Library: &#39;&#39;Patricia Watson has the gift of making her job seem easy and effortless. It is anything but. However the public sees only the results. I hope many individuals will say &#39;Thank you&#39; to their librarians and to our government officials who have funded the Library System.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Saturday&#39;s column will deal with other mail and a special hat you can buy to shield your brain from &#39;&#39;electrosmog.&#39;&#39;

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">T</font>hose of us who tried to go
        somewhere in the car Saturday morning felt a little like
        Chicken Little. </p>
        <p>The sky was falling. </p>
        <p>In fact it fell so low it not only threw a blanket
        over our windshield, it seeped into our car and misted up
        our glasses. </p>
        <p>Early mornings in East Tennessee are known for their
        smoke-and-mirror shows, especially along the river roads
        when fog can get so thick it turns the world upside down, </p>
        <p>Fog lets us see the Earth's breath, much like we see
        our own on cold winter mornings when the air is crisp and
        clear. </p>
        <p>It's like some hidden artist paints an opaque gray
        across the landscape under the glaze of night, then
        changes his mind and washes it away in sunlight so bright
        it makes you wonder if you might have dreamed the whole thing
        up. It reminds me of the games we used to play with dry
        ice: pouring water over it to watch the smoke spew forth,
        letting it swirl about our heads like iridescent scarves. </p>
        <p>Saturday morning I had to pull off the road and wait,
        not daring to drive when I couldn't see the center line,
        couldn't make out any headlights. </p>
        <p>Even my own. </p>
        <p>It's the second time within a week that the sky fell
        on me. </p>
        <p>The other time was Sunday night in northern New
        Mexico, where I'd gone to serve on the faculty at a
        weeklong writer's conference. </p>
        <p>It was a clear night and my responsibilities were
        over. I took a hike up along the spines of the sandstone
        mesas and watched the sun slide like a gold coin into a
        slit on the horizon -- a slit, by the way, that from
        where I stood was off towards that place on the map that
        marks the only point in the United States where four
        states come together at the corners. </p>
        <p>Northern New Mexico is a sight to behold any season,
        but in the fall the aspens -- which other than scraggly
        cottonwoods and pinons are about all there is in the tree
        department -- turn such a blinding yellow-gold you forget to
        miss the reds and oranges of fall back home. </p>
        <p>If you can ''do'' yellow that well, why not just stick
        with it and specialize? </p>
        <p>My after-supper walk that night turned into an
        all-nighter. I went back to my room and dragged the
        blankets off my bed, stuffed a sweatshirt and some water
        into a day pack and took off for the high mesa that
        sprawls out next to the conference center like a sleeping
        giant. </p>
        <p>Years ago I learned from a park ranger in the area
        that humans have built-in night vision. Under clear night
        skies and against those earth tones you don't really need
        a flashlight. I climbed to the top, spread out my
        make-shift sleeping bag and spent all night watching the
        sky come closer and closer down on me until I might as
        well have been riding one of the 16 falling stars I
        counted before the sun turned out their lights. </p>
        <p>You can never get enough sky, and it's amazing how
        many stars can fit inside your eyes when you look close. </p>
        <p>I thought about something I learned in grade school,
        which at the time seemed just a bunch of numbers: how
        there are billions of galaxies out there, spaced a
        million light years apart -- one light year being about
        six trillion miles. The lens of our biggest telescope
        sees over a hundred million galaxies, but the further you
        go into space, the thicker the galaxies are. Scientist
        figure there are billions and billions of undiscovered
        galaxies. </p>
        <p>That night up on the mesa, I felt not only like the
        sky had fallen, but that I was taken up off my blanket
        and placed slap dab in the middle of the whole blinking
        universe. </p>
        <p>When I came home and told a friend about sleeping on
        the mesa, his first question was ''Why on earth did you
        do that?'' </p>
        <p>I guess I did it because it meant leaving Earth,
        taking a spin through space. It's a different kind of
        topsy-turvy ride than we get these foggy fall mornings,
        but the idea is the same: </p>
        <p>It's like being reminded what over and around us lies,
        even when we can't see it. </p>

        <p><font size="2"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>hose of us who got the impression
        from memorizing our way through Spenserian sonnets and
        playing detective with T.S. Eliot might be surprised to
        know that for the past several years the compendium of
        Best American Poetry has few, if any, poems that rhyme or
        have a fixed form. </p>
        <p>Too much of the poetry I read in school was like some
        secret code that needed breaking: language stuffed
        unnaturally into prescribed forms, ideas wearing trench
        coats and masks so that to understand them you had to
        play Sherlock Holmes with a bunch of dead poets. </p>
        <p>Poetry was orthodontia with words. </p>
        <p>Prose, on the other hand, gives language and meaning
        room to breathe -- but I admit all this is just an excuse
        for why I am no poet, even though I study it, admire it
        and continue to dig deep within myself hoping to strike
        it rich, find that mother lode of insight and discipline
        that makes poetry. </p>
        <p>If I had a nickel for ever poem I've tried to write,
        every line I've scratched out, erased, re-written,
        agonized over and finally balled into a wad and hook-shot
        toward the trash basket -- I could retire as a wealthy
        poet wannabe. </p>
        <p>Only one thing is worse than reading someone else's
        bad poem and that's reading a bad poem written by your
        own self. The best thing to come out of my unrequited
        love affair with poetry is how much I value the skill in
        other people. </p>
        <p>That's why I plan to be at Davis-Kidd tomorrow night
        at 6:30 when winners of the ''About Books'' Poetry
        Contest read their work and accept their cash awards. </p>
        <p>Over 60 entries from local poets made hard work for
        the judges: Dr. Marilyn Kallet, director of the Creative
        Writing Program at the University of Tennessee and
        Davis-Kidd staffer Florence McNabb -- both of whom are themselves
        published poets. </p>
        <p>And the envelope, please. </p>
        <p>First place winner is Linda Parson's ''Book Lover;''
        second place ''Why I Read'' by Jeanne Leiby; a tie for
        third place between Judy Loest's ''Paperback Dreams'' and
        Arthur Stewart's ''Reading Pale Fire.'' Honorable mention
        goes to Caroline Norris, Donna Doyle, Jeff Callahan and
        Jeanne Leiby. </p>
        <p>I found Jeanne Leiby's honorable mention poem, ''On
        Teaching A Poetry Workshop,'' particularly intriguing,
        and I pass along part of it for you to think about: </p>
        <p>The room is dingy gray and the register near </p>
        <p>the one unopenable window blasts hot, </p>
        <p>manufactured heat. Outside, the men in blue </p>
        <p>melt tar for the re-roofing project . . . </p>
        <p>My duty is to teach young people, people </p>
        <p>so much younger than I ever remember being, </p>
        <p>the power of metaphor . . . </p>
        <p>. . . I have wanted only one thing, </p>
        <p>wished upon them only one visitation: </p>
        <p>that just once, in the middle of the night, they get
        shaken </p>
        <p>awake by a voice not their own, a finger </p>
        <p>come forward through the darkness </p>
        <p>of their imaginations, beckoned them forward </p>
        <p>to the journal or keyboard or frosted window pane . .
        . </p>
        <p>But there is one thing I have not had the courage </p>
        <p>to say to them, my class. And I will say it now. </p>
        <p>The truth changes, and no poem, no metaphor, </p>
        <p>no matter how beautifully constructed will hold </p>
        <p>forever. If I've beckoned you toward that mystery, </p>
        <p>and it was my finger in the darkness, </p>
        <p>and if this creation answers some unspeakable question </p>
        <p>you've been asking of yourself since your birth, </p>
        <p>I'm sorry. For, like me, you well may chase this high </p>
        <p>through dingy classrooms, tar fumes, and the
        unbreathable </p>
        <p>heat of institutionalized academia searching </p>
        <p>for something as illusive as the scents of lilacs on
        the wind. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">C</font>hristmas decorations have been out
        for a month now, so I guess it's OK to rush things a bit
        and talk about The (new) Old Farmer's Almanac for 1997. </p>
        <p>I never imagined I'd be alive in 1997 -- a spooky
        thirteen years after George Orwell's ''1984'' -- which
        seemed as far into the future as I wanted to go back in
        my science-fiction teens. </p>
        <p>Yet here we are, three years away from the big bang
        new millennium. </p>
        <p>The main mission of the original Old Farmer's Almanac
        was to give detailed weather information for people whose
        livelihoods depended on it. Weather has always been a big
        guessing game, even for people who've never plowed a
        field or milked a cow. </p>
        <p>I read somewhere that Americans make a billion
        telephone calls a week to find out the weather. I know
        people who sit for hours watching the Weather Channel,
        hushing you up if you try to make conversation -- like
        you were interrupting an apocalyptic incantation. </p>
        <p>The Farmer's Almanac still has all the scoop on the
        year's weather, but trust me. You'll skip those parts.
        The best stuff in there has nothing to do with barometric
        pressure and Fahrenheit. </p>
        <p>Take the classifieds for example. </p>
        <p>From ''Attention Moose Lovers'' to ''Unmarried
        Catholics: Unlimited Choice,'' there's something for
        everyone: alligator recipes; help with impotency;
        insect-eating plants; solar-powered egg beaters; cars for
        under $100. </p>
        <p>Just lick a stamp and they are yours. </p>
        <p>Plus you can order ''Dribble'' the raccoon who teaches
        children good Christian values, and you can earn
        correspondence degrees in metaphysics, hypnotherapy and
        parapsychology. </p>
        <p>Or get yourself a ''ministerial license.'' </p>
        <p>There's a chart to figure the sunrise/sunset,
        moonrise/moonset, the rising/setting times of major
        planets and bright stars for major U.S. cities -- and,
        yes, Knoxville is right there between Ketchikan and
        Kodiak (both in Alaska). </p>
        <p>But before you've done the math to figure out times,
        you'll be distracted by an article on ''Why Did Kamikaze
        Pilots Wear Helmets'' -- and other unanswerable questions
        the Farmer's gleaned from the World Wide Web, including: </p>
        <p>* Why are there interstate highways in Hawaii? </p>
        <p>* If nothing ever sticks to Teflon, how do they get
        the Teflon to stick to the pan? </p>
        <p>* If you're in a vehicle traveling the speed of light,
        what happens when you turn on the headlights? </p>
        <p>* Can you imagine a world in which there are no
        hypothetical situations? </p>
        <p>* Why isn't phonetic spelled the way it sounds? </p>
        <p>I get a fair number of catalogues in my mailbox, but
        the things you can order from the Old Farmer's Almanac
        beat anything I see in Neimans or L.L. Bean: tomato
        plants guaranteed to produce more than 2,000 tomatoes per plant;
        hernia appliances; a video that teaches classical
        harmonica in 60 minutes; a tuna-can liquid extractor; and
        a salve for broken, weak and splitting fingernails that
        is so effective it made one woman's nails so strong her
        husband uses them as screwdrivers. </p>
        <p>It's hard to pick a favorite among the likes of these,
        but I was especially grateful to learn the most landed-on
        space on the Monopoly Board is Illinois Avenue; a ''fear
        of beards'' is called pogonophobia; and to make easy work
        out of catching a wild bird, sprinkle salt on its tail. </p>
        <p>(About that last one: I am no farmer, but it would
        seem to me if you can sprinkle salt on its tail wouldn't
        you have already caught the thing?) </p>
        <p>The Farmer's Almanac isn't the ''good news book.''
        That title is taken, but along those same lines, you
        might be glad to know there's a post box in New York City
        that holds the answer to questions like ''Why God permits evil''
        and ''How come He allows little children to starve to
        death?'' </p>
        <p>Just contact ''Bible Answers'' and you can put your
        mind and heart to rest. Not to worry. </p>
        <p>But here's the best part. </p>
        <p>According to the ad, the answer will be revealed
        ''with no obligations.'' </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        <p><font size="2"><em>By Ina Hughs, Columnist<!--dateline--></em></font></p>
        <p><font size="5">D</font>on't read this if you want a
        good night's sleep tonight. </p>
        <p>His name was Nostradamus, and were he still alive,
        he'd be half a millennium old and most likely spending
        Halloween night in his attic study in France where he was
        once the live-in physician to Queen Catherine de Medicis. </p>
        <p>It isn't his doctoring or his hobnobbing with royalty
        that makes his spooky story last for all these years. It
        is his uncanny insight into people and events. </p>
        <p>His first predictions were silly little things like
        how many peas in a jar, how many coins in a friend's
        pocket -- party tricks for his friends in medical school.
        He never missed. </p>
        <p>The last thing he predicted was his own death. He was
        right about that, too. From court jester to royal seer,
        his prophesies turned from playthings into pieces of a
        puzzle still falling into place these 500 years later. </p>
        <p>It must have seemed the fuzzy ramblings of a goofy
        academic back in 1555 when he looked into his crystal
        ball and wrote, ''The regions subject to Lybra will make
        the world tremble by great war. Blood and fire there will be
        when Mercury, Mars and Jupiter are in France.'' </p>
        <p>Get ready for the first goose bump. </p>
        <p>Those regions ''subject to Lybra'' were to be Austria
        and the Balkans. Mercury, Mars and Jupiter were ''in
        France'' in 1914. </p>
        <p>The rest is in the World War I textbooks. </p>
        <p>He described in detail the Russian Revolution, wrote
        about the League of Nations -- including its weaknesses
        -- and that a ''black, fierce, villainous, evil man''
        named ''Hister'' would set the world on edge and plunge
        it into another great war. Remember. This was 1555. </p>
        <p>Nostradamus was a devout Catholic, tormented by his
        psychic skill. He once came across a band of Franciscan
        friars and fell suddenly to his knees before the youngest
        of them: ''I must kneel before His Holiness.'' </p>
        <p>Everyone thought he was drunk or crazy. </p>
        <p>The young friar's name was Felice Peretti, and in 1585
        -- 19 years after Nostradamus' death -- Felice Peretti
        was elected Pope Sixtus V. </p>
        <p>In time Nostradamus became convinced his gift of
        prophesy was a gift from God, and every night after his
        day-job doctoring the royal family, he climbed the attic
        stairs to his study, stared into a brass bowl filled with water
        and watched the future unfold. </p>
        <p>In a state of self-hypnosis he wrote out what he saw,
        wrapping his predictions in cryptic verse and anagrams
        because he felt it dangerous to give people too clear a
        picture of what lies ahead. </p>
        <p>His track record as prophet has never been understood
        nor duplicated. His predictions include the Great Fire in
        London 110 years before it happened; the French
        Revolution; Louis Pasteur's medical breakthrough in 1864. </p>
        <p>But that was then. This is now, and what Nostradamus
        had to say about us is . . . well, let's just say it'll
        give you goose bumps on top of goose bumps: Russians and
        the United States join to fight a warring Arab leader.
        China, feeling betrayed, joins Arab powers in a military
        invasion. </p>
        <p>In his only dated quatrain -- all others are given in
        astrological terms -- he says in July of 1999 a new
        Western leader ''of Germanic heart'' will take charge.
        Between Nov. 23 and Dec. 21, 1999, the final Battle of Armageddon
        will take place, followed by an Age of Peace that lasts
        until the earth is destroyed in the year 7000. </p>
        <p>Now. Here's the granddaddy of all goose bumps. When a
        friend bid him good night on June 30, 1566, Nostradamus
        said, ''At sunrise, I shall not be here.'' They found his
        body the next morning, dead of natural causes at his worktable.
        As he had requested, he was buried standing up at the
        Chapel of St. Martha. He also asked that a metal plaque
        bearing the date 1700 be buried with him. </p>
        <p>Years later when work had to be done on the Chapel of
        St. Martha, Nostradamus' coffin was opened and his
        remains moved to a new tomb. </p>
        <p>Workers found a metal plaque resting on his bones. The
        year was 1700. </p>

        <p><font size="2"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>he alphabet is a powerful tool --
        26 letters we stir up in all manner of ways to give
        meaning and understanding to things we feel, information
        we have and what we need. </p>
        <p>Words used one way can lead us into temptation; used
        another, deliver us from evil. </p>
        <p>Sometimes words fail. The alphabet swims in our head,
        but all the words we come up with seem haphazard and
        inadequate as messages in a child's Magic Eight Ball toy. </p>
        <p>I suspect that is how all of Knoxville photographer
        Jan Lynch's friends feel now. And there are countless
        people from across the globe who suffer, wordlessly, with
        and for Jan as he slips into the valley of the shadow. </p>
        <p>Even as a child, it was obvious Jan was going places.
        Today critics name him as one of the most important
        artists the South has produced. His credits include
        portraits of Robert Kennedy, Timothy Leary, Greg
        Louganis, Alice Walker -- as well as thousand-word
        pictures of people who, were it not for the
        soul-capturing skill of this amazing man, might blend
        into the woodwork of ordinary lives. </p>
        <p>His cousin Maude, for example, is perhaps his most
        famous photograph, whose vitality and grace, spunk and
        grittiness is clear as black and white in the image Jan
        captures. He calls her his ''Madonna,'' and she's part of
        Jan's exhibit at Key Antiques &amp; Artspace here in
        Knoxville. Other of his works are currently featured in
        galleries and museums from Los Angeles and New York to
        Denmark. </p>
        <p>Yesterday when I visited Jan at Fort Sanders hospital
        where he is dying of AIDS, the light came into his eyes
        as I handed him the simple, automatic camera kept there
        on his bedside table -- a camera much like the one his father
        gave him some 30 years ago. I asked him to take a picture
        for me. He's too weak and confused to do it alone, so we
        held the camera together. Though his mind is not clear,
        his spirit is. In that moment, because of his gentle,
        generous way, he became priest-like, administering a kind
        of blessing in this small task. Perhaps the best way to
        describe Jan Lynch is as photographer-priest. </p>
        <p>His formal education began at Townsend Elementary and
        ended with him graduating with honors in Sacred Theology
        from the University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome. On
        Aug. 28, 1977, he was ordained as a priest and became
        rector of The Nativity of St. Mary's church in Toronto. </p>
        <p>In time Jan turned his calling into another kind of
        ''soul'' work, launching himself towards a career in
        photography that has become something of a legend. In
        1995 news of Jan's life-and-death struggle against
        AIDS-related pneumonia spread quickly through a vast
        network of artists, church colleagues and countless
        numbers of people whose lives had been enriched by his
        art, his fierce sense of justice, his modesty, his
        capacity for friendship. </p>
        <p>It surprised no one that Jan took up the banner of
        hope, transforming his journey in and out of AIDS-related
        pain, both emotional and physical, into a road map that
        demonstrates as no words, no picture can the human capacity
        for goodness and compassion. </p>
        <p>He became priest-photographer on a pilgrimage through
        darkness, towards the light. </p>
        <p>This time death is coming for sure, and hopefully, for
        his sake, soon. Ed White, Jan's biographer and caregiver,
        says this of his dying friend's struggle: ''He doesn't
        shrink from the idea that exposure will bring censure from
        those who will say he deserves this cruel disease. In
        fact he thinks any moralizing done in his name or on the
        subject of AIDS should be a lesson that we should all
        care for one another, that compassion is the proper response
        to suffering, that hope is essential to everyone's
        quality of life even in the face of overwhelming odds,
        and that ignorance is the biggest threat in the battle
        against AIDS.'' </p>
        <p>Jan himself said not long ago, ''We're all going to be
        survivors of this. One way or another.'' </p>
        <p>But I found the most telling message -- the text of
        the book Jan wrote both with his living and his dying --
        to be a picture posted on his hospital wall. It's of Jan,
        holding this sign: </p>
        <p>DON'T HATE WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. </p>

Election Day is tomorrow</font><p><font size=2><i>By Ina Hughs News-Sentinel Columnist</i></font></p>
<p><!--dateline--><br>
<font size=5>T</font>hey say it happened during Adlai Stevenson's first campaign against 
Eisenhower. An enthusiastic female supporter dashed up to Stevenson and 
said, ''Governor, every thinking person will be voting for you tomorrow.'' </p>
<p>To which Stevenson replied: </p>
<p>''Madam, this is not enough. I need a majority.'' </p>
<p>Which is a good way to back into the statement that one thing is for sure: all 
thinking people will vote tomorrow if they haven't done so already. </p>
<p>There's no reason good enough for a rational citizen, able in body and mind, 
not to vote. Any excuse is a lame one, even my own the few times in local 
elections when I forgot or ran out of time. </p>
<p>To me the weakest of all reasons is one you hear every election, no matter 
who is running: ''I'm not voting because there is no choice.'' </p>
<p>As if that will do any good. </p>
<p>On Dec. 15, 1975, Harper's Weekly ran a letter to the editor which became 
a kind of manifesto for the no-choice-no-vote crowd. Vice President Gerald 
Ford had taken over as president after Nixon -- who defeated George 
McGovern -- resigned the previous August. Things were, to say the least, 
testy. </p>
<p>But aren't they always? </p>
<p>At any rate, one Ian McNett was pretty fed up and fired off this letter to 
Harper's: </p>
<p>''In more elections than I care to remember I have grumbled about the 
choice of candidates offered . . . but I dutifully trudged to the polls every 
November and voted for the least worst candidate. Often I wished I had a 
choice, not just a chance to write in somebody's name, but a real choice.'' </p>
<p>McNett then goes on about the futility of ''writing in'' a name because in fact, 
write-ins are never counted, never reported and end up being jokes for 
pundits, the stuff of cartoon politics; and each year the high number of voters 
who stay home are offered up as proof of apathy and the decline of 
democracy. </p>
<p>McNett then launches into his solution for all this. Maybe the people who 
stay home are ''voting with their feet.'' </p>
<p>It's like they are saying by such conspicuous absence, ''We're tired of 
candidates who don't discuss the issues and politicians who play games with 
their supposed constituents.'' </p>
<p>If you don't have a choice or want any of the choices available, why vote for 
any of them? </p>
<p>''But suppose the voters did have a vote,'' McNett continues. ''Suppose we 
had an amendment to the Constitution that required every office on the 
ballot, from county clerk to president, to carry a space to vote for none of 
the above. </p>
<p>Rather than sulk at home on voting day, folks could turn their negative 
attitude into a positive statement. What puts muscle into McNett's plan is 
Article II of his what-if amendment which would require election officials to 
count and report the ''none'' votes gathered by each candidate. Article III 
would provide that if neither candidate out-polled the ''none'' votes, there 
would be a new election and candidates who were ''defeated'' by failing to 
get enough votes of confidence could not run second time around. </p>
<p>''Maybe it wouldn't work,'' says McNett. ''But maybe it would.'' </p>
<p>It's hard not to agree with what Ronald Steel said in the New York Times 
some 10 years ago: politics as battle has given way to politics as spectacle -- 
but it is also true that in a democracy voting is a civic sacrament. Not only a 
privilege, but a duty. The person who doesn't vote is no less a captive than 
the person who can't. </p>
<p>Being a ''flaming liberal'' as some have called me -- not a bad title when you 
think of what fire and freedom mean -- I may sound strange quoting George 
Will, but he told it like it is when he wrote in his ''On Conservatives'' column 
for Newsweek: ''Voters don't decide issues. They decide who will decide 
the issues.'' </p>
<p>To renege on that responsibility is an unpardonable sin. </p>

        <font size="5">T</font>here's been a lot of in-fighting
        during this election, but one thing prognosticators
        agreed on was how voter turnout this election will likely
        hit an all-time low. </p>
        <p>Judging from the crowd at Beech Grove Baptist Church
        in Louisville where I voted, they are right. There was
        hardly a line at all. </p>
        <p>As people here at work drifted in after voting at
        various points in the day, most commented on the no-wait,
        small crowds at schools and churches throughout the area. </p>
        <p>Maybe it's because a lot of people took advantage of
        the early-voter plan. One statistic I heard was that over
        20,000 people voted beforehand to avoid the crowd. One of
        my co-workers got a laugh out of the fact that a friend
        of hers waited two hours in line at the mall to vote
        early, whereas folks are zipping through on Tuesday. Even
        lunch hour voters are in and out with time enough to eat
        sitting down. </p>
        <p>Monday afternoon stumping at McGhee Tyson Airport,
        Tipper Gore pointed out that in 1994, 112 million
        Americans did not vote -- 47 million of them women. </p>
        <p>A conversation I overheard while filling out my voter
        card may help explain why so many people sat this one
        out. Like most polling places, there was a special booth
        set up at Beech Grove Baptist Church where children were encouraged
        to vote along with their parents. A young mother came in
        with her three children, and immediately two of them
        dashed over to the Kid Vote table. </p>
        <p>The older one refused. </p>
        <p>''I don't want to,'' he said. </p>
        <p>''You ought to exercise your voting right,'' says Mom.
        ''It's important.'' </p>
        <p>''No it isn't,'' the boy said. ''It doesn't make any
        difference. It doesn't count.'' With that he plopped on
        the floor and opened a comic book. </p>
        <p>But Mom wasn't giving up: ''Son, people have died
        protecting the right to vote. How can you just sit there
        and watch?'' </p>
        <p>He ignored her. </p>
        <p>''OK, then. Just remember. If you don't vote, you
        don't have any right to complain about anything the
        government does. You can't criticize the president or
        fuss about laws.'' </p>
        <p>The boy looked over at the Kid Vote table. </p>
        <p>''I don't know how,'' he said. ''Plus, it's too much
        trouble. The whole thing is just a game anyhow.'' </p>
        <p>Several years ago an interesting book came out in
        which James Patterson and Peter Kim charted what they
        learned from folks all over the country who were
        interviewed on a number of touchy issues with total
        anonymity. The title pretty much explains the idea: </p>
        <p>''The Day America Told the Truth.'' </p>
        <p>One of the topics investigated was why so many young
        people are ill-informed and turned off by politics and
        the workings of government. </p>
        <p>Americans aged 18 to 24 are now the only age group in
        which less than half of those eligible to vote actually
        do so. </p>
        <p>Though most revolutions are started, most wars fought
        by that age group, they are less likely to vote in an
        election -- at least in this country. </p>
        <p>A 24 year old woman explains it this way: ''I try to
        avoid all the controversy. It just doesn't interest me at
        this point in my life. I'd rather be outside doing
        something, taking a walk.'' </p>
        <p>A 22 year old said, ''I don't think many people in my
        age group are very concerned. They're only concerned
        about issues that affect them. When the drinking age went
        up, quite a few people were upset.'' </p>
        <p>Perhaps the most disturbing comment comes from a sixth
        grade class -- about the same age as the would-be kid
        voter in line with me yesterday. </p>
        <p>Asked how they would characterize the American Dream
        they all agreed: ''Five million dollars and two days in
        the mall.'' </p>
        <p>I doubt they would take time off from shopping to vote
        there in the mall, because how do they characterize
        politicians? </p>
        <p>''Every one of them lies about everything.'' </p>

        <p><font size="2"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>his morning in a little church
        outside Munich, my young niece is marrying a German man
        she met while on a Fulbright scholarship to study art in
        his country. </p>
        <p>Many in my family and most all of his will be on hand
        to share in the festivities, praying together in our
        different languages, eating together after the ceremony
        and making plans to visit each other sometime again in
        the future. Word is there'll be dancing late into the
        night, everyone will toast the bride and groom, each
        heaping congratulations on this new family alliance. </p>
        <p>Quite a different scene from what happened in Germany
        on Nov. 9, 1938. </p>
        <p>Neither my niece nor her young man was alive then, of
        course, but their parents were. And both have great
        uncles and cousins who died on different sides in the war
        that broke out between our two countries shortly afterwards
        -- a war that pitted the groom's family against the
        bride's. </p>
        <p>Less than a lifetime ago, in one sense -- but in a
        deeper sense, millions of lifetimes ago -- a trip to
        Germany would have come from a curse rather than a
        blessing. Traveling there meant marching orders, not down
        aisles, but into battle. </p>
        <p>November 9, 1938, became known as Kristallnacht, or
        ''crystal night,'' so named because of all the smashing
        of glass. </p>
        <p>I doubt they will be ''smashing glasses'' in
        old-country style at the wedding celebrations tonight --
        dashing champagne glasses against the wall like you see
        in old movies. But there will be toasts in fine crystal,
        another kind of ''crystal night.'' </p>
        <p>Kristallnacht 1938 was the polar opposite of what's on
        the agenda today in Germany. During the evening of that
        Nov. 9 and well into the next morning, German mobs broke
        into and destroyed thousands of shops and homes belonging
        to Jews and their sympathizers. Synagogues were burned to
        the ground. Bonfires were set in every Jewish
        neighborhood, using as fuel for the flames sacred
        scrolls, prayer books, Jewish poetry and art and pages ripped
        from the Torah. </p>
        <p>As windows shattered and glass flew, 91 Jews died on
        the spot and more than 30,000 were arrested. </p>
        <p>Now here we are some three-score years later going to
        a wedding. Rings on our fingers and bells on or toes. </p>
        <p>So to speak. </p>
        <p>But I doubt there will be anyone speaking about those
        years. Forgive and forget. That was then, this is now. </p>
        <p>Thinking about it gives me the same feeling I get when
        visiting old battlefields. Today we have to read
        pamphlets and take guided tours to brush up on what the
        big deal was that reaped such havoc. The faces and voices
        we see in our imagination as we read the historic markers
        are like make-believe characters, disconnected from
        reality. The eerie silence of those old battlefields is
        their loudest and most vivid testament. Who died and for
        what seems almost irrelevant and half forgotten. What
        rings in our head is not politics or philosophy. What
        rings in our head is the sound of suffering, the rabid
        frenzy of battle and a whimper of frustration, a stabbing of
        conscience, because we know this is not the way human
        beings should act. </p>
        <p>One of the earliest prayers of the people against whom
        those 1938 pogroms were carried out asks God to show us
        how to turn swords into plowshares, how to turn our
        enemies into our friends. </p>
        <p>I suppose you could say those prayers were answered,
        this morning's wedding in Germany a good example. How
        shameful it is that we have to keep learning, over and
        over again. </p>
        <p>And at great cost. It's like something Hawkeye once
        said on M*A*S*H: </p>
        <p>''Wars don't last forever. Only war does.'' </p>

        <font size="5">T</font>his week marks the first week of
        the second half of autumn. </p>
        <p>If you're a numbers person, it means that in 50 days
        it'll be 1997. </p>
        <p>Put another way: 43 days till Christmas. </p>
        <p>But you don't need me to tell you that. Just look
        outside and you'll see for yourself that fall is at its
        halfway mark. </p>
        <p>Half of the leaves are off the trees, half still
        hanging on for dear life. </p>
        <p>First half of the day you can see your breath, the
        other half you're down to your shirtsleeves. </p>
        <p>Half of the week you're running the car heater, the
        other half you've flicked back to air conditioning. </p>
        <p>You're half sick to death of football, halfhearted
        about the beauty of leaves -- except those raked into
        piles -- and your eyes only open halfway when the alarm
        goes off in the dark every morning on this half of the
        time zone. </p>
        <p>Autumn probably runs a close second to spring as most
        people's favorite time of year. I figure if you took the
        first half of fall and the second half of spring, you'd
        have God's most perfect season. </p>
        <p>I say second half of spring because spring officially
        begins around the first of March, and March can be
        downright nasty. </p>
        <p>Come May, when the world is so budding beautiful
        everyone goes blissfully astray, spring is technically
        half over. </p>
        <p>Guess you could say it's a late bloomer. </p>
        <p>Winter and summer, on the other hand, are half-empty,
        half-full months. </p>
        <p>The first half is pretty much like the second half, in
        a good-news-bad-news kind of way -- depending on how you
        look at it. </p>
        <p>Summer is hot and sticky, but it's also real tomatoes
        and going barefoot. </p>
        <p>Winter means dry skin and frostbite if you think about
        it one way, Christmas and Valentine's Day and Michael
        Jordan (basketball season) if you think about another. </p>
        <p>Before moving to East Tennessee, fall was my least
        favorite season. Now I have to say it's my favorite. </p>
        <p>Both halves. </p>
        <p>I like the way the sun sits half-cocked on the
        horizon, how a low harvest moon fills half the sky, round
        as a 50-cent piece and half as rare. </p>
        <p>I like the way your heart puts your mind in a half
        nelson at the sight of first frost, the rump-up feathers
        of a mallard on a late afternoon fishing trip along his
        flyway. </p>
        <p>I love the half-crazed grin of pumpkins, the
        half-baked plans to diet after the holidays. </p>
        <p>I love the wet canvas, half-finished look of a rainy
        fall afternoon in the mountains, as if the artist got
        distracted and quit midway through her painting. </p>
        <p>It's a wonder April Fools' Day doesn't fall on the
        calendar this time of year, with tricksters and
        politicians running about and the weather teasing and playing
        jokes on us day after day. </p>
        <p>It's a wonder, too, that more songs and poems don't
        get written about this half-baked time of year. Poets
        prefer spring, and if music is the language of flowers,
        then winter is when it's most needed. </p>
        <p>The best lines about fall come, I think, from Percy
        Bysshe Shelley, who believes a kind of lovely hoax is
        played on us this time of year. </p>
        <p>Fall, he says, is a season full of half-truths, and it
        puts us in something of a trance: </p>
        <p>The day becomes more solemn and serene </p>
        <p>When noon is past -- there is harmony </p>
        <p>In autumn, and a luster in its sky, </p>
        <p>Which through the summer is not heard or seen </p>
        <p>As if it could not be, as if it had not been. </p>
        <p>If I didn't know better, I'd think he wrote that poem
        right slap dab in the middle of an East Tennessee fall. </p>

				<FONT size="-1"><I>By Ina Hughs, Columnist</I></FONT><P>
				<FONT SIZE="-1"><!--dateline--></FONT></DIV></B><BR>
				<FONT SIZE="+2">Y</FONT>ou&#39;ve no doubt heard it said that we in the media tend to over-report, to weight the news with political glut, but I&#39;m going to risk it here and talk about the election. Again.
<P>   I know. I know. The fat lady has sung, and no doubt the curio shops are busy filling orders for the bumper sticker shoot-outs: &#39;&#39;Don&#39;t Blame Me&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Get Over It  . .  He Won!&#39;&#39;
<P>   Being from the Carolinas, I had a very emotional and deep-rooted interest in the Helms and Thurmond victories. Harvey Gantt, who ran against Helms, is a friend from my Charlotte Observer days and a person whom I admire a great deal. Jesse Helms has become over the years a caricature for all the things I am against, politically. Outside the South he is a buffoon. Ask anybody.
<P>   As for Thurmond, his dirty-old-man reputation and well-heeled Bubba mentality make him hard to beat in a state that has both a Hilton Head and a Darlington. I once watched him work a country club crowd from the bus boys to the governor&#39;s wife. He is unbeatable.
<P>   So, evidentially, is Jesse Helms.
<P>   My colleague Dannye Romine Powell, in her Sunday-after-the-election column for The Charlotte Observer, shares a conversation she had with Harvey Gantt after the election. Gantt refused to pick up the phone and make the traditional call of concession, a call he also refused to make in 1990 when he lost to Helms by almost the exact margin as in this election.
<P>   Dannye asked him why.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I&#39;m sorry, I cannot be two-faced,&#39;&#39; Gantt told her. &#39;&#39;I cannot call up and say, &#39;I think you ran a great campaign.&#39; If I were honest, I would have called him and said, &#39;I thought you ran a lousy campaign.&#39; I do not like people who distort beyond recognition.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Gantt&#39;s refusal to make that phone call was seen in the Helms camp as lack of good sportsmanship and bad manners. Helms&#39; press agent, Julie Wilkie, told reporters: &#39;&#39;Senator Helms has never lost a race, but he is a Southern gentleman and would&#39;ve done the right thing.&#39;&#39;
<P>   But how right is it to say something you don&#39;t mean, even -- especially -- in politics? It&#39;s different from going to the net after a well-fought tennis match and shaking hands.
<P>   But like me and everyone I have talked to outside of North Carolina, Dannye was stunned at Helms&#39; victory. So she called David Palentz, a political science professor at Duke University. Here&#39;s his take on the Helms victory and Gantt&#39;s refusal to play nicey-nicey after it was over.
<P>   He gives Gantt a point for doing away with the hypocrisy: &#39;&#39;Can you imagine ending the campaign in which you have savaged your opponent and been savaged, by saying, &#39;It was all in good fun!&#39; . . . ?&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;Jesse may be a Southern gentleman,&#39;&#39; Professor Palentz goes on to say, &#39;&#39;but he runs campaigns based on enemies. If Jesse were running against Jesus, he would destroy him with negative advertising. He would say, &#39;Jesus is a man who is always surrounded by 12 other men. There are sort of implications there, you know.&#39; &#39;&#39;
<P>   There are analysts who say the reason Helms and Thurmond won, will always win, is because they are the last of the walk-on-water conservative politicians from the &#39;&#39;old&#39;&#39; South. That&#39;s the main reason. But another one, they say, is because of the people who did not vote, and as everyone knows by now, a higher percentage of eligible voters than ever before chose to sit this one out.
<P>   If it is true that Helms had any help from the no-show crowd, I have to take issue with Mike Royko, who says he may be the only journalist in history who refuses to reprimand folks for not voting. He says people who don&#39;t vote are civic klutzes -- people who haven&#39;t been paying attention and don&#39;t give a flip. So, asks Royko, do you want your officials elected by people who don&#39;t even bother to say eenie, meenie, miney?
<P>   Heck yeah, if it means a mo like Helms gets to stay in office.

        <p><font size="2"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">S</font>omewhere in an ivy-covered tower
        of academia, scholars are doubtless working on correct
        term-paper procedure to use when footnoting material gleaned
        from the Internet. I remember spending hours typing and
        retyping college papers in order to get the op. cit's and
        loc. cit's in proper form, the commas and periods in
        place -- pulling my hair out trying to memorize acceptable
        abbreviations, which sources were underlined, which put
        in quotes; reminding myself that the plural of p is pp,
        trying to guess how many ibids you could get away with. </p>
        <p>Or, would that be ''away with which one may get''? </p>
        <p>You probably heard about the wreck Pierre Salinger had
        on the information highway the other day. Not that TV
        anchors and journalists always name their sources in the
        body of their report or article, but neither do they make it
        up as they go along. </p>
        <p>Unless, of course, they happen to be Rush Limbaugh. </p>
        <p>When retired veteran ABC newsman Pierre Salinger
        talked about the U.S. Navy being responsible for the July
        17 explosion of TWA Flight 800, he failed to mention that
        his information came from an article he read on the Internet.
        Turns out he was quoting a bogus piece of garbage zooming
        over the Web, a hoax which had long-since been
        discredited. </p>
        <p>I once fell for such a story, though mine was
        certainly more harmless. </p>
        <p>Someone e-mailed me a recipe for chocolate chip
        cookies, the story being that it was not just any
        chocolate chip cookie. It was the Neiman-Marcus secret
        recipe. A woman and her daughter, so the story went, were
        lunching at Neiman's and commented to the waitress how
        tasty the cookies were and might they have the recipe. </p>
        <p>''Yes ma'am,'' the waitress told her. ''But it will
        cost you two fifty.'' </p>
        <p>''Add it to my bill,'' the woman told her. </p>
        <p>So. The woman gets her monthly bill in the mail and on
        it is a charge of $250 for ''cookie recipe.'' She called,
        but the store would not budge. She'd been told the price
        and she had said to charge it. My e-mail, with the story and
        recipe included, was her revenge. She was going public
        with their blasted recipe. </p>
        <p>Fortunately I happened to mention all this to
        News-Sentinel food writer Louise Durman, and she laughed,
        ''Oh, that old story is back again. It's pure nonsense.'' </p>
        <p>I never did make the cookies -- I'm a peanut butter
        and oatmeal monster myself -- but every time I get
        something off the Internet, I know to check it out lest I
        end up with cookie dough in my face, as Salinger did. </p>
        <p>The story he passed on as, if not true, then at least
        authentic, had all kinds of implications and got people
        stirred up, as well it should had something like that
        actually happened. </p>
        <p>Salinger isn't the first one and won't be the last to
        stomp and salivate over false reports. Talk show hosts
        and tabloids live off that stuff. </p>
        <p>The Internet is an especially rich source of
        misinformation -- the jungle grapevine, as William Berry,
        professor at the University of Illinois Institute for
        Communications Research calls it. </p>
        <p>Last week was media mess-up week, with two icons
        slipping off their pedestal: Salinger's silicon slaughter
        and David Brinkley's attack of foot-in-mouth disease. You
        might expect those things from Rush Limbaugh, but not
        those two. </p>
        <p>In fact, did you hear Rush's comment this Friday
        morning on the radio? </p>
        <p>He announces that Clinton is telling folks the
        tide-turning event of his re-election was the Oklahoma
        City bombing. </p>
        <p>There's a pregnant pause, then Rush leans into the
        mike and says, ''Here's a question: What if they knew it
        was going to happen, and they didn't do anything to stop
        it.'' </p>
        <p>Immediately you hear the little bell-thing Rush does
        to emphasize a point, and with no further comment, the
        program goes to a commercial break. </p>

<p><!--dateline--><br>
<font size=5>T</font>he easy accessibility of the Internet and its fast-food style of 
communication keeps insomniacs like me busy night and day. It's a huge 
24-hour amusement park of ideas and information. </p>
<p>You can eavesdrop on conversations covering everything from rare 
Wedgewood china to Wiccan worship. You can hire someone to research 
and shop the country for the best deal in buying a car, and you can hook up 
with folks you ''meet'' mid-sentence in one of a zillion chat rooms where non 
sequiturs are a kind of hypnotic art form. </p>
<p>Despite the unfortunate and careless misuse of it by jokesters and media 
flimflammers -- something Pierre Salinger can tell you about -- most people 
quickly learn ''you cannot believe everything you read'' is nowhere more true 
than on the Internet. </p>
<p>A number of my e-pals know how I like a good joke, and while they 
wouldn't necessarily take the time to phone me (some I've never met and 
know only by e-mail names such as 'bigrobot' or 'Ziplite'), and certainly 
wouldn't fork over 32 cents every time they hear a funny story I might like -- 
they will take a few nanoseconds to zap it to InaH@aol.com. </p>
<p>Only once have I gotten a joke that offended me, and I am easily offended 
when it comes to cruel jokes whose punch lines rely on racial, religious, 
gender, class, lifestyle and other hurtful slurs or nasty language. I take no 
credit for this aversion. It's something I learned from my parents, though 
sometimes when I fail to laugh at a ''fag'' joke or a not-funny story told about 
Little Black Sambo, it is seen as a personal affront to the person telling it. </p>
<p>But I didn't mean to get off on this -- just to make the point that despite all 
you hear about the danger of sex-crazy porn creeps and right-wing radicals 
loose on the Internet, I receive few gratuitous jokes and stories even though 
I put myself on a number of special-interest and ''Laughter'' lists. </p>
<p>And laugh I did when I got a missive from DavidR66 which he called 
''Brainless Users,'' referring to computer users who are, let's say, a little 
intimidated by technology. It starts out with a story I'd already heard about 
how the folks at Compaq are considering changing the command ''Press 
Any Key'' to ''Press Return Key'' because of the flood of calls asking where 
the ''Any'' key is. </p>
<p>Duh. </p>
<p>But it gets worse. </p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/blkbul.gif" align=bottom width=14 height=14> An AST technician asked a customer to send him a copy of the defective 
diskettes she called to complain about. She sent him Xeroxed copies of the 
floppies. </p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/blkbul.gif" align=bottom width=14 height=14> A trouble-shooter at Dell got a call from a fellow who said he couldn't get 
his B-drive to work, and so the technician told him to put a disk in and close 
the door. The technician hears the little click as the guy puts the floppy in, 
then he hears the guy put the phone down, get up, walk across the room, 
and close his office door. </p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/blkbul.gif" align=bottom width=14 height=14> Another Dell user called to say he couldn't get his computer to FAX 
anything. After 40 minutes of questioning, the technician finally realized the 
man was trying to FAX a piece of paper by holding it up in front of the 
screen and hitting ''send.'' </p>
<p>There were reports of people wondering why their keyboard won't work 
after they cleaned it by soaking it in a soapy tub of water for two days; and 
you gotta feel sorry for the poor woman who thought she had a lemon when 
''nothing worked.'' The computer just sat there. </p>
<p>Asked what happened when she pressed the power switch, the woman 
says: </p>
<p>''Power switch? What power switch?'' </p>
<p>But my favorite is the fellow who called the Dell customer relations 
department and took them to task because their computer had told him he 
was ''bad'' and ''invalid.'' </p>
<p>Oh, no! Something else for the lawyers to cash in on: computer harassment. </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        <p><font size="2"><i>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel
        Columnist</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">N</font>o news is good news, so they say,
        and certainly the Republicans have reason to yell from
        the amen corner on that one. </p>
        <p>A story came out this week in major magazines that is
        yet another example of how politics is a game where pots
        call kettles black on a regular basis. A Ripley's
        Believe-It-Or-Not tale that shook up editors and had the Republican
        insiders on their knees. Not just praying. Begging. </p>
        <p>It seems Bob Dole . . . the same ''Bobdole''
        (everyone, including he himself always used that one-word
        name) who ran on the merits of being a highly moral guy,
        as opposed to you-know-who . . . had an extramarital
        affair that lasted four years back during the final years
        of his first marriage. </p>
        <p>Early this fall his previous lover evidently came
        forth and the likes of Bob Woodward, the ''deep throat''
        reporter who broke the Watergate scandal for The
        Washington Post, had the story. </p>
        <p>On record. </p>
        <p>The Dole campaign went bananas, and you can understand
        why. </p>
        <p>According to the account I read in Newsweek, though
        Dole did not deny the affair, bigwig Republicans and
        lawyer-types on both sides of the dilemma went to the
        Post, asking them to please not run the story. </p>
        <p>It was too near the election, they said. The affair
        had been a long time ago, they said. </p>
        <p>Elizabeth Dole herself called the paper's publisher,
        Donald Graham, and asked for mercy. </p>
        <p>Never mind that back in January on ''Meet the Press,''
        Dole himself told all of America that the personal lives
        of our political leaders, including marital infidelity,
        are ''fair game'' in campaigns. </p>
        <p>The Post decided to not run the story. Maybe later,
        they said, but not on the eve of the first debate. </p>
        <p>The Dole campaign waited. </p>
        <p>Another week passed. </p>
        <p>Dole was holed up in his condo in Florida because his
        staff figured there was a better chance of deflecting the
        story if Dole was in his 12th-floor condo rather than out
        ''on the stump.'' </p>
        <p>Let the professional double-talkers handle it, the
        damage control crowd, his advisers decided. </p>
        <p>They asked Woodward to at least give them notice
        before the story ran so they could get Elizabeth and
        Robin (Dole's daughter by his first marriage) to do the
        stand-by-your-man routine. </p>
        <p>The same routine they joked about with you-know-who
        when he got caught. </p>
        <p>''(The story of Dole's infidelity) was a mortal
        threat,'' one aide explained to Newsweek. ''It's the one
        thing we have -- the fact that he (Dole) is an upstanding
        guy with high morals. (News of an affair) wipes that all
        out.'' </p>
        <p>The Post story never ran. </p>
        <p>Here's why, according to the Newsweek account: </p>
        <p>''In the Post's newsroom and executive offices on 15th
        Street in Washington, a fierce debate raged over the
        ethics of printing the story. Many of the reporters,
        including Woodward, wanted to publish. They argued that
        Dole had made trust and character an issue, and thus
        adultery, even from the distant past, was relevant. Most
        of the editors, however, accepted the distinction between
        public trust and private actions. The Post and its
        owners, the Graham family, did not want to get into the
        business of investigating the dalliances of presidential
        candidates.'' </p>
        <p>It's be up to the pundits to debate what effect such a
        story would have had on the general election,
        specifically the Senate and House, since many Republicans
        rode the moral ''right'' coattails. But it's a moot
        point. </p>
        <p>The more relevant question is this: </p>
        <p>What would you have done had you been calling the
        shots that week at the Washington Post? </p>

				<FONT size="-1"><I>By Ina Hughs, Columnist</I></FONT><P>
				<FONT SIZE="-1"><!--dateline--></FONT></DIV></B><BR>
				<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n the introduction to &#39;&#39;The Good Book: Reading the Bible With Mind and Heart,&#39;&#39; Peter Gomes tells a parable about disturbing crises in the Christian church today.
<P>   In 1974, Gomes began a long and distinguished career as Professor of Christian Morals at Harvard College and minister of The Harvard Memorial Church. Shortly after he arrived, an anonymous benefactor wanted to give the church Bibles to put in each pew. 
<P>   No stipulations were given as to which translation, and before making the offer a done deal, Gomes discussed it with his colleagues. They were &#39;&#39; . . . suspicious of the motive behind the gift. &#39;What does the benefactor want or expect,&#39; I was asked, and warned that placing Bibles in the pews would create an invitation to steal them. Further, I was warned that &#39;people will think this is a fundamental church. If they see Bibles in the pews you will have an image problem&#39; . . . &#39;&#39;
<P>   They accepted the Bibles, choosing the then-controversial RSV Version, and Gomes is happy to report &#39;&#39;quite a few&#39;&#39; have been stolen.
<P>   In good faith, Gomes and his colleagues wanted to protect their church from what he calls &#39;&#39;religious and secular zealots.&#39;&#39; Today it would be even more of a concern, and the fact that the Bible is the &#39;&#39;weapon of choice&#39;&#39; among warring factions in mainline Christianity goes without saying.
<P>   Every year, Thanksgiving week is set aside by the American Bible Society as a time to emphasize the importance of reading and studying the Scriptures for its message to us today. But which Bible should we read?
<P>   Many here in the Bible Belt would say the King James Version. It is as if they believe that somewhere in the KJV itself, is written, &#39;&#39;Thou shalt read this translation only, for all others are but a mockery.&#39;&#39; They see it as the real word, written down just as Abraham and Moses, Jesus and Paul spoke it.
<P>   The KJV is often referred to as the &#39;&#39;authorized&#39;&#39; version, though no records exist it was ever authorized by King or Parliament in 1611 when it was published, replacing the Geneva translation. King James wasn&#39;t what you would call a top-flight &#39;&#39;holy&#39;&#39; man, and when he proposed the project in 1604, many thought James was designing his one personal monument, much as Versailles was for Louis XIV -- and of course one reason the idea of re-imaging the Bible into user-friendly English appealed to King James is because he instructed no margin notes be given. Marginal notes in the Geneva Bible questioned the divine right of kings.
<P>   &#39;&#39;If every man&#39;s humor was followed,&#39;&#39; objected one Puritan scholar from Oxford at the time, &#39;&#39;there would be no end to translations.&#39;&#39;
<P>   If the fundamentalists and traditionalists want to real &#39;&#39;old time religion,&#39;&#39; they would object to translations of the Bible, period. 
<P>   Taking it out of the &#39;&#39;original&#39;&#39; language and putting it into English was a heresy for which William Tyndale was burned at the stake. The fundamentalist believed Bibles were only for clergy, who would then explain everything to average, unenlightened people like you and me. Heaven forbid we should think for ourselves.
<P>   We&#39;ve come a long way in the half-century since the KJV translation went into its first printing -- a 1,500-page work that sold for about 30 shillings. But translating the Bible still gets folks in hot water.
<P>   If we had stakes to burn people on, there&#39;d be a long line of folks wanting to strike the first match to the editors of the new inclusive version of the Psalms and New Testament -- the one in which &#39;&#39;those crazy people&#39;&#39; want to do away with out-of-date and offensive linguistic barriers and misconception as they relate to women, people of color, and those with disabilities.
<P>   A recent survey I read said that some 91 million Americans believe in the existence of angels. A hundred million believe in the devil.
<P>   And if you want to see the devil at work, open a prayer with &#39;&#39;Our Father-Mother who art in heaven.&#39;&#39;

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">T</font>here are lots of ways to celebrate
        Thanksgiving, and even if we tried every one of them we
        would not get it all thought or said. </p>
        <p>Most of us will gather together with family and
        friends, turning the day into a kind of gastronomic
        outpouring and ingesting of good food and happy memories.
        Many will go to community church services, re-enacting
        the spirit, both divine and human, which turns a house
        into a home, personal bank accounts and full barns into
        cornucopias of sharing. </p>
        <p>According to news clips and statistics, it's also one
        of the busiest weekend on the highways, so a good number
        of us go over the river and through the woods to
        grandmother's or a special friend's to celebrate the good
        bounty and rich blessing of love and compatibility. </p>
        <p>I will probably do all of the above this holiday
        weekend, although earlier this week I got a head start on
        my thanks-giving when my dog Babe and I took an
        after-dinner ride through the Smokies. </p>
        <p>Now, Babe, mind you, is only 4 months old and is a
        black lab puppy, not a seasoned traveler or a
        camera-toting tourist; and she's usually fast asleep there
        in the passenger seat before we're even out of the
        driveway. </p>
        <p>But this time she sat up almost the whole way,
        drinking in the day-glow beauty of the world under the
        full, harvest moon and seemed, as I was, deep in thought. </p>
        <p>Driving along the Foothills Parkway above Maryville,
        the lights below were a living pageant of the season:
        alabaster cities gleaming under spacious skies; purple
        mountains rising majestic all around, the valley of their shadows
        turned friendly and inviting by the light of that silvery
        moon. </p>
        <p>We peeled off the parkway and drove towards Top of the
        World, passing first the cardboard shanties that line the
        road on both sides. My headlights caught various
        tell-tale signs of hard living: abandoned trailers, a
        yard full of broken-down cars, a scraggly patch of boards
        and sheet metal, some child's rusty wagon wrecked up in a
        ditch. Then suddenly we were top-of-the-world in a
        high-rent settlement of folks rich enough to have two homes,
        folks for whom electricity and running water, insulation
        and window curtains are not thought of as luxuries, but
        basic necessities. </p>
        <p>As we retraced our path back to the parkway, I saw the
        whole rags-to-riches panorama in reverse, the wheels of
        the car doing little clackety-clack variations on phrases
        from songs sung at Thanksgiving services all over
        America: ''God of justice, save thy people from the clash
        of race and creed. From the strife of class and faction,
        make our nation free indeed'' . . . ''Refresh thy people
        on their toilsome way, lead us from night to never-ending
        day'' . . . ''What shall I render to the Lord, what shall
        my offering be for all the gracious benefits he bestows
        on me?'' </p>
        <p>We drove through Wears Valley, up the Wonderland Hotel
        road and into the Park at Metcalf Bottoms, getting out of
        the car to watch the river zoom past in its
        rough-and-tumble dance towards the sea. The moon turned
        it fluorescent and made the whole performance seem
        strobe-lit. The water was cold, and I was grateful for my
        extra jacket; grateful, too, that I am one of the blessed
        in this world for whom a freezing-cold night can be seen
        a treat and not a terror, because there is warmth and a
        way home any time I want it. </p>
        <p>When Babe and I take the moon-lit path along the
        Sinks, I think about water frozen under polar ice caps,
        water that hasn't seen light of day or night for millions
        of years, and I marvel at the careful, delicate balance
        we all depend on, giving thanks for people who
        energetically protect that balance, even at great
        political and financial risk. </p>
        <p>We get home long after midnight, Babe and I, and it
        might have just been my imagination, but Babe stood a
        long time just looking at our house and our woods. </p>
        <p>I like to think we were both making the connection. </p>

        <font size="3"><em>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel columnist</em></font></p>
        <p><font size="5">F</font>rom the mail: </p>
        <p>From a birth mother who put her baby up for adoption:
        ''I had a beautiful baby boy when I was 16. He is now 27.
        I was incredibly fortunate to find him a year ago. I was
        even more fortunate in that he has, so far, been willing to
        accept me as part of his life. </p>
        <p>''People think about losing babies, but by death, not
        adoption and the two are very different. Someone
        mentioned the other day that his daughter had just
        adopted a baby boy and all I could think of was how much
        the baby's birth mom is hurting right now, the agony she
        is living, to which she is doomed for the rest of her
        life. I wanted to cry. I could not share in the happiness
        and congratulations of his daughter. It was too hard. I
        was feeling my feelings about the loss of my son. I am an
        out-of-the-closet birth mom now, so am free to talk at
        least, which is a help. In case you are an in-the-closet
        birth mom, I wanted to tell you there are some excellent support
        groups . . . They really help because you discover you
        aren't the only one with all those awful, painful
        feelings. Of course I knew from being in a maternity home
        that there were others like -- but once I delivered, I became
        the only one because I wasn't allowed to talk about it.
        We were all hiding and didn't know how to find each
        other. </p>
        <p>''Your perspective is one rarely acknowledged. The
        birth mom is hardly ever considered or thought of, and
        media portrayal is usually that of a selfish, slut-type
        woman.'' --<b> fridge.sally@hospital.vet.utk.edu</b> </p>
        <p>On the Dole affair and The Washington Post's decision
        not to break the story until after the election: ''Unless
        you slept through the entire campaign, you know full well
        that the vast majority of Bob Dole's attacks on Bill Clinton's
        character were directed at his public ethics and not his
        private morals . . . Bob Dole seemed reluctant even to
        fully engage himself in such legitimate arenas as
        Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate, You-Name-It-Gate. In no
        way do I condone Mr. Dole's affair, but your
        protestations of Republican hypocrisy and journalistic
        double-standards just don't wash. </p>
        <p>''By the way, you've no doubt heard about the nice
        young couple in New Jersey who apparently killed their
        new-born son. If they're smart, they'll claim they killed
        him before he fully emerged from the birth canal so they can
        argue it was a partial-birth abortion . . . I challenge
        you to explain the moral difference between killing a
        baby in the process of being born and killing it seconds
        after it has cleared the canal. I know you can't do it,
        but I would love to hear you try.'' --<b>
        cejenkin@bechtel.com</b> </p>
        <p>Politics, continued: ''Have you read about the harsh
        way Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich left their first wives?
        Phyllis Dole and Jackie Gingrich are the discarded wives,
        discarded for a younger, sleeker model . . . . I'll never know
        why more has not been written about this, especially
        since Dole and Gingrich talk about family values. These
        first wives put them through college, help pay off their
        debt and raise their children. I am 84 years old and I
        think someone needs to 'dig in' on this, don't you?'' <b>--
        Vera M. Roberts</b> </p>
        <p>On the year 2,000: ''While people may celebrate on
        Dec. 31, 1999, the only thing they will be celebrating is
        the end of 1999. The end of the millennium occurs on Dec.
        31, 2000. Unless there was a year '0,' which I doubt, the
        first 100 years ended on Dec. 31, 100, or whatever they
        called it back then. The year 2,000 will be something to
        look forward to.'' -- <strong>rjr@fed.ornl.gov </strong></p>
        <p>On the coming of spring: ''Spring officially begins
        with the Vernal Equinox which is usually around March 21.
        I agree with your comment that the best times of year are
        the last of spring and the first of autumn.'' <b>Sam Ross </b></p>
        <p>Monday's column will give you a chance to hear what
        several readers have to add to my comments about the
        death from AIDS of Knoxville artist Jan Lynch, about the
        use of metaphor, about Nostradamus -- and to read the thought-provoking
        Haiku a UT professor wrote on the coming of winter. </p>

        <font size="5">M</font>y thanks to all of you who take
        time to send along comments about and reactions to things
        you read in this space. From time to time I use a few columns
        to pass along a sampling of mail from past months. Here
        is Part II from the most recent batch: </p>
        <p>On Knoxville artist Jan Lynch and his death following
        a long, courageous and very public battle with AIDS: </p>
        <p>''What a wonderful life you describe and how sad that
        it is ending in a manner that seems to be viewed as
        'sinful' by a large number of people. Your call for
        compassion is the best response to Jan's illness and so
        many more like him who suffer not only from AIDS but from
        the stigma attached to it. I have lived in Knoxville all
        my life and continue to hope that all of us can 'grow up'
        and be more accepting of and loving toward each other. I hate
        to say that I continue to be sadly disappointed in our
        lack of understanding and compassion regarding things we
        fear or don't understand.'' </p>
        <p><strong>-- Cynthia J. Reese </strong></p>
        <p>A different viewpoint: </p>
        <p>''The bottom line seems to be that if your friend had
        obeyed the laws of God concerning sex, he would still be
        living, taking pictures, being artistic, etc. Too bad.
        The Deceiver does come to rob, kill and destroy, but so much
        so when the deceived is a willing victim. You can portray
        people like your friend with as much compassion as you
        like. I, too, extend compassion to him in his dying. But
        you said nothing about whether his soul was prepared to
        meet God. If he was not prepared and you said nothing to
        him about the Savior, then you are only playing games,
        and you lack compassion. It would be such a shame to
        suffer so here on earth and in the hereafter, too.'' </p>
        <p><b>-- Alma Joan Brock, Powell</b> </p>
        <p>On the startling accuracy of Nostradamus' predictions,
        which he said came from God-given talent: </p>
        <p>''I attribute Nostradamus' powers to a demonic rather
        than godly source (because of) his methods . . . you
        refer to his use of a crystal ball and that he 'stared
        into a brass bow filled with water' . . . his 'psychic
        powers,' how he engaged in 'self-hypnosis' and astrology.
        All these methods fall into the category normally labeled
        'occult.' Scripture is very harsh, very clear, and very
        consistent in its condemnation of occult practices. </p>
        <p>''Rather than using occultic means, people are to seek
        God through prayer. Today we think this distinction is
        narrow-minded and limits us too much from exploring a
        variety of 'spiritualities.' But Scripture is clear that
        it is impossible to receive information from God by
        employing occultic practices, no matter how sincere our
        intentions. To borrow a couple of scriptural analogies,
        you can't get fresh water from a cesspool, nor can one expect
        good fruit from a diseased plant. Likewise we can't
        expect to get in touch with a benevolent Spirit through
        evil means.'' </p>
        <p><b>-- C. Morgan Trotter, Lenoir City</b> </p>
        <p>On language and the mischief it causes: </p>
        <p>A reader sent me a poem from Story magazine which
        proves how careless we get in every-day talk. For
        example, what do we mean when we say ''pre-sliced.''
        Sliced is sliced, so pre-sliced is, what? Whole. </p>
        <p>''We float a metaphor until it fails: 'The steam was
        taken out of the President's sails.' We drown correctness
        in polluted waters: 'Woman admits to allegedly killing
        her daughters' . . . '' </p>
        <p>And what on earth is past history? </p>
        <p>Poetry, continued: </p>
        <p><b>Frank K. Robinson,</b> Professor of English at the
        University of Tennessee, wrote a delightful letter
        spurred by my mention of ''Knoxville: Summer of 1915,''
        Samuel Barber's piece based on James Agee's words. As an
        aside, Dr. Robinson included a Haiku he wrote which he
        said came to mind after my tribute to this in-between

<!--SUBHEAD-->        </font><p><font size="3"><i>By Ina Hughs News-Sentinel

        </font><font size="5">S</font>ome leftover turkey talk,
        now that the last sandwich is gone, the pilgrims once
        again rest in peace after rising up for the proper
        blessings -- and all the wild Indians back in school. </p>
        <p>I couldn't help but think about the gladiators this
        Thanksgiving as I lie on the sofa in my mother's living
        room, limp from chewing and swallowing, to watch some
        serious football. </p>
        <p>Because I was visiting family in Virginia, you
        couldn't have convinced a person in the room that it was
        ''just a game.'' First there were the Redskins, and we
        all know what happened to them. </p>
        <p>Then, as if that was not enough, Virginia Tech
        (rough-neck good old boys who spit tobacco and never put
        their napkin in their lap) beat Virginia (bow-tied
        gentlemen who say ''oot'' and ''aboot'' and all grow up
        to make their daddies proud). Rivalries there are even
        worse than Florida and Tennessee, if you can believe
        that. </p>
        <p>There was still grief in my mother's voice when I
        called Sunday night to thank her for the visit. Like a
        good daughter, I told her this too will pass -- like all
        sorrows do in time . . . which got her off again on the
        passing game and how football has become a matter of
        defense and Virginia needs to get a grip. Or maybe fire
        the coach. Then she said again for the fifty-leventh time,
        ''I have quit the Redskins.'' </p>
        <p>To which I said, ''Liar, liar, pants are on fire . . .
        '' An empty threat I'd heard before. </p>
        <p>I say all this to explain why I thought of the
        gladiators. There was almost as much violence and verbal
        scrimmaging going on there in our living room as there
        was on the field. There was meanness in our voices.
        Burrowed brows, slammed fists, stomping and grunting when
        this player got zapped, shouting and high-fives when that
        one did. </p>
        <p>''Kill-em!'' and ''You throw like a girl!'' we yelled
        out, lost in the grit and gore of what we were watching
        -- and we are, I promise you, a very nice family. We
        wouldn't hurt a flea, but put us in front of the Redskins
        and the Cavaliers, and the change is about as subtle as a
        bunch of werewolves at midnight. </p>
        <p>At halftime, when we made a 10-yard dash to the
        kitchen as if we hadn't just polished off more food than
        some people see in a whole winter, I reminded them of the
        bet we made and how the loser of the Cowboy-Redskin game
        had to buy the winner a gift from the Craft Fair that we
        all planned to attend if we didn't all have heart attacks
        first. </p>
        <p>They gave me a stony look, at which I allowed as how
        it might not be good for mother's blood pressure to get
        so worked up, and if my sister took every disappointment
        as hard as she did when Frerotte got sacked, she'd never
        live to see her grandchildren play Little League. </p>
        <p>(Did I mention I myself am a Dallas fan? If it weren't
        for their cheerleaders, I'd probably be at least as loyal
        a Cowboy as they are Redskin.) </p>
        <p>''The fat lady hasn't sung,'' they snapped. </p>
        <p>We tried to laugh about the rivalry, but it wasn't
        very convincing. </p>
        <p>What made me think about the gladiators was how
        IMPORTANT football rivalries have become, how much
        blood-letting is done over referee calls and first downs.
        It releases tensions, we say. </p>
        <p>And it's harmless -- unless of course your career
        depends on the score or your spinal cord snaps in a
        pile-up. </p>
        <p>Maybe we should settle all our rivalries this way, let
        all our meanness out in such ''good fun,'' fight out our
        difference on the field instead of in town halls and
        church sanctuaries. We could have the Liberals against
        the Conservatives, Pro-Choicers playing the Anti's. </p>
        <p>The NRA up against the Brady Billers. Vegetarians
        versus the Ducks Unlimiteds. </p>
        <p>I don't know. It's just an idea, and while it may
        divide families and give parents indigestion at
        Thanksgiving trying to be nice to their wayward turncoat
        children -- it would give us all a chance to stomp and
        salivate -- even ''hate'' each other -- all in good fun. </p>

				<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n her letter to the editor last Thursday, Mrs. Eddie Akers reminds us of the importance of marking Pearl Harbor Day on our calendars. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;I would like to know that the true story of Pearl Harbor remains in our history just the way it really happened,&#39;&#39; she writes.
<P>   As the years pass, there are fewer and fewer among us who can tell from experience exactly what happened. Pretty soon now it will be up to the movie companies and textbook artists to re-enact that Dec. 7, 1941 -- the day President Franklin D. Roosevelt said would &#39;&#39;live in infamy.&#39;&#39;
<P>   If we counted birthdays the way the Chinese do, I would have been 7 months old when it happened. By our standards, I was two months away from existing.
<P>   Here are the bare facts of the attack as I found them in The People&#39;s Almanac:
<P>   Admiral Nagumo&#39;s strike force of six carriers, supported by battleships and cruisers, attacked a U.S. fleet of 94 ships at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The two-hour surprise blow by 368 bombers and fighters, flying in two waves from a fleet position 275 miles north of Oahu, heavily damaged or sank 19 ships including all U.S. battleships except the Pennsylvania, then in drydock.
<P>   One-third of the U.S. naval officers were on shore leave. Only one-fourth of the antiaircraft guns were manned. Military planes on Oahu were parked in clusters, wing tip to wing tip, to reduce the problem of impending sabotage, and their pilots were off duty, subject to a four-hour call.
<P>    The Japanese lost only 19 planes. U.S. casualties: 3,457 soldiers, sailors, civilians, with property damage into the millions. Full details of actual U.S. losses were kept secret for a year.
<P>   An article by John Lang from the Scripps Howard News Service which ran in this space yesterday -- Sam Venable being on vacation -- tells the amazing story of how one of those survivors, a marine bugler aboard the USS West Virginia, became friends five years ago with a retired Japanese Admiral named Zejii Abe. Abe had come to visit Pearl Harbor and Fisk happened to be there on one of his own return trips. Turns out Abe had been one of the Japanese pilots who bombed Pearl Harbor that infamous morning. When the two of the parted, Abe gave Fisk $300, asking that two roses be placed every month in the shrine room of the Arizona, one for each of them, as a way of saying, &#39;&#39;I&#39;m sorry.&#39;&#39;
<P>   In the book, &#39;&#39;Oh Say Can You See,&#39;&#39; historians have put together -- with the blessings of the Chicago Historical Society and Sen. Bill Bradley, among others -- what they call &#39;&#39;unexpected anecdotes about American history&#39;&#39; which teachers and textbooks probably fail to mention. One of these is worth telling this December 7, especially since strides in communication make it such a thoughtful what-if story.
<P>  Though Americans had &#39;&#39;magic&#39;&#39; on their side, it couldn&#39;t save them.  Two weeks before Pearl Harbor, a new U.S. intelligence decoder system named &#39;&#39;Magic&#39;&#39; had intercepted and unscrambled a Japanese message that indicated the Japanese were likely to strike, and an alert to that effect had been sent to all Pacific forces. On Dec. 7, 1941, &#39;&#39;Magic&#39;&#39; decoded a message that said the Japanese ambassador in Washington had been secretly instructed to break off diplomatic relations at precisely 1 p.m. Washington time.
<P>   The attack was under way. Since military communications were down at that moment, the warning of imminent war had to be sent via Western Union. The telegram went out at 11:30 a.m. Washington time and arrived in Honolulu an hour and a half before the dawn attack. The message was given to Tadao Fuchikami, a Japanese-American messenger boy at Western Union, who set out on his bicycle, message in hand, for Fort Shafter.
<P>   When the bombs started falling, the kid fell into a ditch, covered his head and stayed there until the skies were clear.
<P>   At which point, he got back on his bike and pedaled off on his mission, arriving with his message eight and a half hours after it was sent.

<!--SUBHEAD-->        <p><font size="2"><i>By Ina Hughs, News-Sentinel
        columnist</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="7">F</font>or the past 10 years or so, I've
        carried a Swiss Army-type knife on my key ring. </p>
        <p>It's come in handy a number of times, from scraping
        off bird glop from the windshield to fishing out cork
        droppings in paper cups on wine-and-cheese picnics. I've
        even filed my fingernails under the table during a few
        really, really boring meetings. The little toothpick
        thing was lost a long time ago, but having been raised to
        believe only gangsters and scum pick or floss anywhere
        but in the privacy of their own bathroom with the door
        closed, I'm better off without it. </p>
        <p>The blades on the knife are pretty sharp considering
        their size -- strong enough to jimmy open locked
        suitcases and cut through itchy tags that hide in your
        clothes. The blades have tiny grooves on them to help
        people get them open quick and easy with their
        fingernails, although my nails are too short. I use my
        teeth, but it doesn't slow me down a bit. (Long
        fingernails just mean my kids would always be asking me
        to tickle them in church.) </p>
        <p>My key-ring knife is such a handy item, I've given
        several as graduation or birthday gifts, but now I wonder
        if it might get some unsuspecting soul in trouble with
        the law. </p>
        <p>Dustin Seal -- the 17-year-old Powell High School
        student expelled last week for having a knife in his
        glove compartment -- might agree. </p>
        <p>The previous Friday night at a football game,
        officials evidently got excited when they saw ''a glint''
        under the jacket of a friend of Dustin's. When they frisked
        the boys, they found the ''glint'' was neither a gun nor
        a liquor bottle, which is what they were on the lookout
        for. It was the kid's trumpet. Both Dustin and his friend
        play in the school band. </p>
        <p>Not finding any trouble there, the officials decided
        to search Dustin's car, and there they found a knife in
        the glove compartment. Also found was a pack of
        cigarettes and ''some drugs.'' The drugs turned out to be
        penicillin Dustin's mother had been prescribed. The knife
        evidently belonged to a friend, and Dustin didn't know it
        was there. </p>
        <p>Following the ''zero tolerance'' law, Dustin was
        expelled for a year. It probably didn't help that tobacco
        and ''drugs'' had been found along with the knife. </p>
        <p>I am as intolerant as you can get when it comes to gun
        laws, but it seems to me this is a little silly. </p>
        <p>While Dad and his friends can tote a small arsenal, go
        to gun shows, learn to build bombs and order out of a
        catalog a weapon that could flatten a whole aisle of
        Christmas shoppers in no time, this kid loses a year of
        school because he has a knife in the car's glove
        compartment? </p>
        <p>If teachers had ''searched'' my car when I was 17,
        they'd have gotten a lot more dirt than a pack of cigs
        and some medicine. There were Love comics, hooks and
        knives in my dad's tackle box, a couple of tire jacks and wrenches,
        not to mention apple cores and candy wrappers so old and molded
        they would doubtless cause a small epidemic if balled up
        and thrown at someone. </p>
        <p>Taking a kid out of school for a year, delaying his
        education and branding him as a criminal because he had a
        knife in his glove compartment at a football game --
        besides defeating the purpose of the law -- gives the impression
        that grown-ups really are the heartless enemy, especially
        those who stalk the halls waiting and almost hoping
        they'll catch some kid messing up. Which is, of course,
        the way any red-blooded American teenager views grownups.
        It's sort of the last hurrah before you go over to the
        other side as a grown-up yourself. </p>
        <p>My own son disagrees with me on this. He says Dustin
        got what he deserved. A rule is a rule. </p>
        <p>Certainly we shouldn't minimize the problem of
        violence in the schools and the fact that guns account
        for more teen deaths than all natural diseases combined,
        according to the Centers for Disease Control and
        Prevention. </p>
        <p>But kicking out a B-student for a whole year because
        he had a knife in his glove compartment is a far cry from
        catching Jack the Ripper. </p>
        <p>I sure am glad my keys didn't fall out of my pocket
        the other day when I spoke to a class of eighth-graders
        here in town. </p>

        <font size="5">H</font>aving just spent three days in bed
        with the flu, I was glad to find out that when it comes
        to surviving illnesses, we Americans have a better chance
        of beating the odds than we might think. </p>
        <p>If you add up all the statistics quoted in studies and
        recited on those disease-of-the-week TV dramas, we should
        all be calling in sick. </p>
        <p>Not that I was faking, mind you. It's been a long time
        since I had that brand of The Green Death. My teeth hurt.
        My hair tingled. My joints felt like the skeletal
        equivalent of Malfunction Junction. </p>
        <p>Tea and sympathy work wonders for most ailments, but
        all I wanted was a dark room and for the dog next door to
        get laryngitis. </p>
        <p>But sometimes we are glad we don't get what we pray
        for, and as I was coming out of the death-wish stage, I
        read an article by Bob Garfield, columnist for
        Advertising Age, which gives me hope that not only would
        I live to eat and walk again, we Americans are better off
        than we might think, medically speaking. </p>
        <p>Certainly I don't minimize the awful threat of AIDS
        and cancer, the nightmare of mental illness, the serious
        implications of abuse and the irreparable damage we do
        ourselves in polluting the environment. </p>
        <p>There's a lot of bad stuff going around, but the good
        news is that the bad news may not be as bad as statistics
        suggest. Read all the studies, pamphlets in the doctor's
        office, bulk mail solicitations, and you might think
        there's not a healthy person around. Garfield, an ad man
        and a bean counter by trade, says that many people can't
        be that sick. </p>
        <p>He takes as a for-instance, a report he read in The
        Washington Post on -- as God is his witness -- ''restless
        leg syndrome.'' Twelve million Americans, according to
        the report, suffer this affliction. That got my attention
        right away. </p>
        <p>If I have arm-wrestled my children once during church,
        I have done it a thousand times. Sometimes heads bobbed
        all along the pew from the bumps and jolts my restless
        children caused. It wasn't just their legs, either.
        Hands. Elbows. Shoulders. Tongues. </p>
        <p>The point Garfield makes is not so much about the
        prevalence of restless legs or other body parts, it's
        more to do with how many Americans suffer from these
        awful diseases. Even if you aren't a numbers person, the
        figures don't all add up. It's not just restless leg
        syndrome, it's every syndrome and disease you can think
        of. The numbers are staggering. Too staggering to
        believe: 6 to 8 million Americans with
        obsessive-compulsive disorder; 15 million with Type II
        diabetes; 5 to 10 million with elevated ocular pressure;
        20 million with impotence. </p>
        <p>Read these figures one at a time, in special articles
        about specific diseases, and it sounds awfully
        believable. Put them all together and it begins to sound
        suspicious. Your restless leg feels like it is being
        pulled. </p>
        <p>Garfield offers a runaway-train look at just one
        year's worth of medical statistics gleaned from The
        Washington Post, The New York Times and USA Today.
        Hopping on that train here for just a short ride: </p>
        <p>One million Americans with Parkinson's, 50 million
        with hypertension, 12.4 million with migraines, 28
        million with hearing loss, 10 million with
        temporomandibular joint disorders, 16 million with
        obesity, 20 million to 25 million who drink
        pesticide-contaminated water, 40 million with
        papilloma-virus . . . </p>
        <p>Garfield adds up all the statistics and finds it comes
        to a whopping 543 million disease-ridden American. </p>
        <p>Since there are only 266 million of us to begin with,
        we are a pretty sick bunch. </p>
        <p>Or else -- and this is the way Garfield figures it --
        too many of us in the media are fixated compulsively on
        certain numbers and repeat them an estimated 1.2 million
        times. </p>

        <font size="5">Y</font>es, Virginia, there is a Santa
        Claus. </p>
        <p>But, no. There's no such thing as snow. </p>
        <p>At least as predicted by weather people. </p>
        <p>Snow is just a figment of our imagination. A rumor. It
        starts out with someone checking barometric pressures and
        cloud mergers who whispers ''possibility'' under his
        breath . . . and by the time that Little Red Engine gets
        up the hill, it not only thinks it can, there are 6 to 12
        inches on the way. TV cameras rush to film gullible
        masses body-slamming into grocery stores for Duraflame
        logs and sandwich bread. People leave work to rush home
        and run a tub of water, and everything from bowling
        parties to birthings scheduled within the next 10 days
        goes to Plan B. </p>
        <p>If faith is defined as a sure belief in things not
        seen, snow is a kind of religion here in East Tennessee.
        Other than mountaintop experiences, we have little to go
        on besides optimism. </p>
        <p>Most of us around here are more familiar with the kind
        of snow you get on an old Motorola or buy in a cone at
        the beach. Maybe that's why we go bonkers at the mere
        mention of the word. </p>
        <p>Especially when coupled with ''possibility.'' </p>
        <p>All my life I have been a snow atheist. Even as a kid
        when I'd get my hopes up and my sled out, underneath it
        all I was filled with doubt. Usually justified. Only once
        do I remember a white Christmas, and wouldn't you know. </p>
        <p>I was in bed with bronchitis. </p>
        <p>This week when we got the Chicken Little chatter about
        mountains of snow up there overhead about to fall on us,
        I just shrugged and went on about my business. The
        children were quick to remind me how I stood at the
        window and laughed the night of the Blizzard of '93.
        Hours later it started, and we didn't leave the house for
        four days. I'd bah-humbugged the idea of stocking up on
        matches, milk, toilet paper, aspirin. Or to pull the long
        underwear out of the attic. It was March, for Pete's
        sake. Besides, there was plenty of canned food. </p>
        <p>As it turned out we had no food which didn't require
        technology, and tempers run short after two meals of
        low-fat Doritos and little boxes of raisins. We lost
        electricity, heat, water, lights and, before it was over,
        our minds. </p>
        <p>This week when the snow rumors started, I got six
        messages on my answering machine asking if I was
        prepared. Friends were worried. I live in the country.
        There are exposed pipes and steep driveways. We're on a
        first-name basis with emergency crews from Alcoa because
        limbs on trees out here have expert marksmanship when it
        comes to utility poles and rooftops. </p>
        <p>But even though I don't believe in snow, I'm ready for
        its coming. This is the first winter I ever owned a
        truck, a 4-wheel-drive of my very own. So I have to
        admit. I had my hopes up. Only once have I driven my
        truck ''off road,'' and that was by mistake, playing
        bumper cars through the Cedar Bluff/Truckers
        Lane/Pellissippi Parkway obstacle course and ending up
        beside a bulldozer in a pile of gravel. </p>
        <p>I asked my daughter to stay over the night of the
        supposed first-coming snowfall of the year. We'd build a
        fire and play Christmas music. Chestnuts roasting on an
        open fire and Jack Frost nipping at your nose are
        concepts hard to get worked up over when the temperature
        is in the 60s and we're all tugging at our turtlenecks,
        itching inside Christmas sweaters. </p>
        <p>Next morning, we woke up to the brown winter woodland,
        bare as undriven snow. The only ''winter wonderland''
        thing about it was how, once again, I wondered why I'd
        even half expected sleigh bells and snowdrifts. </p>
        <p>I knew better. </p>
        <p>Now, mind you, as I write this, there are still rumors
        of snow wars in the air. Twice today I've heard that
        possibility word, the word which seems to be the
        call-to-worship for the snow-falling faithful. If it does
        snow, my 4-wheel invites your 4-wheel over for a romp in
        the snow. </p>
        <p>I'll be inside by the fire. Eating crow. </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        <p><font size="2"><i>By Ina Hughs News-Sentinel Columnist</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">I</font> ran into some old friends the
        other day in the bookstore. You probably know them, too. </p>
        <p>They have no last name, but were the middle-class,
        American Dream family in schools across the country:
        Father, Mother, a first-born son named, I suppose,
        Richard, Jr. </p>
        <p>Dick for short. </p>
        <p>Next came Jane, then baby Sally. There was a cocker
        spaniel, a yellow cat and a set of visiting grandparents
        who both wore glasses. </p>
        <p>We saw Spot run in the house carrying the evening
        newspaper in his never-drooling mouth, and Mother handing
        Father his slippers, but the world outside never
        interrupted the Dick and Jane family's domestic
        adventures. No stock market crash. No Holocaust. No
        polio. No Korean War. No Sputniks, Edsels or civil-rights
        marches. No Betty Friedan. </p>
        <p><b>Look at Father:</b> He looks, come to think of it,
        like an over-the-hill Ken. Maybe Ken is his great
        grandson. Father wore a three-piece suit and a fedora,
        except on weekends when he raked leaves in a V-neck. He
        drove a hunched sedan the color of Elvis' carpet at
        Graceland, but as the family grew, he bought a
        zippidy-doo-dah blue wagon that, compared to today's Jeep
        Cherokee, looked like an ocean liner. </p>
        <p><b>I see Mother:</b> Never ''Mom'' or ''Mama'' --
        which sounded fishy at first because calling your mama
        ''Mother'' where I came from was as unthinkable as
        calling her by her first name. A mother was a noun, not a
        person. But after a few turns around the Red Robin
        Reading Group, the name suited. She was the Mother of all
        mothers. The only difference between her and the sacred
        version was that she had blond hair. Maybe that's what
        made her even more a middle-class white icon than Harriet
        Nelson, Donna Reed or June Cleaver. They had dark hair.
        Mother was a day-glow blond, Marilyn Monroe in an A-cup
        and apron. </p>
        <p>Her voice, of course, sounded altogether different
        from Marilyn Monroe's since all her speaking parts were
        stammered out phonetically by readers yet unskilled in
        the nuance of speech and more into pleasing the teacher
        than following plot or getting into literary criticism.
        It didn't matter what any of them did as long as you
        pronounced it properly. </p>
        <p>This mother had no first name, which seemed logical to
        me at the time, but I'm glad to say is something my
        daughters would definitely have picked up on when they
        were in the first grade. They'd also have asked a bunch
        of embarrassing questions about how come Dick and Jane's
        mother was so different from theirs. Mother carried
        pocketbooks for every outfit, didn't own a single jogging
        suit, never whipped out a Mrs. Paul's fish stick and a
        side of (canned) applesauce for dinner, and never, no
        never, did Mother furrow her brows. </p>
        <p><b>Mother sews</b> . . . <b>Mother knits</b> . . . <b>See
        &127;Mother pet Puff:</b> My daughters never saw their
        mother sew, and for me to muster the patience to knit,
        I'd have to be on Valium. We didn't allow cats in our
        house, but if we had, we'd never have named one Puff. </p>
        <p>I don't remember Dick and Jane doing anything very
        exciting. All they did was run and jump. Too bad they
        never came home after school with me. I'd have shown them
        what fun was: water balloon fights, spying on the
        sixth-graders smoking behind the drugstore, crank-calling
        folks and asking if they had Prince Albert in a can. </p>
        <p>My favorite member of the family was Sally, because
        when I was in the first grade, my sister Anne was born.
        By the time I advanced beyond one-syllable words in Dick
        and Jane's world, Anne looked just like curly-headed baby
        Sally, down to her high-top white shoes. </p>
        <p>That's why this Christmas I'm sending Anne, now a
        physician in California with a grown Jane and Sally of
        her own, a copy of the new behind-the-scenes story of
        ''Growing Up with Dick and Jane'' by Carole Kismaric and
        Marvin Heiferman. It's everything we never wondered, but
        still have fun reading about. </p>
        <p>Old pals should get in touch at Christmas. </p>

        <font size="5">I</font>f you're looking for Jesus this
        Christmas, check the Internet. </p>
        <p>It may seem heresy to some, to others, a distasteful
        Saturday Night Live skit -- but today's hillside chorus
        of angels might give out Web sites rather than a street
        address in Bethlehem: '' . . . and ye shall find the Babe

        <p>Faster than a shepherd's bare feet can hasten to the
        manger, you can join thousands of Christians across the
        world for worship, fellowship, healing, testimonials,
        study, political activism and Christian shopping. There
        are literally hundreds of thousands of ''hits'' on the
        Internet where Christians can gather in his name and
        share their faith, doubts, problems and victories. </p>
        <p>Here is a small sampling of topics that come by the
        screens-full when you search the word Jesus: </p>

        <p>Monday morning I hopped aboard an America Online
        search engine, making a stop at a Christianity chat room
        called ''Sanctuary.'' Here's part of that conversation --
        pretty boring stuff, which surprised me since it was
        Christmas Eve eve: </p>
        <p><em>InaH:</em> Hi <br>
        Siboney100: Hello, sweetie <br>
        Blessedn96: Happy Birthday &gt; i.e. MERRY CHRISTMAS <br>
        Srg Smilly: Hello <br>
        Siboney100: Hello Hon <br>
        Srg Smilly: Is this something private? If it is I'll
        leave. <br>
        Siboney100: No don't leave. STAY <br>
        Srg Smilly: OK. Welcome RoyalBlood <br>
        Srg Smilly: Does InaH know how to type? <br>
        <em>InaH:</em> Yes. But I don't know what to say. <br>
        Srg Smilly: Say anything. <br>
        <em>InaH:</em> How do y'all feel about praying Online.
        Does it help? <br>
        DaleEu: YES! <br>
        Srg Smilly: Do any of you have ALCHOL (sic) problems? <br>
        DaleEu: Yes, I do. Several. <br>
        <em>InaH:</em> Is Jesus on the Internet? <br>
        DaleEu: Jesus is everywhere. <br>
        Srg Smilly: Oh, Ina. I can send you this letter that's
        written from Jesus, and it talks about people not talking
        about him this season. </p>
        <p>In Saturday's column, I'll share some of that letter,
        which Srg Smilly sent asking me and others in the chat
        room to pass it along as part of our Christmas
        witnessing. </p>
        <p>After doing a quick ''member profile,'' I learned Srg
        Smilly is a 14-year-old kid who lists his main interests
        as ''GIRLS'' and ''Listening to Christian music.'' His
        favorite quote is a good one any time of the year, but
        especially today: </p>
        <p>Thou shalt worship the Lord your God with all your
        heart, mind and strength. </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        <p><font size="2"><i>By Ina Hughs News-Sentinel Columnist</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">Y</font>ou probably noticed during your
        Christmas shopping that there has been a population
        explosion among angels. They're everywhere, and it's not
        just a seasonal thing. People wear them in their lapels,
        use them as bookends, have them inscribed on oven mitts
        and hair clips. I even found a bag of angel pasta. </p>
        <p>In Biblical times, angels were more like messengers
        than decorations or guardians -- a kind of heavenly
        Western Union delivery person, announcing important
        information, bringing a warning, or explaining an earthly
        event. For centuries the Judeo-Christian tradition
        depended on angels, earthly and otherwise, to get the
        story out. Oral tradition carried the faith from one
        generation to the next, saints and angels being those who
        led the troops either by sacrifice or example. </p>
        <p>As time went on, that explosive message first sung by
        angels to a handful of shepherds got sent over radio
        wires, made into movies and televised via satellite for
        all the world to see. </p>
        <p>But no medium -- angels included -- has matched what
        the computer is doing to ''spread the word.'' Computer
        evangelism has impacted personal faith and theology in a
        way nothing else has in all the years since religion
        first met technology five centuries ago as Sumerians,
        seeking a better way to organize and preserve the
        spiritual underpinnings of their lives, began etching
        their hopes and fears in cuneiform. </p>
        <p>Between Nov. 25 and Dec. 9 of this year, Christianity
        Online -- one of thousands of sites dedicated to the
        Christmas faith -- did a random survey among 1,153 of its
        subscribers. Over 55 percent of those surveyed said they
        had shared their religious beliefs with someone they
        didn't know, either by chatting online with them or by
        sending them e-mail. Over 63 percent said their own
        spiritual life had been enriched by online experiences. </p>
        <p>Ninety-three percent were interested in forming
        evangelistic teams to witness in other chat areas
        throughout the Internet. </p>
        <p>According to a study done by Time magazine, among the
        most popular sites found in this ''high-speed spiritual
        bazaar'' are newsgroups like <a
        href="news:alt.fan.jesus-christ"><b>alt.fan.jesus-christ</b></a>
        and <a href="news:alt.religion.scientology"><b>alt.religion.scientology</b></a>
        -- although the sky is almost literally the limit. There
        are over 20,000 such groups offered on Usenet alone. </p>
        <p>Even the technophobic Amish are online. </p>
        <p>The example Time gives for topics tackled in these
        ''religious'' chat rooms is this AOL query recently up
        for discussion: </p>
        <p>Is it OK to have a pot-bellied pig as a pet if you
        keep a kosher kitchen? </p>
        <p>The answer? Probably. As long as you don't plan to eat
        it. </p>
        <p>My own ''epiphanies'' on the Internet have been less
        humorous but certainly more thought-provoking. I find it
        encouraging that there are a lot of people who, with the
        anonymity allowed in cyberspace's great ''cathedral of
        the mind,'' are daring to question reality as we know it,
        to be less interested in settling old scores than finding
        new insight. Sometimes I have to remind myself of that
        balance, especially when I come across the rabid anti's
        who use as a disguise for bigotry a foam-at-the-mouth God
        whose rules are everything but Golden. </p>
        <p>But then there was the Christmas letter I got ''from
        Jesus'' -- by way of a 14-year-old boy in one of the
        religious chat rooms two days before Christmas. In the
        letter Jesus tells this story: </p>
        <p>One day he sees a man sitting on the steps of a very
        exclusive church, head in hands. Jesus asks him what's
        the matter and he says the folks inside turned him away
        because they didn't think he was good enough, didn't wear
        the right clothes, have the right manners, couldn't
        conform to their lifestyle and social outlook. </p>
        <p>Jesus puts his arms around the fellow and says, ''Hey.
        I know just how you feel. I've been waiting to get inside
        that same church for years, and they won't let me in
        either.'' </p>

        <font size="5">A</font> hand-written note posted
        Christmas Eve on the drive-through window at an Alcoa
        Highway Hardee's is, indeed, a sign of the times. It
        reads: ''I'VE GOT TICKLE ME ELMO. WILL SELL FOR THE RIGHT
        PRICE.'' </p>
        <p>''The right price,'' we found out in news stories
        documenting the lengths to which parents will go to do
        Santa right, is way over budget. </p>
        <p>The scroungy little doll even made prime time news
        Christmas Eve when a local children's agency sent out a
        bulletin that they had three Elmos they'd give to the
        highest bidder. That way you could make more than your
        own child happy by forking over a month's worth of
        grocery money for the hottest toy of the season. </p>
        <p>It's easy to get sanctimonious and preachy about this
        kind of thing, especially when your kids are grown and
        the things on their wish list are more cost-effective
        than a stuffed doll that giggles on cue. Grown children
        at least have sense enough to know people don't,
        shouldn't, can't and mustn't come to expect to get
        everything they want -- even at Christmas. </p>
        <p>Still, most parents want to make it happen on
        Christmas morning, especially for the little ones. I've
        certainly gone to outrageous extremes to find the perfect
        toy -- walking the streets and spending hours on the
        phone hunting down a Nerf bow and arrow set, a Star Wars
        R2D2, a Mrs. Beasley doll. I once made a zillion
        whiney-voice phone calls in search of a REAL cash
        register for a budding 5-year-old merchant who put it at
        the top of her list. She didn't get it, although I did
        eventually find one in a Danville, Va., warehouse, but
        they wanted $200 cash upfront, plus $100 for shipping. </p>
        <p>Maybe Tickle Me Elmo has inner beauty. People
        shouldn't be judged by their looks, we tell our children,
        so it stands to reason animal things shouldn't either.
        I've never actually played with Elmo, giggle for giggle,
        but he/she certainly doesn't have a lot of charisma on
        first glance. </p>
        <p>But then, neither did the Cabbage Patch dolls, which
        may still set the record for Christmas mania. They have a
        face only a mother could love. If your neighbor came home
        from the hospital showing off a new baby that actually
        looked like a Cabbage Patch newborn, it would be hard not
        to laugh. When time came to do the cute-baby ooohs and
        ahhhhs, we'd have to lie -- else we'd be saying, ''Lord,
        that's one pitiful-looking creature you got there in your
        bassinet.'' </p>
        <p>I once visited the headquarters where Cabbage Patch
        babies are born. It was one of the strangest experiences
        I've ever had, and I love babies. All kinds of babies.
        But what they pulled up out of the cabbage patch made me
        want to protest to the March of Dimes, or write a letter
        to Dr. Spock. The salespeople were dressed like
        obstetricians and used forceps to ''deliver'' the babies
        from a fake row of cabbages. </p>
        <p>Thank goodness my girls never put one of them on their
        list. It would have been a hard call. </p>
        <p>If this year's ''girl toy'' has us scratching our
        heads over the wonders of marketing, this year's ''boy
        toy'' is equally as nonplussing. Mario, Nintendo's pudgy
        little plumber, had folks scalping and hoarding
        Cabbage-Patch style this Christmas on the other side of
        the gender-toy gap. At $200 a pop, the Japanese-made
        Mario 64 game was a money-wise investment for elves
        looking for a quick buck. </p>
        <p>I can't remember a toy I would die for in my
        childhood. But I didn't play with dolls, and computer
        games hadn't yet been pulled from the cabbage patch of
        the mind. Other than Mickey Mouse watches, Duncan yo-yos
        and Flexie Flyers, I can't even remember brand names. Mr.
        Potato Head and Silly Putty were popular, but were
        neither scarce nor expensive -- and it's my theory that
        Betty Boop, Lincoln Logs, Lone Ranger lunch boxes and
        Curious George are more popular in their nostalgic
        reincarnations than they ever were in their own lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>Can you imagine what a Dick Tracy crime-fighter watch
        would cost today? </p>
        <p>(If you know where I can get one, let me know. We'll
        talk.) </p>

        <p><i>From the ranks of these outstanding young
        researchers will come tomorrow's leaders in science and
        technology, our university faculties and our Nobel
        laureates. The talents of these young professionals will
        create the world of the 21st century. -- John Gibbons,
        science and technology adviser to President Clinton.</i> </p>
        <p>Philip Jardine, an environmental researcher at Oak
        Ridge National Laboratory, is one of the nation's
        outstanding young scientists. </p>
        <p>He's got a plaque and a certificate to prove it. There
        was even a ceremony at the White House, where he and 59
        other scientists and engineers were honored with the
        first-ever Presidential Early Career Awards for
        Scientists and Engineers. </p>
        <p>''It was kind of a shock,'' he said. </p>
        <p>When the nominations were being pulled together last
        spring, his colleagues at ORNL put Jardine's name in the
        nomination pool. He was doing some research at Stanford
        at the time and was only a second-hand participant. </p>
        <p>It's a pretty neat honor. Just the citation on his
        resume no doubt will serve Jardine well as he pursues a
        research career, which currently focuses on natural
        mechanisms that affect the transport of pollutants in the
        environment. </p>
        <p>The prestigious award, however, apparently won't help
        fund Jardine's research projects, and that came as a bit
        of a surprise. </p>
        <p>The announcement in December said that award
        recipients would receive up to $500,000 over a five-year
        period to further their research, but as it turns out
        that was misleading. </p>
        <p>That kind of stipend reportedly will only be handed
        down to those who don't already have funding on the order
        of $100,000 a year. Jardine does have research backing
        from the U.S. Department of Energy, so he won't be
        receiving any additional funding -- at least that's the
        way it looks now. </p>
        <p>He's not pouting or complaining, mind you, but the
        topic of money is unavoidable these days when talking
        about science research. There just isn't enough to go
        around. </p>
        <p>Even in his relatively brief tenure in the research
        world -- he's 37 years old -- Jardine has seen budgets
        grow tighter and felt the competition for grants
        intensify. </p>
        <p>The Chicago native, who got his Ph.D. in soil
        chemistry and physics at Virginia Tech, came to the
        national lab in Tennessee partly because of the
        availability of resources. </p>
        <p>At ORNL, the federal reservation includes a National
        Environmental Research Park and great sites for field
        studies, such as the Walker Branch watershed. There also
        is a talented, broad-based scientific staff already in
        place, which presents opportunities for unique teaming
        arrangements and big projects. </p>
        <p>Jardine and other environmental scientists at Oak
        Ridge are incorporating knowledge of microbiology,
        hydraulics and other specialties into their groundwater
        studies, trying to better understand how contaminants
        bind or change in certain flow systems. They analyze
        geochemical reactions. They try to determine why
        pollutants break down in the presence of certain
        micro-organisms. </p>
        <p>Even though it was the wealth of facilities that lured
        Jardine to Oak Ridge, he thinks there is a misconception
        that ORNL and other federal labs are rolling in the green
        stuff. </p>
        <p>''I know the folks that I deal with at universities
        tend to look at national labs as having lots and lots of
        money,'' he said. </p>
        <p>That image probably works against national lab
        scientists when they submit proposals for research
        grants. Some major funding sources, such as the National
        Science Foundation, are virtually off-limits to lab
        researchers. Yet, Jardine make the point that every
        research grant he has sought over the past decade has
        been in an open competition -- never restricted to staff
        at national labs. </p>
        <p>''The only thing that saves us is we have a diverse
        team of people with the ability to do large-scale
        research you can't do anywhere else,'' he said. </p>
        <p>''It's a good selling point.''<font size="2"><strong> </strong></font></p>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->        <font size="5">S</font>ometimes you get trapped. </p>
        <p>It happens to everybody, and it happened to me a few
        days ago. </p>
        <p>There I was, slinking down in my chair at Oak Ridge
        National Laboratory's Wigner Auditorium, hoping an
        unknown ally in the crowd might yell, ''Fire!''. </p>
        <p>If you cover science, as I do on occasion, you have to
        pick your spots carefully. </p>
        <p>For instance, I monitor ORNL's weekly Technical
        Calendar and avoid -- at all costs -- seminars with
        titles like, ''Polyoxometalate Anions: Inorganic Ligands
        and Cryptands,'' which was presented recently by Michael
        Pope of Georgetown University. </p>
        <p>It's easy to get in over your head, especially if you
        write for an audience several educational notches below
        Ph.D. There are some topics I don't even pretend to
        understand. Otherwise, my editors might ask me to report
        on stuff that makes no sense whatsoever. Like politics. </p>
        <p>Anyway, I thought I was safe recently when I told the
        ORNL staff I would be on hand for the dedication ceremony
        of the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility. </p>
        <p>It seemed pretty straightforward. </p>
        <p>The Holifield accelerator nearly got killed a few
        years ago, but some innovative folks at ORNL convinced
        the U.S. Department of Energy to reconfigure the facility
        and equip it with a new, more productive research
        identity. The experimental beams will enable scientists
        to do neat things like study particles associated with
        the forming of stars and other stellar events. </p>
        <p>And the rehab project only cost about $2.6 million. By
        government standards, that investment would be a bargain
        no matter the outcome, but in this case it appears
        taxpayers really got their money's worth. </p>
        <p>Good deal. </p>
        <p>I figured I'd rush over to the Oak Ridge lab, take
        down a quote or two, grab a few hands, nod, smile, and be
        back at the office in time to churn out a story before
        attending two other news events on that day's schedule. </p>
        <p>Or so I thought. </p>
        <p>That plan fell apart as soon as I entered the ORNL
        auditorium and picked up a program. The dedication
        ceremony had tiers of speakers, stacked like a Royal
        wedding cake, one after another and grouped by category. </p>
        <p>First there was the ''Welcome'' (2 speakers), then the
        ''Introductions'' (1), ''Dedicatory Address'' (1),
        ''Remarks'' (4), ''Scientific Speakers'' (2),
        ''Acknowledgments (1) and, finally, the ''Closing
        Remarks'' (1). </p>
        <p>The beginning and the end were pretty simple. Even I
        can understand comments like, ''This is a very happy day
        for all of us!'' or ''This facility will enhance the
        nation's scientific infrastructure.'' </p>
        <p>However, like chocolate-covered nougat, the tough
        stuff was in the middle. After the fluff and
        pleasantries, and concerns about the federal budget's
        impact on science research in general, there was real
        talk about real physics. </p>
        <p>Uh-oh. </p>
        <p>The first time I heard the term ''neutron halo,'' I
        knew I was in trouble. By the third or fourth time, my
        eyes glazed. </p>
        <p>Next came a discussion of HF potential and harmonic
        oscillators. Some terms seemed to have geographic
        implications, like the valley of stability and the
        neutron drip line. As one speaker addressed quark effects
        and inter-stellar nucleosynthesis, my brain began to lose
        its audio feed. </p>
        <p>I apparently wasn't alone. </p>
        <p>University of Tennessee President Joe Johnson, who
        told a football story when it was his turn to speak,
        looked like he'd achieved cocoon status on the front row.
        </p>
        <p>To Johnson's credit, he showed up. His counterparts at
        Vanderbilt and Oak Ridge Associated Universities sent
        their regrets. (The hosts, however, didn't use those
        opportunities to shorten the program. In each case,
        remarks were read for the absentee speakers.) </p>
        <p>I surreptitiously surveyed the auditorium, and the
        only one I found taking notes was Lee Riedinger, UT's
        physics chairman. I'm not sure what that was all about,
        but I did spot another distinguished gentleman rustling
        papers that turned out to be his flight schedule. </p>
        <p>As one of the speakers displayed a drawing of
        something nuclear that looked like a pepperoni pizza --
        accompanied by all sorts of isotopic numbers and
        scientific symbols that can't be reproduced here -- I
        wondered how the interpreter for the hearing impaired was
        passing along that information. I watched her for a few
        minutes and decided she was faking it, giving what
        appeared to be continuous sign language for ''Etc., etc.,
        etc.'' </p>
        <p>Finally, two hours after it all began, lab physics
        chieftain Fred Bertrand marched to the microphone and
        officially proclaimed the entire affair ''stimulating.'' </p>
        <p>As for me, I simply shrugged my shoulders, confessed
        my shortcomings, and recited this bit of scientific
        scripture: </p>
        <p>''Blessed be the physicists, for they amuse
        themselves.'' </p>
        <p>Merry Christmas. </p>

        size="2"><i>By Frank Munger News-Sentinel staff writer</i></font></p>
        <p><br>
        <font size="5">L</font>ynn Jones, a rising star on
        Lockheed Martin's Oak Ridge management team a few years
        ago, is back in the Atomic City -- at least temporarily. </p>
        <p>Jones left Oak Ridge after Lockheed Martin won the
        contract to manage Sandia National Laboratories in New
        Mexico, and she currently is Sandia's vice president for
        laboratory services. </p>
        <p>She returns to Oak Ridge on assignment for Lockheed
        Martin's Energy &amp; Environment Sector, which oversees
        all of the corporation's work for the U.S. Department of
        Energy. Besides her Sandia title, she now holds the
        sector position of vice president of Oak Ridge
        operations. </p>
        <p>Jones will be taking a close look at all of Lockheed
        Martin's activities, in particular the environmental
        management work that DOE is putting up for competition in
        early 1997. </p>
        <p>Lockheed Martin hasn't officially said it will submit
        a proposal to retain that contract -- and probably won't
        until the formal guidelines are issued in February -- but
        Jones made clear the corporation plans to keep what it's
        got in Oak Ridge. </p>
        <p>''It would be very hard for us to walk away,'' she
        said. ''We really care a lot about Oak Ridge, and we want
        to stay a big player.'' </p>
        <p>Jones is coordinating the pre-proposal activities, and
        that includes talking to would-be partners for the
        upcoming bid. Naturally, she's not disclosing anything
        quite yet. </p>
        <p>''We've talked to quite a few,'' she said. ''In
        particular, this contract calls for a world-class
        environmental firm to be a major partner.'' </p>
        <p>Although Jones emphasized Lockheed Martin got a lot of
        environmental experience managing the Oak Ridge plants
        for DOE since 1984, she indicated there may be needs to
        fill in that area. </p>
        <p>In addition to the environmental management contract,
        Jones will be looking at the impacts of federal
        downsizing in Oak Ridge and trying to determine what
        Lockheed Martin can do to help with economic development.
        </p>
        <p>Economic assistance is expected to be a part of every
        contract DOE awards in the future. Instead of one big
        management contract in Oak Ridge, like the one held for
        decades by Union Carbide, the federal government is
        expected to award lots of smaller contracts in years
        ahead that outline specific tasks with defined beginnings
        and ends. </p>
        <p>''We recognize our customer needs are changing,''
        Jones said. </p>
        <p>She also will be evaluating Lockheed Martin's other
        Oak Ridge holdings, including M4 Environmental, a limited
        partnership shared with Molten Metal Technology, and the
        Energy Systems and Energy Research subsidiaries of
        Lockheed Martin that manage Oak Ridge National Laboratory
        and the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant. </p>
        <p>Jones said she's not in Oak Ridge to provide oversight
        on the Lockheed Martin companies. ''Not at all. I'm
        working with them to be Al Narath's eyes and ears.'' </p>
        <p>Narath heads the Energy &amp; Environment Sector
        headquartered in Albuquerque, N.M. </p>
        <p>* (get bullet, centered) </p>
        <p>As part of the effort to bring new work to Oak Ridge,
        Lockheed Martin is courting the military as never before
        to offset some losses in Department of Energy funding. </p>
        <p>There have been success stories already, of course,
        including Oak Ridge National Laboratory's development of
        automated ammunition supply systems for the Army's
        Crusader -- a self-propelled howitzer that's to be ready
        for 21st Century battlefields. </p>
        <p>There has been a steady stream of top military
        officials in Oak Ridge recently, and a big show is likely
        in early spring when Lt. Gen. Ronald Hite, the Army's
        deputy assistant secretary for research, development and
        acquisition returns to town. </p>
        <p>Hite is expected to bring a cart-load of generals with
        him to fully assess the Oak Ridge technological
        capabilities. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">W</font>ith federal research dollars
        scarce and competition fierce, scientists in Oak Ridge
        and elsewhere are giving project proposals a second look these
        days. They've got to make sure their requests for money
        are as good as can be. </p>
        <p>Which brings to mind this question: Are some research
        grants awarded to institutions based on name alone? </p>
        <p>''It would be impossible for me to say 'No' to that,''
        Al Trivelpiece, director of Oak Ridge National
        Laboratory, said. </p>
        <p>It's always fun to ask Trivelpiece these kind of
        broad, over-the-roof questions because he's been around,
        done this, and done that, too. He's able to draw from his
        experience for examples. </p>
        <p>The lab director makes the point that programs
        typically are on the upswing or downswing, often better
        than their reputations, sometimes worse, but rarely a
        perfect reflection of perception. </p>
        <p>For instance, Trivelpiece recalls some years ago when
        he served on the physics faculty at the University of
        Maryland. The university's physics program at the time
        was probably rated about 20th in the nation, he said, ''but
        it was substantially better than its ranking because it
        had recruited well.'' </p>
        <p>It may take a long time for reputation to catch up
        with reality in some cases. In much the same way, an
        institution's good name can outlive the good work. </p>
        <p>Trivelpiece notes there was a time when Oak Ridge
        National Laboratory was the place to be if one wanted to
        understand nuclear reactors because many of the world's
        top reactor experts were on the lab staff. </p>
        <p>''It still has that reputation, but the reality is
        most of those people have retired,'' he said. </p>
        <p>ORNL gets short-changed in other areas, Trivelpiece
        said. </p>
        <p>''We probably are a little better in high-performance
        computing than our reputation,'' he said. ''Our name is
        not likely to be of great assistance there.'' </p>
        <p>In the nuclear sciences program -- one of the top
        research priorities in Oak Ridge -- the laboratory's
        reputation can be a big help or a hindrance. </p>
        <p>ORNL's research with nuclear reactors over the years
        undoubtedly works in favor of funding for projects such
        as the upgrades of the High Flux Isotope Reactor and
        related research activities there. It also may benefit neutron
        science projects in general. </p>
        <p>''But that doesn't help us on the accelerator side,''
        said Trivelpiece, who desperately wants ORNL to acquire
        the Neutron Spallation Source. The proposed $1 billion
        particle accelerator would be used for a broad band of research
        projects. </p>
        <p>The laboratory could be penalized because it hasn't
        always maintained a large contingent of accelerator
        specialists and doesn't have much tradition. </p>
        <p>The path of life sciences, particularly the biology
        program, is another ORNL story with a twist. </p>
        <p>''I think we're in a recovery mode,'' Trivelpiece
        said. </p>
        <p>For many years, based on the celebrated work of
        Alexander Hollaender and the Russells -- Bill and Liane
        -- ORNL's biology research program flourished, beginning
        in the 1940s and lasting for decades. </p>
        <p>''It once was a mecca,'' Trivelpiece said. </p>
        <p>The Oak Ridge research continued to enjoy a good
        reputation, but the overall biology program went into
        decline in the 1980s and lost luster. </p>
        <p>According to Trivelpiece: ''They continued to pursue
        areas that didn't seem to be consistent with what funding
        sources wanted to provide money for. So it's gone down.'' </p>
        <p>ORNL's current strategy is to rebuild the biology
        program and its famed Mouse House to world-class stature,
        banking heavily on a new generation of researchers such
        as Rick Woychik and a proposed new role in the human
        genome program. </p>
        <p>''We'll gradually become a mecca again,'' Trivelpiece
        said confidently. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">A</font>sked what's keeping him busy these
        days, Alvin Weinberg's voice rose a notch as he replied,
        ''I'm nearly 82 years old . . . '' </p>
        <p>Weinberg sometimes suggests that age is slowing him
        down, but he's still got plenty on his calendar and
        plenty on his mind. </p>
        <p>For the record, he won't turn 82 until April 20, 1997. </p>
        <p>In a couple of weeks, Weinberg will deliver the Teller
        Lecture at the government's Savannah River Site in South
        Carolina. He'll talk about nuclear weapons and world
        peace and how the two should intertwine in years and
        decades ahead. </p>
        <p>Weinberg doesn't believe we'll ever again see a planet
        without atomic bombs, and he insists that learning to
        live with them remains the important issue -- even in the
        post-Cold War period. </p>
        <p>''I don't think we'll have a total abolition,'' he
        said, ''but we can reduce the number very drastically. Of
        course, even one weapon on a big city is unacceptable.'' </p>
        <p>Weinberg, a physicist who helped design the original
        plutonium-production reactors for the World War II
        Manhattan Project, is arguably Oak Ridge's most prominent
        citizen. He directed Oak Ridge National Laboratory for 18 years
        and has been a creative force in science policy
        throughout his career, as well as an international
        ambassador for peaceful uses of nuclear energy. </p>
        <p>Unlike many of his scientific colleagues, Weinberg was
        a supporter of the controversial Star War defense system
        proposed during the Reagan era of the 1980s. He saw it as
        part of a global strategy that could make the nuclear
        threat more manageable, and he still thinks that way. </p>
        <p>''A key to the transition to this 'new world' is
        development of a defensive system,'' Weinberg said. </p>
        <p>When there are 10,000 atomic weapons in the world, the
        concept of a shield to protect against incoming warheads
        is ''phony,'' he said, but it makes more sense if the
        atomic arsenal can be reduced to a few hundred. </p>
        <p>If one nation develops a capable technology for
        nuclear defense, it should be shared internationally --
        with friends and foes alike -- to improve the chances for
        longlasting peace, Weinberg said. </p>
        <p>''That's my feeling,'' he said. </p>
        <p>Weinberg is proud of his work developing and promoting
        the International Friendship Bell in Oak Ridge's Bissell
        Park. While recalling Oak Ridge's roots in war, the bell
        is a symbol of world peace and friendship. </p>
        <p>A symposium on ''Strengthening the Tradition for the
        Non-Use of Nuclear Weapons'' was held in conjunction with
        the bell's dedication in May. Weinberg said work is
        underway to make the symposium an annual event. </p>
        <p>Among his other duties, Weinberg serves on a National
        Academy of Sciences subcommittee to reassess the
        radiation doses from A-bombs dropped on Japan during the
        war. He follows current events at Oak Ridge National
        Laboratory and is particularly interested in efforts to
        create a national center for neutron science, which would
        include a new spallation source and improvements to the
        High Flux Isotope Reactor. </p>
        <p>If anyone should doubt Oak Ridge's claim to such a
        center, Weinberg is quick to remind that last year's
        Nobel Prize for Physics shared by Clifford Shull was
        based largely on pioneering neutron research conducted
        while Shull was at ORNL. </p>
        <p>And, like every other card-carrying scientist,
        Weinberg worries about funding for research and the
        general state of science in the United States. </p>
        <p>''I guess all I can say is much of our prosperity and
        well-being has depended on technological advances that
        came out of research. The basic question is whether
        science is a proper function of the federal government, and
        my deep, ingrained belief is yes, it is. You can't depend
        on the marketplace for all science research.'' </p>

<p><!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Dateline Here--><br>
<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=5>A</font> researcher at the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education has 
thrown another kink into the controversy about low-dose radiation. </p>
<p>Bill Tankersley's study shows that some nuclear workers at Oak Ridge -- 
and elsewhere -- received radiation doses significantly higher than they 
thought because records did not reflect doses at low levels. </p>
<p>This stems from the historic practice of recording a zero if the worker's 
dosimeter measured radiation at or below the ''minimum detectable level.'' </p>
<p>The MDL is the measured level at which authorities believe it is difficult to 
ascertain whether an exposure took place. It also represents a belief that 
even if a worker did receive an exposure at or below the minimum 
detectable level, it was probably insignificant from a health perspective. </p>
<p>Tankersley's research, however, found that the magnitude of unrecorded 
doses was significant in the 1940s and '50s. </p>
<p>During that period, the Atomic Energy Commission used an MDL of 30 to 
50 millirems. At the same time, film badges used to measure doses were 
changed weekly -- instead of quarterly or even annually as some radiation 
readings are handled today. </p>
<p>Therefore, an employee whose job regularly exposed him to low-level 
radiation in the range of 30 millirems could have received an unrecorded 
dose of several rems or more over his career. </p>
<p>This information might not have any direct relevance in determining whether 
an individual worker suffered health effects as a result of radiation doses, but 
Tankersley said the data could provide more insights for epidemiologists 
studying cause-and-effect issues in a population of nuclear workers. </p>
<p>''Today . . . even very low exposures are suspected of contributing to excess 
disease,'' Tankersley wrote in a paper published earlier this year in the 
Journal of Applied Occupational and Environmental Hygiene. ''Therefore, 
there is increased interest in dose previously considered unimportant.'' </p>
<p>While reviewing records at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tankersley and 
colleagues found a ''substantial and otherwise inexplicable'' increase in 
radiation dose levels among employees after 1956. </p>
<p>The increase coincided with ORNL's changeover from weekly to quarterly 
monitoring of employee doses. </p>
<p>''Although the same practice of censoring readings below (30 millirems) was 
continued, the magnitude of the possibly missed or unrecorded dose during 
the period when monitoring was done weekly was many times greater than 
that likely missed for the same reason during quarterly monitoring,'' 
Tankersley wrote. </p>
<p>He and other researchers also looked at sets of raw dosimetry data from 
workers at the Oak Ridge facilities to evaluate the reliability of low-dose 
results, which traditionally were reported as zero in employee records 
instead of the actual measurement. </p>
<p>They found that low doses -- ''even those near the zero level'' -- can be 
''rather accurately measured with a relatively large set of data.'' </p>
<p>In an interview, Tankersley said there is a level of impreciseness with any 
monitoring system, but he said it was particularly important to researchers to 
have as much actual data on radiation exposures as possible when studying 
nuclear workers. </p>
<p>The low-dose information may be helpful in explaining some reported health 
effects among workers that previously were not understood, he said. </p>
<p>Donna Cragle, who heads ORISE's Center for Epidemiologic Research, 
said epidemiologists are now trying to incorporate these findings into current 
studies and, in some instances, retrofitting old studies with new information if 
available. </p>
<p>In the study's conclusion, Tankersley wrote: </p>
<p>''It is not possible to determine accurately the fraction of total dose 
unrecorded due to procedures where all readings less than the applicable 
MDL are set to zero. However, our investigations indicate that, in some 
cases, the amount is considerable.'' </p>
<p>The administrative practice of recording zeros for radiation doses at or 
below the MDL continues today at the government's Oak Ridge plants and 
other nuclear facilities around the country. However, the minimum detectable 
level for dosimeters is much lower than it used to be, and monitoring period 
is longer, too, which reduces the chance that a significant dose of radiation 
will be missed. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, Tankersley urged authorities to change the policy and report all 
radiation doses as measured. </p>

        <font size="5">R</font>emoteuse of ORNL sophisticated
        equipment soon may be just a modem away </p>
        <p>A researcher in San Diego today can sit at her PC or
        Mac and effectively operate a $2 million electron
        transmission microscope at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. </p>
        <p>That's pretty cool. </p>
        <p>What makes it even better is that remote use of
        sophisticated science equipment soon will become a normal
        happening at ORNL. This is not a once-in-a-lifetime stunt
        set up to impress the press or grab the attention of some
        VIP in Washington. </p>
        <p>The effort to establish this capability also reflects
        an attitude that national laboratories are truly national
        resources and should be accessible to those who need
        them. </p>
        <p>''We're not ivory towers . . . at a user facility like
        this,'' said Dr. Larry Allard of ORNL's High Temperature
        Materials Lab. ''We're here to do the best we can to
        advance science in the United States, both in the
        industrial sector and in the universities. There's no
        question about that. That's our goal.'' </p>
        <p>Allard and a research colleague, Dr. Edgar Voelkl,
        recently demonstrated the remote operation, which
        currently is available for two of the microscopes at the
        materials research lab. </p>
        <p>The remote user's requirements are simple: a fairly
        speedy computer -- such as a 486-vintage PC -- and a
        special software package that costs about $200 or less. </p>
        <p>The Oak Ridge microscopes are hooked up to the
        in-house computer system, and the user basically links
        her computer to the system either through the Internet or
        more directly with ISDN telephone lines. </p>
        <p>''All you've got to do then is run our computer with
        your computer, and you're running the machine directly,''
        Allard said. </p>
        <p>Keys on the computer keyboard are used to lower or
        raise the microscope's magnification, alter the electron
        beam tilts, correct astigmatism, and scan across the
        sample specimen being studied. </p>
        <p>Oak Ridge researchers describe the present stage of
        development as relatively crude, but Voelkl already has
        enhanced the software and automation is on the way to
        make it more comfortable for users. </p>
        <p>If a researcher really wants to ''be there,'' she can
        spend another $100 or so to purchase a digital camera
        that lets the remote user maintain visual contact with
        the ORNL scientific staff assisting the work </p>
        <p>''That gives you the feeling of somebody being in the
        room with you. It's not essential, but it adds to the
        experience, and the cost is so low,'' Allard said. </p>
        <p>The amount of assistance required at ORNL depends on
        the situation. Obviously, somebody has to turn the
        microscope on, put the sample in place, and make a couple
        of adjustments. </p>
        <p>Beyond that, Allard said, ''You can have as much or as
        little local operator presence as demanded by the nature
        of the experiment and by the skill of the researcher on
        the other end.'' </p>
        <p>Industrial researchers at Dow, Ford and other big
        corporations who now travel to Oak Ridge on a regular
        basis to use equipment and to tap the lab's materials
        expertise are interested in the remote operation. </p>
        <p>So are university scientists. In fact, colleagues at
        Lehigh University are evaluating the possibilities for an
        electron microscopy course based on a regular remote
        hookup with ORNL instruments. </p>
        <p>The High Temperature Materials Lab is loaded with
        electron probes and other advanced equipment that also
        may become accessible. The concept of a virtual lab is
        becoming more and more a reality every day. </p>
        <p>Allard, a materials scientist, and Voelkl, a
        physicist, have submitted a proposal to the National
        Institutes of Justice, and they would like to develop a
        remote capability for the nation's crime labs. </p>
        <p>''This is perfect for a lot of the crime labs because
        they're overworked and underfunded,'' Allard said. </p>
        <p>At the High Temperature Materials Lab, there is a
        waiting list for use of microscopes and other costly
        research equipment. Remote operation is one way to make
        better use of the high-in-demand instruments. </p>
        <p>Instead of waiting months to get on the schedule and
        then traveling thousands of miles to conduct an
        experiment at ORNL, a researcher may take advantage of
        time on the machine that comes open at the last minute.
        It also could be an effective way for visiting scientists
        to follow-up their experiments after they return home. </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        <p><font size="2"><i>By Frank Munger News-Sentinel staff

        <p>You don't ordinarily associate military research with
        Oak Ridge National Laboratory and, in times past, that
        was just the way ORNL brass wanted it. </p>
        <p>The national lab has tried for many years to
        differentiate its broad-based science mission from that
        of its Oak Ridge sister plant, the Y-12 nuclear weapons
        factory, and the government's warhead design laboratories
        out West. </p>
        <p>''We don't make bombs'' is a common refrain from Oak
        Ridge scientists, sometimes exasperated by the public's
        -- and the news media's -- misperception of their
        research role. </p>
        <p>Nonetheless, ORNL does perform some work for the U.S.
        defense -- always has -- and it wouldn't be surprising if
        that effort picks up substantially in years ahead. </p>
        <p>The Oak Ridge projects are drawing notice, such as a
        prototype acoustical- measurement system developed for
        the U.S. Navy. </p>
        <p>The Navy, of course, likes its submarines to be quiet
        -- undetectably quiet, as far as adversaries go. However,
        in order to make sure submarines are built and maintained
        according to these unparalleled standards, the Navy had
        to come up with a way to measure underwater noise at bare
        levels that escaped conventional instruments. </p>
        <p>The problem was exacerbated by the natural background
        noises of the ocean that tend to mask the subtle, manmade
        interruptions. </p>
        <p>The new class of Navy subs was simply too quiet to
        assess with precision, even by its owners, and that's
        where Oak Ridge engineers stepped to the front. </p>
        <p>''The Seawolf in particular presented a new problem,''
        said Randall Wetherington, an electrical engineer who
        headed the project in ORNL's Instrumentation and Controls
        Division. ''Its (noise) signature was significantly below
        anything they had before. So we needed to approach this a
        different way.'' </p>
        <p>ORNL had helped the Navy with noise measurements in
        the past, mostly by amplifying the sounds picked up by
        hydrophones and then processing the data at high speeds
        with computers. </p>
        <p>The Oak Ridge lab developed an expertise in noise
        analysis decades ago as part of the nuclear reactor
        programs. Subtle noise changes can accurately reflect
        impending problems in the reactor operations. </p>
        <p>The new acoustic system put together for the Navy
        involves an elaborate underwater network of sensors
        arranged mathematically to enhance their performance.
        Electronic processors manipulate the vast signal load and digitize
        the information, which is then relayed to computers by
        fiber optics. </p>
        <p>The equipment has been deployed at the Navy's testing
        center near Eleuthera Island in the Bahamas, and it
        reportedly has met or exceeded all expectations so far. </p>
        <p>Wetherington will discuss the project in an ORNL
        Showcase lecture next month. In a recent issue of the
        ORNL Review, he offered this localized comparison of the
        technical challenge faced by lab engineers and their accomplishment: </p>
        <p>''It's the Tennessee-Alabama game at Knoxville in the
        last minute of play. The score is 28-27, and Alabama, who
        has just scored to come within one point, is lined up to
        try for a go-ahead two-point conversion. Imagine the crowd
        noise from about 100,000 people. </p>
        <p>''Now, sitting near the 50-yard line is an English
        professor with a heart condition who, in times of stress,
        calms himself by reciting aloud Edgar Allen Poe's
        'Annabelle Lee.' </p>
        <p>''This acoustic technology could pick the professor's
        poem out of all that crowd noise.'' </p>

        <font size="5">T</font>here's going to be another party
        in Oak Ridge. </p>
        <p>During the past few years, there have been a lot of
        50th-year celebrations, mostly to commemorate Oak Ridge's
        creation and subsequent events of the World War II
        Manhattan Project. </p>
        <p>This time the golden anniversary belongs to Oak Ridge
        Associated Universities, which was founded 50 years ago
        as the Oak Ridge Institute for Nuclear Studies (ORINS). </p>
        <p>ORAU is one of the least understood entities in Oak
        Ridge, and that should say a lot, because many activities
        and institutions in the Atomic City remain a puzzle to
        outsiders. </p>
        <p>The name itself is confusing to many people, some of
        whom think ORAU is a university and try to enroll in
        classes on the Oak Ridge ''campus.'' </p>
        <p>ORAU is a consortium of colleges and universities --
        including 88 Ph.D.-granting institutions -- with its
        headquarters and staff operations in Oak Ridge. In
        addition to providing services to those member
        universities, ORAU is a federal contractor and operates
        the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education for the
        U.S. Department of Energy. </p>
        <p>Nuclear research, including development of radioactive
        medicines, was the foundation for ORINS, and that remains
        a part of the mission, although it is highly diversified
        today and always changing. </p>
        <p>Ceremonies this week will mark the incorporation of
        ORINS (Oct. 15) and the first meeting of the executive
        council (Oct. 17). </p>
        <p>''It's just kind of a kickoff, a beginning of our 50th
        year,'' said Jim Drewry, acting president of ORAU and
        director of the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and
        Education. ''We're not going to make a big deal out of
        it.'' </p>
        <p>The big deal will come in April, coinciding with the
        anniversary of ORAU's first contract with the Atomic
        Energy Commission, a predecessor agency of DOE. </p>
        <p>Its work for the federal government is what makes ORAU
        different than other collections of universities that
        bond for mutual interests. The contracting role also
        helps ORAU put member universities in touch with federal
        research opportunities. </p>
        <p>Drewry said details of the spring celebration aren't
        yet worked out, but some of the ''notable people from
        ORAU's past'' will be in the spotlight. </p>
        <p>The current budget, most of which comes to the Oak
        Ridge Institute for Science and Education, is about $75
        million. That's down from last year, as is employment,
        now about 700. </p>
        <p>Even though the budget is about $5 million less than
        last year, Drewry said he is proud of the ORAU staff for
        keeping funding relatively stable. </p>
        <p>''These are hard times,'' he said. </p>
        <p>DOE remains the principal federal sponsor, but it's
        not the dominant source it once was. ORAU also does work
        for the Environmental Protection Agency, Nuclear
        Regulatory Commission and, increasingly, the Department of
        Defense. </p>
        <p>Drewry said ORAU is tackling a new national-security
        role, which will include some classified work. Part of
        the project involves training and planning for
        counter-terrorism exercises, he said. </p>
        <p>Training and education remain big components of ORAU's
        work in Oak Ridge, and the effort is more
        computer-oriented than ever before. The contractor
        organization also handles a range of environmental
        services, including sampling and site assessments, and
        Drewry said ORAU is an essential part of DOE's
        environmental cleanup effort. </p>
        <p>The Radiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training
        Site (REACTS) responds to nuclear accidents around the
        globe. The staff in Oak Ridge, headed by Dr. Robert
        Ricks, also has trained thousands of personnel in the United
        States and beyond to deal with the medical aftermath of
        radiation exposures. </p>
        <p>The rest of ORAU's nuclear package includes studies on
        genetic changes resulting from radiation exposures,
        health physics and dosimetry research, and worker health
        studies at the Center for Epidemiologic Research. </p>
        <p>There were 14 founding members of ORINS in 1946:
        University of Alabama, Auburn University, Catholic
        University of America, Duke University, Emory University,
        Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Kentucky,
        Louisiana State University, University of North Carolina, University
        of Tennessee, University of Texas, Tulane University,
        Vanderbilt University, and University of Virginia. </p>
        <p>The consortium has grown continuously, but there
        growth has been emphasized in recent years as ORAU
        accepted members outside the traditional Southeastern
        base -- such as New Mexico State, Idaho State and the
        University of Nevada at Las Vegas. </p>
        <p>ORAU also established an associate membership for
        smaller institutions, principally four-year liberals arts
        colleges, and Drewry said it's inevitable that ORAU will
        establish a program for community colleges, which form an increasingly
        important part of the educational infrastructure in the
        United States. </p>

<p><em>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge bureau</em></p>
<p>Einstein.</p>
<p>The name evokes an image of unparalleled intellectual brilliance. It's also like 
a bookmark in a history text, reminding us of the battle against fascism, 
development of the atomic bomb and physics as the supreme tool for 
understanding our world.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/mugs/Einstein.gif" alt="Einstein" align=right hspace=7 vspace=7 width=125 height=179>Albert Einstein died 41 years ago, but he is very 
much alive in contemporary culture. His face still 
adorns many T-shirts, posters and coffee mugs.</p>
<p>For many, perhaps, he's just that eccentric genius with 
the wild, white hair. </p>
<p>But there's so much more, science and beyond, and 
that's what Peter Kortman -- a Ph.D. physicist -- 
wants to share with others.</p>
<p>Dr. Kortman, who works in the classification office at the Y-12 nuclear 
weapons plant in Oak Ridge, will teach a course this fall at the University of 
Tennessee entitled, ``Einstein in Perspective.''</p>
<p>The class is part of the UT Community Program, and it's open to everyone 
who's ever been fascinated, interested or just a bit curious about Einstein. </p>
<p>No matter what you expect, you're bound to come away with more from this 
rich experience. </p>
<p>Einstein, of course, was one of the great physicists in history.</p>
<p>``It is less well known,'' according to Kortman, ``that Einstein was a master 
politician as well as an outstanding philosopher and humanist.'' </p>
<p>He was a religious man, a caring man, a man for all times. There is an Einstein 
legacy of insights into the nature of thought, living and human nature. </p>
<p>Kortman draws parallels from Einstein's model with examples from 
contemporary management literature, including the currently popular, ``The 
Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.''</p>
<p>He hopes participants in the course will use Einstein's way of measuring the 
world as a diagnostic tool and come away with a better understanding of 
themselves.</p>
<p>If that sounds a little deep, don't be intimidated. </p>
<p>Kortman said the class members themselves will set the direction and the 
tone, and he will gladly guide the Einstein discussion along any route folks 
want to take it.</p>
<p>Nor is a science background a prerequisite. </p>
<p>This isn't just an exercise for physicists, and even the science can be put into 
easily understood terms. </p>
<p>Kortman wants the Einstein experience to be individually challenging, but he 
wants it to be fun, too. </p>
<p>Here's one of his favorite Einstein quotes, which talks about the need to 
persevere.</p>
<p>``There comes a time when the mind takes a higher plane of knowledge but 
can never prove how it got there. All great discoveries have involved such a 
leap. The important thing is not to stop questioning.''</p>
<p>The Einstein course will meet four times. It will begin Thursday, Oct. 10, and 
meet for two hours (6:30-8:30 p.m.) every other Thursday evening through 
Nov. 21 at West High School.</p>
<p>The registration fee is $65. To register, call UT at 974-0150.</p>

<!--SUBHEAD--><p><font size=2><i>By Frank Munger News-Sentinel staff writer</i></font></p>
<p><!--dateline--><br>
</p>
<p>About 10 physics majors annually enter the undergraduate program at the 
University of Tennessee. </p>
<p>''That's not a lot, but it's symptomatic of physics programs across the 
country,'' said Lee Riedinger, new head of the Physics Department at 
UT-Knoxville. </p>
<p>Riedinger succeeded Bill Bugg at the helm Aug. 1. The 65-year-old Bugg 
remains on the physics faculty and will devote his energies to teaching and 
research. </p>
<p>Although fewer students are entering the program than when he was in 
college, Riedinger said the profile of a physics major is pretty much the 
same. </p>
<p>''I think it's a young person who really likes science, first of all; secondly, 
also likes mathematics a great deal and has a real mind for mathematics; and, 
thirdly, is intrigued by technology and technical things. </p>
<p>''When you combine all those things together, the answer often is physics. 
Not always, but often.'' </p>
<p>There are about 75 graduate students in the physics program. Riedinger 
includes three of the grad students and a post-doctoral resident on his 
research team, which conducts nuclear structure experiments. </p>
<p>The UT research group has submitted a research proposal for use of 
radioactive ion beams this fall at the reconfigured Holifield accelerator at 
Oak Ridge National Laboratory. </p>
<p>The new physics head is proud of his faculty, saying it is among the best, if 
not the best, on campus. The physics group boasts the only UT faculty 
member elected to the National Academy of Sciences -- Gerald Mahan -- 
and the department recently was recognized for bringing in the most research 
dollars to the university. </p>
<p>Riedinger doesn't think the Physics Department will be dramatically different 
under his leadership, but he does have a couple of changes in mind. </p>
<p>He's mulling a broader range of options for undergraduate majors, perhaps 
including a curriculum that combines physics with business and marketing. It 
would target people interested in working for a high-tech company, as 
opposed to the classical preparation for graduate school. </p>
<p>Riedinger also would like to create an advisory committee to draw more 
input from industry, particularly with a view toward redefining the 
department's educational opportunities. </p>
<p>* (get bullet, centered) </p>
<p>Here's one more reason to buck the return-to-polyester fashion trend: The 
static charge from polyester attracts radioactive particles associated with the 
decay of radon gas. </p>
<p>That issue came up again recently during an Oak Ridge visit by an esteemed 
panel of the National Research Council. </p>
<p>The group was in town to investigate technical issues associated with the 
nuclear fuel removal and subsequent cleanup of the Molten Salt Reactor 
Experiment at ORNL. </p>
<p>As the panel of scientists and other guests prepared to board a bus for a visit 
to the reactor site, there was this reminder on a message board: </p>
<p>''Wear cotton, not polyester, for tour.'' </p>
<p>* (get bullet, centered) </p>
<p>ORNL's High Flux Isotope Reactor was shut down for nearly three years in 
the late 1980s after authorities discovered that the reactor's carbon-steel 
pressure vessel had become ''embrittled'' from years of neutron 
bombardment. </p>
<p>The embrittlement issue was the subject of a seemingly endless stream of 
reviews and safety analyses. The reactor scrutiny was magnified in the wake 
of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet Ukraine. </p>
<p>There were fears that a weakened vessel might pose a safety hazard. </p>
<p>Before restart of the research reactor was approved, it was agreed that the 
operating power would be lowered from 100 to 85 megawatts to ease the 
stress. </p>
<p>That change, of course, also reduced the reactor's research qualities. </p>
<p>Since then, a series of hydrostatic pressure tests have been conducted at the 
vessel, reportedly showing it is in good shape. There are plans to return the 
power at the High Flux Isotope Reactor to 100 megawatts, if approved by 
the Department of Energy. </p>
<p>Joe Lenhard, DOE's former research chief in Oak Ridge, said he thinks 
that's a great idea, even though he concurred with the earlier decision to 
lower the power. </p>
<p>The 1980s decisionmaking process, Lenhard said, was ''super-conservative'' 
in order to appease critics and nervous administrators in Washington. </p>
<p>''There was no doubt in my mind that it would operate fine at 100 
megawatts,'' he said, ''We did it, yes, to make it obvious that we were doing 
everything possible to mitigate any possible hazard.'' </p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><em>September 16, 1996</em></td><td valign=top width=470><!--IMAGE--><h2>NEW SYSTEM CAN EVAPORATE SOME 
OF NUCLEAR WASTE PROBLEMS </h2>
<p><em>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge bureau</em></p>
<p>A new waste-evaporator system has been tested successfully at Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory, and it promises to save millions of taxpayer dollars in 
the future.</p>
<p>In the two-week demonstration at ORNL, workers used the mobile system 
to treat 22,000 gallons of low-level radioactive wastes, reducing the volume 
by 25 percent. The effort concentrated the liquid waste product, making it 
more acceptable for grouting and eventual disposal.</p>
<p>Andrew Lucero, the project manager in ORNL's Chemical Technology 
Division, said the Oak Ridge experiment drew interest from a number of 
other Department of Energy sites with waste problems. A similar system 
could be applied to the high-level nuclear wastes stored at Aiken, S.C. and 
Hanford, Wash.</p>
<p>Lucero said the evaporator could have reduced the ORNL waste volume by 
a greater percentage, but project managers wanted to leave open a variety 
of options for future treatments and didn't want to create sludges. There also 
was a concern about the nitrate concentrations, he said.</p>
<p>The evaporator system was designed and built by Delta Thermal Inc., of 
Pensacola, Fla., based on specifications from the Oak Ridge lab.</p>
<p>The mobility of the system is the primary difference from other evaporators 
that are built into process-treatment operations, Lucero said. The flexibility 
should reduce costs and increase potential usage, he said.</p>
<p>While the portable system likely will be adopted elsewhere, ORNL plans to 
continue using the evaporator to reduce the backlog of legacy wastes stored 
at Oak Ridge.</p>

<p>Vice President Al Gore is among a scant gathering of politicians who can 
talk about neutrons and actually know what he's talking about.</p>
<p>During his recent campaign visit to Oak Ridge, Gore's science familiarity 
came in handy, as he discussed the use of neutron probes for basic research 
and acknowledged the 50th anniversary of the first radioisotope shipment -- 
a millicurie of carbon-14 -- from Oak Ridge National Laboratory to a 
cancer hospital in St. Louis.</p>
<p>The combination of science and politics makes interesting friendships.</p>
<p>ORNL Director Al Trivelpiece, who was a political appointee during the 
Reagan administration, offered a brief tribute to Gore shortly before the vice 
president announced some funding gifts for the Oak Ridge lab.</p>
<p>Trivelpiece rightly called the VP one of the nation's leading science 
advocates and noted that some of ORNL's most treasured programs, such 
as the high-performance computing venture, wouldn't have been possible 
without Gore's leadership.</p>

<p>Old nuclear secrets apparently won't stymie a study of cancer deaths among 
workers at the K-25 plant in Oak Ridge.</p>
<p>Project managers at NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health) earlier complained that the study was months behind schedule 
because of delays in getting information on K-25 employee exposures.</p>
<p>Thousands of pages of historical documents were declassified at NIOSH's 
request, but there were lingering questions about data that remained 
classified because of national-security concerns.</p>
<p>One NIOSH official suggested the project, which looks at multiple myeloma 
in the Oak Ridge workforce, could be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>The problems, however, appear to be resolved by an Aug. 20 memorandum 
from the Department of Energy's Office of Security Affairs.</p>
<p>George McFadden, the director, said steps are underway to ensure that 
K-25's radiation and chemical exposure data are available to NIOSH.</p>

<p>Dr. Warren K. Sinclair, president emeritus of the National Council on 
Radiological Protection and Measurements, will visit Oak Ridge later this 
month, and he's expected to make some eye-opening comments at a dinner 
speech Sept. 26.</p>
<p>Sinclair will address the risk of cancer from low-level radiation exposures, a 
subject of continuing debate in the United States.</p>
<p>His speech at the Oak Ridge Elks Lodge is sponsored by the American 
Nuclear Society, the Health Physics Society, the American Institute of 
Chemical Engineers and the Oak Ridge League of Women Voters.</p>

<HEAD><TITLE>ORNL WANTS AN UPGRADE FOR ITS PRIZE REACTOR</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><A HREF="/"><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="A Publication of News-Sentinel Online" BORDER=0></A><center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><H2>ORNL WANTS AN UPGRADE FOR ITS PRIZE REACTOR</H2>

    Once upon a time, in the morning of the nuclear age, research reactors were taken for granted.<P>

    It seemed that every institution with even a pretense of doing serious research had a reactor housed in the corner lot, or maybe stashed behind the Physics Building.<P>

    That's no longer the case. In fact, these reactors have become quite scarce and increasingly precious to scientists and engineers who use them to teach and, most importantly, to learn about the world around us.<P>

    Currently, there are 75 operating research reactors in the United States, including 33 at universities. Another 150 have been shut down.<P>

    At one time there were six reactors in operation at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Now there is one.<P>

    That's why ORNL has proposed a $70 million program to sustain and improve its prized asset, the High Flux Isotope Reactor.<P>

    Lab officials believe HFIR, the nation's most powerful research reactor, can operate for another 40 years. That, of course, would be well beyond the reactor's life expectancy when it was built in the early 1960s.<P>

    ORNL wants to do more than just extend the reactor's life.<P>

    Colin West, a physicist at ORNL, calls the upgrade program a ``usefulness extension.''<P>

    Physical improvements should enhance each of the reactor's missions: neutron-scattering for basic research on nuclear structure; neutron-activation analysis for detection of elements at low levels; materials testing for fission and fusion programs; and production of radioactive isotopes for medicine and industrial purposes.<P>

    ``It's a beautiful reactor,'' West said.<P>

    He acknowledges that nuclear cynics may laugh at such a description, but adds, ``It was well-designed. It's safe. It operates beautifully.''<P>

    ORNL is proposing a package of projects to make the reactor better than ever. Among the major ones:<P>

    * Construction of a cold neutron source. This involves a chamber of liquid hydrogen -- at temperatures of 20 degrees Kelvin or -420 Fahrenheit-- that slows the movement of neutrons. These low-energy neutrons are influenced by even the most subtle forces, so complex phenomena can be studied more easily.<P>

    Although cold neutron sources are available in reactors at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the National Institute for Standards and Technology, the HFIR is more powerful. Thus, the neutron beams will be brighter and better for researchers.<P>

    * Installation of neutron ``guides'' to multiply the number of beams available for research. A proposed facility would be built adjacent to the reactor for researchers to conduct their experiments.<P>

    Glass guides will be bundled at an access port in the reactor and divert the flow of neutrons to locations a few hundred feet away, maximizing the research opportunities. According to West, the quality of the beams also will be enhanced by the mirrored guides that reflect neutrons without destroying them.<P>

    * A spectrum change in the center of the reactor, where californium-252 is produced. The alteration will increase the type of neutrons -- called epithermal neutrons -- needed to generate californium, a valuable radioisotope used for cancer treatments and analytical scans on airplanes.<P>

    This change should accelerate and optimize the production of californium, making it available to users on a more timely basis.<P>

    * Construction of a remote-handling facility atop the reactor. This shielded cell would allow quick processing of radioactive materials as they emerge from the reactor core. <P>

    The upgrades became more important to the lab after last year's cancellation of the Advanced Neutron Source, a proposed $3 billion research complex that would have replaced the High Flux Isotope Reactor soon after the turn of the century.<P>

    Although ORNL still hopes to get another neutron-scattering device -- the proposed Spallation Neutron Source -- for science experiments, it would not produce isotopes or have other capabilities of a nuclear reactor.<P>

    West said plans call for most changes at the High Flux Isotope Reactor to take place during a six-month period in 1999, when the reactor's beryllium reflector is scheduled for replacement. Because installing a new reflector requires dismantlement of major reactor components and takes months to accomplish, it is viewed as ideal time to do other work, he said.<P>

    ``We don't want to deprive the researchers of neutrons any longer than we have to,'' West said.<P>

<title>Pulling back on fusion research has global implications</title>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><em>September 2, 1996</em></td><td valign=top width=470><!--IMAGE--><h2>PULLING BACK ON FUSION RESEARCH 
HAS GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS </h2>
<p><em>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge bureau</em></p>
<p>Oak Ridge National Laboratory's fusion research program mirrors the 
national effort, and right now it's not a pretty sight.</p>
<p>That is not a knock on the quality of work. The science is as good as ever. 
It's more a reflection of the federal government's decelerating support, as 
evidenced by the budget dropoff in the past couple of years, and a 
recognition that the United States is no longer the international leader in 
fusion research.</p>
<p>Mike Saltmarsh, ORNL's fusion director, naturally is troubled by the turn of 
events. He sees the problem in broader terms.</p>
<p>``In the U.S., for whatever reason, we don't put so high a priority on energy 
issues as Europe and Japan,'' Saltmarsh said. ``I really do believe it's a 
mistake in view of the long-term energy options. There are very, very few of 
them.''</p>
<p>The world's dependence on fossil fuels ``is almost total,'' he said, and almost 
any move away from that dependence has significant barriers or limitations.</p>
<p>Nuclear fission, of course, has problems, regardless of whether one views 
them as technical or perceptual, Saltmarsh said. Even if waste difficulties are 
resolved, proliferation concerns will linger, he said.</p>
<p>The ORNL official said it's ``hard to believe'' that solar can become a 
primary energy source, and other options -- such as biomass and so-called 
renewables -- are needed contributors but probably not a total solution.</p>
<p>``Most analyses these days assume that you'll need a mix of everything you 
can get your hands on,'' Saltmarsh said.</p>
<p>Fusion energy involves the fusing of light nuclei, mimicking a natural process 
that takes place continually on the sun's surface.</p>
<p>Because of its great potential -- offering an unlimited fuel supply without the 
dangers and waste problems associated with nuclear fission -- fusion 
remains attractive. Fusion has been under development for decades, with 
notable progress, but it is not a short-term energy option.</p>
<p>The United States has narrowed its focus, largely because of pressures on 
the federal budget.</p>
<p>After a big budget chop last year, the Energy Department asked its Fusion 
Energy Advisory Committee to come up with ways to restructure the 
program to accommodate the budget constraint. The recommendation was 
to focus U.S. research efforts on the science of fusion and pay less attention 
to the energy goals.</p>
<p>The United States is still a partner in ITER (International Thermonuclear 
Experimental Reactor), but DOE no longer will propose to host that project 
in this country. Oak Ridge was considered a viable candidate site for the 
multi-billion-dollar fusion reactor.</p>
<p>ORNL's fusion budget, meanwhile, has dropped by about 35 percent, 
roughly the same decline as the national budget. That makes sense, 
Saltmarsh said, because the Oak Ridge lab is involved in all aspects of the 
national program.</p>
<p>The Advanced Toroidal Facility, ORNL's last experimental machine, is 
being disassembled, and useful components are being sent to fusion research 
sites across the globe -- Spain, Japan, England.</p>
<p>Some of the scientists and engineers in the lab's Fusion Energy Division are 
working on non-fusion projects where their expertise is needed and where 
funding is more plentiful.</p>
<p>This is a period of uncertainty.</p>
<p>``It's pretty nerve-wracking for people,'' Saltmarsh said. ``The general 
budget issue, of course, is pretty disturbing.''</p>
<p>For those who have spent their careers in fusion research, the U.S. pullback 
is difficult to accept. The European fusion program is now twice as large, the 
Japanese effort nearly so.</p>
<p>This is not just a provincial exercise. There are global implications. Over the 
next half-century, there will be a tremendous growth in energy consumption, 
with most of that growth taking place in developing countries.</p>
<p>New energy sources undoubtedly will be needed.</p>
<p>If efficient and environmentally friendly sources aren't available, needy 
countries will use whatever is available. And if the United States isn't a 
leader, it won't have much influence on what's used and where.</p>

<title>CLEANUP PROGRAM IS MATTER OF GIVE AND TAKE</title>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><em>August 26, 1996</em></td><td valign=top width=470><!--IMAGE--><h2>CLEANUP PROGRAM IS MATTER OF 
GIVE AND TAKE</h2>
<p><em>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge bureau</em></p>
<p>The environmental cleanup program in Oak Ridge has been in the news a lot 
lately, particularly as the U.S. Department of Energy tries to compress the 
work into a single decade.</p>
<p>Here are some items of interest:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/blkbul.gif" align=bottom width=14 height=14> When in town last week, Al Alm, DOE's assistant secretary for 
environmental management, talked about the ``exciting possibilities'' for 
success as DOE sites around the nation work cooperatively to solve 
problems.</p>
<p>A concern among some East Tennesseans is the amount of toxic and 
radioactive waste that will be shipped to Oak Ridge to be burned in the 
incinerator at the K-25 Site. DOE wants the incinerator to become a 
national resource.</p>
<p>When asked to address community concerns, Alm replied, ``I think if you 
take a look at the possibilities, there's more leaving (Oak Ridge) than 
coming.''</p>
<p>He was referring to DOE plans to ship much of the waste generated at Oak 
Ridge nuclear facilities to other locations, particularly a landfill in Utah.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/blkbul.gif" align=bottom width=14 height=14> Not all of Oak Ridge's nuclear waste, of course, will be sent elsewhere.</p>
<p>As part of its new 10-Year Plan, DOE wants to construct an ``on-site 
disposal cell'' to deal with radioactive wastes -- including those generated 
during cleanup activities.</p>
<p>Federal officials said this Oak Ridge operation could save taxpayers up to 
$700 million by reducing costs associated with transporting and disposing of 
wastes at other sites.</p>
<p>So, what is an on-site disposal cell? It sounds like a hole in the ground.</p>
<p>Bruce Kimmel, Lockheed Martin's director of environmental restoration in 
Oak Ridge, corrected that description. ``It's a lined hole in the ground,'' he 
said.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/blkbul.gif" align=bottom width=14 height=14>Who says there's no drama in environmental cleanup?</p>
<p>Alm told an Oak Ridge crowd if DOE doesn't meet its goal for opening the 
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) -- the controversial tomb for transuranic 
wastes -- ``I'm going to slit my wrist.''</p>
<p>DOE's plan calls for the New Mexico facility to begin receiving Oak Ridge 
wastes in 2002.</p>
<p>There's a new concern, however, because some of Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory's hottest wastes -- those containing radioactive californium and 
curium -- reportedly have been ruled ineligible for disposal at WIPP. The 
matter is still under discussion.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/blkbul.gif" align=bottom width=14 height=14> The Department of Energy is concerned about Lockheed Martin draining 
talent from its Oak Ridge workforce, particularly the staff that conducts 
environmental cleanup for DOE.</p>
<p>``I would say it's an issue we need to work,'' said Rod Nelson, an assistant 
manager at DOE's Oak Ridge office. Nelson declined to specify the level of 
concern, but said it would be discussed with Al Narath, who heads 
Lockheed Martin's Energy &amp; Environment Sector.</p>
<p>In the past couple of years, Lockheed Martin has transferred some of its 
environmental leadership at Oak Ridge-based Energy Systems to M4 
Environmental -- a limited partnership of Lockheed Martin and Molten 
Metal.</p>
<p>Now, three more members of Lockheed Martin's ``green team'' in Oak 
Ridge have been tapped for positions at the company's new subsidiary at 
Hanford, Wash.</p>
<p>Linc Hall, a vice president at Energy Systems, is the new president of 
Lockheed Martin Hanford, and two of his VPs will be Fran DeLozier, 
former environmental cleanup chief at Oak Ridge-based Energy Systems, 
and Harry Boston, another top environmental officer.</p>
<p>The Oak Ridge situation is in the spotlight. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary 
recently announced the environmental management portion of Lockheed 
Martin's Oak Ridge contract will be put up for competition next year.</p>
<p>``Obviously, what we need is a smooth transition here, particularly with three 
people going to Hanford,'' Nelson said.</p>
<p>Fred Mynatt, senior vice president at Energy Systems, said Lockheed 
Martin is aware of DOE's concerns. He emphasized, however, that it's a 
normal process whereby top people leave for promotions elsewhere and 
talented people come to Oak Ridge to take their place. Mynatt said the 
traffic isn't one way.</p>

INDUSTRIAL PARKS OF THE 90S</h2>
<p><em>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge bureau</em></p>
<p>The concept of eco-industrial parks is new and green, sort of a '90s thing, 
but it's probably more than you think.</p>
<p>It's about companies working together, sharing ideas, exchanging 
byproducts that otherwise would be wasted, reducing pollution and -- alas 
-- turning a profit.</p>
<p>``A lot of people, myself included, think this is the industrial park of the 
future,'' said Michelle Bell, a 26-year-old environmental engineer at Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory.</p>
<p>``You can have economic growth and create jobs without hurting the 
environment.''</p>
<p>The development is one way of applying what's known as ``industrial 
ecology,'' an emerging field that helps businesses work efficiently without 
undue side-effects on the communities in which they reside.</p>
<p>``The idea is that people can live near where they work. Typically, people 
haven't wanted to live near industrial parks because of the pollution,'' Bell 
said.</p>
<p>Some aspects of eco-industrial parks have been around for a while, but 
they're just catching hold as a viable entity in the United States.</p>
<p>Chattanooga is among four cities -- the others are Cape Charles, Va., 
Fairfield, Md., and Brownsville, Texas/Matamoros, Mexico -- that received 
grants for pilot projects from the President's Council on Sustainable 
Development. Each of the sites is developing a variation of new-age parks 
that have drawn broad interest -- and, of course, lots of questions -- from 
industry.</p>
<p>Part of the strategy is finding compatible businesses that can feed off each 
other for individual benefits and tackle problems collectively.</p>
<p>For instance, one company may generate steam as a byproduct of its 
operations. That steam may be used to heat a nearby facility. Another 
company's sulfur byproducts could be fed into startup operations at an 
industrial neighbor.</p>
<p>There are almost endless possibilities for sharing arrangements, and a 
common denominator is that potentially valuable resources aren't discarded 
as wastes, Bell said. Money is saved and, in many cases, pollution is 
averted.</p>
<p>``Finding `the fit' is a different form of economic development,'' she said.</p>
<p>While industrial neighbors traditionally have had little interaction, 
communication is vital at eco-industrial parks. All tenants may be able to 
share certain types of training or emergency response functions and 
coordinate programs that help ensure overall compliance with environmental 
regulations. They also may collectively purchase raw materials to upgrade 
the quality and lower costs</p>
<p>Bell, a native of Hendersonville, N.C., holds degrees in environmental 
engineering and science from Stanford University and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. Next month, she will start a leave of absence to 
pursue her doctorate degree at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>She became interested in eco-industrial parks through her work on 
environmental policy at the Department of Energy's laboratory in Oak Ridge.</p>
<p>Aside from the pilot projects, other communities are pursuing this kind of 
development, Bell said, citing Eugene, Ore., and Burlington, Vt. as 
examples. Minneapolis and Seattle are interested, and there are reports of 
parks in the works in Nova Scotia, Canada, and Japan, she said.</p>
<p>At Burlington, a cheesemaker's leftover whey is used by another company in 
the manufacture of plastic wrap.</p>
<p>There are even plans for ``virtual'' eco-industrial parks. That's where 
companies in the same town or region -- but not the same site -- attempt to 
share resources or work collectively in ways that improve efficiency. This 
approach is being taken by Brownsville and its sister city across the Mexican 
border, Matamoros.</p>
<p>The first notable eco-industrial park was developed at Kalundborg, 
Denmark, and it evolved by chance, without anyone planning the concept. A 
power plant and other industries simply started exchanging things and 
negotiating rights, a network emerged and pretty soon Kalundborg became 
an international model.</p>
<p>``I think this thing is really going to take off,'' Bell said, ``especially once 
these pilot projects get up and running. I have faith they will be a success.''</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><em>August 12, 1996</em></td><td valign=top width=470><h2>LOCKHEED MARTIN SMOKERS GET A 
BREAK IN ASBESTOS WORK DUTY </h2>
<p><em>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge bureau</em> </p>
<p>Cigarette smokers -- outcasts in many circles of today's society -- frequently 
complain of undue discrimination. </p>
<p>In an interesting twist at the federal plants in Oak Ridge, it's nonsmoking 
workers who claim they are the victims. </p>
<p>Lockheed Martin, the Department of Energy's chief contractor, has adopted 
a rule that allows only nonsmokers to do work with asbestos at the 
government installations. </p>
<p>The company's policy is based on evidence that smoking and inhalation of 
asbestos fibers work synergistically to magnify the risk of lung cancer more 
than tenfold. </p>
<p>``It's flat-out unfair,'' said a maintenance worker at the K-25 Site, who 
recently learned that smokers were excluded from the work pool on 
asbestos projects. </p>
<p>``They want me to get asbestos 'cause I don't smoke? My lungs don't 
matter, I guess.'' </p>
<p>When asked about the situation, Lockheed Martin's medical office provided 
these statistics to illustrate the risks of developing lung cancer: </p>
<p>* Nonsmoker and nonasbestos worker -- 11 cases of lung cancer out of 
every 100,000 people. </p>
<p>* Nonsmoker and asbestos worker -- 55 cases out 100,000. </p>
<p>* Smoker and nonasbestos worker -- 122 cases out of 100,000. </p>
<p>* Smoker and asbestos worker -- 601 cases out of 100,000. </p>
<p>Lockheed Martin justified the Oak Ridge policy in a prepared statement: </p>
<p>``Even though there is only the slightest chance that any of our workers 
would inhale asbestos -- they are required to wear respirators and other 
protective gear and follow safety procedures -- we don't want to take the 
slightest chance with a segment of our workforce that is more susceptible to 
cancer than others, so we do not assign smokers to asbestos work.'' </p>
<p align=center>* * * </p>
<p>So, what are the odds of the proposed Spallation Neutron Source actually 
being built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory? </p>
<p>Herman Postma, former ORNL director (1974-88) who now consults for 
other national labs, including Sandia and Argonne, thinks the would-be Oak 
Ridge project has a 70-30 chance of success. </p>
<p>The biggest factor, he said, will be keeping the pricetag under control. The 
cost of the project is now estimated at $1 billion. </p>
<p>The particle accelerator, which would generate neutrons for a variety of 
research efforts, has a strong science foundation, Postma said. There are 
potential research application for biology, fundamental structures and 
materials design and analysis. </p>
<p>The project is viewed by many as a replacement for another project that 
Oak Ridge lost -- the $3 billion Advanced Neutron Source, a research 
reactor complex that was a victim of the budget ax before construction ever 
got started. </p>
<p>The fact that the Spallation Neutron Source is not a nuclear reactor will be 
an advantage when promoting the project before Congress and other 
important non-technical audiences, Postma said. </p>
<p>``The word `reactor,' all by itself, sets you back about two steps,'' he said. 
``Accelerators are accepted as OK things.'' </p>
<p>The budget climate is tough, but Postma noted that Congress historically has 
been ``fairly kind'' to science -- even when funds are in short supply. </p>
<p>``Science has always taken its licks, of course, but has fared fairly well 
compared with other programs. I think most administrations pretty well 
understand that technology is one of the unique strengths of this country.'' </p>
<p>And the time may be right, even with the budget scrutiny. </p>
<p>``DOE generally tries to fight for a few large projects . . . because DOE is 
steward of certain large facilities in the United States,'' Postma said. ``This is 
the only big-time science project on their screen. Therefore, DOE is likely to 
push for it pretty strongly.'' </p>

ALGORITHM THAT SPEEDS UP 
COMPUTER'S 'BRAIN' </h2>
<p><em>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge bureau</em></p>
<p>Not all top-notch research takes place at big laboratories with big 
reputations.</p>
<p>Some of the most innovative work takes shape in small -- even obscure -- 
facilities, such as the American Welding Institute in Knoxville.</p>
<p>Although the institute's name suggests a school for blue-collar workers, it's 
actually a nonprofit research lab set up to solve technical problems for the 
U.S. welding industry.</p>
<p>It was established in 1984, with help from the White House and sponsorship 
from the American Welding Society and the Welding Research Council. 
Knoxville won a national competition to become the host site, coinciding 
with the startup of the Tennessee Technology Corridor.</p>
<p>In some ways, the institute has been a disappointment. It hasn't grown, as 
was expected, or received the level of funding that's desired. The current 
staff is about 10, and the annual budget -- $1 million -- wouldn't pay for 
utilities at many labs.</p>
<p>The institute's research, however, is thriving.</p>
<p>That was exemplified by a 1996 R&amp;D 100 Award. The award program, 
sponsored by R&amp;D Magazine, recognizes the top 100 technological 
achievements of the year.</p>
<p>Dr. Xiaoshu Xu, a 41-year-old mathematician on the AWI staff, was 
honored for his development of an algorithm that pushes the boundaries of 
artificial intelligence and helps computers solve difficult problems with 
unparalleled speed.</p>
<p>``The algorithm allows you to emulate the human brain on a computer,'' Xu 
said. ``It's not the same, but you get the idea.''</p>
<p>Xu said he began his research six years ago while working on a sensitive 
defense project related to the interpretation of radar signals. Traditional 
techniques were not meeting the needs, he said.</p>
<p>``That's all I can tell you about that,'' Xu said.</p>
<p>The procedures he developed are applied to software to ``train'' a computer 
to perform interpretive tasks, such as the processing of signals to determine 
when there's a problem.</p>
<p>The research can be used in the welding industry to locate a weld failure or 
gauge the potential for one, and the applications to other fields are virtually 
unlimited, according to the institute's president, Dr. Hans Vanderveldt.</p>
<p>Among the uses already identified: analysis of ultrasound for diagnosis of 
kidney problems; interpreting vibration waves from a helicopter gearbox to 
pinpoint hazardous abnormalities; and assessing seismic data to improve 
success rates in oil exploration.</p>
<p>Besides time-dependent phenomena, such as noise patterns, the system can 
be adapted to other tasks like the geometry of a weld ``bead'' -- the round 
crown left by a completed weld -- to determine flaws.</p>
<p>The training algorithm generates artificial neural systems that help a computer 
perform these decision-making tasks.</p>
<p>It is difficult to explain in simple language. Vanderveldt compared the 
workings of the algorithm to the early learning process with children 2 or 3 
years old.</p>
<p>For instance, he said, a parent may show a child a baseball, and the child 
responds, ``Doll.''</p>
<p>The parent replies, ``No. Ball.''</p>
<p>``You're sending a correction back,'' Vanderveldt said. ``You propagate an 
error and then you correct it, so that next time the child gets the error 
corrected.''</p>
<p>A day later child is given a different ball -- a beach ball -- and then the day 
after that another one -- a football. Each time, a response and correction 
takes place.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, the child can be shown any of the objects and is able to 
identify it as a ``ball.''</p>
<p>``No one challenges how the child did it,'' Vanderveldt said. ``If you ask him 
how to do it in precise terms, he couldn't. It's the same with this algorithm.''</p>
<p>The AWI president said the training algorithm is a form of ``back 
propagation'' used in various forms of signal processing. Xu's computer 
technology, however, works much faster than other algorithms when applied 
to particularly difficult problems, he said.</p>
<p>Researchers calculated that solving one radar-related problem with a 
standard back-propagation technology would take a 386-level personal 
computer 10 years, operating 24 hours a day. With Xu's training algorithm, 
the same computer could complete the task in six weeks.</p>
<p>``If you have a simple one it doesn't matter what you use,'' Vanderveldt said. 
``Anyone can solve the very simple problem.''</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><em>July 29, 1996</em></td><td valign=top width=470><!--IMAGE--><h2>ORNL 'BURP' CARRIES A HEFTY PRICE 
TAG</h2>
<p><em>By Frank Munger, Oak Ridge bureau</em></p>
<p>Sometimes a burp is worse than a breach of etiquette, does more than ruin a 
polite conversation at dinner.</p>
<p>That was the case earlier this year at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. An 
earth-shaking belch halted an $11 million project and forced lab scientists to 
reassess a promising -- but controversial -- waste-treatment technology 
known as ``in situ vitrification.''</p>
<p>ISV uses high-powered electrodes to melt the ground at temperatures 
reaching 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. As the molten mass cools, it forms a 
resistant glass similar to obsidian.</p>
<p>When applied to a nuclear waste pit, the concept is supposed to seal 
radioactive constituents inside a glass monolith for millions of years and keep 
those materials out of harm's way. ORNL was the first place to test the 
technology on radioactive waste, although there were some successes 
elsewhere with various wastes containing hazardous chemicals.</p>
<p>The Department of Energy-sponsored demonstration was well underway 
when the incident occurred April 21. The melt had reached the bottom of an 
underground zone where radioactive waste was dumped 40 years ago.</p>
<p>An unexpected bubble of gas within the molten mass lifted the hood covering 
the work pit. Thin shards of glass and hot gases showered the immediate 
area. There was a brief fire at the surface.</p>
<p>Project monitors were at the site, but luckily no one was injured.</p>
<p>Lots of intelligent people, however, were left scratching their heads. The 
burp wasn't supposed to happen. Precautions -- and plenty of engineering -- 
supposedly had eliminated that possibility.</p>
<p>Now, three months later, Oak Ridge authorities are preparing to resume the 
meltdown and finish the demo project. The target date for restart is Sept. 
30.</p>
<p>Damage to the hood is being repaired. Some panels have to be replaced, as 
does much of the wiring. Cost of the April messup will exceed $500,000.</p>
<p>Project officials say they've learned a lot from the burp, which was blamed 
on excessively wet conditions and an unforeseen buildup of water 
underground. The rapid melt reportedly created the unwelcome pocket of 
steam that rose to the surfaces.</p>
<p>Before the melt operation is restarted, workers will pump groundwater from 
the site to reduce chances of a repeat situation. Project leaders, however, no 
longer believe they can eliminate the possibility of a burp, and more 
emphasis will be placed on limiting the impacts.</p>
<p>More venting is to be installed, and the hood will be modified so that if 
another bubble emerges it will blow off a panel in a designated area -- where 
worker access will be restricted.</p>
<p>Just as important as structural changes is information from obtained early test 
results. The consequences of a burp aren't as bad as once feared, according 
to Harry Boston of the environmental staff.</p>
<p>``Our big concern was that we might release a cloud of radioactive gas, and 
lo and behold that did not happen,'' Boston said.</p>
<p>Data prove that nearly all of the radioactivity was contained in the 
underground melt, he said.</p>
<p>Legal issues -- as well as technical ones -- may play a role in the decision to 
restart the waste project.</p>
<p>Ralph Hutchison, a leader of the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance, 
which monitors DOE activities, said his group is considering a lawsuit to halt 
the project.</p>
<p>Hutchison said he believes there already have been violations of the National 
Environmental Policy Act, and he said an environmental impact statement 
should be completed before work continues.</p>
<p>``I'd be disappointed if the Department of Energy goes forward with a failed 
cleanup technology without a full NEPA review,'' he said. ``I think it's a 
major federal action with a potential to have a significant impact on the 
environment.''</p>
<p>Hutchison said DOE and its contractors have not addressed questions about 
the work and its potential impacts.</p>
<p>``DOE is just way out of line. If they refuse to be accountable with the law, 
then we'll go to court. It puts the public in a real difficult position.''</p>
<p>Boston said a review was done before the project started, and he said the 
accident didn't change anything regarding the environment. ``We probably 
scorched a little bit of the dirt we put down,'' he said. ``That's all.''</p>

<h2><em>ORNL creates computerized command center 
for Atlanta officers</em></h2>
<p><em>By Frank Munger, Oak Ridge bureau</em></p>
<p>One doesn't ordinarily associate fast-moving, low-cost projects with the 
federal government. Just the opposite image comes to mind: boondoggles 
born of a creeping bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, when the Atlanta Police Department desperately needed a 
computerized command center in time for the Summer Olympic Games, it 
was a federal lab -- Oak Ridge National Laboratory -- that came to the 
rescue.</p>
<p>Private companies weren't much help in this case. When approached about 
creating and setting up a system to help police cope with the influx of 2 
million people from around the world, they reportedly wanted 3 years and 
$3 million to do the job. Unfortunately, at that point, only 13 months 
remained before the Olympics began, and no treasure chest was available to 
pay the ransom.</p>
<p>ORNL researchers pulled a few rabbits out of a hat, kicked aside old rules 
for project management, and came up with a pretty nifty computer system 
for about $700,000.</p>
<p>Response to the technology has been overwhelmingly positive.</p>
<p>``It's a real eye-opener to police in general,'' said Robert Hunter, who heads 
a research group in ORNL's computational physics and engineering division. 
Hunter gave an entertaining preview of the still-evolving project in a recent 
Showcase Lecture at the laboratory.</p>
<p>Because of the time crunch on development, Atlanta PD received a working 
prototype of the system soon after work started in order to get police 
familiar with the operations. It was also important for ORNL to get 
feedback on specific police needs, so they could be incorporated on the fly.</p>
<p>The first prototype contained only 20 percent of the system's expected 
capabilities. Since then, it's been updated at three-month -- and more 
recently three-week -- intervals.</p>
<p>One big task was to support police in time of crisis. Nobody, of course, 
likes to dwell on it, but the Olympics can provide a backdrop for ugly things 
like terrorism.</p>
<p>ORNL's command-and-control system has a range of capabilities to help 
police respond to and defuse all sorts of harrowing dramas -- a hostage 
situation, riots or even Atlanta's much anticipated traffic gridlock.</p>
<p>Computer operators will have a choice of ways to view the city. They can 
call up maps, identify specific sections, zoom up for a block-by-block 
analysis, and zoom still farther until structures on top of buildings can be 
identified.</p>
<p>Color-coded graphics quickly show decision-makers what Olympic 
activities are taking place at what locations, when the crowd is arriving and 
when a particular arena is full or empty. Flashing lights will pinpoint blocked 
streets and other barriers.</p>
<p>Information on thousands of events -- social and cultural, as well as athletic 
-- has been programmed into the system.</p>
<p>If there's a problem at an Olympic venue, police can use computer animation 
to take an amazingly detailed tour inside facilities and plan the best route to a 
hot spot or develop ways to seal the area.</p>
<p>Call up another map, and operators can see in real time where police 
officers -- by name and rank -- are stationed around the city.</p>
<p>Making the most of limited resources is essential, Hunter said, because the 
Atlanta police didn't receive the funding windfall afforded to some other 
agencies. A staff of about 3,000 was needed, and the department is trying to 
do the job with 2,000, he said.</p>
<p>Besides keeping tabs on police in the field, the department will use the 
computer system to design staggered schedules, beginning in July, to make 
optimum use of personnel. The system also will allocate overtime equitably 
among the force.</p>
<p>The computer system is packed with information of potential use to police 
for this special summer. Among the protocols and procedures will be advice 
on what to do if a foreign visitor asks for asylum.</p>
<p>``The average cop doesn't get that request very often,'' Hunter said.</p>
<p>As events unfold, the system will be updated with lessons learned.</p>
<p>After the Olympics, the Atlanta police will continue to use the computer 
system for things like roll call and scheduling. It will also will be used for 
special projects, including drug enforcement, and one questioner at the 
ORNL seminar asked if there were concerns about Big Brother abusing 
individual rights with this technology.</p>
<p>Hunter replied that he didn't think the ORNL system, even though it's 
sophisticated, would provide that kind of capability.</p>
<p>Then he added jokingly, ``But if Big Brother has a budget, we'll talk to him.''</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><i>July 1, 1996</i></td><td width=470><h2>SCIENTIST WILL SHARE ON 
SABBATICAL TO HAMBURG</h2>
<p><i>By Frank Munger, Oak Ridge bureau</i></p>
<p>Steve Lindberg, one of Oak Ridge National Laboratory's top environmental 
scientists, will leave soon for a sabbatical at a German research center near 
Hamburg.</p>
<p>While there, Lindberg will share some of his innovative techniques for 
assessing mercury pollution and its movement in the environment. He also 
will help his German colleagues take measurements in the flood plain of the 
Elbe River.</p>
<p>``They have a problem not unlike what we have here in East Fork Poplar 
Creek,'' Lindberg said.</p>
<p>The mercury hazard in Oak Ridge's East Fork came from spills and 
discharges at the Y-12 plant during Cold War development of 
thermonuclear weapons. The mercury in the Elbe, which runs through 
downtown Hamburg and feeds into a major bay, is the result of 
broad-based industrial emissions in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Lindberg's research has shown how mercury in soil and vegetation volatilizes 
in response to solar radiation, interaction with various bacteria or other 
factors. After the mercury vapors are released into the atmosphere, the 
pollutant can relocate to other surfaces.</p>
<p>A better understanding of the natural cycles involved, including changes in 
mercury's chemical form, can help scientists gauge impacts on the 
environment and, ultimately, human health.</p>
<p>After a three-week stay at the GKSS Research Center, Lindberg will remain 
in Hamburg and serve as co-chair of the International Conference on 
Mercury as a Global Pollutant. The conference will be held Aug. 4-8.</p>
<p>Lindberg's sabbatical award from the International Institute of Hydrophysics 
is a big deal, and he is pleased, thankful and proud.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, the scientist is bothered that sabbaticals are 
considered almost a luxury at ORNL and other national laboratories. Unlike 
universities, which typically mandate a sabbatical every seven years for 
faculty members, the labs have no such policy or even a commitment to fund 
these leaves of absence for travel, research and renewal.</p>
<p>Lindberg thinks the time away -- especially for research treks to foreign 
laboratories -- is not just useful but vital.</p>
<p>``I've maintained for more than 20 years that it's extremely important to try 
to establish a sabbatical program that allows staff to interact in other settings. 
I think you get a whole new perspective on the way we do research, and 
you make lifelong contacts for future funding, research collaborations . . . All 
those things are critical.''</p>
<p>The 49-year-old scientist, who joined the ORNL staff in 1974, considers 
himself fortunate to have taken four sabbaticals of varying lengths in his 
career -- two in Sweden, two in Germany.</p>
<p>In 1987, after receiving an award from the Alexander von Humbolt 
Foundation, Lindberg was able to teach at the University of Gottingen in 
Germany. Because of the extended stay and the award's extra stipend, he 
also was able to take his family with him.</p>
<p>His upcoming trip will be of relatively short duration -- less than a month -- 
but Lindberg has been invited back to the German institute next summer for 
a longer period.</p>
<p>What's the ideal sabbatical?</p>
<p>``From my own experience, six months is just long enough. I think a year 
would be a bit of a luxury,'' Lindberg said.</p>
<p>Now, more than ever before, the national labs have an opportunity to share 
their unique capabilities with others around the world, whether it's in Europe 
or South America, he said. </p>
<p>Although researchers may have exhausted possible applications for their 
career's work in the United States, Lindberg noted, ``There is a huge need 
for technologies, measurements, in developing countries . . or even 
well-developed countries, which simply haven't been looking at the same 
things.''</p>

<HEAD><TITLE>CONTEMPLATE THE QUESTION: WHO NEEDS NATIONAL LABS?</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="/images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><I>June 24, 1996</I><td width=470><H2>CONTEMPLATE THE QUESTION: WHO NEEDS NATIONAL LABS?</H2>


<i>By Frank Munger, Oak Ridge bureau</I><P>

    In the very best sense of the term, Walter Massey has ``been around.''<P>

    His resume is dotted with prestigious stops in the world of science and technology.<P>

    At various times, Massey was director of Argonne National Laboratory; director of the National Science Foundation; provost and senior vice president for academic affairs at the University of California; vice president for research at the University of Chicago; and dean of physics at Brown University.<P>

    He has served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He holds honorary degrees from 20 colleges and universities.<P>

    What a career.<P>

    Massey is now president of Morehouse College, where he received his bachelors degree in physics and mathematics nearly 40 years ago. His doctorate is from Washington University.<P>

    The breadth and depth of his experience gives Massey a valuable perspective on the state of science and the institutions that conduct science research at the highest level.<P>

    When he speaks, people listen, and there was an auditorium full of listeners at Oak Ridge National Laboratory last week when Massey gave his lecture, ``National Laboratories: Who Needs Them?''<P>

    Alvin Trivelpiece, director of ORNL, joked about the topic during his introduction of Massey. ``I hope he comes up with the right answer,'' Trivelpiece said, suggesting the audience hold their applause if they heard the wrong thing.<P>

    Massey grinned and replied, ``I have two possible endings.''<P>

    Once into his talk, Massey wasted little time before reassuring the audience of scientists and engineers that he did indeed have the ``right'' answer. The national labs, of course, are needed, he said.<P>

    Massey said he's strongly convinced that the nation's investment over the past half-century has been a good one. The national labs are a great asset, he said. That does not mean, however, that the laboratories should remain in the same form, he emphasized.<P>

    He briefly recounted the history of big-time reviews of the laboratory system in the United States, including the commission headed by Peter Grace in the early 1980s and a later survey by David Packard of Hewlett-Packard fame.<P>

    In the post-Cold War era, there was the Galvin Commission, headed by former Motorola chief Robert Galvin, who concluded, ``The DOE laboratory system is broken.'' Galvin found fault all around, including the micro-management by the DOE hierarchy, Congress and the lab honchos themselves.<P>

    The Morehouse president predicted that the Galvin report won't disappear --  like so many of its predecessors -- into the ``dust bins of history.'' But he doubted that its more extreme recommendations, such as the ``corporatization'' of the laboratories, will be carried out.<P>

    Massey said he believes three aspects argue on behalf of the laboratories' continued existence:<P>

    <IMG SRC="../../images/blkbul.gif" ALT="*"> Their longevity and stability, both in personnel and facilities.<P>

    While some view this stability as staleness and think it's a deterrent to innovation, Massey said the labs are able to take a long view of things and not just do the glamorous or trendy projects.<P>

    With a wealth of talent on hand, ORNL and other labs can capitalize on unexpected findings by quickly mobilizing research teams. This wouldn't be possible if new organizational units had to be formed. Massey cited advancements in high-temperature superconductors as an example of the labs' advantage.<P>

   <IMG SRC="../../images/blkbul.gif" ALT="*"> Their ability to built and operate large and unique research facilities that are open to the entire scientific community.<P>

    Massey said he thinks this is the least controversial of the arguments. If the labs didn't exist for this purpose, then they would have to reinvented.<P>

   <IMG SRC="../../images/blkbul.gif" ALT="*"> Their ability to respond to national priorities where there is a scientific or technological component.<P>

    It's conceivable, Massey said, that universities and/or private corporations could play this role, but they aren't and probably wouldn't do it as well.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>IN THE NUCLEAR WORLD, IS GOOD NEWS, NO NEWS?</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="/images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><H2>IN THE NUCLEAR WORLD, IS GOOD NEWS, NO NEWS?</H2>

<i>By Frank Munger, Oak Ridge bureau</I><P>

    A newly published mortality study of 3,145 nuclear workers in the United States hasn't attracted much attention.<P>

    The study's principal author, Dr. Shirley Fry, said she had received no feedback. In fact, Fry said she didn't realize her work had been published until a few days ago, even though it appeared in the April issue of the Journal of Applied Occupational and Environmental Hygiene.<P>

    There could be several explanations for the general lack of notice.<P>

    For one thing, the results are pretty old. The study looked at mortality rates of these nuclear workers through 1984, and the research was completed in 1990. The preliminary findings were announced at a life-sciences symposium in Washington state in 1991, and there has been limited discussion of the work since then, mostly in a subgroup of U.S. epidemiologists who take a statistical view of disease and death in the nuclear industry.<P>

    It easy to speculate, of course, that the study was treated with a rather large yawn because the findings are mostly non-findings. No real health problems were identified within the select group of nuclear workers, even though each of the workers received a significant dose of radiation at some point in their career. <P>

    ``Their mortality experience overall is actually somewhat better than the general population and within specific areas -- such as cardiovascular disease and digestive disorders -- it is significantly better than the general population,'' Fry said.<P>

    ``Really, it's good news.''<P>

    That begs the question of whether such news gets less attention or no attention, as nuclear proponents have long proclaimed.<P>

    The study apparently sat on a shelf for an unusually long time before being published in a technical journal. Is there a bias there, perhaps, even within the world of epidemiology?<P>

    Fry, a physician and epidemiologist who's semi-retired from Oak Ridge Associated Universities, said it is sometimes difficult to get published with studies that don't uncover a lot of problems. But she declined to term it a bias.  She said a lot of papers are submitted to these journals, and those which illuminate problems may simply be more attractive to the publishers.<P>

    Plus, some researchers may be reluctant to seek publication of papers without results that pinpoint areas of concern, she said.<P>

    In an area as controversial as radiation effects, however, one would expect almost every study to be greeted with scrutiny.<P>

    The population in Fry's study included U.S. workers who had received at least 5 rems of radiation during one calendar year at least once during their careers. It's of interest that in recent years 5 rems has been the occupational limit for nuclear workers, but at the time when most of these workers received their 5-plus rems of radiation (in the 1940s and '50s), the applicable annual standard was 15 rems.<P>

    The study group included workers from 32 nuclear facilities associated with the U.S. Department of Energy, as well as seven Navy shipyards where activities associated with the nuclear-propulsion fleet took place. About 140 of the participants in the study worked at Oak Ridge nuclear facilities, with 130 of those at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and 10 at the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant.<P>

    The highest radiation exposure was 4,400 rems received by an accident victim at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Most of the worker doses were closer to the 5-rem minimum.<P>

    Within this group, as of 1984, there were no deaths observed due to Hodgkins lymphoma, malignant bone disease or cancer of the thyroid -- some of cancer types associated with radiation exposures. There also were no leukemia deaths among the workers with the longest follow-up (those who began their nuclear careers prior to 1968).<P>

    Fry said there were no statistically significant increases in death from any types of cancer observed among this worker group.<P>

    The researcher said the study generally supports a conclusion that radiation-protection standards at the nuclear facilities were effective. She also said the results refute ``to the extent that's possible'' the allegation that radiation at low doses may be more harmful per unit of dose than high-level exposures.<P>

    Although there were limitations on the study, such as the size of the worker group, Fry said the results are consistent with risk estimates.<P>

    ``It's not a real surprise that there were no major effects seen,'' she said.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>WHAT IS IT ABOUT DINOSAURS THAT'S SO FASCINATING TO KIDS?</TITLE>

<b>COLUMN</B><P>

<I>By Frank Munger, Oak Ridge bureau</i><P>
  
    Well, they're big and ferocious and scary. Just as important, perhaps, they no longer exist.<P>

    ``If there were really eight-ton carnivores running around, I'd be willing to bet kids wouldn't be so excited,'' said Dr. Michael Green, a geologist who recently got his doctorate at the University of Tennessee and joined the staff at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.<P>

    Green helped put together a week-long program at UT this summer that will give young students -- fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders -- a view of dinosaurs from a slightly different perspective. They'll learn how paleontologists come to know what they know about the ancient creatures.<P>

    Most school-age kids, of course, can quickly recite the names of their favorite dinosaurs. The youngsters may even remember how much they weighed and what they ate.<P>

    Few, however, know how scientists use bones or fossils to estimate the weight of animals that lived millions of years ago. With a replica model of T-rex, a pail of water and some simple instructions about how to do a displacement test, kids can figure it out for themselves.<P>

    That's just one of the activities in ``Beneath the Surface: Dinosaurs, Rocks and Fossils.'' Scott Hageman, a doctoral student at UT, will be the instructor. The week-long program, which begins June 17, is part of Kids U on the Knoxville campus. <P>

    Cheryl LaBerge, director of UT's community programs, said Kids U is a series of summer-long opportunities to go ``behind the scenes'' on campus and learn from the university's staff and faculty. Most of the kid-sized programs are based on actual research taking place at UT.<P>

    This is the first year for ``Beneath the Surface,'' and there are plenty of possibilities for inquisitive pre-teens.<P>

    Besides the work with dinosaurs, participants will learn how to use a compass and map to find out where they are on the campus.<P>

    There'll also be arm-waving, get-your-hands-dirty experiments that demonstrate how craters are formed. Which makes a bigger crater, a small meteor traveling at a high speed or a big projectile at low velocity?<P>

    Messy laughs, of course, will be mixed with facts, and the expectation is that kids will leave the week with fun memories and information they'll find useful for years to come.<P>

    Everybody loves to catch the bad guys, and the enterprising young sleuths will even take a ``stab'' at forensic anthropology. They'll use geologic remnants and other clues to solve a whodunit crime ``on The Hill.''<P>

    Did you realize that about half of all evidence submitted to the FBI's material science labs for crime analysis involves geologic material?<P>

    The kids will meet each day for three hours, beginning at 9 a.m. Fee for the week-long program is $79, and parents can register by phone at 974-0150. Better hurry, classes start next week.<P>

    If dinosaurs and other things found below ground aren't your kid's interest, UT is offering a range of other topics later this summer. There's even one for budding architects called, ``Design Knoxville.''<P>

    Other Kids U programs include ``Science Discovery for Girls,'' ``Wonders of the Universe,'' ``Where the Wild Things Are,'' ``Snakes Alive: Hands-on Herpetology,'' ``Adventures in Chemistry,'' ``Young Naturalists: Hands-on Ecology,'' and ``Modern Medicine, Behind the Scenes.''<P>

    Call UT for more information.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>COLLIDER GONE, NOT FORGOTTEN; DOE LOOKS AT 'LESSONS LEARNED'</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF>

E-mail:  <A HREF="mailto:73302.1254@compuserve.com">73302.1254@compuserve.com</A>

<H2>COLLIDER GONE, NOT FORGOTTEN; DOE LOOKS AT 'LESSONS LEARNED'</H2>

    The biggest science project of our time, the Superconducting Super Collider, is still drawing attention -- even though it's dead and gone.<P>

    Congress killed the SSC on Oct. 28, 1993. The reasons for the project's demise have been debated and discussed by many folks in many places since then. There still isn't much of a consensus, except in political terms. The SSC's bloated pricetag clearly became a power tool for opponents, an albatross for supporters and a disincentive for those in between.<P>

    The Department of Energy's Inspector General (IG) has come out with a new report that takes a look at ``lessons learned,'' a popular thing to do nowadays in government and business.<P>

    ``The project's cancellation ... offers a unique opportunity to analyze what went wrong, correct the mistakes and apply this knowledge to future large-scale projects,'' the authors note in the overview.<P>

    That sort of cheery spin is likely to further irritate the project's long-suffering supporters.<P>

    Dr. Alvin Trivelpiece, director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, pushed the project into being as DOE's research chief during the Reagan administration, and he passionately promoted it until the end.<P>

    When asked about the IG report, Trivelpiece said he hadn't seen it, and his tone of voice suggested that the last thing he wanted to read was yet another autopsy report on the SSC.<P>

    The Superconducting Super Collider, for those who don't remember, was to have been the world's most powerful particle accelerator, and there was an enormous competition to host the prestigious facility. Texas won the fight, but Tennessee surprised many folks with a top-flight proposal.<P>

    The SSC featured a 54-mile underground tunnel in the shape of a racetrack. High-speed collisions precipitated by rotating proton beams were expected to provide scientists with new knowledge about the basic workings of the physical world.<P>

    The science, of course, was intriguing, but the news about SSC almost always focused on the cost and that much hasn't changed. The IG report pinpoints DOE's problem with cost estimates as one of the chief culprits in the failure.<P>

    In 1989, DOE estimated the cost of completing the project at $5.9 million. By the time it was terminated four years later, the estimate had ballooned to somewhere between $11 billion and $13 billion.<P>

    The IG said part of the reason for the huge increase were major changes in the SSC design, ``even as the Congress was debating its affordability.'' Those changes included doubling the High Energy Booster from 1 trillion to 2 trillion electron volts and even altering the collider's circumference from 52 to 54 miles.<P>

    According to the IG report, DOE continued to provide Congress with lower cost estimates than those received from independent review panels providing advice on the project. In addition, the absence of a cost-control system concealed ``substantial cost overruns,'' and key issues simply weren't brought to the attention of DOE managers.<P>

    Of the original $5.9 billion cost estimate, about $1.8 billion was to come from sources other than the U.S. government. That also proved to be a big problem.<P>

    While the state of Texas came through with the money it promised -- about $900 million -- the funds from foreign countries never materialized.<P>

    Expectations may have bordered on wishful thinking, and some European countries indicated they'd never promised contributions to the SSC funding pool. Japan was to be the principal foreign benefactor, but there were conflicts at work there, too.<P>

    The report said: ``Japanese contributions ... hinged on broad support for the SSC project. A key for continued congressional support was (DOE's) ability to obtain foreign contributions. When no other foreign resources were obtained, congressional support decreased, and Japan chose to defer making any contributions.''<P>

    The IG recommended funding arrangements be set during a project's initial stages.<P>

    However, in its response to the report, top DOE officials said that's desirable but maybe not realistic. They noted that foreign sources aren't apt to commit any money unless there's a greater assurance of Congressional support.<P>

    ``Further, requiring foreign commitments before starting a project would effectively give foreign powers a veto over the project,'' DOE responded.

<H2>ORNL MOVING TOWARD NEXT GENERATION OF POWER</H2>


    The news about Oak Ridge National Laboratory's superconductivity breakthrough was several weeks old, but Robert Hawsey was still excited.<P>

    ``We're talking about a revolution, the next generation of power equipment,'' Hawsey said. ``This is a tremendous step forward.''<P>

    A research team at ORNL developed a new process for manufacturing superconductor wires capable of carrying unprecedented amounts of electric current. The key development was a specially constructed multilayer substrate -- or foundation -- upon which the yttrium-barium-copper-oxide (YBCO) superconductor was deposited with a laser.<P>

    Chemical layers of palladium, cerium oxide and yttria-stabilized zirconia (such as used in fake diamonds) were applied to a nickel base and rolled and treated in such a way that the uniform atomic alignment enhanced the flow of electric current.<P>

    The initial results went beyond promising. Researchers reported that the lab experiments with the superconducting tape produced a critical current density of 300,000 amperes per square centimeter under certain conditions. That compares with standard household wires that carry an electrical load of less than 1,000 amps per square centimeter.<P>

    Soon thereafter, the ORNL staff announced an achievement of 2 million amperes, but that was later downgraded to 650,000. Even that conservative level, however, was much higher than achieved anywhere else in the research world.<P>

    ``When we presented this data last month at San Francisco (at the Materials Research Society meeting), we surprised the heck out of the Japanese, and I loved it,'' said Hawsey, who is director of ORNL's Superconductivity Technology Center.<P>

    The results prompted Hawsey and others to predict significant changes in energy efficiency, perhaps reducing the need for new power plants in the United States in decades to come.<P>

    Superconductors have virtually no resistance to electric current and offer huge potential for savings. That potential, however, has been offset by the limitations, and the challenge is to find a feasible and economical system to use them.<P>

    For instance, existing superconductors work only at super-cold temperatures, although the YBCO mix is effective at conditions cooled with liquid nitrogen -- about -321 degrees Fahrenheit.<P>

    That sounds cold, of course, but in scientific nomenclature the YBCO compound is considered a high-temperature superconductor. That's because earlier compounds became superconducting only at much lower temperatures, such as those created by liquid helium at -452 degrees Fahrenheit.<P>

    ``There's a world of difference,'' Hawsey said.<P>

    The new developments at ORNL could lead to the first use of superconducting wires for any appreciable length in a system insulated by liquid nitrogen, and that is viewed as a great opportunity for advancement in the electric industry.<P>

    According to Hawsey, the ``real payoff'' will be in electric machines that require operation in a magnetic field.<P>

    ``To make a motor run or to generate electricity with a generator you need a magnetic field, and all the other high-temperature superconductors ... are essentially worthless in magnetic fields at nitrogen temperatures,'' he said.<P>

    The work, naturally, is far from done. Hawsey estimates it will take another five years or so of intensive research and development before the first practical lengths of superconducting wire are produced. Reaching that goal will depend heavily on the participation of industrial partners, and ORNL already has signed some non-exclusive agreements and is close to others.<P>

    Suddenly, one concern is that the ORNL research team may become spread too thin as the corporate world joins the effort in a big way.<P>

    ``We've got a limited number of people and only so much funding,'' Hawsey said, ``and everyone is going to want assistance from ORNL.''<P>

    On the whole, however, that's a rather happy dilemma.<P>

<H2>BIOTECHNOLOGY CROSSES ORGANIZATIONAL BOUNDARIES AT ORNL</H2>


    Biotechnology is big in today's world of science, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory is big in biotechnology.<P>

    Of all the Department of Energy's national labs, ORNL is the biotech leader, with more than 200 scientists doing research valued at about $60 million a year.<P>

    There is, however, no Biotechnology Division at the Oak Ridge lab. That's not the way it works. Biotechnology overlaps organizational boundaries.<P>

    By rough definition, it is an interdisciplinary realm of science that combines a biological approach with the tools of technology to solve problems -- everything from pollution cleanups to energy production.<P>

    Along the way, biotechnology manages to embrace environmental and life sciences as well as just about every other scientific field of research, usually employing elements of engineering to make sure things work.<P>

    ``It literally cuts across all of the laboratory,'' said Dr. Carl Gehrs, who is director of ORNL's Center for Biotechnology.<P>

    The 18-month-old center's staff includes only Gehrs and his secretary, Annetta Hendricks. And there's no special edifice -- stone, glass or otherwise -- to house the endeavors.<P>

    ``It's a virtual thing,'' Gehrs said. ``My role is to try to get people together across the organizational units of the laboratory to work together.''<P>

    He coordinates biotechnology research projects that unite bright minds from all corners, whether it's in genetics, physics or statistical ecology.<P>

    The 55-year-old Gehrs, whose background is in environmental science, holds a doctorate in zoology from the University of Oklahoma. He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a charter member of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry.<P>

    Gehrs helped create the Center for Biotechnology, although he's sure how to tell if it's a success.<P>

    He's also not sure how to gauge his own performance, but he enjoys the challenges.<P>

    ``It's been exciting, and things are happening,'' he said. ``We're in a real competitive business.''<P>

    The competition for research dollars has never been more fierce. But the scientific competition ostensibly should be with other laboratories -- or other countries -- and not so much with the colleagues across the hall.<P>

    More than ever before, successful research laboratories are able to eliminate or reduce the internal turf barriers that impair the scientific process and hinder innovation.<P>

    Identifying and showcasing top research areas is a common task for all world-class research institutions. However, collectively utilizing those research strengths may be the key to surviving tough budget times.<P>

    That's one of the reasons why ORNL formed the Center for Biotechnology. Even though it's bare-bones organization, the center promotes the existence of a broad-based laboratory capability that might otherwise go unnoticed. It also encourages those at the lab to keep thinking about research partnerships -- even unorthodox ones -- that can tackle problems heretofore unsolvable.<P>

    Mostly, the center is about maximizing opportunities, and that's a good idea.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>CLASSIFIED DATA SLOWING STUDY OF K-25 WORKERS' CANCER DEATHS</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF>

<H2>CLASSIFIED DATA SLOWING STUDY OF K-25 WORKERS' CANCER DEATHS</H2>

    Classified information is having a huge impact on a study of cancer deaths among workers at the Department of Energy's K-25 plant in Oak Ridge.<P>

    John Cardarelli, project manager for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), said the study already is more than six months behind schedule because of delays in getting information.<P>

    Thousands of pages of K-25 documents -- such as industrial hygiene reports dating back to World War II -- have been declassified during the past two years and provided to NIOSH for the study.<P>

    In addition, NIOSH has asked DOE to declassify some information related to the uranium-enrichment technology once used at K-25, because researchers believe it is critical to understanding worker exposures. A government panel will review the matter and weigh the national-security implications against the health study's needs.<P>

    ``If this particular data cannot be declassified, it may place the whole study in jeopardy,'' Cardarelli said.<P>

    The Oak Ridge plant was built during the 1940s to enrich uranium with the  fissionable U-235 isotope for atomic bombs. The mission later was changed to production of uranium fuel for nuclear reactors, and that work continued until the mid-1980s, when the gaseous diffusion operation was shut down.<P>

    NIOSH is looking at K-25 worker deaths attributed to multiple myeloma, a type of cancer sometimes linked to radiation exposures. The association with radiation, however, is controversial, and one of the reasons for the K-25 study is to illuminate and better understand possible workplace causes, including radiation or chemical exposures.<P>

    ``Our primary exposure of interest is internal radiation,'' Cardarelli said. At K-25, the most common radioactive substance was uranium.<P>

    The Oak Ridge plant was chosen for study because of the number of multiple myeloma cases.<P>

    There are reports that 63 K-25 workers have died from this particular type of cancer. While not confirming that number, Cardarelli said, ``That's about right.''<P>

    He added: ``We felt there were enough cases of multiple myeloma to give us enough power to detect if there are any associations (with workplace exposures). We would not be doing if this if there were only two or three deaths.''<P>

    The detailed work histories of more than 300 K-25 workers will be analyzed for the health study, which is due for completion in 1998. For each one of the workers who died of multiple myeloma, there will be four other K-25 workers with similar backgrounds used as ``control'' cases for the study.<P>

    Workers in the study were employed at K-25 for at least 30 days between May 31, 1943 and Dec. 31, 1984.<P>

    Under an agreement reaches several years ago, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -- of which NIOSH is a part -- took control of the wide-ranging studies of nuclear workers. Previously, DOE had overseen the health and mortality studies and assigned its own contractors to do the work. Because of continued challenges to the credibility of that arrangement, the studies were reassigned.<P>

    A three-member team at NIOSH is working on the K-25 project. Besides Cardarelli, a health physicist, the team includes an epidemiologist, Barbara Massoudi, and an industrial hygienist, Larry Elliott.<P>

    NIOSH has been privately criticized for using a shotgun approach when requesting information for the Oak Ridge project.<P>

    Cardarelli defended the technique, saying researchers were asked to name what documents they wanted even when they didn't know what existed. That forced the researchers to make broad requests to DOE and its contractors, he said.    <P>

    NIOSH has gained greater access than previously accorded DOE contractors, and Cardarelli said the tougher approach has paid dividends by ferreting out undisclosed records on chemical exposures at the plant. That information will be helpful in the multiple myeloma study, as well as other studies in the future, he said. <P>

    The end result should be a scientifically credible look at health impacts in the government's nuclear workplace, the project officer said. Despite some friction and a few ``hurdles'' to overcome, Cardarelli said the NIOSH team isn't anti-DOE and doesn't have any hidden agendas.<P>

    ``All we're out for is the truth,'' he said.<P>

PROVING WOMEN SCIENTISTS DON'T HAVE TO BE MANAGERS</H2>

    Nancy Larson jokingly notes that mathematician friends refer to her as a physicist. Her physicist friends, meanwhile, think of Larson as a mathematician.<P>

    All such snobbery aside, Dr. Larson's academic experience -- including a doctorate in theoretical physics from Michigan State University -- gave her a lot of math as well as physics, and she needs both for her work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.<P>

    She's on the scientific staff at the Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator, where she develops mathematical models that help interpret what's happening during the accelerator experiments.<P>

    Efforts are always made to control variables during research, but a particle accelerator is a complex and imperfect system that often alters one's text-book expectations. Mathematical models help to correct the real-world imperfections and lend meaning to the work.<P>

    Tracking neutrons with math is a remarkable exercise, and Larson recently shared some of her thoughts with a group of college students at the Women in Science and Technology Conference.<P>

    ``When you work on a project that's impossible, you have job security,'' she said with a laugh before adding, `` ... as long as you can find somebody to fund it.''<P>

    She produced a few pages of math formulas to prove there really was some brain-baffling work that takes place behind the research headlines. Most of her remarks, however, were down to earth and useful to those mulling a career in science.<P>

    Larson said she was living proof that a woman can make it in science without being coopted into an administrative role.<P>

    In her situation, Larson said she simply said `No' so many times that managers stopped asking. It was a personal decision made years ago. There were several factors, including a desire to remain part-time and spend more time at home after her daughter was born.<P>

    Larson is a strong speaker, yet she describes herself as a hermit. That, too, played a part in her career decision making, she said.<P>

    ``If I have a choice between walking out into the hall where people are having coffee and interacting with people or hibernating in my office and working on a math problem, you know where I'd be. In the office. I have to force myself to do things like this (speak to groups).''<P>

    So, why is it many women who enter science go into management, instead of staying in research posts? Part of the reason, according to Larson, has to do with numbers.<P>

    ``There's been a lot of pressure at the laboratory and I'm sure throughout the country to promote women in general, and if you only have two women Ph.D.'s on your entire staff, you can expect that one of them is going to get put into management. I fought it because it's not my personality. I would have ulcers. I would have retired long ago.''<P>

    Although generally considered a good career move, the change doesn't always come with a pay raise -- at least not at first, she said.<P>

    Some of the women scientists at the Oak Ridge conference talked about discrimination they'd faced from male counterparts. One said men think they're smarter than women and, even if they don't say it, that attitude is apparent from their body language.<P>

    Asked if she got negative feedback, Larson said, ``You do when you're young. I got it early in my career. Just being acknowledged as a person who has a Ph.D. is tough ... In fact, `Nancy Larson' has been introduced to `Dr. So and So' in more cases than I care to remember, and I get furious every time it happens.''<P>

    At ORNL, professional titles typically aren't used, but that can cause problems, too, when it comes to getting respect.<P>

    ``Because of the fact that we don't use titles, the men assume you are either a secretary or maybe have a bachelor's degree. I worked for three months with this man and then I found out six months later he thought I had a bachelor's degree. I had wondered why he was not listening when I was talking, and he was clearly not listening. That sort of thing happens.''<P>

    She shared this anecdote:<P>

    ``I got through graduate school at least in part on anger. The anger was at these dumb men who were my teachers who didn't know what they were talking about. I remember one class that was literally taught by myself and another graduate student because the professor -- at least I thought so at the time -- was so dumb. I figured if this dumb idiot can get a Ph.D., so can I.<P>

    ``Well, it turns out he was brilliant, but just bored.''<P>

<HR>
<H1>FRANKLIN'S DESCRIPTIONS KEEP TEENS IN STITHCES</H1>

    Teenagers aren't an easy audience.<P>

    A leather-lunged drill sergeant would have a tough time keeping their attention. Bill Cosby might not be able to make them laugh for an entire hour.<P>

    Melissa Franklin can do both, and she teaches them physics, too.<P>

    If you think that's unconventional, then you've found the operative word to describe Dr. Franklin. She's off the wall, over the top, raw and warm.<P>

    When she talks, words like goofy and cool come rolling out frequently, only to find themselves interchanged with things like fractional electron charge.<P>

    The Harvard University professor comes up with some extraordinary -- some might say bizarre -- notions to describe physics and her research in the world of sub-atomic particles.<P>

    At one point, Franklin uses a drawing of a Chardonnay-sipping dog inside a particle to make some point about quarks and California (where she received her doctorate at Stanford). A few minutes later up pops a photograph of a vending machine at Fermilab in Chicago, where she conducts her research experiments.<P>

    Somehow the physicist intersperses her affinity for junk food with construction of a 3,000-ton detector capable of measuring the energy from high-speed particle collisions. By the way, folks, did you know that Pepsi goes with Cheetos, Coke with Fritos?<P>

    Franklin is a talented communicator.<P>

    She's also a gifted scientist, although she admits she spent way too much time in her formative years wondering, ``Am I smart enough?'' Even during graduate school, she sometimes went to the bathtub to cry away her doubts.<P>

    Now she offers others this advice: ``If you want to do it, do it. If someone gets in your way, kick them in the shin.''<P>

    In between her regular jaunts back and forth to Chicago and Boston, Franklin found time to visit Oak Ridge the other day. She spoke at the Women in Science and Technology Conference, which annually attracts girls and young women from high schools and colleges. It's a forum where science is fun and where the role models are female. Men are the butt of most good jokes.<P>

    At the top of Franklin's resume is her membership on the 450-person team at Fermilab's Collider Detector that discovered the sixth quark -- the so-called ``top quark.''<P>

    It was quarks, specifically the charm quark, that got Franklin interested in particle physics when she was still a teen-ager, and she refers to herself as ``a quark girl.''<P>

    ``I have some bad news for you,'' she told the Oak Ridge crowd. ``There's only six quarks. We don't have anymore. So you can't be quark girls.''<P>

    The way she figures it, there's not much of a chance that the last quark discovery will garner a Nobel Prize, because the selection committee usually honors a maximum of three people on awards. Since there were 450 collaborators on the quark project, Franklin said that means there are 15 million different combinations of members for the honor.<P>

    ``So forget the prize,'' she said.<P>

    When Franklin talks, laughs are a constant. But for every laugh, there is an accompanying thought. Some kids laugh -- and learn -- so hard, their sides hurt.<P>

    She's apt to refer to a famous physicist as the guy with the mustache.  She a little bit irreverent, sometimes a lot. Her message is hip and in tune. She said she was attracted to Stanford by a professor, even though he wasn't very good looking.<P>

    ``You know there's only two motivations in life -- science and cute,'' she said.<P>

    Indeed, science is soulful experience for Franklin, and she doesn't think people should set up artificial barriers.<P>

    ``You don't have to be a good student to go to graduate school. You don't have to have good grades. You just have to really bug people a lot. It's true,'' she said as the laughter builds.<P>

    ``And that's true in life in general. Don't worry about your grades. I know that sounds strange (but) if you worry about your grades, you're just worried. And you can't be seduced by science when you're worried . . . When you get seduced by science, everything else is trivial.''

<H1>ROBINSON'S LEGACY IS NEW NUCLEAR ASTROPHYSICS FACILITY</H1>

    The nuclear physics community lost a valued friend last week.<P>
    Russell Robinson died after a difficult struggle with ALS, formerly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.<P>
    Before illness stalled his career at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Robinson was scientific director at the Holifield Heavy Ion Research Facility. He played an important role in the particle accelerator's survival and conversion to a radioactive beam facility.<P>
    In the summer of 1994, an addition to the ORNL research center was named Robinson Hall in his honor. The physicist attended the ceremony in a wheelchair. Although physically weakened, he was upbeat and gracious.<P>
    ``Wow . . . This is a fantastic way to wind up a very enjoyable career,'' he told the assembly.<P>
    Following the event, I wrote, ``It isn't necessary to know Russell Robinson to recognize how special he is. His friends and colleagues make that obvious. They treat him with the respect accorded a dignitary or statesman, with the warmth of close kin.''<P>
    In a brief note, Robinson thanked me for the column. He also made a prediction:<P>
    ``It is my judgment that in about two years, you will be writing an article about the first successful experiment at (Holifield) with a radioactive beam, and this will be followed in due course with an article on important discoveries made at that same facility .  . . I especially will look forward to those articles.''<P>
    Sadly, Dr. Robinson didn't live long enough to witness the first experiments at the reconfigured Holifield facility, which will open up all sorts of new research possibilities in Oak Ridge.<P>
    ``He really loved that facility .  . . he dedicated himself to it,'' said Fred Bertrand, director of ORNL's Physics Division and a close friend of Robinson's.<P>
    In anticipation of the new facility coming on line, ORNL has established a program in nuclear astrophysics. Already two experimentalists have joined the staff. Top theorists may soon find a home in Oak Ridge, too.<P>
    Researchers from around the world are expected to visit Holifield in the years ahead. Their experiments will explore galactic phenomena like supernovae and help us understand how elements are formed.<P>
    Beyond the bursting stars and other stellar events, scientists will have a new and improved tool for the study of nuclear structures. The revamped accelerator will create exotic nuclei otherwise inaccessible for study and help researchers push the boundaries of physical knowledge.<P>
    Unlike astrophysics, nuclear structure has long been a research strength at ORNL. ``That's our bread and butter,'' Bertrand said.<P>
    The initial experiments with radioactive ions will take place around Oct. 1, the physics director said. ``We have completed the mechanical construction of the new capabilities,'' he said.<P>
    Already, a stable ion beam has been accelerated through new parts of the facility to make sure components are functional. Further progress, however, has been slowed while workers install a special facility where the radioactive targets can be handled remotely.<P>
    A lot of debugging and fine-tuning is yet needed before scientists produce their first radioactive ion beam at Holifield.<P>
    Meanwhile, the excitement is building Ä not just at ORNL, but at universities and research institutions in the United States and beyond.<P>
    The Oak Ridge laboratory has received 34 ``letters of intent'' from would-be users Ä ranging from the nearby University of Tennessee to laboratories in Europe. The letters outline research interests and potential experiments. A formal request for research proposals is due out in the next month or so.<P>
    While Robinson won't be on hand when Holifield reopens its doors to researchers, Bertrand said the Oak Ridge staff will emphasize things Robinson felt were important.<P>
    ``Russell made the atmosphere here conducive to the best possible research. He respected the importance of the intellectual environment for users to come and do experiments. We had long been known as a very user-friendly facility. The reason is Russell made it that way .  . . We will do everything we can to retain the base that he created.''

<H1>Ailing workers see progress after NIOSH visit</H1>

    Oak Ridge workers with health problems they blame on cyanide exposures at the government's K-25 Site are frustrated that no occupational source has been pinpointed, but they're finally getting some respect for their concerns.<P>
    "I think I see progress," said Ann Orick, a health physics technician at the Department of Energy plant.<P>
    Orick has been out of work since mid-January because of recurring health problems, including a severe rash and migraine headaches. She also has been afflicted with gastrointestinal problems, rapid heart rate and shortness of breath.<P>
    The K-25 worker believes these ailments are associated with cyanide exposures. She said medical lab tests have documented abnormal levels in her body.<P>
    Other workers have similar concerns.<P>
    At first, the affected employees at K-25 shared concerns with each other but felt they were ignored or treated with condescension by their employer, Lockheed Martin Energy Systems -- the contractor that manages K-25.<P>
    After an team from NIOSH (the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health) visited the site at the workers' request, Lockheed Martin hired an expert team from the University of Alabama to review the situation.<P>
    The Alabama report didn't soft-pedal the problem, as some workers had feared. Indeed, the specialists found weaknesses in the sampling and criticized Lockheed Martin for poor communications with its workers.<P>
    Sherrie Farver, another concerned worker at K-25, said she was encouraged after a briefing from the University of Alabama team. "I think they were very open and honest," she said.<P>
    Orick said Lockheed Martin had been more responsive in recent weeks.<P>
    However, Orick and Farver emphasized they remain concerned about cyanide exposures at K-25, even though no obvious source has been identified.<P>
    Farver said she was relocated to another work site temporarily, but she said other workers with health concerns -- and elevated cyanide readings -- still must work at K-25 in areas suspected of having a problem.<P>
    "I personally do not feel safe in that environment until some definitive answers are obtained," Farver said.<P>
    Orick noted one positive change: "I think we can voice our concerns without fear of retaliation. I didn't feel like that before."<P>

    There have been more than a few management foulups during the past decade at DOE's toxic-waste incinerator in Oak Ridge.<P>
    That was especially the case in the mid- to late-1980s, when the incinerator's rocky startup and early operations were a constant source of concern. The rapid turnover in incinerator's management team reflected the tough times.<P>
    In recent years, the TSCA (Toxic Substance Control Act) Incinerator at the K-25 Site enjoyed a smoother run. The facility, which burns wastes with both hazardous and radioactive elements, even won awards and kudos from DOE for achieving production and safety milestones.<P>
    However, a recent incident, which damaged the off-gas treatment system, again raises questions about oversight at the $26 million incinerator.<P>
    That situation may become more obvious in the weeks ahead. A Lockheed Martin spokesman said operations should resume in mid-April after repairs are completed.<P>
    The problem, which occurred Feb. 20, has been blamed on human error. The incinerator was down at the time for maintenance and testing.<P>
    Work was being done on the quench system, which therefore was inoperable. Nonetheless, workers tried to conduct an operation that requires the use of the quench to cool down everything. The incinerator chambers were still hot from activities the night before.<P>
    An alarm apparently sounded, showing the quench was out of operation, but a decision was made to proceed and bypass that warning. Hot air was sucked into the treatment system, melting some components and scorching plastic surfaces.<P>
    Vince Adams of DOE said "appropriate disciplinary actions" will be looked at. Adams said DOE also will review whether to charge Lockheed Martin, the contractor, for the damages. The final cost hasn't been established, he said.<P>
    A final point: Adams said the incident probably wouldn't have occurred if Fidel Perez --  the incinerator's most experienced employee -- had still been in his former position as technical operations chief. Perez was promoted months ago to facility manager and apparently wasn't available when the bad decision was made.<P>

<h1>NEW 'MONKEY LAW' AROUSES IRE OF PROFESSOR</h1>

    Political science? No way. Politics in science? Perhaps.<P>
    The melding -- some might say meddling -- of politics and science has been in the news a bunch lately.<P>
    Dr. Alan White, a Tennessee native, University of Tennessee doctoral grad and now a philosophy professor at the University of Wisconsin Centers, wrote the other day to express his distaste for the current round of ``Monkey Wars.''<P>
    ``Needless to say I am greatly concerned (and somewhat embarrassed) by this obvious ploy by religious conservatives to once again attempt to hold Tennessee education hostage to their own (rather cynical and mean-spirited) purposes,'' White said.<P>
    As you can gather, White is rather unhappy about attempts to legislate how evolution is taught in the public schools.<P>
    The philosophy of science is one of White's academic interests. The 42-year-old professor said he also teaches philosophy of religion ``with real gusto.'' His perspective, White said, is as a concerned educator who has surveyed at all sides of this issue.<P>
    He wrote:<P>
    ``The main complaint seems to be that evolution can't be a fact because it is a `theory.' This is straining at unbelievably small linguistic gnats. Physicists, as you know, still quite uniformly speak of the special theory of relativity -- probably because as a complex system of ideas it is most easily called a theory -- but no serious physicist would question that the claims of SR are anything other than fact!<P>
    ``Evolution is likewise an intricate construct of ideas, the major tenets of which simply are as much fact as anything in human knowledge can be, reinforced as they are from such diverse areas as biology, geology, and even nuclear physics.<P>
    ``I see this politicization of this issue much as I do questions about the authenticity of the Holocaust. Facts are facts and perverse wishes to the contrary be damned.''<P>
    The eyes of the nation are watching the Tennessee Legislature.<P>

    Another topical issue is possible U.S. restrictions on immigration. This has been a source of heated debate in recent months on the Republican campaign trail.<P>
    Clearly, this discussion is unsettling to scientists, who value freedom of expression perhaps as much as any group -- maybe even as much as journalists.<P>
    Scientists have long understood and valued the importance of sharing information regardless of political boundaries, as well as visiting or even relocating to foreign sites in order to maximize career opportunities.<P>
    If there were limitations or newly imposed restrictions on immigration, what would be the impact on the scientific community? Would research suffer?<P>
    Dr. Alvin Trivelpiece, director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory and a stalwart Republican (he was a political appointee in the Reagan administration), didn't seem too worried when asked for his viewpoint.<P>
    While acknowledging that immigration has become  ``a hot potato politically,'' Trivelpiece noted:<P>
    ``In general, restrictions on immigration and exchanges have not had a big effect on the scientific and engineering fields. We have always had a complex system, with occasional restrictions regarding travel and immigration to or from one or more countries, followed by easing and encouragement to have exchanges and immigration. Russia and South Africa come to mind as examples.<P>
    ``Of course, I have no way of knowing how the outcome of the election would affect these matters, but it usually doesn't go to either extreme in the final analysis. Even during the periods of great political stress when Russia was in Afghanistan, exchanges continued on fusion, including an extension of some existing agreements that ran out.''<P>
    More on this issue later.<P>

<TITLE>Waste-melting operations to begin at ORNL</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<H1>Waste-melting operations to begin at ORNL</H1>
 
    A much-delayed demonstration of ``in situ vitrification'' (ISV) is scheduled to start before the end of the month at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and it now appears likely that similar projects will be staged elsewhere in ORNL's nuclear burial grounds.<P>
    The waste technology literally melts the ground Ä plus the hazardous constituents buried there Ä with enormous amounts of electricity. Once the molten mass cools, the result is an underground monolith of volcanic-like glass. Supporters of ISV believe it can be an effective way to seal radioactive wastes for millions of years and reduce the risk of materials migrating into local groundwater and beyond.<P>
    Pilot tests were conducted in recent years at ORNL, and the project this spring is intended to demonstrate the viability of ISV at an actual nuclear-waste pit Ä albeit a fairly small one.<P>
    Lockheed Martin, which manages the Oak Ridge lab for the U.S. Department of Energy, is collaborating with Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory and Geosafe, a company developing ISV for commercial applications.<P>
    Brian Spalding, the ORNL project manager, said an equipment failure and other lingering issues have been resolved at the test site, and it looks like the melting operations will finally get started within a few weeks.<P>
    It will take a while, of course, for the graphite electrodes to melt the ground. An array of technical equipment will monitor the progress of the melt and characterize what's happening underground Ä as well as emissions coming into an off-gas treatment system.<P>
    It may require a couple of years for the molten mass to cool completely, but scientists should know well before then if the ``treatability study'' was a success.<P>
    Meanwhile, DOE already is shopping for other variations of the ISV technology.<P>
    The federal agency plans to sponsor more demonstrations and recently advertised in Commerce Business Daily for companies interested in the waste work. DOE's Energy Technology Center at Morgantown, W.Va., will seek proposals from private firms with ideas on how to do the waste-melting operations from ``bottom to top.''<P>
    The current ISV method demonstrated at ORNL places electrodes near the surface and melts downward. This so-called ``top-to-bottom'' technology has some limitations and is not considered good for waste sites where there are buried drums or underground tanks. The concern is that melting containers will cause a waste site to ``burp'' or even explode, breaking the containment and releasing radioactive gases into the atmosphere.<P>
    DOE wants to examine other glassification technologies that start the melt from the bottom of a waste pit.<P>
    According to the Commerce Business Daily announcement, ``The objective of this effort is to demonstrate the suitability of the bottom-to-top in situ vitrification technology to contain and stabilize a contaminated solid-waste site cost-effectively in a way that reduces risk and meets regulatory requirements.''<P>
    DOE wants the winning company to do a ``cold'' test Ä without radioactive materials Ä and then a ``hot'' test at a burial site with real nuclear waste.<P>
    The agency's Oak Ridge operations and ORNL already have agreed to host these tests.<P>
    Spalding said the cold test would be done near Pit No. 1, where the current ISV project is set up. The hot test would be done at nearby Pit No. 3, which may contain as much as 100,000 curies of radioactivity from wastes dumped there decades ago.<P>
    ORNL authorities already have made tentative plans to contain the wastes at Pit No. 3 with their top-to-bottom ISV technology if current work goes as well. If an alternative technology is approved for demonstration, a portion of the same Oak Ridge pit would be set aside for a test project, he said.<P>
    Because of the substantial size of Pit No. 3, it probably will take about 18 melting operations to seal all of the wastes buried there, the ORNL scientist said.<P>

<TITLE>TRIP TO ANTARCTRICA REVEALS WORLDS OF RESEARCH YET TO BE DONE</TITLE>

<H1>Trip to Antarctica reveals worlds of research yet to be done</H1><P>

    During her month-long science adventure in Antarctica last year, Jane Mural quickly adapted to the weather conditions. It wasn't that bad. In fact, she wore short sleeves one day while working outdoors.<P>
    ``It was deceptively not cold,'' Mural explained, ``because the sun was shining all the time.''<P>
    Weather stats weren't available, but she estimated that temperatures were in the 20s most of the times and never below zero. It got above freezing on a couple of occasions.<P>
    In other words, her January 1995 stay in Antarctica wasn't terribly different from January 1996 in East Tennessee. At least not when it comes to the weather.<P>
    Keep in mind that January is mid-summer in the Southern Hemisphere. The around-the-clock sunshine boosted the energy level, and the molecular biologist worked 16 to 18 hours a day.<P>
    Mural, who works under contract at Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Environmental Sciences Division, was surprised by other aspects of Antarctica.<P>
    ``I guess I expected to find it completely barren and devoid of any kind of life, especially greenery,'' she said.<P>
    What she found, however, were some moss-covered areas and freshwater pools of water teeming with micro- and macro-organisms that survive severe conditions at the bottom of the Earth.<P>
    ``The science was great,'' Mural said. ``It gave me a really good introduction to what's available as far as doing science in Antarctica.''<P>
    She met scientists from around the world and conducted research on how phytoplankton repair themselves from genetic damage of UV radiation. She also came away with an inspired outlook on her career.<P>
    ``It showed me there's really a lot of good basic science left to be done,'' Mural said. ``I keep thinking of those freshwater pools and all the organisms that are yet to be found in there, things that are yet to be discovered. There are a lot of people working in Antarctica, but there's still a whole new world there.''<P>

    Good ideas and promising technologies don't always get funded. That's simply a fact. Unfortunately, it's becoming more prevalent or at least that's the way it seems.<P>
    That thought came to mind the other day while talking with Jonathan Woodward, a Ph.D. biochemist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A couple of years ago, Woodward and other researchers developed a keen technique for removing ink from waste paper Ä particularly old newspapers.<P>
    The benchscale technology, which relies on a naturally produced enzyme to break down the cellulose fibers in papers, was quite successful in separating ink-fee pulp fibers from the inked fibers. Not only could be ink-free fibers be recycled for use in white paper products, but the inked fibers also could be reused for such things as insulation or even those grayish egg cartons in the grocery store.<P>
    ORNL's bioreactor system was loaded with promise. It didn't require any de-inking chemicals, minimized waste, and saved lots of energy when compared to traditional techniques for recycling newspapers.<P>
    Because the enzyme called cellulase is environmentally friendly, the liquids left after paper processing reportedly could be dumped down the sink drain without concern.<P>
    Sounds great, right? <P>
    Well, there was a significant burst of interest from paper companies, but none apparently had the money available to invest in more definitive research projects Ä even on a shared basis with ORNL. And the U.S. Department of Energy was unwilling to carry the funding load in a tight budget time.<P>
    As for Woodward, he admits it was ``a little disappointing'' that sponsorship for the research project dissipated. However, the scientist Ä a native of Birmingham, England, who came to ORNL 16 years ago Ä is not giving up. He intends to pursue other possibilities for industrial partnerships.<P>
    ``I guess I'm going to have to get back on the bandwagon,'' he said.<P>

Discovery may block of pain with signals from bandages</H1>
    
    
     Steve Michelson is a pharmacist, would-be golf pro, inventor, businessman and big thinker.<P>
    The 57-year-old New York native lives and works in Miami, Fla., and his latest venture is development of bandages and splints with built-in devices that block pain with electrical signals.<P>
    In a recent telephone interview, Michelson talked about the excitement of discovery, rewards of hard work, and frustrations of bringing new products to the marketplace.<P>
    His company, Cyclotech Medical Industries Inc., has received a number of research and development grants, including one from the National Institutes of Health for innovative small businesses.<P>
    Cyclotech's products, however, aren't quite ready, money is short and there are other potential complications.<P>
    Still, the concept is interesting to many.<P>
    Michelson said he eventually would like to take the medical technology known as TENS -- transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulations -- and incorporate it safely, routinely and effectively into products that could be sold across the counter.<P>
    That would, of course, require approval by the Food and Drug Administration, and it could be a while. Currently the use of electrical waves across the skin to block pain must be done under medical supervision.<P>
    Michelson wants to combine electrical units with a variety of medical products, perhaps even using the technology with casts to reduce pain during the healing process. Prototypes will be marketed to medical practitioners, although he someday wants to promote drug-free pain relief directly to the patients.<P>
    ``That's the best way to be successful,'' he said.<P>
    Beyond the task of developing and demonstrating an easy-to-use system that can substantially reduce -- if not eliminate -- risks to the untrained consumer, Michelson's firm is faced with other technical challenges. One is making the electrical system portable enough and small enough to use in connection with bandages, but still maintain enough power for a reasonable work life. Remote-control operations may be added to make the products friendlier to users and allow more mobility.<P>
    Might we see this kind of pain relief built into a little Band-Aid?<P>
    ``We think we can get there someday,'' Michelson said, but he admits that's probably not going to be any day soon.<P>

<P>
    Pollution watch: The state of Tennessee is getting a little more help in monitoring environmental activities at the U.S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge reservation.<P>
    Earl Leming, the state's environmental oversight chief in Oak Ridge, said his office has joined a national program called ERAMS -- Environmental Radiation Ambient Monitoring Systems. The information network is sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which collects data from sites around the United States and makes it available to users and others interested in the results.<P>
    ``We've cut a deal with EPA where they're basically supplying the (sampling) equipment and the analytical services, and we're going to provide the manpower,'' Leming said.<P>
    With the new equipment and free lab tests, the state will be able to do more of its own air and water sampling at the reservation in Oak Ridge -- polluted by the federal government's nuclear research and production activities over five decades.<P>
    State authorities have done a limited amount of Oak Ridge sampling in the past, but this should enhance that effort and support their role as environmental regulators.<P>
    Besides checking areas of the reservation with a suspected problem, the state workers also will able to independently verify some of the pollution sampling done by their federal counterparts in Oak Ridge.<P>

<H1>ORNL DEVELOPS NEW SELF-LUBRICATING SUBSTANCE</H1>
    Materials researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory have developed a self-lubricating coating that holds promise for engine parts and other applications where friction is a limiting factor.
    The coating combines the beneficial properties of two compounds:
    * Titanium nitride, a hard and strong material commonly applied to gold watches to make them scratch resistant.
    * Molybdenum disulfide, a material known to be a solid lubricant -- but effective for relatively short periods when used by itself.
    ``Our idea was to use a hard matrix material and put microscopic nuggets of molybdenum sulfide in it,'' said Ted Besmann, who heads the ceramic surface systems research group at ORNL. ``Then, as the surface wears away, it would reveal these nuggets and provide lubrication.''
    If that sounds easy, it wasn't. In fact, it took the Oak Ridge researchers about three years to successfully combine these materials into a coating that replenished the lubricant with use.
    Laboratory experiments were repeated again and again to find a good mix of gases as they flowed over the base component. Researchers employed a chemical vapor deposition technique that required gases at a high temperature and low pressure.
    ``The difficulty was in getting the chemistry right,'' Besmann said. ``We tried a lot of compositions until we found the magic window.''
    Although considered a success, the self-lubricating coating still isn't perfect by any stretch.
    The coated material had a lower friction rate than titanium nitride alone, and the surface seemed to have a longer lubricating life than molybdenum sulfide by itself. However, researchers want to improve on the developments because the coating doesn't have the strength or the lifetime they desire.
    One limitation apparently is caused by the way particles form on the deposited surface.
    Under examination with a transmission electron microscope, researchers found that exceptionally tiny particles of titanium nitride were actually coated with the molybdenum disulfide and weren't connected well themselves -- thus losing strength.
    ``We have ideas about how to fix that,'' said Besmann, a 47-year-old engineer who holds a Ph.D. from Pennsylvania State University.
    Having a built-in lubricant could be a big help, especially for equipment with rubbing parts that are relatively inaccessible and hard to lubricate with oils. Besides the automotive industry, there could be applications for aircraft or even deep in space.
    Besmann pointed out that the Galileo spacecraft had a problem with a key antenna that wouldn't unfold properly. The antenna stuck apparently because the lubricant dissipated during years of storage prior to the space project. Conventional lubricants, such as oils, tend to decompose over time.
    Presumably, if there had been a solid lubricant built into the antenna itself, such a problem could have been averted.
    Besides looking at solid lubricants that replenish themselves with wear, the Oak Ridge research team also is interested in material coatings that survive -- indeed, thrive -- at high temperatures.
    There is significant potential, but there also is a major obstacle -- funding.
    Sponsorship for the ORNL research effort ran out last year, and the project was mothballed. With progress stalled, researchers turned their attention to other projects.
    Part of the problem, according to Besmann, was that work on self-lubricating coatings didn't fit neatly into any particular program funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. That could change in the months ahead. If not, there is the possibility of getting funds elsewhere.
    Can the scientists and engineers resuscitate the research project -- and the excitement -- if the money comes through?
    ``We can pick it up without too much difficulty,'' Besmann said confidently.

<H1>SCIENTISTS SEE THE LIGHT WITH THE HELP OF BIOREPORTERS</H1>


    
    One of the hot areas of environmental research involves ``bioreporters''-- bacteria that are genetically engineered to glow under certain conditions.<p>
    For instance, bacteria can be restructured to give off light when they're in the presence of toluene-- one of the hazardous compounds found in gasoline and other petroleum products. This might be helpful in checking environmental samples from a site where it's feared an underground fuel tank is leaking. Or, using the same technique, scientists could determine whether a cleanup project at a spill site has been effective.<p>
    This is remarkable and intriguing science.<p>
    Bioreporters are even more useful when incorporated in bacteria already capable of  other tasks-- such as ``eating'' or otherwise degrading pollutants in the environment. Organisms known to break down toxic substances such as trichlorethylene, a solvent once widely used at nuclear weapons sites, may be redesigned with a couple of new genes to send light signals to researchers.<p>
    Among those working with bioreporters is 42-year-old Anthony Palumbo, a research group leader in Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Environmental Sciences Division.<p>
    Current research at ORNL focuses on ways to clean up pollution, Palumbo said, although he noted bioreporters have broad potential.<p>
    ``There's a lot more potential that we can follow up on at this point,'' he said. ``We're concentrating on this as a way to monitor a (cleanup) program. We can see how well it's been done . . . or assess whether a certain site is amenable to cleanup.''<p>
    One of the laboratory's projects involves an Air Force base in Delaware.<p>
    The work is not always by the numbers. It requires interpretation and an understanding of complex issues in the environment. Bioreporters might not illuminate because the chemical in question isn't there. However, they also might not light up because other organisms present at the site may be killing the reporters.<p>
    Do these restructured bacteria really give off visible light?<p>
    Absolutely.<p>
    According to Palumbo, scientists usually use a device in the laboratory to measure the luminescence. But, he noted, it's also possible to see the light with the naked eye-- if you take a large enough sample into a dark room.<p>
    Studies are underway to genetically introduce fluorescent responses into certain bacteria. Analysis of those bioreporters would require shining ultraviolet light on the samples.<p>
    Not only can these bioreporters signal what's present in the environment, but they're also capable of telling scientists what's not there. It might be important, for example, to note that the soil was devoid  of phosphorous and may be limiting the growth of bacteria in an area. Bacteria are an important part of natural processes, such as decomposition of leaves and grass.<p>
    ORNL's research with bioreporters is being applied to field studies, but most of the actual analysis still takes place in the laboratory with environmental samples. At some point in the near future, scientists hope to take this show on the road and conduct their detective work with portable equipment. That might mean lowering a fiber-optic cable or other sensors into a test well to see if groundwater is polluted.<p>
    One common question about any research that involves genetic tampering or alterations of natural activities is: What are the risks?<p>
    Palumbo, a microbial ecologist who earned his doctorate at North Carolina State University, said he's unaware of any situation where bacteria introduced into the environment caused harm. But the scientist understands the concern, and he incorporates a level of caution into his work.<p>
    ``It's something people talk about a lot,'' he said, referring to suggestions that changes in biological systems may become a threat to the environment or even human health.<p>
    Before any agent is introduced into a natural process, scientists carefully analyze the potential consequences, Palumbo said.<p>
    ``Although we can say it's a little overblown as an issue . . . just because it hasn't happened doesn't mean it couldn't happen.''

<H2>POSSBILE GLOBAL CHANGES NECESSITATE PREVENTION, ADAPTATION</H2>

<p>    Mike Farrell's recent ``Showcase'' lecture at Oak Ridge National Laboratory was an engrossing refresher course on the complex issues of global warming.
<p>    Farrell, who directs the Center for Global Environmental Studies at ORNL, mostly stuck with the scientific components. He updated the audience on progress at several study fronts and outlined current prognostications on the greenhouse effect.
<p>    ``Are we there or not?'' is a hot question in the scientific community.
<p>    Indeed, there is recent evidence that global warming is with us in an early stage, and Farrell counts himself among the scientists who support that conclusion. He believes that the rise in severe storms is probably linked to the ``first glimmer'' of those changes, including a slight rise in average temperature that's sometimes masked by other factors.
<p>    The ecologist avoided any overt politicking during his speech, and that's not so easy when dealing with a volatile issue immersed in politics and impacted by social and political changes around the globe.
<p>    One contributor to the greenhouse effect that's largely ignored is population pressure, Farrell said, calling it ``the sleeping dog.''
<p>    The United States, perhaps not surprisingly, tops the list of countries with greenhouse emissions on a per-capita basis, followed by Australia, Russia, North Korea, United Kingdom and Japan.
<p>    Down at the bottom of the list is China. That's important. if China, with its billions of people, should even approach the international average for per-capita emissions, there would be dramatic consequences. The same is true to a lesser extent with a range of developing countries.
<p>    The United States is investing some effort and resources Ä although probably not enough Ä to help foreign nations develop reliable, efficient and environmental friendly sources of energy.
<p>    Burning fossil fuels for energy is often labeled the culprit in greenhouse warming because of the affiliated release of carbon dioxide and other gases. That's not the whole story, however.
<p>    Land use also is a critical issue. Deforestation, for instance, has a significant effect on the global carbon cycle. The Amazon Basin, which has been rapidly defaced by slash-and-burn clearing for development, is a prime example.
<p>    Brazil is among the international leaders in total release of carbon dioxide even though burning of fossil fuels is not the factor in that South American country. Brazil, of course, leads the planet in deforestation, followed by Indonesia.
<p>    Given that climate change may be upon us or in our future, Farrell outlined three approaches: prevention, mitigation and adaptation.
<p>    Under that last category, changes within the United States might necessitate moving soybean production from one area to another. Other adaptations could be more dramatic.
<p>    Farrell showed a map of Florida in the year 2100, based on temperature changes that would cause a foot-and-a-half rise in ocean levels. It's hard to describe that futuristic map of Florida, except to say it was only a strange fragment of what the Sunshine State looks like today.
<p>    Climate change could have a multitude of more subtle effects.
<p>    Farrell described a local situation in which striped bass have died during the summer in Douglas Lake and other reservoirs. As it turns out, these fish need cooler pockets of water to live during particularly hot spells. They stay there until the temperatures cool down. Sometimes, when these hot periods are extended, the striped actually die of starvation unless their natural prey Ä smaller fish Ä follow them into these cool pockets of lake water.
<p>    If the temperatures were to climb on a permanent basis, entire habitats could be lost.
<p>    The laboratory in Oak Ridge is using unique capabilities for massively parallel computing to assess global climate models with different scenarios and different time periods. This is speeding the process, of course, and hopefully making future conditions more predictable and addressable.
<p>    ORNL also is involved in studies that touch on nearly all facets of the global- warming situation, ranging from development of new-age refrigerants that eliminate the need for damaging chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to field experiments that measure the impact of changing weather conditions on forest ecosystems.

<H2>DIRECTOR WANTS TO GUIDE ORNL THROUGH TRANSITION</H2>    

<P>    It's not often that I write consecutive columns on the same
person, but Al Trivelpiece gets another look this week.
<P>    When he arrived as director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in
1989, Trivelpiece was billed as a science superstar. At the top of
his glittering resume was a stint as executive officer of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.
<P>    During the past seven years, the California native has
frequently acknowledged the Oak Ridge job turned out to be
different -- and a lot more difficult -- than he ever imagined.
Yet, at 64 years old, he has made no move toward retirement.
Frankly, it'd be a surprise if he did.
<P>    Trivelpiece won't say how long he'll stay at ORNL, but he
appears committed to the laboratory helm for at least a few more
years.
<P>    One reason is he wants to guide the Oak Ridge lab through a
transition period under its new management contract with the
Department of Energy. Trivelpiece is president of the contractor
organization, Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corp., but his
interests are scientific, not corporate.
<P>    "I'm director of the lab and incidentally president of the
company," he said.
<P>    Whatever the title, Trivelpiece's job pays pretty well, and the
ORNL chief admits that finances are on his mind, perhaps more than
he would like. That's another reason he's likely to stick around
for a while.
<P>    Money became a concern after Trivelpiece's tenure as a
political appointee in the Reagan Administration. For six years, he
directed DOE's Office of Energy Research, leaving midway through
Reagan's second term.
<P>    "To be an assistant secretary in the Department of Energy cost
me a lot of money," he said. "Most people probably don't appreciate
that government service is tremendously expensive.
<P>    "It cost me all of my retirement plan. To be an assistant
secretary and work for Mr. Reagan, I had to give up all my stock
options at SAI (Science Applications Inc., where he had served as
vice president), sell all my stock in SAI, take a roughly 50
percent cut in salary at that time, and pay my own way to
Washington because political appointees didn't even have their way
paid at the time . . .
<P>    "You put that all together, and you have a negative cash flow
for six years. Basically, I left government not because I wouldn't
like to have stayed to the end of Mr. Reagan's term, but I was
literally broke.
<P>    "So I had to start over in 1987 with no retirement plan and so
on. There is a simple desire to continue working long enough to
provide some financial stability."
<P>    Trivelpiece said he's never been driven by finances but by
challenges, noting, "This is certainly at the moment a challenging
job." Among the Oak Ridge challenges is doing more with less.
<P>    The impetus for changing the contract at ORNL was improved
management control, but another expectation was cost control. The
laboratory must improve in order to help U.S. Energy Secretary
Hazel O'Leary keep her commitment to cut spending.
<P>    "I have promised the secretary that I will reduce costs by $18
million a year over the next five years without a corresponding
loss in scientific probability," Trivelpiece said. "That's tough."
<P>    It wouldn't hurt, of course, if some non-DOE sources chipped in
more money, and the state of Tennessee has committed to help with
funding for a proposed Spallation Neutron Source -- if the project
moves toward reality.
<P>    The state's pledge of $8 million might seem paltry compared to
the overall pricetag of $1 billion, but Trivelpiece said the show
of support is extremely important in Washington.
<P>    "Cost-sharing contributions by political subdivisions other
than the federal government have a weight -- a value -- that goes
far beyond the numerical sums that are involved," he said.
<P>    Trivelpiece often frets that ORNL is not appreciated outside
the scientific community. He retains a sense of amazement at
research taking place all around himand seems to wonder why
everyone doesn't feel the same.
<P>    The ORNL chief talked excitedly about the reopening of the
Holifield accelerator, which has a new mission and new potential
for understanding the physical world.
<P>    "But the public doesn't really share that excitement," he said,
almost dejectedly.
<P>    When it was suggested, however, that the physics venture at the
Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility would mean that people
would be talking about ORNL in important circles around the world,
Trivelpiece raised his eyebrows and his voice.
<P>    "They already are," he replied smugly.

<P>There are probably plenty of reasons why they don&#39;t let journalists negotiate peace treaties and things like that.
<P>    I know I&#39;ll never try. I&#39;m sure I&#39;d create some kind of ugly international incident. I almost did a few weeks ago.
<P>    That&#39;s when I was host to a Russian TV crew from Tomsk.
<P>    Tomsk is one of those walled cities once devoted to secret work for the Soviet Union&#39;s nuclear weapons program. Clearly, there are elements of Tomsk common to Oak Ridge, itself an atomic city, although I&#39;m sure there are many differences as well.
<P>    Anyway, unlike the Cold War years, Russian visitors are a common feature in Oak Ridge these days. There are cultural and scientific exchanges, and there is a special interest in sharing technologies on how to best protect the stockpile of weapons-making materials.
<P>    The Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant is the U.S. repository for bomb-grade uranium. As such, it has particular capabilities in uranium handling.
<P>    Viktor Loysha, a TV producer in Tomsk, was accompanied by a cameraman -- whose name I never quite got -- and an interpreter, Julya Mikhaleva, whose business card identified her as being from the Russian Federation Ministry of Nuclear Power.
<P>    They were escorted by Howard Kerr, a state legislator and Oak Ridge National Lab nuke engineer who has had a long interest in developing nuclear projects abroad.
<P>    The meeting started off cordially enough, with introductions, chit-chat and so forth. It was informal, even though the discussion was videotaped.
<P>    I wasn&#39;t sure what kind of information Loysha wanted, but talk soon turned to nuclear topics and news coverage of them.
<P>    All conversation was being funneled through the interpreter. I don&#39;t speak Russian. And, if Loysha speaks English, he didn&#39;t display it that day.
<P>    He seemed interested mostly in my opinions, not so much facts and background. He wanted to know what I thought about Greens -- environmentalists -- and other groups.
<P>    I didn&#39;t think that was particularly unusual because my impression is that Russian journalists more often are advocates than their U.S. counterparts.
<P>    Loysha, however, didn&#39;t seem enthralled with my responses, and I figured that was because they were too bland. I tried to explain that my relationship with many news sources was just a professional thing, that&#39;s all, without much of an opinion basis.
<P>    His TV program, by the way, is titled &#39;&#39;The Apple of Discord,&#39;&#39; and it is billed as &#39;&#39;The unique everyweek program about problems of nuclear power.&#39;&#39;
<P>    He was curious about news coverage of the nuclear weapons plant in Oak Ridge, and I told him not much had changed since the end of the Cold War.  I told him it was difficult to visit the Y-12 weapons plant, noting that areas where workers produce nuclear warheads or store deposits of enriched uranium are off limits. 
<P>    That seemed to spark a special interest. Loysha&#39;s voice rose a notch, and he began a discourse that took a while to say and even longer to translate. His response, as translated, had a boastful tone. Loysha said he had seen everything there was to see in the Russian weapons program. He said he&#39;d looked at warheads and had held enriched uranium in his hand.
<P>    I was impressed and told him so. After a question, he clarified his statement and said he had seen everything except the operation where nuclear warheads are assembled. I was still impressed.
<P>    He asked me about nuclear security, and my response was not well received. I told him it was my perception that the United States had the best safeguards and security for nuclear materials in the world. I also noted the general concern, often expressed here, that protection of nuclear resources might be inconsistent following the breakup of the Soviet Union.
<P>    Loysha offered a couple of responses, neither of which were clear in translation. One seemed to say Russian security was as good as any. The other seemed to blame the Ukraine for any problems.
<P>    I was having doubts about the level of communication taking place, and he seemed to grow more agitated with each topic. His voice was louder, and his body language told me he wasn&#39;t happy.
<P>    As time for the interview neared an end, he asked about the economy. I told him it was a difficult time for Oak Ridge, with hundreds of people losing their jobs. He asked a question, which came translated as, &#39;&#39;How many publications cover this?&#39;&#39;
<P>    I stumbled with the wording, as I had with other questions. I didn&#39;t know what he meant. Publications?
<P>    &#39;&#39;Local or national?&#39;&#39; I asked.
<P>    When the translator returned the question, Loysha became enraged. He stood up and shouted something.
<P>    I was baffled, not sure what to say. As it turns out, he apparently wanted to know how many stories I had written on layoffs, but I couldn&#39;t figure that out at the time.
<P>    Anyway, Ms. Mikhaleva, the translator, turned to me in desperation. &#39;&#39;Please,&#39;&#39; she implored, &#39;&#39;tell me something or I am in serious trouble.&#39;&#39;
<P>    It was too late. She burst into big tears, the result of a Siberian tongue-lashing. Loysha and his cameraman gave only the briefest of salutations before turning sharply and leaving the office.
<P>    Kerr tried to console Mikhaleva, offering her a hanky. Then they left, too, and I was left to ponder the meaning of it all.
<P>    I&#39;m still working on that.

            <FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>any Tennesseans have no idea what Oak Ridge National Laboratory is. The rest take it for granted.
<P>    That oversimplifies the situation, of course, but it also reflects the truth.
<P>    Al Trivelpiece, director of the laboratory, often poses tricky wake-up questions, such as:
<P>    If ORNL were on the auction block, what would the state of Tennessee bid?
<P>    His point is that the laboratory is generally underappreciated
<P>    Trivelpiece believes state government probably would offer all sorts of enticements to land an institution of ORNL&#39;s prestige and economic significance, and that&#39;s probably true.
<P>    Fortunately, ORNL isn&#39;t going anyplace anytime soon, and Tennessee probably won&#39;t be forced into a bidding war, although Trivelpiece frequently warns us that the laboratory&#39;s existence isn&#39;t guaranteed.
<P>    Of more immediate concern is the level of research funding coming to the national labs, universities and other premier scientific institutions in the United States.
<P>    While the United States spends more money on research and development than any country in the world, the nation&#39;s financial support of science is not what it once was and undoubtedly not what it should be.
<P>    There, too, is a feeling among many that the bottom could fall out if the federal budget debates turn nasty in Washington. Even though the Clinton administration has said some nice things of late, there&#39;s no clear sense of science leadership, and one can&#39;t help but wonder if a program or two or three might not be sacrificed for political advantage.
<P>    It&#39;s discouraging that some budget analysts think of research as discretionary. When I hear that term, it makes me think of people trying to decide whether to spend their pocket change at the arcade, ice cream parlor or the race track.
<P>    Science and technology are more important than that.
<P>    If some of these folks care about science, they choose not to show it. On the other hand, there&#39;s a fine line between don&#39;t know and don&#39;t care, ignorance and indifference.
<P>    In a recent issue of Scientific Computing & Automation, the editor-in-chief, Elliot King, wrote a topical piece titled, &#39;&#39;Public Ignorance is the Hidden Threat to Scientific Research in the U.S.&#39;&#39; He based his editorial largely on results of an annual survey produced by the National Science Foundation.
<P>    After outlining the key indicators of research funding in the United States, which reaffirm the U.S. position of world leadership despite the decline in support and other disturbing trends, King noted:
<P>    &#39;&#39;The real hidden threat to scientific research in the U.S. is the public&#39;s appalling lack of knowledge about sciences. According to the NSF survey, more than 60percent of Americans have no understanding of scientific inquiry at all. Only twopercent understand scientific inquiry as the development and testing of theory. Only 21percent understand the concept of experimental study.
<P>    &#39;&#39;And there is more. Less than 10percent of Americans understand the term molecule; less than 20percent understand the term DNA; less than half know that electrons are smaller than atoms or that the earth goes around the sun once a year. (So how does the public understand reports about &#39;Life on Mars&#39;?)
<P>    &#39;&#39;Ironically, despite, or perhaps because of, this apparent lack of interest and understanding of science, the public has a good deal of confidence in the leadership of the scientific and medical community. Around 40percent expressed their confidence in scientists, compared to 25percent who have faith in leaders in education, religion and business and 10percent who have confidence in our political leadership.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Investment in R&D has stagnated for a decade but the public&#39;s apathy to science and engineering is its hidden threat to increased research support. The scientific establishment must use its reservoir of credibility to educate the public about the need to invest in discovery.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Interesting. I happen to agree with Mr. King.

        <p>This is one of a series of special reports on the Y-12
        nuclear weapons plant in the post-Cold War era. -- The
        Editor. </p>
        <p>The story is always the same. Maybe that's why it is
        so vexing. </p>
        <p>No matter how many times the U.S. Department of Energy
        denies there's a plan to move weapons work from the Y-12
        Plant to Los Alamos National Laboratory, another report
        trips an alarm and reinflates the anxiety in Oak Ridge. </p>
        <p>This time it was an item in Engineering News Record,
        headlined, ''DOE Taps Fluor for Los Alamos.'' </p>
        <p>The federal agency, according to the story, plans to
        spend about $800million in construction upgrades over the
        next decade at the New Mexico laboratory, and the work
        load is so great that Fluor Daniel Inc. has been hired to
        work side by side with Los Alamos on design and
        management of construction projects. </p>
        <p>First off, it is simply an astonishment to many that
        DOE is spending $800million on construction at Los Alamos
        when the agency is supposed to be downsizing the weapons
        complex and saving taxpayer money left and right. </p>
        <p>Secondly, from an Oak Ridge perspective, the Fluor
        contract arouses new suspicion that DOE's blueprint
        ultimately will consolidate the entire weapons complex in
        New Mexico. </p>
        <p>''I think DOE has been leading us down a path all
        along,'' said Bill Bibb, a retired DOE executive and
        co-founder of Citizens for National Security in Oak
        Ridge. </p>
        <p>For the past couple of years, Bibb and others have
        accused DOE of covertly trying to shift Y-12 missions to
        Los Alamos, a concept they fear could be ruinous to the
        nation's weapons capabilities. </p>
        <p>According to the Engineering News Record story, ''Los
        Alamos will be the only site in the nation's weapons
        complex capable of manufacturing nuclear weapons, and the
        facilities must be refurbished and updated to perform
        that task.'' </p>
        <p>That descriptive statement is attributed to ''agency
        spokesman'' Jim Danneskiold. </p>
        <p>Danneskiold actually is a not a DOE spokesman. He is a
        spokesman for Los Alamos, which is managed by the
        University of California, and he said the ENR statement
        is accurate except that nuclear weapons should be
        followed by the word ''pits'' -- as in plutonium pits. </p>
        <p>The spokesman said the mountain of construction is
        mostly intended to help prepare Los Alamos facilities for
        production of plutonium pits -- work formerly done at the
        Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado. </p>
        <p>Danneskiold said he did not mean to imply that Los
        Alamos would be the only weapons manufacturing site in
        the United States. He acknowledged that the recent
        environmental impact statement on nuclear stockpile
        management identified Y-12 as the preferred site for
        production of warhead secondaries from enriched uranium
        and other materials. </p>
        <p>The ENR story also quotes Danneskiold as saying,
        ''Rather than build a new weapons factory, the job falls
        to Los Alamos. But it will take quite a bit of
        reconfiguration.'' </p>
        <p>The spokesman said that quote was accurate, but again
        he emphasized Los Alamos is only following DOE's script
        for stockpile management plan. </p>
        <p>About $350million from Los Alamos' construction
        treasure chest will refurbish a facility known as TA-55,
        which houses the plutonium works. </p>
        <p>The price tag, of course, is an issue. When DOE
        decided to reduce the size of the complex in the
        post-Cold War era, moving plutonium work to Los Alamos
        was made because the capability already existed there. If
        the capability existed there, however, it sure is
        requiring some extensive -- and expensive -- fine-tuning.
        </p>
        <p>Another $120million will be spent on improvements
        already begun at the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research
        building. Oak Ridge critics have said the project is
        nothing more than a veiled attempt to replicate key Y-12
        functions at the New Mexico site. </p>
        <p>Danneskiold laughed when told the CMR facility had
        been labeled ''Y-12 West.'' </p>
        <p>It's easy to be skeptical of the Los Alamos work
        because capital improvements at most DOE weapons sites
        have been severely shorn. </p>
        <p>A November 1996 inspector general report noted, with
        some satisfaction, that following an earlier review on
        incompatible downsizing that Y-12 was forced to eliminate
        $53million in capital projects. Projects totalling
        hundreds of millions of dollars were cut at other DOE
        facilities, but somehow the powerhouse labs escaped
        relatively unscathed. </p>
        <p>In a press release heralding new construction at Los
        Alamos and creation of 200 jobs, U.S. Energy Secretary
        Hazel O'Leary offered this upbeat view: </p>
        <p>''I commend Los Alamos National Laboratory and the
        congressional leadership of New Mexico for forging this
        partnership for economic growth in Northern New Mexico.
        This contract is a significant step in building the
        facilities at Los Alamos that will enable it to fulfill
        its missions into the next century. An added benefit will
        be Fluor Daniel's long-term commitment to the economic
        development of northern New Mexico.'' </p>
        <p>In Oak Ridge, there will be a public hearing this week
        on DOE's plan to lay off 1,680 workers. </p>

        In the twilight of Aug. 6, 1988, Judith Hallock was
        arrested and charged with trespassing at the Y-12 nuclear
        weapons plant. </p>
        <p>For Hallock, the moment was much more than a one-line
        entry on the Oak Ridge police blotter. </p>
        <p>''It was the ultimate in my life's work. It was as if
        I was cosmically bound to be there . . . . It was a very
        emotional day for me.'' </p>
        <p>Hallock, now 44 years old, recalls the events of
        Hiroshima Day, 1988, with emotion even today. </p>
        <p>That summer evening, the 43rd anniversary of the
        A-bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, marked the first time
        Oak Ridge protesters challenged authorities at the
        government's top-secret installation. </p>
        <p>Before Hallock crossed the blue line marking the
        plant's protected boundary, she gathered in a circle with
        four others who planned to participate in the nonviolent
        act of civil disobedience. </p>
        <p>They talked of reasons for being there, for protesting
        the production of atomic weapons. They talked of hopes
        for peace, dreams that someday the world would live
        without the threat of total destruction. </p>
        <p>Hallock buried a quartz crystal at the site. ''That
        was the seed of my intention to help rid the world of
        nuclear weapons,'' she said. </p>
        <p>Each of the protesters came from a different
        background with a different set of convictions. But as
        they linked arms that evening, they shared a feeling that
        crossing the line would somehow prove more meaningful
        than a few steps on hot asphalt. </p>
        <p>Looking back, Hallock said their hopes may have been
        unrealistically inflated, but on that day she felt bigger
        than one person. </p>
        <p>''It was very powerful to tell the truth,'' she said,
        acknowledging that most people in Oak Ridge didn't share
        her views or appreciate her struggle. </p>
        <p>''When you speak the truth, it's not always socially
        acceptable.'' </p>
        <p>For the past 20 years, Hallock has lived in Whittier,
        N.C., just across the Smoky Mountains from East
        Tennessee. She's a nurse and the mother of three
        children, ages 21, 17 and 14. </p>
        <p>Nonviolence is a guiding principle in her life. She
        has studied the works of Gandhi and Martin Luther King
        Jr. She tries to apply their thoughts to her actions on a
        daily basis, such as volunteering a couple of times a
        week at a shelter for battered women. </p>
        <p>When she first became involved in the peace movement,
        Hallock wasn't even aware there was a weapons plant 100
        miles from her home. She met Stephen Smith, then a
        resident of Kentucky, at a protest at the Nevada Test
        Site, and they later helped found the Oak Ridge
        Environmental Peace Alliance. </p>
        <p>Hallock said she realized she could play a role
        without traveling halfway across the United States. </p>
        <p>She also has become involved in environmental issues,
        saying it's a natural outgrowth of her nonviolence
        training. The links between pollution and violence at Oak
        Ridge are clear-cut, she said. </p>
        <p>''Not only are they making a bomb, but they're
        dropping it in your backyard,'' she said. </p>
        <p>Hallock has mixed views of what's happened since
        August 1988. </p>
        <p>Y-12 is no longer engaged in the production of new
        weapons, but Hallock notes that the Oak Ridge plant still
        manufactures replacement parts for nuclear warheads and
        continues other production tasks. For that reason, she
        objects to the term ''post-Cold War.'' </p>
        <p>Hallock wonders if maybe peace activists stopped their
        work too soon -- and prematurely patted themselves on the
        back -- instead of trying to eliminate weapons entirely. </p>
        <p>''If we had stayed strong, maybe we wouldn't be
        struggling with these same things,'' she said. </p>
        <p>She is thankful for weapon reductions that have taken
        place, and she believes protests such as hers contributed
        to that happening. </p>
        <p>''At first we were just looked at as a bunch of
        lunatics, but maybe when the truth was said again and
        again . . . . You can't help but think in some way that
        we helped bring about the so-called end of the Cold
        War.'' </p>
        <p>Does she think the world is safer today? </p>
        <p>''Yeah, I do. I used to have nightmares about nuclear
        destruction. It hung over me . . . I am hopeful now, but
        you have to remain vigilant.'' </p>

        reports on the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant in the
        post-Cold War era. -- The Editor. </p>
        <p>There's a satellite dish stationed behind a warehouse
        at the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant, but it doesn't mean
        bored workers are watching Oprah. </p>
        <p>The device is used to help international inspectors
        keep watch on the Oak Ridge plant's reserves of
        bomb-grade uranium. </p>
        <p>As part of a post-Cold War agreement, representatives
        from the International Atomic Energy Agency have complete
        access to one of the Y-12 vaults containing highly
        enriched uranium, and they monitor it closely. The amount
        of uranium stored in that vault has not been disclosed
        publicly, but it reportedly is only a fraction of the
        stockpile at the heavily guarded installation. </p>
        <p>IAEA inspectors have made monthly visits to Oak Ridge
        since September 1994. They double-check access controls
        at the tube vault to make sure that none of the material
        has been removed or otherwise disturbed. They sometimes
        order chemical sampling of the uranium stocks to verify
        the composition. </p>
        <p>More recently, with the addition of the satellite
        technology, representatives at the IAEA headquarters in
        Vienna, Austria, can view the vault from thousands of
        miles away. They can watch, if they wish, the comings and goings
        there on a real-time basis. </p>
        <p>U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary tested the system
        herself during one of her controversial trips abroad. </p>
        <p>The satellite link, much like anything elsewhere in
        the weapons complex, is not universally admired. </p>
        <p>Critics see it as a needless toy that may generate
        more security problems than it resolves, and some
        belittle the entire IAEA setup as window dressing by an
        administration shopping for nuclear success stories. </p>
        <p>Others, including the Military Production Network (of
        which the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance is
        part), believe DOE should turn over more -- if not all --
        of the jurisdiction for Y-12's surplus uranium to
        international inspectors. </p>
        <p>* </p>
        <p>Has there ever been a documented theft of enriched
        uranium from Y-12? </p>
        <p>Of course not, Y-12 authorities answered without
        hesitation. </p>
        <p>But there have been rumors of missing uranium ever
        since the World War II Manhattan Project, and there are
        plenty of people -- including some former Y-12 workers --
        who insist that significant amounts of the fissile
        material have been removed despite the safeguards system. </p>
        <p>''The system involves security force and a number of
        mechanisms to account for materials in storage and
        monitor access to and exit from the area in the interest
        of health,'' a Y-12 spokeswoman said. ''The standards for
        health are so fully in place that moving out with
        (radioactive) materials would be far more difficult than
        leaving with materials on the sole of a shoe -- which is
        just about impossible.'' </p>
        <p>That situation may be characterized as nearly
        impossible now, but it wasn't impossible several years
        ago when visiting officials left Y-12 with uranium on
        their shoes and set off alarms a couple of days later at
        a nuclear facility in South Carolina. </p>
        <p>Since then, Y-12 technology has been upgraded
        significantly, including a $15 million perimeter
        detection system to counter terrorists and more hardware
        to scan workers -- and visitors -- for possible
        contamination. </p>
        <p>* </p>
        <p>While those worried about the nation's nuclear
        security often pose questions about Y-12 and protection
        of its inventory of fissile materials, less attention --
        from a public standpoint, anyway -- is paid to those
        carting the bombs on U.S. highways. </p>
        <p>The nuclear couriers, who nowadays prefer to be called
        special agents, are an interesting group. They must
        combine the talents of a truck driver with those of a
        special forces ace. </p>
        <p>Morale has long been a concern among the nuclear
        couriers, and that problem is worse now than ever,
        according to some members of the Southeastern unit based
        in Oak Ridge. </p>
        <p>Transporting nuclear weapons components from point to
        point is an incredible responsibility, and the potential
        threats to those couriers are broad and real. </p>
        <p>Some of those who have spoken out recently don't
        believe the Department of Energy has kept pace with the
        rise of terrorism. The couriers said they feel more
        vulnerable than before, and they suggest the public would
        be worried, too, if they knew more about the risks from
        certain terrorist scenarios. </p>
        <p>While not providing many details, the agents said
        there is intelligence information that indicates they are
        targeted by terrorists, individually as well as a group. </p>
        <p>They feel the need to protect themselves at all times,
        especially on the road, but federal regulations prevent
        them from carrying their weapons while off duty -- even
        if it's in a Holiday Inn soon after dropping off a
        nuclear shipment. </p>
        <p>There are other complaints, too, including concerns
        about new speed limits and extended tours of duty. </p>
        <p>If these nuclear couriers -- key cogs in the weapons
        chain of events -- are worried, should we all be a little
        worried? </p>
        <p>As one noted, ''I'm just glad Timothy McVeigh didn't
        know about us.'' </p>

        <font size="2"><strong>This is one of a series of special
        reports on the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant in the post-Cold
        War era. -- The Editor.</strong></font> </p>
        <p>It was the summer of 1983, and Frank D'Itri felt the
        heat. </p>
        <p>The Michigan State professor, one of the nation's top
        experts on water quality, was asked by congressional
        staff to testify regarding an environmental scandal
        brewing in Oak Ridge. </p>
        <p>A House Science and Technology subcommittee, headed by
        then-Rep. Al Gore Jr., was looking into pollution
        problems at the government complex, especially
        revelations of wholesale mercury releases from the Y-12
        nuclear weapons plant during the Cold War. </p>
        <p>Staff members wanted D'Itri to submit testimony on the
        dangers of mercury, etc., but the professor was
        uncomfortable serving as an expert witness because he
        hadn't actually seen the situation at Y-12. He knew
        testimony based on sampling data would be vulnerable to
        critics, who simply had to ask, ''Dr. D'Itri, have you
        been to Y-12?'' and his credibility would be shot all to
        heck. </p>
        <p>So he called Gore's staff in Washington and told them
        he couldn't do it under the circumstances. </p>
        <p>''They got a little bit panicked and said, 'Suppose we
        hire you and bring you down to Oak Ridge?' '' </p>
        <p>D'Itri was skeptical. He'd been an Air Force officer,
        had dealt with special weapons, knew all about security
        clearances and wondered aloud how much government
        overseers would let him see at a nuclear weapons plant. </p>
        <p>Congressional staffers reassured him. ''We'll take
        care of that,'' they said. </p>
        <p>And so D'Itri arrived in Oak Ridge a few days before
        the field hearing was to be held, July 11, 1983. The
        problems at Y-12 were worse than he suspected. </p>
        <p>While much of the mercury tonnage had washed
        downstream over the years and been covered with a
        protective layer of silt and sediment, D'Itri was
        flabbergasted at things taking place in the 1980s. </p>
        <p>''I couldn't believe what ... I was seeing,'' he said. </p>
        <p>At one site, workers poured truckloads of PCB
        (polychlorinated biphenyl) oils directly onto the ground.
        Elsewhere, 55-gallon drums of hazardous waste were dumped
        into acid-laden lagoons. </p>
        <p>D'Itri had a nightmarish vision of what was taking
        place underground. </p>
        <p>''They had, in my estimation, a total disregard for
        the groundwater and the potential for this stuff to be
        moved by the water. They were just absolutely cavalier
        about it.'' </p>
        <p>He said one manager at Y-12 was proud of the fact that
        wastes disappeared after they were dumped into the acidic
        S-3 Ponds. The problem was that the toxic gunk was
        bubbling to the surface a few hundred yards away in a
        dried creekbed, the visitor noted. </p>
        <p>D'Itri inquired about a low-level radioactive waste
        dump at Y-12, only to find he was standing on top of it.
        ''But this looks like a parking lot,'' he said to his
        hosts. </p>
        <p>To keep rainwater from rushing through the radioactive
        remains, Y-12 workers had paved over the burial site, he
        said. </p>
        <p>While Gore's staff made sure D'Itri got the access
        needed at Y-12, the key to his fact-finding mission was
        Barry Sulkin, a state pollution inspector who accompanied
        the group. Sulkin repeatedly whispered advice to D'Itri
        about what requests to make of Union Carbide, the DOE
        contractor. </p>
        <p>''If it hadn't been for him, they'd have snowed me,''
        D'Itri said. </p>
        <p>After a couple of days, he'd seen plenty. He spent the
        rest of the weekend preparing his testimony for Monday's
        congressional hearing. </p>
        <p>On Sunday, Gore arrived in town, and D'Itri was asked
        to meet with him after dinner. He wasn't sure what to
        expect, but he had a nagging fear that the congressman
        might want him to tone down his remarks. After all,
        D'Itri figured, this was Gore's home state, and the son
        of a senator clearly had political ambitions. Trashing
        Tennessee might not be looked upon favorably, he thought. </p>
        <p>''He was really quite candid,'' D'Itri recalled. ''He
        said to me, 'My staff tells me you're quite upset, quite
        amazed at what you're seeing.' '' </p>
        <p>Gore then asked D'Itri for his opinion of Y-12. </p>
        <p>''I told him, 'You're going to have some problems. I
        don't know if it's tomorrow or next week or five or 10
        years down the road.... The only thing that has saved Oak
        Ridge until now is that you've got 100 square miles and the
        area is controlled by security and keeping people out of
        there.' '' </p>
        <p>To which Gore replied, ''Do you think we have a Love
        Canal here?'' </p>
        <p>''I said, 'I can't answer that.' '' </p>
        <p>Gore asked D'Itri, ''What are you going to testify?'' </p>
        <p>''I'm just going to lay it all out there,'' he said. </p>
        <p>According to D'Itri, Gore gulped and said, ''OK.'' </p>
        <p>''I thought I was going to get leaned on,'' D'Itri
        said. ''But I really walked away from that meeting with
        Gore thinking to myself that, 'God, this guy is all
        right. He's got some principle.' I was impressed. When I
        hear him talking now and then about the environment, I
        think, 'Hey, he's got a record.' '' </p>

        <p><font size="2"><strong>This is one of a series of
        special reports on the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant in the post-Cold
        War era. -- The Editor. </strong></font></p>
        <p>After inspecting the stockpile of bomb-grade uranium
        at the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant earlier this year, an
        audit team came up with a list of 49 vulnerabilities. </p>
        <p>The team concluded, however, there was no reason for
        the public to be alarmed. </p>
        <p>''You don't have to run out and sell your house,''
        said Bill Rask, who directed the uranium assessment. </p>
        <p>Rask then wiped the smile off his face and said he
        didn't want to underplay the nature of safety problems at
        the Oak Ridge plant, which houses the nation's largest
        supply of highly enriched uranium. </p>
        <p>''There's a lot of work to be done,'' he said. </p>
        <p>The team's findings at Y-12 will be included in an
        upcoming report to be released on all Department of
        Energy facilities with highly enriched uranium. </p>
        <p>What is a vulnerability? Here's the definition used by
        Rask's team: </p>
        <p>''Conditions or weaknesses that could lead to
        unnecessary or increased exposure of workers or the
        public to radiation or associated chemical hazards from
        highly enriched uranium or the release of radioactive
        materials to the environment.'' </p>
        <p>The safety experts categorized the potential problems
        according to severity and the likelihood of occurrence.
        Fortunately, none of the uranium vulnerabilities at Y-12
        was viewed as a disaster waiting to happen, and many of
        the weaknesses were considered quite unlikely to cause a
        problem. </p>
        <p>In general, the team found the staff at Y-12
        knowledgeable of the plant's weaknesses. Many of the
        problems, in fact, had been identified in previous audits,
        including self-assessments conducted at the Oak Ridge
        facility. </p>
        <p>It's interesting to note that some of the potential
        hazards cited by the audit team were created by Y-12's
        stand-down in response to critical findings from a 1994
        visit by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. </p>
        <p>Because key operations at Y-12, such as enriched
        uranium processing, have been shut down for a long
        period, there is a buildup of bomb-grade uranium in
        undesirable forms. There is an accumulation of uranium
        scrap, as well as a backlog of contaminated trash that
        must be processed to remove the remnants of almost-pure
        U-235. </p>
        <p>Rask said about 100 tons of scrap containing highly
        enriched uranium is in a form that auditors would prefer
        not to see, but that issue won't be resolved until all
        normal activities resume at Y-12. Resumption could be a
        year away or longer. </p>
        <p>The safety team also noted that in-house waste
        materials increased the fire hazard. Fire concerns were a
        theme throughout the vulnerability report. </p>
        <p>Rask, who works at the government's Rocky Flats site
        in Colorado, said one of the problems facing Y-12 is a
        problem seen throughout the nuclear weapons complex in
        the post-Cold War period. As downsizing takes place,
        plants lose experience, and training hasn't replaced that
        loss of expertise. </p>
        <p>Another persistent issue at Y-12, as at other weapons
        facilities, is age. Many of the 200-plus buildings date
        to the World War II Manhattan Project or to construction
        add-ons that took place in the 1950s to meet Cold War
        production requirements. The ability of key facilities to
        withstand the force of earthquakes or tornadoes has been
        questioned repeatedly in recent years. </p>
        <p>John Powell, the environmental manager at Y-12, said
        about a third of the vulnerabilities identified by
        auditors have been corrected since their summer visit.
        Plans to resolve other problems are still in the works,
        he said. </p>
        <p>It's possible that some problems won't be corrected,
        Powell said, if the Department of Energy decides
        eliminating the risk is not worth the cost. </p>
        <p>Perhaps the strongest comments that Rask's team
        received from the public were not associated with safety
        findings but with potential vulnerabilities that the
        auditors did not address: terrorism and nuclear
        proliferation. </p>
        <p>Oak Ridge officials, of course, won't discuss security
        arrangements at Y-12 because they fear any discussion
        would weaken the plant's protection. </p>
        <p>However, some knowledgeable people -- including
        retired DOE security director Bill Phelps -- believe the
        potential for harm is much greater from terrorism or
        other security threats than virtually any scenario
        involving a safety breakdown. </p>
        <p>Alan Zaslow of the Tennessee Emergency Management
        Agency attended Rask's meeting and said state officials
        had reviewed sensitive papers regarding security at Y-12
        as well as emergency planning documents. Although Zaslow
        said the state was very concerned about the potential for terrorism
        in Oak Ridge, he said he was impressed with Y-12's preparedness
        for all sorts of threats. </p>
        <p>''You can never be ready completely for acts of
        terrorism,'' he said. </p>
        <p>Zaslow said TEMA is planning a full-scale emergency
        exercise at Y-12 sometime in the spring of 1997. </p>

		<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>his is one of a series of special reports on the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant in the post-Cold War era. -- The Editor.
<P>
<P>Gordon Fee, president of Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, has worked at all three of the government&#39;s Oak Ridge installations, but Y-12 was the soul of his career.
<P>    In an interview earlier this year, Fee described the plant and production of nuclear weapons in personal terms.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It was a family business,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ll never forget going to my first meeting, and they talked about this nuclear weapons business as a family. Because of security and the fact that the complex had been set up as a distributed set of sites -- the seven production sites and three laboratories -- it was very tight-knit.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Employees talked about weapons all the time, Fee said, but the talk was technical, not philosophical.
<P>    While think-tanks in Washington discussed deployment issues and debated how to avoid nuclear warfare, Oak Ridge officials were more likely to fret over specifications for a new weapon system and whether the plant needed a larger inventory of steel or nickel.
<P>    Fee said it would be wrong to assume that bomb builders longed to be bomb users.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I can honestly say I have never heard of a person at Y-12 that believed you ought to use a nuclear weapon. They were strong believers that we ought to have a defense component, but I never heard a person who said you should use one.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Fee worked at Y-12 at different points during his four decades in Oak Ridge. He managed the weapons plant for nine years, 1982-91, spanning the Reagan era and the last big production thrust of the Cold War.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It was a great period,&#39;&#39; he said, noting that it&#39;s always easier to manage a plant during a growth period than a downturn.
<P>    Some folks have suggested that Fee&#39;s presence and personality are a little wooden, but he&#39;s not apt to dance the macarena -- real or imagined -- to prove anybody wrong.
<P>    What he may lack in clever adornments, Fee recoups in substance. He&#39;s not an intellectual bully, as are some of his Ph.D.-toting colleagues in town. His information recall, however, is legendary.
<P>    Fee sometimes astonished participants at Y-12 meetings by having a better working knowledge of specific programs than the program managers. During his tenure, managers learned to be prepared or be embarrassed.
<P>    He tells good stories about Y-12, some of which illustrate the way things have changed since he came to Oak Ridge in the Cold War &#39;50s.
<P>    For many years, Bear Creek Road, including the section that runs alongside Y-12&#39;s full length, was open to through traffic. It was frequented by residents and workers taking a shortcut to the west side of Oak Ridge.
<P>    This was an anomaly within the U.S. weapons complex. Most nuclear plants were well segregated from the general population, and none had a public road so close to warhead production shops and buildings that housed bomb-making materials.
<P>    That changed when Joe La Grone became the Department of Energy&#39;s Oak Ridge manager in 1983. La Grone came to Oak Ridge from DOE&#39;s San Francisco office, which had oversight for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and he was savvy about nuclear protests and a newly emerging threat called terrorism.
<P>    According to Fee, La Grone was shocked at Y-12&#39;s accessibility. One of the new manager&#39;s first acts was to close Bear Creek Road, except for official traffic, and he told Y-12 officials he wanted the restrictions put in place quickly.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Mr. La Grone said, &#39;I want that road closed by 6:30 in the morning.&#39; This was about 5 o&#39;clock at night.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Fee said the urgent ultimatum didn&#39;t rattle George Evans, the contractor&#39;s security chief.
<P>    &#39;&#39;George Evans was one of the great doers in this place. You gave him an assignment, and George would get it done -- as long as you didn&#39;t ask him how he got it done or how much it cost.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Well, he blocked the road that night with Dempster Dumpsters full of sand. And the first car that showed up about dawn the next morning was a guy towing his bass boat. He wasn&#39;t an employee. He was a guy going to the lake to go fishing. He turned up Bear Creek Road, and there were all these boxes sitting there.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The bewildered fisherman turned around and left, but Fee said the Bear Creek blockade soon attracted security-conscious visitors from Washington.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The Secret Service people came down from the White House and said they&#39;d heard of a neat way to block a road. They had to block off the White House in a hurry ... and the first thing they used was Dempster Dumpsters full of sand.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Of course,&#39;&#39; Fee added, &#39;&#39;theirs were a lot prettier than ours.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Y-12 subsequently installed an abundance of security hardware to enhance the plant&#39;s physical protection, including pop-up barriers in the road, armored patrol vehicles and bulletproof watch towers.

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><i>This is one of a series of special reports on the Y-12
        nuclear weapons plant in the post-Cold War era. -- The
        Editor.</i> </p>
        <p>Fred P. Gustavson likes to be called Gus, an
        informality that belies his rigid approach to work at the
        Y-12 nuclear weapons plant. </p>
        <p>Gustavson spent 30 years on active duty in the U.S.
        Navy, achieving the rank of rear admiral, and there's no
        doubt where he acquired his appreciation for ritual and
        attention to detail. </p>
        <p>When he speaks, his words are precise and his
        sentences are orderly. In an interview earlier this year,
        he often described his thoughts with lists -- five priorities,
        six reasons, four steps to success, etc. </p>
        <p>There's a marching rhythm in his manner. He wears a
        favorite blue suit like a uniform without the
        decorations. The military background is undisguised and unequivocal. </p>
        <p>That's apparently what Lockheed Martin was looking for
        in 1995 when they hired the 52-year-old Gustavson to
        instill more discipline at the bomb plant. </p>
        <p>His title is vice president for defense and
        manufacturing. </p>
        <p>Gustavson's job is to return all of Y-12's operations
        to working order and prepare the federal facility for the
        21st century. </p>
        <p>Some Y-12 functions -- notably the plant's processing
        of bomb-grade uranium -- have not resumed since a safety
        stand-down was instigated in late-1994. The Defense
        Nuclear Facilities Safety Board continues to monitor the
        plant's progress, as do Department of Energy officials in
        Oak Ridge and Washington. </p>
        <p>How well Lockheed Martin manages Y-12 during this
        critical period may determine the contractor's future in
        Oak Ridge. There's a lot riding on Gustavson's
        leadership. </p>
        <p>Gustavson was trained and qualified in nuclear
        submarines, commanding a strategic squadron of 10 subs at
        one point late in his career. </p>
        <p>Nuclear Navy grads are a much-sought-after commodity,
        particularly in the nuclear industry. During the past
        couple of years, Y-12 has hired about 40 people from the
        nuclear side of the Navy and another 20 from commercial nuclear
        facilities. </p>
        <p>Gustavson described the attraction: </p>
        <p>''I think what the nuclear Navy person -- and the
        culture -- brings to the table is a unique blend of a
        person who is highly trained, motivated and is willing to
        accept responsibility. He is able to follow procedures
        and is not afraid, not concerned about raising the flag
        when there's something that is not quite right and say,
        'This is not quite right, and we need to go fix it.' '' </p>
        <p>Y-12 is being converted from a manufacturing plant
        that relied heavily on the experience of its workers to
        one based on strict adherence to procedures. </p>
        <p>Gustavson was expected to bring change to Y-12, and he
        did. How well has he done? That depends on who's doing
        the evaluating. </p>
        <p>Margaret Morrow, the admiral's deputy, gushes about
        her boss. She calls him ''incredibly bright,''
        ''refreshing'' and ''different.'' </p>
        <p>Her summation: ''He's a good person -- honest and
        tough.'' </p>
        <p>Morrow, who has worked at Y-12 for nearly 30 years,
        provides the nuclear weapons experience that Gustavson
        lacks. </p>
        <p>Gustavson gets grudgingly good reviews from the
        Department of Energy, although nobody -- either in Oak
        Ridge or Washington -- seems to be pleased with the pace
        of the return to operations. </p>
        <p>There are plenty of critics at Y-12, including those
        who don't like the brigade of military hirings or the new
        system that some workers think belittles the value of
        their experience. </p>
        <p>Union leader Carl ''Bubba'' Scarbrough said, ''I think
        everybody probably likes Gus OK, as far as a person. But,
        obviously, you've got to have 30-some years of experience
        in this plant to even know where the buildings are, OK?
        And we took it a little personal that, you know, the
        Navy's come to town.... I think the procedures we're
        going to change. But what I'm saying is the boss ought to
        know what's going on down in the plant, and really he
        can't. There's no way.'' </p>
        <p>Gustavson expresses nothing but admiration for the
        Y-12 workers. </p>
        <p>''I felt after my 30 years in the submarine corps that
        I'd had a career of dealing with patriots -- people
        totally dedicated to the service of their country. I was
        really gratified to find I had the same thing here. The
        people here have spent decades of very motivated service
        to the needs of the defense of their country.'' </p>
        <p>He once commanded a sub deployed under the Arctic ice
        cap. He matched wits with Soviet sailors. He traveled the
        world. </p>
        <p>By comparison, managing Y-12 might seem a little
        boring, but Gustavson insists that's not the case. </p>
        <p>''This is the same thing. It's not painted black and
        doesn't go into the water, but it's the same challenges
        in communicating your expectations to people, setting the
        standards for them to perform to and then evaluating the
        results.'' </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><strong>This is one of a series of special reports on the
        Y-12 nuclear weapons plant in the post-Cold War era. --
        The Editor. </strong></p>
        <p>'Rigor'' is a word heard a lot these days at Y-12. </p>
        <p>So much so that a Y-12 engineer recently complained of
        rigor mortis, which he and a few colleagues redefined as
        death by procedure. </p>
        <p>If an engineer, whose professional training is based
        on discipline and procedure, is complaining, it's not
        surprising that some plant workers have even harsher
        workplace descriptions -- most of which start with curse words
        and can't be printed here. </p>
        <p>The past couple of years, beginning with the
        stand-down instigated in late 1994, have been a miserable
        time at the nuclear weapons plant. </p>
        <p>A few, notably union leader Carl ''Bubba'' Scarbrough,
        attribute the chin-down attitude to the continuous
        downsizing and day-to-day job uncertainty that greets
        workers every morning at the gate. </p>
        <p>Others, however, point to the seemingly endless stream
        of changes invoked by the Defense Nuclear Facilities
        Safety Board, an advisory panel that critics view as a
        defacto regulator of the Department of Energy. </p>
        <p>This latest cultural face-lift at Y-12 is galling to
        long-time workers who think the weapons plant operated
        just fine for decades, meeting production deadlines and
        maintaining a safety record that stood up well against industrial
        standards. </p>
        <p>Y-12 employees, of course, didn't exactly embrace
        Tiger Teams in the 1980s, when hundreds of safety
        violations were identified by auditors. Still, Oak Ridge
        workers better understood those findings. Even though
        some safety violations were seen as nitpicking, most were
        recognized as real problems with hazardous implications. </p>
        <p>It was a painful and difficult process, but ultimately
        Y-12 employees came to accept the Tiger Teams and similar
        audits that followed. </p>
        <p>Acceptance, by most accounts, has been more difficult
        in the mid-1990s, as workers struggle with the importance
        of phrases like ''conduct of operations.'' Many have yet
        to grasp the need to convert Y-12 to a procedure-based
        system that relies less on worker experience and places more
        attention on doing things by the book. </p>
        <p>The lack of acceptance undoubtedly dates back to the
        Sept. 22, 1994, visit by DNFSB inspectors, who observed a
        violation in an enriched uranium storage area at Y-12. </p>
        <p>That was the start of the safety stand-down, which
        actually was ordered by Lockheed Martin -- the contractor
        that manages Y-12 for DOE -- after DNFSB staff became
        upset at the contractor's initial lack of response. </p>
        <p>The safety issue had to do with the way certain
        containers of uranium were stacked in a plant storage
        area. The stacking array was not one approved by the
        plant's written procedures for preventing nuclear
        criticality. </p>
        <p>As it turned out upon further review, the way the
        containers were stacked did not pose a safety hazard.
        There reportedly was no threat of a criticality accident
        -- the worst nightmare at a facility where fissile
        materials are stored. In fact, the particular arrangement
        was viewed as no threat at all. </p>
        <p>But the incident did show an inattention to procedures
        as they were written. If workers didn't know procedures
        or follow them, the argument went, then they might not
        always make the right decision when it came to stacking uranium
        containers or other tasks fraught with potential for
        nuclear danger. </p>
        <p>The Oak Ridge plant was virtually shut down in late
        1994 while all procedures were reviewed. Criticality
        safety documents were scrutinized and, in many instances,
        rewritten. Hundreds of weaknesses were identified in the
        manuals. </p>
        <p>Retraining became rampant in 1995, and workers were
        lectured repeatedly about the importance of rigor and
        conduct of operations if Y-12 was to survive into the
        next century -- or even the next fiscal year -- as a national-security
        operation. </p>
        <p>However, at the same time DOE and Lockheed Martin
        managers were preaching about the importance for change,
        they privately -- and, to some extent, publicly --
        minimized the significance of the incidents that
        triggered the stand-down. </p>
        <p>In some quarters, more emphasis was placed on the
        relative insignificance of the container stacking than on
        the potential for real problems. Supervisors and workers
        repeatedly shared examples of procedural violations that
        turned out to be safer situations than if procedures had
        been followed to the letter. </p>
        <p>That fostered an attitude, still prevalent among many
        Y-12 employees today, that even though the stand-down --
        and strict adherence to DNFSB recommendations -- is
        required for Y-12 to continue operating, it's an exercise
        that is excessive if not downright ridiculous. </p>
        <p>The subtle message from managers seems to be, ''Follow
        what I say, not what I think,'' and its undermining
        effect on morale may explain partly why the stand-down at
        Y- 12 is now into its third year. </p>

        <p>This is one of a series of special reports on the Y-12
        nuclear weapons plant in the post-Cold War era. -- The
        Editor. </p>
        <p>Because of the government's dominant presence in Oak
        Ridge since World War II, most of the city leaders --
        municipal, business and otherwise -- have been and remain
        in-the-pocket supporters. </p>
        <p>It's sometimes difficult to gauge the mind-set of
        average Oak Ridgers, especially those who don't work at
        one of the federal facilities. In an attempt to tap that
        part of the population, I talked this summer with some of those
        who help feed the masses in Oak Ridge. </p>
        <p>Call it the Fast Food Test. </p>
        <p>Y-12 was the topic for questions, and some responses
        were a little surprising. Even though the nuclear weapons
        plant has been a huge supplier of jobs in Oak Ridge since
        the 1940s-- and still employs more than 5,000 people --
        many of the young adults had no idea what kind of work
        takes place at Y-12. However, even those who knew little
        about Y-12 usually had formed some opinion of the federal
        plant. </p>
        <p>Here's a sampling: </p>
        <p>* Jason Dickey, an 18-year-old server at Mr. Gatti's
        pizza restaurant and graduate of Oak Ridge High School,
        said he was somewhat familiar with Y-12. </p>
        <p>Although he was unable to describe the work done at
        Y-12, Dickey said he didn't think there'd be much of an
        economic impact on the city if the federal government
        decided to close the plant. </p>
        <p>''I'm not speaking from knowledge but from
        observation,'' Dickey said. ''I know that every day at a
        certain time, all this traffic leaves Oak Ridge and very
        little traffic is entering Oak Ridge. I think that with
        all the people who work at the plant, only a minority are
        actually from Oak Ridge.... If they shut Y-12 down, then
        it'd be like the Graphite Reactor (a historic reactor that
        was closed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the
        1960s), the Visitor's Center and the American Museum of
        Science &amp; Energy in another 10 years. It'd just mean
        more for us.'' </p>
        <p>In other words, Dickey thought Y-12 could become a
        tourist attraction. </p>
        <p>* Olivia Anthony, a team leader at Mrs. Winner's fried
        chicken, said she grew up in the Knoxville area but only
        recently was transferred to Oak Ridge. </p>
        <p>''I've heard of it,'' the 21-year-old said of Y-12,
        ''but I don't know exactly what they do.'' </p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Anthony said the plant ''seems to be
        pretty important,'' and she said she would hate for
        anything to happen to it. </p>
        <p>* Kevin Lawson, a cashier at Taco Bell, knew the Y-12
        basics. ''I know they make bombs over there.'' </p>
        <p>Lawson, 19, grew up in Roane County and graduated from
        Oliver Springs High School. His dad has worked at Oak
        Ridge National Laboratory for 17 years. </p>
        <p>As for Y-12, Lawson said he wouldn't mind if DOE shut
        it down. </p>
        <p>''I kind of wish they would,'' he said, ''because if
        we were to get in a war I wouldn't want them to come in
        here.'' </p>
        <p>Because Oak Ridge is home to a nuclear weapons plant,
        Lawson believes the town and communities surrounding it
        might become a target for adversaries. </p>
        <p>''They could put it (Y-12) in a less populated area,''
        he said. </p>
        <p>As a hunter and fisherman, Lawson has other concerns
        about Y-12. The creek that runs behind the house where he
        lives is posted with warning signs because of pollution
        from the plant. When he hunts for deer, the carcasses have
        to be checked for radioactivity. </p>
        <p>''That ruins the whole effect of it,'' he said. </p>
        <p>* Roger Rymers, a 31-year-old custodian at Krystal,
        was knowledgeable about Y- 12. He also was the staunchest
        supporter among those surveyed. </p>
        <p>''I know they used to put together components for
        nuclear weapons, but right now I think they're
        dismantling those weapons,'' he said. </p>
        <p>If Y-12 were to be closed or severely downsized,
        Rymers said, ''That wouldn't be good for Oak Ridge.... I
        like Y-12. Indirectly or directly, I would say it is
        responsible for a lot of what Oak Ridge is. To get rid of
        that, it'd be kind of like getting rid of the part of Oak
        Ridge that makes it special.'' </p>
        <p>Even though the plant may have caused some pollution,
        that situation has opened up jobs for cleanup companies,
        Rymers said. </p>
        <p>Besides, he said, it'd make no sense to relocate the
        weapons work somewhere else. </p>
        <p>''There's already a building there, already people,
        and there's already experience at the facility, so why
        don't they just take advantage of it? Instead of building
        something new, just use what they've got.'' </p>

        <font size="5">T</font>his is one of a series of special
        reports on the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant in the
        post-Cold War era. -- The Editor. </p>
        <p>The breakup of the Soviet Union has given comfort to
        many people in the 1990s. </p>
        <p>Communism's failure, however, has not made life
        relaxing for those charged with guarding the Oak Ridge
        Y-12 Plant and other U.S. nuclear installations. </p>
        <p>''The thing that people don't seem to understand is
        that the post-Cold War world is far, far more dangerous
        and threatening than the Cold War ever was,'' said Bill
        Phelps, the Department of Energy's recently retired
        security director in Oak Ridge. </p>
        <p>Although the Soviet Union was a powerful adversary,
        its presence was stable and somewhat predictable -- not
        only in Russia and member states but in Middle East
        hotbeds like Libya and Iraq that looked to Moscow for support
        and guidance. </p>
        <p>''During the Cold War, there were very strong forces
        in control . . . . Those controls are gone now,'' Phelps
        said. ''Now you have all kinds of independent elements
        running around under no kind of centralized control, all
        with their own agenda. </p>
        <p>''Also, during the Cold War, all those nuclear
        materials were under pretty tight controls. No longer.
        Weapons of mass destruction are out there everywhere. You
        have chemical, biological weapons to deal with. You have the
        potential for improvised nuclear devices. All kinds of
        things.'' </p>
        <p>It's that backdrop that prompts Phelps to question
        whether DOE is doing enough to protect the national
        security and nuclear assets, such as hundreds of tons of
        bomb-grade uranium stored at Y-12. </p>
        <p>Phelps suggests the department's current priorities
        are out of whack. As an example, he cites DOE's
        operational stand-down at Y-12, where the agency's Oak
        Ridge contractors are spending millions of dollars trying
        to appease the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. </p>
        <p>Nearly two years after DNFSB inspectors identified
        weaknesses in procedures for handling enriched uranium at
        Y-12, key parts of the weapons facility still have not
        returned to normal activities. </p>
        <p>''That is absolutely appalling to me because the DNFSB
        can snap their fingers, and they go out and hire all
        these people to create all these written documents and
        these detailed procedures and all that in order to ensure safety
        while ignoring safeguards and security,'' Phelps said. </p>
        <p>By disregarding security needs, DOE may be ''enabling
        some disgruntled employee who wants to sabotage something
        to deliberately create an event that would be far more
        serious than something that would occur accidentally,''
        he said. The extra money pumped into safety programs comes
        from funds that could -- and should -- be spent on
        security, Phelps said. </p>
        <p>''At the least, let's have some balance here,'' he
        said. ''Let's don't go to the extreme on the safety side
        and ignore the security side.'' </p>
        <p>Phelps joined DOE in 1974. Before that he spent 20
        years with the U.S. Air Force Office of Special
        Investigations, where he was an agent specializing in
        counter-intelligence and counter-espionage. </p>
        <p>As security threats have changed over the years, so
        has Oak Ridge. </p>
        <p>When Y-12 was constructed during the World War II
        Manhattan Project, the plant was in the middle of armed
        encampment that extended for miles in every direction. </p>
        <p>''The outer perimeters were way out there, so nobody
        even got close to these production facilities,'' Phelps
        said. ''Over time, the city and the surrounding area has
        encroached on that facility, where now it's just over the
        hill and there you are.'' </p>
        <p>Indeed, no other nuclear weapons facility in the
        United States has a populated area as close as Y-12 does.
        To harden the target, DOE spent more than $200 million on
        security improvements at Y-12 in the 1980s -- including a
        high-tech electronic system to better detect intruders. </p>
        <p>''What we were doing was bringing that facility into
        the modern age,'' Phelps said. </p>
        <p>However, with dramatic reductions in security
        personnel, with insufficient funds for training, and with
        aging equipment that's not being replaced, he fears the
        level of preparedness is slipping into the danger zone. </p>
        <p>''They have a saying in those Middle Eastern
        countries: 'Revenge is best served cold.' I think we
        would be very, very wise to never forget that. These
        people can wait forever and ever and hit you when you're
        weakest, most vulnerable. And, make no mistake about it,
        there are elements all around us, watching and waiting
        for an opportunity to create some horrendous event or
        incident.'' </p>

				<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>his is one of a series of special reports on the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant in the post-Cold War era. -- The Editor.
<P>Bill Phelps is calm by nature. He&#39;s not the kind of guy who jumps up and down, screaming and yelling, either in joy or anger.
<P>    That demeanor served him well as the Department of Energy&#39;s security director in Oak Ridge. His job was to protect the nation&#39;s nuclear assets -- including the repository of bomb-grade uranium at Y-12 -- not to attract unnecessary attention.
<P>    Phelps retired in July, and he recently agreed to talk about security. Although he&#39;s not anxious to see his name in print, he is deeply concerned and wants people to know what&#39;s going on.
<P>    At a time when threats to Y-12 and other nuclear facilities are growing, the level of protection is declining. He thinks that trend is scary.
<P>    He also thinks it is wrong and needs to be corrected before terrorism arrives in Oak Ridge, radioactive debris is scattered across East Tennessee and tragedy becomes reality.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The stakes don&#39;t get any higher,&#39;&#39; Phelps said. &#39;&#39;In a nuclear facility, you cannot afford to play catchup. You don&#39;t get a second chance. One time is too many, and it is unthinkable.... Are you going to allow your protective forces, your security systems and so forth to deteriorate to such an extent that a potential adversary decides that maybe you&#39;re now soft enough to take on?
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s creeping up on us, and we&#39;re not doing anything about it.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Although he never mentions her by name, Phelps points the finger at U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O&#39;Leary.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I think DOE has done a very good job in the past, but I think the current administration in Washington -- the highest leadership in this department right now -- is allowing a very good, strong safeguards and security system to deteriorate.&#39;&#39;
<P>    In multiple instances, according to Phelps, security needs are simply being ignored.
<P>    Worse yet, he said, &#39;&#39;I think there are some elements within this administration that have an open dislike or disdain for safeguards and security.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Under O&#39;Leary&#39;s leadership, DOE has tried to rebuild trust with the public, preaching openness and reaching out to stakeholders across the country.
<P>    The federal agency also hired some of the sternest critics of its nuclear programs and placed them at high levels within the department.
<P>    &#39;&#39;That&#39;s very troublesome,&#39;&#39; Phelps replied when asked about that point. &#39;&#39;I think that&#39;s the tone for the direction that the entire program is taking.... When you&#39;ve got management support, you&#39;re going to have a good program. If you don&#39;t have management support, then the program is likely to suffer.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Budget cuts have been especially hurtful to security. In 1989, the Y-12 guard force was 546. It&#39;s now barely above 300.
<P>    Because Y-12 guards are unionized, job cuts are based on seniority. Phelps said that magnifies the impact.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Your youngest, most vigorous runners and gunners are the ones who get lopped off. Your older guys are very good, sharp, dedicated and all that, but, let&#39;s face it, is a 50-year-old protective force member able to respond as well as a 30-year-old, especially on a tactical unit kind of thing?
<P>    &#39;&#39;There&#39;s very little or no infusion of new blood coming into the system. Essentially no hiring at that level. Moreover, the dollars that are required to conduct adequate training are no longer there, and an army that does not train is not going to be effective.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Phelps also thinks DOE&#39;s newfound openness has worked against the security interests at Y-12.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Openness is one thing. Stupidity is another thing entirely. And sometimes it&#39;s just not smart to go into a lot of things for no apparent reason.&#39;&#39;
<P>    In the past few years, DOE has declassified enormous amounts of information related to the weapons program, and federal officials have talked freely about storage of fissile materials at Y-12 and other sensitive topics once considered off limits.
<P>    Phelps won&#39;t repeat specific statements that caused him discomfort, but he cited general areas of concerns.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I did not appreciate the detail that was disclosed in the press, with regard to facilities, their location, amounts of materials at a certain facility, building locations, etc., etc. I thought that was excessive and served no useful purpose.... Does the whole world need to know that?&#39;&#39;
<P>    Is DOE sacrificing security for phantom safety improvements at Y-12? Next week, Phelps talks about that and other topics, including the terrorist threat in the post-Cold War era.

unthinkable</b></font><p><em>This is one of a series of special reports on the Y-12 nuclear weapons 
plant in the post-Cold War period. -- The Editor. </em></p>
<p><font size=2><i>By Frank Munger News-Sentinel staff writer</i></font></p>
<p>The post-Cold War era. </p>
<p>As familiar as that term has become, few people talked about it -- or even 
thought about it -- a decade ago. It was unfathomable, especially at the 
Y-12 nuclear weapons plant in Oak Ridge. </p>
<p>Bob Wesley, a retired spokesman and public affairs specialist at Y-12, 
remembers the climate in the mid-1980s when the Oak Ridge plant was at 
peak operation. </p>
<p>An anecdote from Wesley helps put the period in perspective. </p>
<p>''I was part of a planning session with Y-12 division managers on the subject 
of possible threats to Y-12 operation, events or disasters that could possibly 
close the plant. Such sessions were held periodically. </p>
<p>''We were divided into five-person teams and discussed such potential 
threats as internal sabotage, terrorist attacks, chemical or radiation leaks, 
breakdown of weapons complex computer systems, weather disasters, etc., 
and the actions that could be taken to prevent such problems or to effect a 
rapid recovery if one of these problems should occur. </p>
<p>''In one of these sessions, the team I was on came up with the possibility that 
the Cold War might end suddenly, that the Soviet Union might finally decide 
it should get rid of Communism and end its aggressive posture toward the 
Free World. If that should occur, our argument went, the plant would no 
longer be needed to produce nuclear weapon components. </p>
<p>''It seems amusing now that this possibility was dismissed by the total 
management team as being the least likely thing that could disrupt Y-12 
operations. Only a few years later the Berlin Wall came down!'' </p>
<p>He added: ''It just caught us by surprise, like it caught our whole nation by 
surprise.... Our prayers worked. Our prayers actually worked.'' </p>
<p>The irony of the situation is worth a chuckle or two, but Wesley emphasizes 
that there's a painful side to the story. </p>
<p>''I'm glad that the Cold War is over and that the nuclear threat seems to have 
subsided for the time being, but I'm sorry that so many competent people 
are losing their jobs or being displaced.'' </p>
<p align=center><img src="../../images/blkbul.gif" align=bottom width=14 height=14> <img src="../../images/blkbul.gif" align=bottom width=14 height=14> <img src="../../images/blkbul.gif" align=bottom width=14 height=14></p>
<p>For workers at Y-12, the end of the Cold War is a daily reality. </p>
<p>Despite management exhortations that ''The pride is back!'' and good times 
will follow, many employees insist that morale in the workplace remains 
depressingly different than it was during the production years. </p>
<p>''I dread coming to work now,'' said a materials specialist whose job 
requires inspection of incoming and outgoing shipments at the weapons 
plant. ''I never used to dread coming to work.'' </p>
<p>The Y-12 worker, who asked that his name not be used, blamed the general 
lack of enthusiasm on the plant's current focus on procedures and conduct of 
operations instead of actual work. </p>
<p>Carl ''Bubba'' Scarbrough, president of Oak Ridge's largest labor 
organization, said he hears some of the same gripes, but he thinks the root of 
most complaints is job insecurity. </p>
<p>''Everybody is just real insecure, and it's getting worse because we're sensing 
that this downsizing may speed up. We've been really lucky and kind of 
handling it as it came along, but it's really speeding up and we have to live 
with the reality of it.'' </p>
<p>Many hourly employees come to work every day wondering if their names 
will be on the next layoff list, Scarbrough said. </p>
<p>''People say, 'Hell, go ahead and lay me off and get it over with.' Think 
about it.... Your family, your house, your quality of life. This insecurity is 
killing people.'' </p>
<p>The union leader said the problem is simple to understand: Y-12's defense 
budget is dropping -- by about $47million this fiscal year -- and there's 
nothing yet available to take its place. </p>
<p>''There's $47million missing, and even I understand there is going to be some 
impact, even if you work hard at it.'' </p>
<p>Although there are prospects for creating nonweapons jobs in Oak Ridge, 
most of them aren't good replacements for positions at Y-12 that 
traditionally have provided high hourly wages and strong benefits for 
craftsmen. </p>
<p>''Even the people trying to create jobs are not thinking big,'' Scarbrough 
said. ''They're thinking small. I've been raising hell just for that attitude. 
You've got to have the attitude of trading a $25 (per hour) job for a $25 
job, right? Guess what their attitude is? Twenty-five for a $10 job. Think 
about that mindset.'' </p>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size=2><strong>This is one of a series of special reports on the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant in the 
post-Cold War era. -- The Editor. </strong></font></p>
<p>During the Cold War, the Department of Energy and its predecessor 
agencies -- including the Atomic Energy Commission -- sometimes 
calculated the value of bomb-grade uranium to impress newspaper reporters 
and curious others. </p>
<p>In 1982, officials at the Y-12 weapons plant said a 10-pound button of 
enriched uranium was worth four times its weight in gold -- or about 
$200,000 at the time. </p>
<p>The hefty price tag presumably took into account the government's cost to 
produce and process the discs of nearly pure U-235, a critical element in 
nuclear weapons. </p>
<p>It's doubtful, however, that figure adequately reflected the many billions of 
dollars spent over a half-century on the uranium side of the U.S. nuclear 
deterrent. The true price tag would include construction, operation and, yes, 
cleanup of dozens of facilities in Oak Ridge and around the country. </p>
<p>From a financial viewpoint, the costs have been staggering, but national 
policy has always assumed that benefits to the citizenry were even greater, 
maybe incalculable. </p>
<p>At issue in the 1990s is what to do with the surplus amounts of highly 
enriched uranium, much of which is stored at Y-12 in Oak Ridge. </p>
<p>The vast stockpile is no longer needed in the post-Cold War period, and the 
United States is committed -- as is Russia -- to dramatically reduce the 
availability of fissile materials to ease proliferation concerns. </p>
<p>Following a lengthy study, with public input, DOE decided the best option is 
to ''downblend'' up to 200tons of the bomb-grade material by mixing it with 
other uranium stocks to lower the level of U-235 and make it unusable for 
weapons. </p>
<p>Even with that decision on record, the debate likely will continue over the 
ultimate disposition of the uranium. </p>
<p>DOE's goal is to sell most of the downblended material for use as nuclear 
reactor fuel. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said the sales could return as 
much $770million to the U.S. Treasury. </p>
<p>While that won't come close to balancing the ledger on the nation's uranium 
investment, O'Leary has characterized it as a DOE contribution to the 
federal deficit battle. </p>
<p>Some critics, including the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance, don't 
really argue with the decision to downblend the enriched uranium. However, 
they believe it is best to bury it as waste rather than use it for nuclear fuel and 
create other dangerous products -- including plutonium -- in the process. </p>
<p>Whatever the case, the surplus uranium isn't going to disappear anytime 
soon. It took decades to create the bomb material, and it is expected to take 
at least 20years to get rid of it. </p>
<p>Policy is one thing, process is another, and there are barriers to cross before 
springloading a new uranium program. </p>
<p>Y-12, the principal storage site, is also one of the facilities likely to 
participate in the downblending activities. It's a busy time there, particularly 
because the enriched uranium operations at Y-12 have been shut down for 
nearly two years as part of a stand-down related to the plant's conduct of 
operations. Restart is still a year away, maybe longer. </p>
<p>Plus, much of the uranium is not ready for downblending, either because of 
its current chemical form or location. A recent audit revealed that enriched 
uranium at Y-12 was stored or ensconced in an astonishing 29,000 
containers. </p>
<p>The Savannah River Plant, another DOE operation in South Carolina, also 
was identified as a facility capable of doing the downblending work, as were 
two commercial operations -- Babcock &amp; Wilcox in Virginia and Nuclear 
Fuel Services at Erwin, Tenn. </p>
<p>Interestingly, Babcock &amp; Wilcox recently signed a memorandum of 
agreement to lease some casting furnaces in Y-12's uranium-processing 
complex. If the company wins the contract, it apparently would do the 
downblending at Y-12 instead of its nuclear facilities in Lynchburg, Va. </p>
<p>It's important to many in Oak Ridge to keep the uranium work at Y-12, 
even if someone new has the reins. Part of that attitude is pride, but mostly 
it's about jobs. </p>
<p>''We'll work with whoever has the work,'' said Carl ''Bubba'' Scarbrough, 
Oak Ridge union leader. </p>

<p>Nothing defines Y-12 more than its half-century relationship with 
bomb-grade uranium.</p>
<p>The Oak Ridge plant was built during World War II to produce uranium for 
the first atomic bombs, including the ``Little Boy'' device dropped on 
Hiroshima, Japan. Y-12 successfully used an electromagnetic process to 
separate quantities of the fissile U-235 isotope, which constitutes less than 
1percent of uranium found in nature.</p>
<p>After the war was won, the plant's role was switched to manufacturing 
bombs and warhead parts -- especially those made from highly enriched 
uranium.</p>
<p>Y-12 also became the nation's chief storehouse for weapons-usable 
uranium, prompting its nickname as the Fort Knox of Uranium.</p>
<p>In the post-Cold War period, the storage role is more important than ever 
because of the U.S. focus on dismantling weapons once deployed at sites in 
the United States and abroad.</p>
<p>Early this year -- during the week of Jan. 15 -- Y-12 surpassed its historic 
maximum for storage of enriched uranium, 189metric tons. That total 
presumably has continued to grow since then, although the exact amount in 
storage at any current time is classified information.</p>
<p>How big is a ton of uranium? Probably not as big as most people think, 
because uranium is one of the heaviest elements on earth.</p>
<p>If it could be assembled in one chunk, a metric ton (2,200pounds) of 
bomb-grade uranium would be about a 15-inch cube, roughly the size of a 
microwave oven.</p>
<p>However, a Y-12 official emphasized that it would be impossible to put that 
much enriched uranium together without achieving nuclear criticality.</p>
<p>New storage vaults have been acquired to accommodate the influx of 
material from retired weapons systems, and plant managers insist that the 
growing supply of enriched uranium won't overburden Y-12's capabilities.</p>
<p>It's difficult to get a close-up perspective on the work with uranium, partly 
because visits to production areas at Y-12 are off-limits. Issues are further 
muddied by the range of terms used to describe nuclear materials in 
weapons.</p>
<p>For instance, highly enriched uranium and bomb-grade uranium may or may 
not be the same, and the definitions seem to change over time.</p>
<p>According to the Department of Energy, highly enriched uranium is uranium 
with a concentration of 20percent U-235 and above.</p>
<p>Strategic nuclear material -- when the term is applied to uranium -- can also 
mean 20percent U-235 or higher. In addition, DOE uses strategic to 
describe any fissile material ``having a present or future use related to the 
U.S. defense program.''</p>
<p>DOE now confirms that bomb-grade uranium has a U-235 level of 
93.15percent. In years past, the agency refused to be specific, citing 
classification.</p>
<p>Oralloy, which stands for Oak Ridge alloy, is another term frequently used in 
the weapons business to describe uranium metal with a U-235 content of 
93.15percent.</p>
<p>Handling uranium is not a routine industrial exercise at Y-12.</p>
<p>First off, the material is radioactive, although not intensely so and can be 
handled without some of the shielding needed for other nuclear elements. Its 
toxicity, however, can be a problem if ingested, with kidney damage a 
particular concern.</p>
<p>The biggest worry is criticality, keeping the fissionable material in a safe 
configuration to prevent an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction. A 1958 
criticality accident at Y-12 exposed eight workers to radiation, five of whom 
received severe doses.</p>
<p>Uranium also is pyrophoric. When uranium is milled and machined, as done 
at Y-12, fires can occur spontaneously among the chips and shavings. 
Therefore, machining tools are flooded with coolants, and other precautions 
are taken outside of the production processes.</p>
<p>In 1985, a basket containing nearly 8pounds of uranium chips caught fire, 
and the smoke carried enriched uranium into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The threat keeps everybody on their toes, according to a Y-12 machinist.</p>
<p>``You don't think it's exciting to work at Y-12? Hey, if you've ever seen 
enriched uranium burn, it can get real exciting.''</p>
<p>More on Y-12's work with uranium later.</p>

WAR CHANGES </h2>
<p><font size=3><em>This is one of a series of special reports on the Y-12 nuclear weapons 
plant in the post-Cold War era. -- The Editor.</em></font></p>
<p><em>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge bureau</em></p>
<p>Like so many others in Oak Ridge, Ken Brady's career was shaped by the 
Cold War.</p>
<p>When the United States braced for war with the Evil Empire, Brady 
managed bomb-building programs at Y-12. When the United States 
embraced Russia as a friend, he managed to find something else to do.</p>
<p>He feels fortunate for the opportunities.</p>
<p>Brady grew up in the Atomic City but never thought about working there. 
He went to Georgia Tech to play football, not to prepare himself for the 
weapons business.</p>
<p>After four years at halfback, Brady left Tech with a degree in business and a 
job at Rich's department store in downtown Atlanta. The retail life, however, 
lasted just a few months before he ended up back in Oak Ridge. That was 
1959.</p>
<p>Brady was hired at Y-12, the same plant where his father -- an analytical 
chemist -- worked during the World War II Manhattan Project.</p>
<p>As a materials dispatcher, Brady tracked bomb parts as they went through 
the manufacturing process. He later acquired other responsibilities.</p>
<p>When the weapons program dipped in the late 1960s and early '70s, Brady 
transferred from Y-12 to K-25, a sister plant on the government's Oak 
Ridge reservation.</p>
<p>He worked on a classified project to develop centrifuges as a method for 
separating isotopes of uranium for nuclear fuel. The timing was good for him. 
The energy crisis made the nuclear option look more attractive, and funding 
was readily available.</p>
<p>Brady spent 10 years at K-25 before returning to Y-12 in time for the 
Reagan administration and a new weapons buildup. He headed the staff that 
coordinated the Oak Ridge plant's work with Los Alamos National 
Laboratory -- a New Mexico lab that designs nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, Brady was named manager of the Y-12 program that 
produced warhead parts for the MX -- an intercontinental ballistic missile 
that subsequently came to be known as the Peacekeeper.</p>
<p>The MX and the Trident II, which went into production in 1987, were the 
last of the big weapons systems approved before the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of a decades-long standoff 
between the superpowers.</p>
<p>That period of rapid world change meant changes for Brady, too.</p>
<p>As events in the Soviet Union took a tumultuous turn, he was getting ready 
to direct Y-12's work on a proposed new weapon system. ``It was going to 
be an anti-submarine type, and I was kind of waiting around for that to kick 
off.''</p>
<p>However, with everything in flux, Martin Marietta -- then the contractor at 
Y-12 -- decided not to waste Brady's management talents. He was assigned 
on a temporary basis to the environmental cleanup effort.</p>
<p>That transfer helped transform Brady's Oak Ridge career once again.</p>
<p>He worked on projects that successfully sealed some of Y-12's most 
significant pollution sources. He was subsequently promoted to management 
of environment, safety and health programs at K-25 and then headed Martin 
Marietta's program to clean up and close down contaminated buildings no 
longer needed at five government plants.</p>
<p>Ironically, in a couple of instances, he faced the challenge of cleaning up 
legacies from his former work in weapons production.</p>
<p>Although he has gained a new appreciation for the environment, Brady 
doesn't appreciate those who try to portray the Cold War effort as a dirty 
deed.</p>
<p>``I tend to bristle a little about the `bad things' we did in Oak Ridge,'' he 
said. ``We did our part as the threat deterrent, and I think it worked.''</p>
<p>In 1994, the Department of Energy approved the most extensive and 
financially attractive buy-out package in Oak Ridge history, the front-end of 
a downsizing trend that continues today.</p>
<p>Brady was among those who opted for early retirement. He joined with 
several colleagues to form a consulting business, MS Technology Inc., of 
which he is a vice president,</p>
<p>Interestingly, environmental restoration is now Brady's specialty, even though 
it was a relatively small part of his work careers.</p>
<p>That may not be his ideal assignment, but the 59-year-old is realistic about 
the job prospects in town these days.</p>
<p>``I don't think weapon experts are much in demand.''</p>

<p><em>This is one of a </em><a href="../munedit.html"><em>series</em></a><em> of special reports on the Y-12 nuclear weapons 
plant in the post-Cold War era. -- The Editor.</em></p>
<p><em>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge bureau</em></p>
<p>Down a long hallway, for as far as Glenn Bell could see, nuclear bomb 
casings were lined up, row after row.</p>
<p>``My God,'' he thought, ``what would happen if just half of these were 
used?''</p>
<p>That anxious feeling momentarily froze Bell, but it left as quickly as it came, 
and he went back to work.</p>
<p>Another time, while completing an inspection, Bell had a similar flash.</p>
<p>``I realized I was sitting on a complete weapon, minus the propulsion 
system, that could wipe out this part of the state.''</p>
<p>Many men and women who work or have worked at the Y-12 Plant say 
they never considered one of the nuclear weapons built there might be used.</p>
<p>Bell is different. Maybe he's just more candid.</p>
<p>He admits -- and this, too, is unusual among Y-12ers -- that he once wanted 
to put the plant's potent products to use. During the Gulf War, he thought the 
United States should have nuked Saddam Hussein into never-never land.</p>
<p>The 48-year-old machinist doesn't hold much back. He expresses himself 
freely. That becomes even clearer when one sees the handiwork of his 
hobby/part-time job, painting fantasy scenes on vans and motorcycles.</p>
<p>Bell describes his artwork as sensual. Others might call it risque.</p>
<p>His experience at Y-12 has been a mix of good and bad. It started out 
good.</p>
<p>He came to Oak Ridge in the late 1960s, not long after graduating from high 
school in his West Tennessee hometown of Milan.</p>
<p>Bell is a patriotic man, maybe more than most, and going to work at Y-12 
was an important milestone, partly because he'd been eliminated from the 
Vietnam War draft due to a medical problem.</p>
<p>``I felt like this was kind of a substitute contribution to my country,'' he said.</p>
<p>He's proud of what Y-12 has done to keep the United States safe and 
whole. He's proud of himself and his contribution.</p>
<p>Bell has worked in just about every shop possible for a machinist, and there 
are a lot of possibilities among the plant's 200-plus buildings.</p>
<p>``I don't know whether I'm indispensable or whether nobody wants me,'' he 
jokes of his expansive tour of duty.</p>
<p>Y-12 is best known for its work with bomb-grade uranium, but the Oak 
Ridge plant has produced warhead components with a myriad of materials.</p>
<p>According to a 1993 report from the congressional Office of Technology 
Assessment, Y-12 workers process more than 80 ``weapons materials and 
chemicals contained in weapons assemblies.''</p>
<p>Among those warhead materials is beryllium, a lightweight, toxic metal that is 
handled in different chemical compositions, including an oxide form that 
looks like porcelain.</p>
<p>Bell worked in a beryllium inspection area during the mid-1980s. Today he 
is one of about two dozen Y-12 employees who have been diagnosed with 
chronic beryllium disease.</p>
<p>A study is underway to determine how many other present and former Y-12 
workers have this respiratory condition, which is associated with an 
allergic-like reaction to the metal.</p>
<p>CBD can make breathing tough and life unpleasant. In severe instances, it 
can be fatal.</p>
<p>Bell controls his illness with medicine and aerobic exercise. He laughs about 
being the only guy in jazzercise class. He can even joke about his symptoms. 
The personalized license plate on his van is ``WHEEZN,'' a reference to his 
breathing difficulties.</p>
<p>One thing Bell refuses to laugh about is the workplace where he and others 
were exposed to beryllium. He believes some exposures were unnecessary. 
He says procedures were in place to protect workers but they weren't 
always followed -- at least not when the work load was heavy.</p>
<p>``Production was put above all else at the time,'' he said.</p>
<p>Bell researched beryllium after his illness was diagnosed, and he was 
surprised to find out that the dangers were known for decades. He said 
Y-12 authorities knew of the hazards and even applied special precautions 
to projects many years ago.</p>
<p>Yet, in the shops, information wasn't always passed down to the working 
level. That bothers Bell because trust is essential in a national security plant 
like Y-12.</p>
<p>``We believed what we were told,'' he said, noting that the hazards of 
beryllium and other materials were sometimes understated.</p>
<p>Manuals may explain the dangers of chemicals from A to Z, but that 
guidance is often superseded by advice on the shop floor, passed along from 
supervisor to workers, worker to worker.</p>
<p>According to Bell, a common refrain among Y-12's beryllium workers was, 
``Aw, don't worry about it. You could eat this stuff and it wouldn't hurt you.''</p>
<p>He knows better now.</p>

SCENES </h2>
<p><strong>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge bureau</strong></p>
<p>This is one of a series of special reports on the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant 
in the post-Cold War era. -- The Editor.</p>
<p>Citizens for National Security, according to Bill Bibb, the group's founder 
and leader, is working like a submarine.</p>
<p>Quietly, effectively and out of sight.</p>
<p>That's an abrupt change of tactics from a year ago, when Bibb and CNS 
colleagues made their presence public and helped secure Oak Ridge's role in 
the U.S. nuclear weapons complex.</p>
<p>Bibb, a retired Department of Energy defense officer, was particularly 
forceful. He spoke out again and again, challenging some of his former 
associates in the nuclear weapons program. He suggested that collusion 
between the warhead design labs and the defense elite at DOE headquarters 
in Washington had become unhealthy and a detriment to good 
decision-making.</p>
<p>Bibb was convinced, as were others, that DOE was moving forward with a 
private plan to consolidate all weapons activities at the laboratories -- Los 
Alamos in New Mexico and Lawrence Livermore in California.</p>
<p>If that scenario were carried out, Y-12 would become just another DOE 
cleanup site.</p>
<p>More importantly, Bibb argued, it would fritter away the Oak Ridge plant's 
half century of experience and leave the United States without a proven 
capability for producing nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Although combining roles for the pared-down weapon needs of the 21st 
century appeared to offer great savings, critics maintained that such a move 
could come at the incalculable expense of national security.</p>
<p>DOE, of course, never confirmed such a plan, and more recently the agency 
recommended a long-term defense role for Y-12, both as a warhead 
manufacturing site and as a storage center for bomb-grade uranium.</p>
<p>Some observers believe Y-12 was the direct beneficiary of Citizens for 
National Security's involvement, keeping the debate public and the 
decision-making above board.</p>
<p>If that's so, why suddenly a low profile?</p>
<p>Because Bibb and CNS, which includes a stable of weapons experts 
formerly at Y-12, have turned their attention to educating members of 
Congress and their support staffs.</p>
<p>Any victories achieved to date are temporary, according to Bibb, and 
bashing DOE brings little in return, especially since the agency may not even 
exist at this time next year. Plus, there is a risk that CNS will be viewed as a 
group solely intent on saving Oak Ridge jobs, an image already exploited by 
DOE's defense hierarchy.</p>
<p>``This is not a jobs issue,'' Bibb insists. ``Y-12 is going to shrink. It's going 
to be a much, much smaller plant. That's a given.''</p>
<p>Although Bibb is an unabashed supporter of Y-12 and continued operations 
there, he said his reasons all pertain to good defense strategy, not economic 
preservation.</p>
<p>He believes the design labs are ill-equipped to tackle production missions. 
He also believes if precise manufacturing skills developed at Y-12 are 
allowed to erode, they may be lost forever.</p>
<p>The thrust of Bibb's campaign now is to promote ways to keep Y-12's 
technologies and bomb-making expertise available as long as needed, and 
he thinks that'll be a long time.</p>
<p>One idea involves a change in policy.</p>
<p>Bibb says the United States should adopt the re-manufacturing concept long 
used by Russia and Great Britain, whereby a certain percentage of weapons 
in the atomic arsenal is replaced on an annual basis. This not only gets rid of 
old weapons before their parts deteriorate, but it also keeps a steady supply 
of work in the defense facilities, he says.</p>
<p>The United States traditionally has relied on evaluations of weapons taken 
out of deployment to determine when modifications or replacements are 
needed.</p>
<p>Another idea is to formalize Y-12's role as a prototype manufacturing center 
for the federal government. Over its history, the Oak Ridge plant has been 
tapped for nonweapons projects requiring manufacturing skills unavailable 
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, Y-12 produced a special box for astronauts to 
collect moon rocks. More recently, the plant was asked to manufacture 
precise propeller parts for the Seawolf submarine.</p>
<p>It's the uniqueness of Y-12 that Bibb and his group want to preserve.</p>
<p>``We're losing that capability as every day moves forward,'' he warns.</p>

<p><em><strong>This is one of a series of special reports on the Y-12 nuclear weapons 
plant in the post-Cold War era. -- The Editor.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge bureau</em></p>
<p>Amid unsecured peace in the post-Cold War period, Y-12 continues to 
produce parts for nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>That may be a surprise to some, a comfort to others. To Ralph Hutchison, a 
peace activist who closely monitors the government's Oak Ridge operations, 
it's an outrage.</p>
<p>``That should be page-one news,'' the 39-year-old Presbyterian minister 
said.</p>
<p>Hutchison recalls the Department of Energy scored big headlines back in 
1992 when it announced warhead production had been halted at the Oak 
Ridge plant.</p>
<p>Federal officials, of course, never promised to stop production altogether, 
but that was the assumption of many and was the primary focus of news 
accounts.</p>
<p>What actually came to an end was the manufacture of new weapons. Y-12 
today is producing or preparing to produce replacement parts for nuclear 
systems already deployed.</p>
<p>``The challenge for us all is how to maintain a safe and reliable nuclear 
stockpile with no warhead testing and no production of new weapons 
systems,'' Y-12 defense chief Gus Gustavson said in testimony earlier this 
year before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>
<p>``Part of the solution is to retain the required manufacturing technologies and 
capabilities to fix or modify warheads when problems are identified by our 
stockpile surveillance programs.''</p>
<p>Margaret Morrow, Gustavson's deputy at Y-12, said the Oak Ridge plant 
annually receives 10 to 15 warhead assemblies taken out of deployment for 
evaluation. Workers examine parts originally built at Y-12, including 
warhead secondaries -- the second stage responsible for most of the 
explosive yield.</p>
<p>Key materials such as uranium and lithium compounds are tested for 
impurities and deterioration, broken down and cut apart, checked in every 
way possible to determine what -- if any -- changes have occurred since the 
weapons were manufactured. The Y-12 inspections are videotaped for 
further review by engineers and warhead designers.</p>
<p>Do the tests uncover problems? ``Occasionally,'' Morrow said.</p>
<p>That's not to say the weapons wouldn't work, officials emphasized. ``In 
every case, I'd say they're still good,'' Gustavson said.</p>
<p>Trends identified during evaluations help DOE make plans for maintaining 
the U.S. weapons stockpile.</p>
<p>Defense work apparently is on the rise at Y-12, allowing plant officials to 
rehire some of the machinists laid off in recent years.</p>
<p>Among the confirmed activities:</p>
<p>* Production of parts for the B-61, Mod-11. This is a modified version of 
the B-61 Bomb, which is sometimes referred to as the granddaddy of 
atomic bombs because of its long presence in the arsenal and numerous 
modifications.</p>
<p>* Preparations for life-extension work on W-87 warheads, which are part of 
the Peacekeeper weapon system (once known as the MX). This retrofit 
program reportedly is the biggest production effort to date in the post-Cold 
War era.</p>
<p>``They'll actually be sending ones (warhead components) into us, which we'll 
disassemble and make new parts for and then send them back,'' Morrow 
said.</p>
<p>* Production of limited-life components for the W-88 warheads, which are 
deployed on Trident II missiles. This activity involves cyclical replacement of 
depleted-uranium parts that are removed from warheads.</p>
<p>* Manufacture of mock warheads, known as type units or joint test 
assemblies, for the Defense Department. These dummies do not contain 
nuclear materials but are used to test missile systems and deployment 
platforms.</p>
<p>``There was never any stop in this production,'' Morrow said.</p>
<p>Hutchison questions why any weapons production is needed. He cited a 
study released earlier this year by the Institute for Energy and Environmental 
Research that showed safety and reliability were not a problem in the United 
States nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>Even if some nuclear weapons are going bad, he doesn't think it's necessary 
to replace them. ``We have more than enough.... If we have three, we have 
plenty.''</p>
<p>Other critics, however, think Y-12 should be increasing its production, not 
shutting it down.</p>
<p>More on that later.</p>

BE THE SAME </h2>
<p><em><strong>This is one of a series of special reports on the Y-12 nuclear weapons 
plant in the post-Cold War era -- The Editor.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge bureau</em></p>
<p>People don't seem to smile much at Y-12.</p>
<p>At security checkpoints, armed guards are pleasant but plain-faced. Plant 
workers walk past with purposeful strides, nodding to others, sometimes 
giving a quick wave. Mostly they look ahead and go about their duties, as if 
stopping or slowing down might cause something bad to happen.</p>
<p>The Oak Ridge plant, like so many industrial sites around the nation, has 
suffered from the contemporary cure-all known as downsizing. In the 1990s, 
thousands of workers have left the payroll. Some volunteered in order to 
take advantage of financial incentives that pad their pensions. Others had no 
choice.</p>
<p>Recurring personnel cuts, however, only partly explain the dour atmosphere 
at Y-12. Some old-timers say the plant was always that way. Maybe it's the 
mission. Building bombs is serious business. So is taking them apart.</p>
<p>But there's more to it than that.</p>
<p align=center>* * * </p>
<p>The last few years have been tough for Margaret Morrow, and she doesn't 
try to sugarcoat her feelings.</p>
<p>``It was probably the worst time of my life,'' she said.</p>
<p>Morrow is the No. 2 defense officer at Y-12. As such, she's been immersed 
in a cyclone of change -- most of it necessary, none of it fun.</p>
<p>She's had to lay off friends and say goodbye to others whose long careers at 
Y-12 came to a jagged and uncomfortable conclusion because defense 
dollars no longer supported their work.</p>
<p>Morrow also led an urgent effort to rewrite the book -- literally -- on how 
Y-12 does business. A stand-down was ordered in 1994 after inspectors 
from the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board found fault with aspects of 
the plant's safety program, especially procedures that govern 
decision-making in the nuclear workplace. Nearly two years later, Y-12 is 
still under pressure to prove it can meet contemporary standards, and some 
key work with bomb-grade uranium has yet to resume.</p>
<p>``The stand-down was a real blow to our self-esteem,'' Morrow said. 
``Y-12 and its people never like to recognize that we have failed in any 
way.... To see yourself not succeeding is a real demoralizer.''</p>
<p>Perhaps most difficult of all has been the always-present uncertainty over 
Y-12's place in the weapons complex. At one point, it appeared the 
Department of Energy wanted to close the facility and consolidate its work 
elsewhere to save money.</p>
<p>DOE now supports a long-term defense mission at Y-12, according to the 
latest set of plans, and in recent weeks some laid-off machinists have been 
called back to work to prepare for new assignments.</p>
<p>But nobody at the Oak Ridge plant takes its future for granted anymore.</p>
<p align=center>* * * </p>
<p>The way Gordon Fee looks at it, managing Y-12 was pretty easy back in 
the 1980s. At least compared to today.</p>
<p>``It was a great period. Back then, we produced products, and they came 
out the door and we could see what we were doing, what we had 
accomplished. Employees could understand what we were doing.''</p>
<p>Y-12's products, of course, were parts for nuclear warheads, fashioned 
from uranium, lithium and other materials. For decades, every weapon 
added to the U.S. atomic arsenal had Oak Ridge fingerprints on it.</p>
<p>The 1980s, when Fee was plant manager, was a particularly busy period at 
Y-12. The Reagan administration preached strength against the Evil Empire, 
and the U.S. Congress responded with approval and funding for a defense 
buildup. A new generation of weapon systems, such as the MX (later 
renamed the Peacekeeper) and the Trident II, emerged from the last great 
production period of the Cold War.</p>
<p>Fee is now president of Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, the contractor 
that manages Y-12 for the government.</p>
<p>``If you step back and reflect on it, it's sort of mind-boggling what has 
occurred,'' he said, referring not only to the fall of the Berlin Wall, collapse 
of the Soviet Union and other events that signaled the Cold War's end, but 
also to the quick chronology of change at Y-12.</p>
<p>Even if the plant retains its defense mission, Y-12 in the 21st century likely 
will be only a tenth the size of Y-12 in its bombmaking heyday.</p>
<p>That scenario recently evoked strong opinions in public hearings held by 
DOE. Fee notes simply and without discernible emotion, ``Y-12 will never 
be the same.''</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>August 7, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>GOOD NEWS FROM ECO STUDY AT 
ORNL </h2>
<p>By Frank Munger, News-Senitnel Oak Ridge bureau</p>
<p>Fish-eating wildlife do not appear to be adversely affected by pollutants 
from the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge plants, according to 
environmental scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.</p>
<p>The study found that eating contaminated fish did not hamper reproduction 
among the great blue heron and osprey living at Poplar Creek and the Clinch 
River.</p>
<p>Fish in those waterways contain mercury, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) 
and other pollutants associated with historic operations at the government's 
nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>The Oak Ridge birds had the same rate of reproduction as birds feeding in 
uncontaminated areas, and their offspring showed no evidence of harm, even 
though the eggs of the heron had measurable levels of PCBs and mercury.</p>
<p>In a related study, the scientists found that mink living in the area appeared 
to have fewer babies than average, but the young were considered normal. 
Fish are a major part of the mink's diet.</p>
<p>Glenn Suter, an ecologist at ORNL, said the research findings should be 
viewed as good news.</p>
<p>``Absolutely,'' he said.</p>
<p>Suter said there are three implications to be drawn from the study and all are 
positive:</p>
<p>* ``The direct implication is that fish-eating wildlife in the Clinch River and 
Poplar Creek are not being negatively affected by the contamination from 
DOE.</p>
<p>* ``A less direct implication is that these organisms, which are eating a lot 
more fish than humans would, are not experiencing severe toxic effects. 
Their reproduction is not being affected, and this would suggest that those 
kinds of effects wouldn't be occurring in humans either. But the limitation on 
that is the work we did with wildlife doesn't look at cancer effects, and that's 
the basis for the fishing advisory on PCBs. So we can't reassure people on 
that point.</p>
<p>* ``The third implication is that by doing some direct study of the 
contaminated sites, we can find out what the actual effects of the 
contaminants are. This eliminates the need to do costly remedial actions that 
might be necessitated if we limited ourselves to modeling the risk rather than 
direct measuring. By spending a little money on the field ecology, we 
potentially saved millions of dollars in remedial costs.''</p>
<p>Brad Sample, a wildlife toxicologist who participated in the study, agreed 
with Suter's conclusions.</p>
<p>Sample also noted that while information on cancer would be desirable, it's 
not easy to assess in wildlife. Unless a cancer is external and visible, it 
probably wouldn't be detectable, he said.</p>
<p>The high turnover rate -- due to predation, starvation and other factors -- 
makes cancer less of an issue for animals than humans. In some instances, 
the normal development time for cancer might exceed an animal's expected 
life span.</p>
<p>The study results weren't all that surprising, but there were open questions 
about the impacts of pollutants on fish-eating wildlife.</p>
<p>Suter said a screening assessment done in the early 1990s indicated there 
was some threat of reproductive harm.</p>
<p>``We used a conservative model ... and felt there was a sufficient chance to 
be worthy of investigation,'' he said.</p>
<p>The scientist also made an interesting point regarding the animals and the 
need to find out if they were being harmed by pollutants.</p>
<p>``If we had concluded that these organisms were affected, we wouldn't be 
able to eliminate the problem through fishing advisories. They can't read 
warning signs.''</p>

EVERYBODY'S TALKING </h2>
<p><em>By Frank Munger, Oak Ridge bureau</em></p>
<p>When Gov. Don Sundquist was in East Tennessee a few weeks ago, 
combining a little fund raising with the other neat things that governors do, he 
stopped by the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant for a brief visit and a few photo 
opportunities.</p>
<p>As part of the event, he spoke to a class of the first Governor's School for 
Manufacturing. The class was taking a field trip to the Department of Energy 
plant in Oak Ridge.</p>
<p>Sundquist began his remarks by thanking Dr. Joe Iannelli of the University of 
Tennessee, who was director of the Governor's School.</p>
<p>One problem: The usually articulate Sundquist couldn't seem to pronounce 
the director's last name. He started with ``O-I-uh ...'' and then tried ``I-O-ah 
...'' and finally gave up.</p>
<p>Like a good politician, however, Sundquist knows how to salvage a 
screwup. As he apologized to Iannelli, the governor made a proposal.</p>
<p>``I am Swedish, so you can mess up my name.''</p>
<p>That sounds like fun.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIMS &amp; CLAMOR:</strong> It's always helpful for politicians to have a few 
gifts to distribute around election time, and Vice President Al Gore had 
some goodies in his pocket when he visited his home state last week.</p>
<p>Among the tidbits was an announcement that the Department of Energy 
planned to provide $3.2million to the Community Reuse Organization of 
East Tennessee (CROET), a group that's supposed to coordinate programs 
that offset the impacts of declining federal funds in the post-Cold War era.</p>
<p>Soon after Gore's announcement came a statement from the camp of Rep. 
Zach Wamp, the first-term Republican from Tennessee's Third District (that 
includes Oak Ridge). Wamp wanted everyone to know that he was directly 
responsible for $1million of the $3.2million grant announced by Gore.</p>
<p>Of course, neither of the politicians was anxious to announce that the grant 
falls way short of what was requested ($9.5million), expected (about 
$6million) and needed (more than was requested or expected) in Oak Ridge 
and surrounding communities as they prepare for an economic downturn.</p>
<p>It was a bipartisan bit of deception.</p>
<p><strong>HOW BAD IS BAD: </strong>Some folks are shocked at Department of Energy 
projections that show the annual Oak Ridge budget may decline by $1billion 
soon after the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Jim Hall, the Oak Ridge manager, and other DOE officials are telling 
community leaders that the budget dropoff -- as the government concludes 
some missions, such as environmental cleanup, and reduces others -- could 
result in the loss of 7,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Hall said the federal agency wants to help with economic development so 
that there isn't a huge gap when DOE pulls out of Oak Ridge in the future.</p>
<p>More cynical observers think that the DOE may simply be trying to generate 
more support for the federal activities that are oftentimes taken for granted in 
Oak Ridge and East Tennessee.</p>
<p>By reciting the potential losses, DOE is reminding listeners or readers of the 
government's staggering importance to the regional economy. And there's no 
question that some DOE officials are getting in people's faces these days, 
making sure they understand just that.</p>
<p>Scare tactics?</p>
<p>Joe Lenhard, who heads the Community Reuse Organization of East 
Tennessee, said he welcomed Hall's comments.</p>
<p>``I think it's good that DOE is coming forward and noting these possibilities 
so that people in the city and the employees at the plants can start taking 
actions to mitigate the impacts,'' he said.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean that Lenhard, a retired DOE executive, swallowed the 
bait whole. ``I personally don't think things are ever going to be so bad as 
reflected by those numbers (cited by Hall).''</p>
<p>He also noted: ``There is a tremendous range of opportunities for mitigation, 
for bringing companies in to reuse the DOE assets, facilities, technologies, 
and create jobs that do not depend on the federal budget.''</p>

<TD WIDTH=470><H2>INCOMING WASTES PART OF STATE'S TRADE-OFF</H2>

<i>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel staff writer</i><P>

Just a few years ago, the state of Tennessee refused to allow the U.S. Department of Energy to haul toxic wastes from Weldon Spring, a Missouri cleanup site, to Oak Ridge.<P>

    The federal agency wanted to burn those wastes in an incinerator at the K-25 Site. The Oak Ridge incinerator is the only DOE facility in the United States that is licensed to burn certain kinds of wastes that have PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), radioactive substances and other hazardous chemicals.<P>

    The state, however, upheld a policy intended to keep Oak Ridge from becoming the nation's dumping ground.<P>

    Out-of-state wastes were barred unless there were special circumstances, such as a prior involvement by the Oak Ridge nuclear operations or conditions that satisfied Tennessee concerns.<P>

    An extensive review by state officials identified no reason to accept the hazardous wastes from Missouri.<P>

    That was in 1991.<P>

    As it turns out, an agreement was later reached, and with little fanfare those wastes were brought to Oak Ridge earlier this year and burned at the K-25 incinerator.<P>

    According to Steve McCracken, executive director of DOE's environmental management program in Oak Ridge, there were six shipments, each involving 3,000 to 4,000 gallons of liquid waste.<P>

    A large component of the Weldon Spring waste was tributyl phosphate, a solvent commonly used in the nuclear industry. Also in the mix were radioactive uranium and thorium, PCBs, and other toxic constituents left at the site once used to process uranium for the nuclear weapons program.<P>

    The Missouri wastes could be followed by shipments from DOE sites around the nation in the months and years ahead.<P>

    Tennessee authorities have changed their attitude. As a result, DOE's Oak Ridge incinerator may become a national treatment facility.<P>

    Earl Leming, the state's environmental oversight chief in Oak Ridge, said Tennessee and other states that host DOE nuclear facilities agreed to work together to resolve mutual problems. Negotiations were conducted through the National Governors Association.<P>

    There now is more flexibility on everybody's part.<P>

    Tennessee may relax its requirements to burn difficult-to-process wastes from Idaho or New York. In turn, New Mexico may dispose of Oak Ridge radioactive materials that are unacceptable anywhere else.<P>

    There are trade-offs, of course, and the deals undoubtedly won't satisfy everyone, especially those communities perceived to be getting the worst end of it.<P>

    ``We came up with a set of principles,'' said Leming, who serves as a technical adviser to the governor's committee on mixed wastes.<P>

    One of the principles is that states hosting DOE treatment facilities, such as Tennessee, won't be stuck with the remnants of wastes received from other states.<P>

    For instance, the residues and ashes left from burning the Weldon Spring wastes are now in storage at Oak Ridge, but they soon will be sent to a commercial landfill in Utah or returned to the original site in Missouri, according to Leming.<P>

    A fairly long list of other DOE cleanup sites have identified the Oak Ridge incinerator as a preferred alternative for treating some of their wastes. The requests typically involve unusual wastes in which there are few treatment options available.<P>

    Each project must be approved individually.<P>

    Leming said Tennessee officials rejected an initial proposal for burning wastes from California because not enough consideration had been given to treating those materials at the site of origin.<P>

    State overseers, however, have approved the burning of wastes from a number of DOE facilities in Ohio, including the Fernald uranium foundry near Cincinnati and a uranium extrusion plant outside Cleveland.<P>

    There also is the likelihood of wastes coming to the Oak Ridge incinerator from nuclear sites in New York, Colorado, New Mexico and Idaho.<P>

    ``It's hard to close the door,'' Leming said. ``States are going to have to work together.''<P>

SHARE LATER </h2>
<p><em>By Frank Munger, Oak Ridge Bureau</em> </p>
<p>It's hard to imagine, but there apparently are companies willing to spend their 
own money helping the Department of Energy clean up some of the 
government's messy legacies in Oak Ridge. </p>
<p>The incentive, of course, is that the companies ultimately will make more 
money in return for their initial investment of time, money and expertise. </p>
<p>That's a general strategy DOE is using to speed the decommissioning and 
cleanup of old facilities on the federal reservation. It's also a way to reduce 
the wad of money spent annually just to maintain these aging structures and 
keep the hazards from getting out of hand. </p>
<p>If it works, taxpayers may actually get a break -- for a change. </p>
<p>The newest target is an inactive research reactor at Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory. The Homogeneous Reactor Experiment (HRE) has been shut 
down and defueled since the early 1960s, but it still contains some 
radioactive materials inside the reactor core, as well as the process piping. </p>
<p>The nuclear reactor isn't considered a high-hazard facility compared to other 
problems awaiting attention. It's rarely mentioned when folks discuss the 
Oak Ridge priorities for reducing risks to the environment and human health. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the HRE requires attention -- and money -- to make sure the 
situation remains relatively benign. This is known, in regulatory parlance, as 
``surveillance and maintenance.'' </p>
<p>According to Robert Brown of DOE, the federal agency annually spends 
megabucks for upkeep at the aging reactor and other facilities like it on the 
Oak Ridge reservation. </p>
<p>Brown is the official in charge of DOE's reindustrialization program, which 
finds new uses for old facilities. He would like to cut the maintenance costs 
so funds could be applied to other Oak Ridge projects. Quick cleanup of 
contaminated sites also will broaden their potential for reuse and make them 
more attractive to would-be tenants. </p>
<p>Most of DOE's reindustrialization effort to date has taken place at the K-25 
plant, which formerly housed a uranium-enrichment operation and has lots of 
surplus buildings available, but Oak Ridge officials recently solicited ideas 
from companies interested in the research reactor at ORNL. </p>
<p>The reactor's potential for privatization was advertised on the World Wide 
Web, and Brown said two companies have expressed serious interest so far. </p>
<p>Actually, privatization on this project may be a misnomer. Even though DOE 
advertised that companies might be able to use the inactive reactor for other 
purposes -- such as warehousing or recycling operations -- that option has 
been withdrawn because ORNL indicated to DOE that the lab has a future 
need for the site. </p>
<p>Laboratory Director Alvin Trivelpiece reportedly hit the ceiling when he 
learned that the reactor was being advertised for other alternative uses. </p>
<p>DOE, however, is still pursuing the option of using a private company as the 
agency's landlord at the site. </p>
<p>Brown won't discuss details of possible dealmaking because of proprietary 
concerns, but DOE apparently wants a company to invest a certain amount 
to stabilize the reactor site in such a way that maintenance needs are 
dramatically reduced. For instance, steps would be taken to minimize the 
chance of groundwater infiltrating the nuclear facility. Other efforts would 
reduce the radioactive contamination or further isolate it. </p>
<p>The DOE contractor would spend the lump-sum money that DOE has been 
unable -- or unwilling -- to commit over the past 30 years to safely secure 
the site for the long term. In return, DOE would share the funds annually that 
would have been spent on maintenance and oversight of the facility. </p>
<p>Brown said DOE is still evaluating the potential for savings, but he said he's 
encouraged by the interest shown so far. The DOE official said the reactor 
project is ``on the front burner,'' and formal proposals on the project may be 
sought before year's end. </p>
<p>If the concept catches on, it may be applied to other, more difficult projects. </p>

<HEAD><TITLE>LAYOFFS LOOM, BUT DOE'S NOT TALKING</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="/images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>June 26, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>LAYOFFS LOOM, BUT DOE'S NOT TALKING</H2>

<I>By Frank Munger, Oak Ridge bureau</I><P>

The dominant theme of recent mail -- electronic and otherwise -- is layoffs. It seems like everyone wants to know when the Big One is coming in Oak Ridge, and speculation is nearing flood stage.<P>

    Some people believe the cuts will be far more severe than those taken in the past five years, especially hurtful because voluntary reductions probably won't be as effective as in the past. Many of the workers interested in taking early retirement have already opted for one of the financial-incentive packages offered in previous cutbacks.<P>

    Among the rumors is that Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is managed by Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corp., will face reductions of 500 to 800 people. Another rumor is that the environmental management program of Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, which does most of the pollution cleanup and waste management, will be forced to eliminate 800 jobs to make budget ends meet.<P>

    Overall, the prevailing thought is that 2,000 jobs could be lopped off Lockheed Martin's Oak Ridge payrolls.<P>

    Cynics -- or should we call them realists? -- suggest that the announcement on jobs cuts won't come until after the elections this fall.<P>

    The Department of Energy, of course, isn't offering much in the way of insight.<P>

    I asked DOE for a response to the growing uncertainty among Oak Ridge contractors, and agency spokesman Steve Wyatt gave this official line: ``Until the (fiscal year 1997) budget is final, we will not know the impact on DOE programs and, of course, employment in Oak Ridge.... Our information has to be based on the final budget figure, and we just don't have that at this time.''<P>

    The notion that DOE has to have final budget confirmation in order to act is just downright silly. In fact, the agency often has moved in anticipation of future budgets in order to minimize impacts. Eliminating jobs early sometimes can reduce the overall job losses because the savings have a cumulative effect.<P>

    I hate to give the brass at DOE more credit than they deserve, but they know more than they're saying.<P>

    Sure enough, a few days after my inquiry about forthcoming reductions, Lockheed Martin Energy Systems announced that DOE had given approval for a ``Retirement Incentive Program'' in 1996-97.<P>

    Company officials hope the action will reduce the work force by 500 to 600 employees ``in anticipation of budgetary reductions and changing missions.''<P>

    Some observers believe that projection is mighty optimistic. They think Lockheed Martin may have to resort to threats to get that many volunteers.<P>

    Actually, the biggest incentive to leave may not be financial. It may be the realization that in the long term there's no other choice.<P>

<P>
    Some folks might say it's ill-advised for the Department of Energy to start a new 10-year plan for its environmental cleanup program at this point, perhaps just a few months away from a change of administrations.<P>

    I'm one of those folks. It strikes me as a peculiar form of self-anointment that's bound to cost taxpayers a few more dollars down the line.<P>

    Al Alm, DOE's assistant secretary for environmental management, recently directed the field offices such as Oak Ridge to come up with new 10-year plans to address the needs of their operations.<P>

    To his credit, at least Alm addressed the obvious question when he said in his authorizing memo:<P>

    ``This is not designed to be yet another plan or extraneous exercise.''<P>

    Of course, that's probably what it will be, especially if there's a new regime in Washington come 1997.<P>

    Under the best of circumstances, it's difficult to provide any continuity between political administrations because the new kids always want to put their stamp on things. Even when good programs are underway with good results, there is a temptation to change them -- just for change's sake.<P>

    That has certainly been true at the Department of Energy, where new slogans and new plans are as common as threats to abolish the agency.<P>

    You can bet that Al Alm's new vision will last as long as his political appointment in Washington. Maybe not even that long.<P>

    Next.<P>

<TD WIDTH=470><H2>A HALL OF FAME CREATED IN OAK RIDGE?</H2>

<I>By Frank Munger, Oak Ridge bureau</I><P>

Father's Day is already past, but I thought I would share a letter from Dr. James C. Little Jr., a physician in Sanford, N.C. His inspirational message is about his father, of whom he is obviously proud, but it has a broader meaning, too.<P>

    Dr. Little wrote: ``From 1942 through 1976, my father was a superstar at the Y-12 plant.<P>

    ``His name is James Conrad Little.<P>

    ``He was engineering supervisor in charge of mechanical aspects of the plant. He established many safety records. He was written up in the Y-12 bulletin many times. He did consulting on loan to many firms around the country. He gave lectures at national meetings.<P>

    ``He was sent in 1968 to Houston to help NASA design the moon rock box from a solid block of aluminum and to design the receiving laboratory deep in the ground under a hundred feet of granite.<P>

    ``He remembers in his old age, but he is not remembered. He should be remembered and honored for the magnificent contributions he made to Y-12, Oak Ridge and the United States. He was one of the people who kept us free. He is one of many who should be uplifted and given credit for what they have done for us all.<P>

    ``I believe that honoring the past is a way of inspiring the present. In other words, if morale is low at the plants now because of loss of purpose and safety concerns, then make the present employees feel important and useful and potentially heroic by making heroes out of those who have gone before.<P>

    ``There should be a `Hall of Fame' in Oak Ridge, a way of recognizing the great people and wonderful contributions of the past 50 years.<P>

    ``. . . Dad lives two miles from me, is active and bright at 84 years old. He is now studying relativity and black holes and quasars.<P>

    ``Please recognize him and others from Oak Ridge's formative years. You know, they are the ones who kept us free, who made sure that English, not Japanese or German, is the language of our government.''

  <B>  UGH:</B> Comments last week by Gov. Don Sundquist raised my eyebrows and turned my stomach.<P>

    In a story regarding the opening of two new production facilities at Eastman's chemical complex in Kingsport, Sundquist was quoted as saying, ``We intend for Tennessee to remain a premier business location -- a place of low taxes and light regulation, a place where government and industry work together.''<P>

    What in the heck is light regulation? You either enforce the rules or you don't. Lack of regulation led to decades of environmental abuse in this country, including widespread problems at the nuclear facilities in Oak Ridge, and the price tag for cleanup is enormous.<P>

    The concept of light regulation is repugnant. It slightly stinks.

   <B> ALMS FOR THE POOR:</B> With downsizing and budget reductions a way of life in Oak Ridge, the perks for working at the federal facilities aren't what they used to be.<P>

    There are examples of this all over the place. For instance, the internal news line at Lockheed Martin (the Department of Energy's chief contractor) recently informed employees that new identification badges are on the way. Employees were told when to expect the new DOE standard badges and when to begin using them.<P>

    The news item concluded with this cheery message: ``Employees may then keep the old badge as a souvenir.''<P>

    Well, it beats nothing. Maybe.

   <B> ENVIRO PROBE</B>: Hazardous Waste Remedial Actions Program (HAZWRAP), a division of Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, is under investigation. The inquiry reportedly pertains to projects done for the Air Force under a federal interagency agreement with the Department of Energy.<P>

    Steve Wyatt, a spokesman in DOE's Oak Ridge office, confirmed that representatives of DOE's Inspector General and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations visited the HAZWRAP facilities in Oliver Springs June 6. He said the visitors requested documents related to contracts with the Air Force.<P>

    ``Energy Systems cooperated fully and supplied the documents requested,'' Wyatt said.<P>

    No details were available from investigators.<P>

    HAZWRAP was established in 1984 to provide special cleanup services to DOE and other agencies. Much of the work has been for various components of the Defense Department.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>ORNL SHOWS CAN BE GAIN WITHOUT PAIN</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="/images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><I>June 12, 1996</I>
<TD width=470><H2>ORNL SHOWS CAN BE GAIN WITHOUT PAIN</H2>

<I>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge Bureau</I><P>

Some of the super-cool stuff happening at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is making life a little less painful.<P>

    A laser-based biopsy system has attracted considerable attention in recent months, and its early success is due largely to the research of ORNL's Tuan Vo-Dinh, the Vietnamese native whose genius continues to amaze us.<P>

    The so-called optical biopsy has been successful in diagnosing certain types of cancer without removing any tissue. Just as important, the system provides a diagnosis almost immediately.<P>

    The technology relies on the interpretation of different light intensities after a laser is directed onto suspect tissues.<P>

    There is broad potential, medically and commercially.<P>

    Other projects also are being built on innovative science at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Among them:<P>

    <IMG SRC="../../images/icons/blkbul.gif" ALT="*" ALIGN="TOP" HSPACE=2 VSPACE=2>A sophisticated system that can predict the onset of seizures and perhaps help epileptics and their medical practitioners better control the condition.<P>

    ORNL researchers Lee Hively, Ned Clapp, Stuart Daw and Bill Lawkins devised methods that can decipher the complicated data from an electroencephalogram, especially the brain-wave activity, and predict a seizure up to 15 minutes before it occurs. They are working with Dr. Michael Eisenstadt, a neurologist at St Mary's Medical Center in Knoxville, to bring this research to medical usefulness.<P>

    One possibility is development of a portable device that monitors brain-wave activity and beeps when a seizure is forthcoming. This would enable the wearer to take appropriate action, such as medication. One day, perhaps, the technology would be able to send an electrical impulse to stem the seizure before it happens.<P>

    <IMG SRC="../../images/icons/blkbul.gif" ALT="*" ALIGN="TOP" HSPACE=2 VSPACE=2A glucose-checking device that may eliminate the blood tests now endured by many diabetics, sometimes daily.<P>

    Again, Vo-Dinh is playing an important role. He and colleagues in ORNL's Health Sciences Research Division are working with a private company -- SpectRx Inc. of Georgia -- to provide quick results without a needle.<P>

    By analyzing changes in protein molecules in the eye, researchers believe they can simulate the results of the hemoglobin Alc procedures now used to measure glucose levels.<P>

    An ORNL device will scan the eye with light of varying wavelengths and detect subtle changes instantaneously, again relying on the emitted response to the illumination. Another important aspect of this work is that it produces no biological wastes that have to be disposed of somewhere.<P>

    SpectRx plans to develop a safe, hand-held device that combines the technologies needed for analysis of those with diabetes mellitus, which affects millions of people.<P>

    <IMG SRC="../../images/icons/blkbul.gif" ALT="*" ALIGN="top" HSPACE=2 VSPACE=2A new generation of mass spectrometers -- once used to separate isotopes of uranium for atomic bombs -- can detect the presence of chemicals at exceedingly low levels, with almost unlimited applications.<P>

    Michelle Buchanan, an analytical chemist, recently told a group of young, would-be scientists that the Oak Ridge laboratory is a neat place to work because there's a continuous education taking place.<P>

    ``Getting into something you may think is trivial can open up something totally new,'' she said.<P>

    Buchanan got involved in analyzing the chemical composition of fingerprints to help law-enforcement agents better understand why children's fingerprints often weren't available where they should be. The answer has to do with chemical composition and the apparent lack of fatty secretions at early ages.<P>

    While looking at that problem, however, the ORNL scientist and her colleagues started thinking about other information that may be at our fingertips -- literally.<P>

    Certain conditions in the body release organic compounds -- known as esters -- that can be measured on the skin. The manner in which the body metabolizes substances also shows up in the delicate mix of chemicals found on the surface.<P>

    Scientists soon may be able to assess cholesterol levels without drawing blood and identify alcohol abusers with a simple check. In the same molecular manner, new technologies can help spot marijuana smokers and steroid users.<P>

    What next?<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>O'LEARY REFUELS TALK ON OAK RIDGE CONTRACTS</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF>


<IMG SRC="/images/mungersm.gif" ALT="" BORDER=1 HSPACE=5 ALIGN=left><B>FRANK MUNGER</B><BR>
E-mail:  <A HREF="mailto:73302.1254@compuserve.com">73302.1254@compuserve.com</A>

<I>June 5, 1996</I>
<HR>
<H2>O'LEARY REFUELS TALK ON OAK RIDGE CONTRACTS</H2>

Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary intensified the guessing game in Oak Ridge with her comment last week that DOE remains keen on rebidding the contracts held by Lockheed Martin.<P>

    It's hard to know what she had in mind. The decision, of course, is hers. If O'Leary wants to look at new proposals for managing the Oak Ridge facilities, she can announce that the Department of Energy will hold a contract competition. Forget the ``keen'' stuff.<P>

    However, that would breach protocol, since she hasn't yet received a recommendation from DOE's Oak Ridge office. And that's probably why aides scurried around after her comments to construct an explanatory statement that made it sound like the secretary was talking only in philosophical terms.<P>

    Whatever the case, a decision on the Oak Ridge contracts is due sometime in mid- to late-summer. Meanwhile, there's plenty of talk going around.<P>

    Here are some rumors, tidbits and observations:<P>

    <IMG SRC="/images/icons/blkbul.gif"> Perhaps the biggest fear among local power brokers is that federal programs in Oak Ridge will get slammed if DOE holds a contract auction. That process could take up to two years and, with a lame-duck contractor at the helm, who will look after Oak Ridge's interests when the downsizing orders come down?<P>

    <IMG SRC="/images/icons/blkbul.gif"> Will Lockheed Martin participate in a new competition?<P>

    Probably, even though a rebid would be viewed as an insult because the Oak Ridge contractor (since 1984) has done just about everything DOE has asked. In fact, I once used the term ``grovel'' to describe the relationship.<P>

    Lockheed Martin supposedly has been mulling a powerhouse partnership with Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC), Bechtel and possibly others, but that appears to be history. Besides, DOE hasn't looked favorably on contract teaming arrangements that scare off the competition.<P>

    <IMG SRC="/images/icons/blkbul.gif"> Could DOE opt to seek bids on only one of the two Oak Ridge contracts? Yes. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory contract, held by Lockheed Martin's newly formed Energy Research subsidiary, seems to be more secure than the Energy Systems contract for managing Y-12 and K-25. Some folks are concerned that DOE might even split the Y-12 and K-25 functions into two contracts, especially since the plan is to privatize the operations at K-25.<P>

    <IMG SRC="/images/icons/blkbul.gif"> The relationship between the two Lockheed Martin subsidiaries in Oak Ridge is still rocky, maybe worse, according to most reports, and that's not helping the corporation's cause with DOE.<P>

    <IMG SRC="/images/icons/blkbul.gif"> When the new Oak Ridge contracts are renegotiated, either with Lockheed Martin or some other entity, they probably won't be as lucrative or as powerful as those currently held. DOE's chief contractor in the future will be an integrator, doing much less by itself and acting more as a team leader coordinating the work of many.<P>

    <IMG SRC="/images/icons/blkbul.gif"> The East Tennessee Economic Council recently endorsed Lockheed Martin for a contract extension. That's not much of a surprise, except some folks didn't like the fact that the vote came at an ETEC board meeting with few in attendance. The East Tennessee Environmental Business Association (formerly the Oak Ridge Waste Management Association) plans to discuss a possible endorsement at its next board meeting.<P>

    <IMG SRC="/images/icons/blkbul.gif"> O'Leary's verbal pronouncement favoring a contract competition in Oak Ridge was not an official decision, but Lockheed Martin supporters flinched in a big way. Especially because of the timing. Some observers believe the comment, even if it was just a slip of the tongue, will make it difficult for her to support a contradictory position in a couple of months.<P>

<H2>FIRMS TO VIE FOR HUGE DOE WASTE PACT</H2>

Some of Oak Ridge National Laboratory's hottest nuclear wastes, including radioactive materials generated in the World War II Manhattan Project and stored in underground tanks, will be consolidated, processed and prepared for final disposal over the next decade.<P>

    The wastes are characterized as ``remote-handled transuranic wastes.''<P>

    Transuranic wastes include radioactive elements with an atomic weight greater than uranium, such as plutonium and curium. Remote-handled wastes are those too hot for workers to handle, requiring that work be done from a distance, with protective shielding or both.<P>

    Eventually, the Oak Ridge wastes are to be transported to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), a controversial disposal site under construction for more than a decade in New Mexico. The underground facility is not yet approved for operation.<P>

    Meanwhile, the Department of Energy has started the search for a company -- or team of companies -- to handle one of the biggest waste contracts ever offered at the Oak Ridge research facility.<P>

    Gary Riner, project manager for DOE's field office, said many of the interested companies are expected in town next week for an informal briefing on the project and discussion of contract guidelines. Those guidelines, as contained in DOE's draft invitation for bids, could be changed based on input from would-be contractors, Riner said.<P>

    ``We want to hear their concerns and where they think the vulnerabilities are,'' he said. ``We might revamp this thing.''<P>

    This is a big deal in the burgeoning U.S. industry that conducts environmental cleanup and waste management.<P>

    Riner said he has been fielding inquiries from companies for about a year. More than 60 already have expressed interest in the work.<P>

    DOE currently plans to issue a formal call for bids on Jan. 10, 1997, and then give companies about six months to prepare their proposals. Six months is an unusually long time for contract preparation, but this is a complex project.<P>

    Also, DOE is requiring fixed-price bids. That means companies must focus detailed attention on costs, not just the technical capabilities required for the job.<P>

    The federal agency likely will award the contract sometime in the fall of 1997.<P>

    Much of the radioactive wastes are contained in huge storage tanks in ORNL's Melton Valley area. The waste includes sludges and liquids.<P>

    Other wastes stored elsewhere at ORNL will be transported to Melton Valley and consolidated there before the processing work begins. Those wastes include sludges left in 50-year-old underground tanks near the Graphite Reactor and a storage tank at the old Hydrofracture Facility, which once was used to inject nuclear waste into deep-lying rock formations.<P>

    Lockheed Martin, the contractor that manages ORNL, will consolidate the wastes, and Riner said that work should be completed by 1999.<P>

    In the 1980s, DOE planned to build its own treatment facilities and use existing contractors to do the waste processing and packaging necessary for disposal at WIPP. However, because of constricting budgets, DOE no longer considers that a viable option.<P>

    DOE previously estimated it would cost about $350million to construct a new waste-handling plant at ORNL, and the total waste project was expected to run about $1.6billion.<P>

    However, Riner said federal officials believe they'll be able to cut the price tag by at least half with the new plan that relies on private contractors.<P>

    ``By far, this contract is in the taxpayers' and the government's interest,'' he said.<P>

    Riner said DOE intends to fence off the Melton Valley area and give the new contractor complete authority and responsibility for the waste project, although the federal department will retain ownership -- and ultimate liability -- for the radioactive wastes.<P>

    The Oak Ridge project, which does not include transportation to the New Mexico disposal site, is to be completed by the year 2006.<P>

<H2>IS DOE IN THE MARKET FOR A WHITE HAT?</H2>

There's some irony in the flap over the Department of Energy's plan to use private companies to process wastes currently stored at federal facilities in Oak Ridge.<P>

    DOE wants to send millions of pounds of so-called mixed wastes -- containing hazardous chemicals and radioactive elements -- to treatment sites in order to prepare the stuff for disposal. The agency says it can save a lot of money by contracting for the private services instead of building new treatment facilities at DOE plants.<P>

    The proposal has drawn strong opposition, particularly from concerned residents in Roane County.<P>

    Among their concerns is that DOE's wastes will end up at one of the existing treatment firms in Roane County. Scientific Ecology Group, the world's largest processor of low-level radioactive waste, and Diversified Scientific Services Inc., a subsidiary of industry leader Chemical Waste Management, both have Roane County operations.<P>

    Worse yet, from the protest point of view, is that prospects for a big DOE contract might lure another waste outfit to the area.<P>

    Suffice it to say, citizen activists -- led by the Roane County chapter of Save Our Cumberland Mountains -- don't have a lot of confidence in waste firms already in Roane County. They also don't have faith in the state's environmental regulators to keep things clean and safe.<P>

    In general, opponents of DOE's plan feel that waste operations in Roane County already pose a threat to public health and the environment, and they're afraid that more waste will make matters worse.<P>

    The message: Keep the wastes on DOE property and do the processing there, where the work force is highly trained and nobody cuts corners on safety to earn a profit.<P>

    The irony is that suddenly DOE is being painted as a conscientious caretaker.<P>

    That's news, of course. Throughout the 1980s, when Congress and everyone else started looking at the legacies of Cold War weapons production, DOE was used as an example of how not to treat the environment.<P>

    Time after time, the case was made that DOE had not followed standards routinely enforced on private industry. Critics charged that DOE used its national security missions as a shield to escape external regulation and to hide flagrant abuses.<P>

    Since the early 1980s, however, more than a billion dollars has been spent on environmental programs in Oak Ridge. There has been tremendous progress. For anyone familiar with the past operations -- even a decade ago -- the change is obvious and dramatic.<P>

    Still, it is odd hearing people argue that the best place for waste to be is in DOE's hands.<P>

*<P>
<B>
    CHATTANUKA:</B> When the economic and technological Summit convenes at Chattanooga next week, there will be a major Oak Ridge presence on hand.<P>

    I'm not just talking about the usual crew from the Department of Energy and its contractor chain gang. No, this goes beyond federal bureaucrats or heavyweight scientists and engineers. This is a true Oak Ridge icon: a nuclear weapon.<P>

    On display at the Chattanooga conference center will be an 8-inch AFAP (artillery fired atomic projectile), courtesy of the Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant.<P>

    Actually, a DOE spokesman said, this weapon isn't loaded with the nuclear goods. It's really just the casing of a W79, the weapon's stockpile designation.<P>

    ``There's nothing inside,'' spokesman Steve Wyatt said.<P>

    In fact, Wyatt confided, this model, although realistic, was never actually a weapon. It's just a mock-up, he said, noting that the AFAP model doesn't have the same exact specifications as the real thing.<P>

    ``There is nothing classified about this one,'' the DOE spokesman said. The model has been used for a display at the Oak Ridge weapons plant, and it is similar to one exhibited at the American Museum of Science & Energy.<P>

    The issue came up because of a rumor that Chattanooga folks were on the hot seat to provide more security for the bomb exhibit.<P>

    Wyatt confirmed that some security arrangements were being made, but he said it's no big deal. DOE and Lockheed Martin, which manages Y-12, just wanted to be sure that nobody walked off with the fake AFAP as a souvenir.<P>

    ``It would make a heckuva paperweight,'' Wyatt said.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>WILL LOCKHEED MARTIN STAY OR GO?</TITLE>

<H2>WILL LOCKHEED MARTIN STAY OR GO?</H2>

Rumors are surfacing again in regard to Lockheed Martin's future as the Department of Energy's chief contractor in Oak Ridge.<P>

    Perhaps the rumor resurgence should come as no surprise since so many companies -- contractors, subcontractors and a glut of would-bes and wannabes -- have an interest in DOE's decision-making.<P>

    Where there's interest, there's going to be talk.<P>

    For the record, DOE insists no decision has been made on whether to extend Lockheed Martin's contracts to manage the federal facilities, which include the Y-12 and K-25 plants as well as Oak Ridge National Laboratory.<P>

    However, DOE's Oak Ridge office recently submitted a strategic plan to agency headquarters in Washington, D.C. The long-range analysis was requested last year by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary.<P>

    When asked about a lingering rumor that DOE's Oak Ridge boss -- Jim Hall -- has recommended a new competition for the Oak Ridge contracts, an agency spokesman came back with this fact-free response:<P>

    ``We cannot discuss the Oak Ridge Operations plan other than to say it contains our overall vision and management objectives and how we expect to meet those objectives through a contract acquisition plan.... As far as the timing, we hope a decision will be made before the end of this fiscal year.''<P>

    Steven Wyatt, the DOE spokesman, added: ``The management plan contains our objectives on how we plan to manage the facilities in the future. What we're concentrating on now is the approach we want to take to implement those objectives.''<P>

    Whazzat?<P>

    When pressed about whether DOE's plan -- submitted May 1 -- contains a recommendation on the Lockheed Martin contract, Wyatt said it did not.<P>

    ``That will follow ... but it's expected before July 1.''<P>

    Carol Grametbauer, a spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin Energy Systems in Oak Ridge, which manages Y-12 and K-25, said the company hasn't heard anything new regarding its contract.<P>

    There was a lot of talk last year, of course, before DOE issued a two-year extension of the Lockheed Martin contract to allow more time for planning the management future in Oak Ridge.<P>

    Many people thought Lockheed Martin solidified its Oak Ridge presence when the corporation agreed to establish a separate subsidiary with a separate contract for management of ORNL. The national lab is now operated by Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corp., headed by ORNL Director Alvin Trivelpiece.<P>

    That move ostensibly satisfied DOE's concern that ORNL wasn't getting sufficient management attention (largely because it was part of Energy Systems and coexisted contractually with all or parts of four production facilities). Now ORNL has equal status to other national labs -- Sandia National Laboratories and Idaho National Engineering Lab -- managed by different companies within Lockheed Martin.<P>

    The rumor mill, however, is far from quiet.<P>

    There are plenty of parties interested in managing one or more of DOE's Oak Ridge installations, and periodically there are reports circulated that DOE is upset with Lockheed Martin and poised to make a change. There is one line of thought that DOE actually initiates these rumors in order to increase its leverage with Lockheed Martin, although that may be assuming a level of cleverness that simply doesn't exist.<P>

    If DOE should opt to put the Oak Ridge contracts on the auction block, it would be an entertaining process for observers.<P>

    But it also would be an extremely expensive process, both from the government perspective and that of potential bidders. Millions of dollars would be spent preparing proposals from corporations (or universities?), and millions of taxpayer dollars would be needed to run the competition and evaluate the bids.<P>

    The cost of a contract transition is more difficult to gauge.<P>

    It is possible, one supposes, that DOE could put only one of the Oak Ridge contracts up for competition, but that seems unlikely.<P>

    Perhaps a bigger question is whether Lockheed Martin will offer a proposal if DOE puts the Oak Ridge contracts up for bids.<P>

    A couple of years ago (pre-merger, when Martin Marietta was still the contractor), such a move by DOE undoubtedly would have been viewed as a snub and interpreted as a clear sign that the government wanted new blood.<P>

    Now, however, is a different time with different expectations, and contract competitions are more the rule than the exception. It's not so obvious that Lockheed Martin would bow out quietly.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>DOLLARS MAY NOT OVERCOME DOUBTS ON ISV</TITLE>

<BR CLEAR=ALL><HR NOSPACE Size=1><H2>DOLLARS MAY NOT OVERCOME DOUBTS ON ISV</H2>

Aburp during last month's waste-melting operation at Oak Ridge National Laboratory was a setback to a controversial technology known as in situ vitrification, but it may not have been the death blow -- as critics clearly hoped.<P>

    The project manager was upbeat this week about preliminary findings and the chances of restarting the Oak Ridge project.<P>

    Plenty of questions remain, however.<P>

    The U.S. Department of Energy has spent millions of dollars trying to develop and demonstrate in situ vitrification (ISV) as a method of stabilizing leaky nuclear waste sites around the country. Oak Ridge has been the host location for several of those tests.<P>

    In situ vitrification uses high-powered graphite electrodes to melt the ground at temperatures approaching 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. After the molten mass cools, it is supposed to form a monolith of volcanic glass that traps the radioactivity inside for millions of years. The idea is to prevent hazardous constituents from moving elsewhere via the groundwater.<P>

    After the April 21 incident, during which the ORNL test pit unexpectedly belched and released thin shards of radioactive glass, project officials were dejected. The mishap was particularly troubling because it matched the profile of previous problems, which project organizers thought they'd resolved.<P>

    No one was speaking persuasively about the restart of the Oak Ridge project or the future of the ISV technology.<P>

    A few days later, however, project manager Chris Taylor seemed encouraged by internal discussions and some of the data collected. At that point, he speculated there was slightly better than a 50-50 chance of restarting the Oak Ridge ISV demonstration.<P>

    Taylor this week was even more enthusiastic. He said DOE was supportive following the ISV burp, and he noted that a hypothesis had emerged regarding what happened three weeks into the meltdown.<P>

    The investigation of the incident is to be completed by June 5.<P>

    A preliminary assessment of filters found very little radioactivity was released from the nuclear waste pit into the off-gas collection system, Taylor said. Nearly all of the radioactivity was contained within the molten mass, he said.<P>

    According to the project manager, that means that the melting operation was actually proceeding as planned -- until the burp, of course.<P>

    So, what caused the burp?<P>

    Project officials apparently believe steam buildup underneath the molten mass caused the expulsion of gas that lifted the gas-collection hood and stunned the project participants on hand at the time.<P>

    Taylor said Geosafe -- a private company that is developing the ISV technology for commercial purposes -- shared information from past experiences that identified similar problems caused by melting too rapidly at pit's bottom. The problem reportedly can be overcome by slowing the melt process at the critical point when pockets of groundwater are reached.<P>

    If that's true and can be proved, fine. But it's interesting to note that Geosafe was one of the partners involved in the Oak Ridge demo project and had people on site for the meltdown (and for many months beforehand).<P>

    Why wasn't this potentially valuable information available on the front end to avoid the big burp on April 21?<P>

    Next question.<P>

    Assuming that project officers -- and the funding sponsors at DOE -- can reach a consensus on the burping problem, what caused it and how to avoid such issues in the future, what will it take to restart the Oak Ridge melt?<P>

    Ralph Hutchison, a spokesman for the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance, said the ``explosion'' at ORNL should come as no surprise given the past problems with in situ vitrification. He said DOE and its contractors should be required to conduct a full-blown environmental impact statement -- with public hearings -- before even considering a new meltdown at the nuclear burial grounds.<P>

    Taylor said an environmental impact study is unnecessary and would be a waste of taxpayer money. He emphasized that the recent problem, while unexpected and unwanted, did not harm workers, area residents or the environment.<P>

    Nonetheless, some skeptics don't want to see a restart under any conditions. One Oak Ridge woman earlier said she was so frightened by the technology that she planned to take her family out of town during the melting process.<P>

    It's going to take more than facts and figures to sell ISV. It's going to take more than the government's bankroll.<P>

    Somebody needs to do a better job of explaining what ISV is all about, why it's really needed and whether it's worth the risks.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>SEG CHIEF TALKS ABOUT NUKE FIRM'S PLANS</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF>

<HR>

<BR CLEAR=ALL><HR NOSPACE Size=1><H2>SEG CHIEF TALKS ABOUT NUKE FIRM'S PLANS</H2>

Scientific Ecology Group, the nation's largest processor of nuclear waste, has been in the news a lot during the past week.<P>

    First, there were reports about a screwed-up waste shipment that came from the Department of Energy's Savannah River site in South Carolina. What was supposed to be a routine shipment of low-level nuclear trash became a high-profile problem because of the unadvertised presence of tritium at high levels.<P>

    Mike Mobley, the state's nuclear chief, was not amused by the mistake, and he blocked -- at least temporarily -- additional waste shipments from Savannah River to SEG.<P>

    Next came news that SEG is up for sale as part of Westinghouse's planned exit from the environmental services business. Westinghouse is weighing interest from ``several strategic and financial buyers.'' The impact on the company's Oak Ridge complex is open to speculation at this point.<P>

    Both stories prompted renewed questions from SEG watchers in general, SEG critics in particular.<P>

    Bud Arrowsmith, who founded SEG a decade ago and remains its president, addressed several points in a couple of brief interviews.<P>

    Now that SEG is on the market, will Arrowsmith and a team of investors attempt to buy back the company he once sold to Westinghouse?<P>

    No. Arrowsmith said he had no interest in purchasing the company, but he does hope to have a strong say-so in its future, no matter who purchases SEG.<P>

    ``I'm the president.... That's all I can say. I certainly will interface with the prospective purchasers,'' he said, emphasizing that Westinghouse's corporate hierarchy will handle the sale.<P>

    As for the tritium problem, which became public more than a month after the incident set off alarms at SEG's processing facilities in Oak Ridge, Arrowsmith rushed to defend DOE.<P>

    He said DOE is not a sloppy manager of nuclear waste, as some -- including Mobley, Tennessee's top regulator -- have portrayed the federal agency. He reiterated that SEG has received more than 20,000 containers of waste from DOE without ever having a problem like the load from Savannah River, which had thousands of times more radioactivity than reported.<P>

    SEG issued a press release calling DOE ``a careful, concerned waste manager.'' It appeared Arrowsmith was taking direct aim at Mobley's published comments in which the state official cited DOE's past woes and added, ``They'll send you anything they've got. Sometimes they don't even know what they've got.''<P>

    Arrowsmith said he wasn't surprised by Mobley's sharp words. He indicated he'd heard it all before. While he obviously doesn't share Mobley's opinion of DOE, Arrowsmith said he holds the state official in high esteem.<P>

    ``Mike Mobley and I have a very good relationship. He's the best regulator in the country,'' Arrowsmith said.<P>

    The SEG chief said he plans to go to Russia in mid-May to meet with a high-ranking government official about developing a long-term waste strategy, which might include a processing facility near Chernobyl that's similar to SEG's complex in Oak Ridge.<P>

    Arrowsmith said he would have to come up with the financing from Western sources. Why would anyone want to invest in a waste complex in Russia? ``World safety,'' he said. ``That has to be the driving force.''<P>

    He nixed any notion that Russian waste might be coming to Oak Ridge.<P>

    Back at home, a number of Roane County residents -- especially members of Save Our Cumberland Mountains -- have voiced displeasure about the growth of the SEG waste facilities and possible environmental effects.<P>

    Arrowsmith said SEG has growth plans, but not for the Oak Ridge complex, which he said has reached its optimum size and will be used as a test bed for new technologies on a small scale.<P>

    Future growth likely will take place elsewhere, such as individualized units set up to process waste at generating facilities or storage sites, such as one in the planning stages at DOE's Savannah River plant.<P>

    Environmental activists have questioned SEG plans for a barge terminal the company will lease at DOE's K-25 site in Oak Ridge.<P>

    Arrowsmith said there is no current plan to use the Clinch River site to chop up radioactive materials or do preliminary processing of contaminated equipment. However, he refused to rule out using it as a staging ground.<P>

    SEG officials have said they will use the barge facility to receive large pieces of equipment too cumbersome to transport on highways. Arrowsmith said the first use actually will be shipment of a recycled metal products from SEG to a Canadian firm.

<H2>TAXPAYERS TO PAY FOR REPAIRS AT K-25</H2>

The Department of Energy apparently won't make Lockheed Martin -- DOE's Oak Ridge contractor -- pay for the $690,000 in damages done to the toxic-waste incinerator at the K-25 plant earlier this year.<P>

    An investigation determined that human error was a primary cause of the Feb. 20 incident that scorched the incinerator's emission-control system. A decision was made to go ahead with an incinerator test even though the quench system, which cools down the components with water, was out of operation.<P>

    While DOE is footing the cost for repairs, Lockheed Martin still will be penalized for problems at the incinerator, according to agency spokesman Frank Juan.<P>

    Juan said the incident will have a ``negative impact'' on the award fee Lockheed Martin receives for its management performance at K-25.<P>

    The incinerator, which burns hazardous and radioactive waste, returned to operation April 3.<P>

  <B>  JOB SHOP:</B> Dr. Everet Beckner, as I've recounted in recent weeks, is among those government officials to take advantage of revolving-door job opportunities.<P>

    On Friday, Feb. 2, he left his powerful job at the Department of Energy. On Monday, Feb. 5, he assumed an executive position with Lockheed Martin, DOE's largest contractor.<P>

    In Beckner's case, he had walked through that door before. He held a number of top positions at Sandia National Laboratories in the 1980s before going to DOE headquarters in Washington -- where he was involved in decision-making that affected his previous employer.<P>

    Beckner now is vice president for technical operations in Lockheed Martin's Energy & Environment Sector. The sector is responsible for the company's DOE contracts, which includes management of Sandia.<P>

    As noted earlier, Beckner signed a form recusing himself from activities pertaining to Lockheed Martin on Oct. 25, 1995. He said that coincided with his decision to pursue employment at Lockheed Martin, and he accepted a job offer at the company in December.<P>

    That wasn't his only job-shopping venture among DOE contractors.<P>

    Beckner, who was DOE's principal deputy assistant secretary for defense programs, said he preferred not to discuss firms that he might have talked to and didn't accept employment from. However, DOE provided copies of forms that showed he twice recused himself from agency activities associated with Bechtel.<P>

    On Aug. 1, 1995, he recused himself from Bechtel issues but subsequently withdrew that recusal on Aug. 22. He recused himself from Bechtel work again on Oct. 25 -- the same date he recused himself from Lockheed Martin activities.<P>

    Bechtel was awarded a contract last year to manage DOE's Nevada test site. Actually, the contract went to Bechtel Nevada, which is a consortium of Bechtel, Lockheed Martin and Johnson Controls.<P>

    Bechtel Nevada received the contract Oct. 27.<P>

    According to Beckner's last financial disclosure report, which was filed after he left the Department of Energy, he interviewed with Bechtel on Aug. 5. The report showed he received an airline ticket from Bechtel and other expenses valued at $650.<P>

    In an earlier interview, Beckner indicated his job hunt began last fall. When asked about that Aug. 5 interview with Bechtel, Beckner said that date didn't sound right. He later, however, confirmed it was correct.<P>

    ``What I have clearest in my mind is my negotiations with Lockheed Martin,'' he said.<P>

   <B> MELTDOWN:</B> Although the in situ vitrification (ISV) project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory began April 3, the melting operation has not yet reached the underground deposit of nuclear waste.<P>

    The controversial technology uses massive amounts of electricity -- about  1 1/2 megawatts -- to melt the ground and convert it into volcanic glass. Once the molten mass cools, it is supposed to seal the radioactive constituents inside for millions of years.<P>

    Chris Taylor, the ORNL project manager, said the electrodes so far have melted about 12 feet of soil -- still about two feet short of the buried wastes. He said things are going well so far, although there have been a few technical glitches -- including a loss of power for a while Easter Sunday.<P>

    The project currently is in a holding pattern while officials assess the entire operation before proceeding to a critical stage.<P>

    Taylor said project officials plan to return the electrodes to full power today and continue the melt down to the waste pit's zone of contamination. The radioactive waste should be reached sometime between Friday and Sunday, he said.<P>

<H2>WAMP'S TOUGH TALK POPULAR IN OAK RIDGE</H2>


The Department of Energy's 1996 road show stopped in Oak Ridge last week, and DOE officials insist they've finally got a realistic blueprint for the nuclear weapons complex as we head toward the 21st century.<P>

    ``This is it,'' Earl Whiteman, DOE's frontman for the stockpile stewardship effort, said with confidence.<P>

    The revised study by the Clinton administration DOE outlines the nation's scaled-down needs in the post-Cold War era and assigns various roles to the weapons facilities -- including warhead production and uranium storage at the Y-12 Plant in Oak Ridge.<P>

    The cocky Whiteman is not particularly popular with some factions in Oak Ridge, although he claims to have many friends in the atomic city.<P>

    Last year, during another round of hearings on a draft of the same study, Whiteman took the brunt of abuse from Oak Ridgers unhappy with the Y-12 Plant's uncertain status. At times, it got rather personal. This year's event was more civilized and matter of fact.<P>

    Whiteman is a member of DOE's defense establishment at the Albuquerque (N.M.) Operations Office, and Y-12 supporters remain convinced that Whiteman is part of a conspiracy to relocate the Oak Ridge plant's work to Los Alamos National Laboratory.<P>

    Even though the latest planning documents list Y-12 as a preferred site for production of warhead secondaries and case manufacturing, skeptics believe it is DOE's intent to eventually consolidate work at the weapons labs -- such as Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore in California.<P>

    The Oak Ridge disbelievers point to other documents that recommend giving the labs responsibility for process development and weapon surveillance, activities once cloistered at Y-12.<P>

    With responsibility goes control of the purse strings, and critics say that if the dollars flow through Los Alamos, they won't flow very far afterwards.<P>

    Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., was one of the winners at last week's meetings, solidifying his position as a defender of Y-12 and DOE's other holdings in Oak Ridge.<P>

    Wamp got kudos for his tough talk. He challenged DOE to do the right thing, absent politics and parochialism, and he basically warned agency officials to keep their hands off Y-12.<P>

    Interestingly, Wamp was effective because he was forced to be tougher than he wanted to be.<P>

    In late February, Wamp's office issued a gushy little press release under the headline, ``Wamp says PEIS report great for Y-12.'' (PEIS stands for programmatic environmental impact statement, which was the report assessing various alternatives for the weapons work.)<P>

    Wamp's press statement called DOE's report ``a major break for Oak Ridge because it confirms that the core competencies of Oak Ridge's Y-12 Plant will continue to be performed there.''<P>

    The congressman was later quoted as saying, ``When I took office, the future of Y-12 looked bleak. I am delighted that Wednesday's report confirms that Y-12's basic missions will not go elsewhere. This successful effort to keep the core functions of the Y- 12 Plant is the direct result of teamwork between my office and members of the local community, including Citizens for National Security (CNS).''<P>

    Wamp was ready to claim victory. Congressmen, of course, like to claim victories. It's one of the things they do best.<P>

    In Oak Ridge, however, some folks saw Wamp's declarations as premature and perhaps even a bit foolish.<P>

    CNS, an Oak Ridge-based group of Y-12 devotees that includes a number of weapons experts, did not believe the DOE report painted such a rosy picture. In fact, Dr. William Bibb, a retired DOE defense officer and leader of CNS, suggested that the report was error-filled and should be scrapped in its entirety.<P>

    In a press briefing before last week's meetings, Bibb was asked about Wamp's statements. Bibb politely suggested that the congressman may not have reviewed all of the documents, some of which showed Y-12 surrendering key responsibilities.<P>

    There also were concerns expressed privately in Oak Ridge that Wamp might have gotten hoodwinked or snookered when he visited Los Alamos on a fact-finding mission earlier this year. There are unconfirmed reports that Wamp was prepared to announce a new era of cooperation between Oak Ridge and Los Alamos until he was talked out of it.<P>

    Whatever the case, by the time of last week's public meetings, Wamp had shed his celebration outfit and donned his battle gear once again.<P>

    It appeared to be a shrewd fashion statement.

<HEAD><TITLE>DOE HAMMERS HOME REINDUSTRIALIZATION</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF>

<IMG SRC="/images/mungersm.gif" ALT="" BORDER=1 HSPACE=5 ALIGN=left><B>FRANK MUNGER</B><BR>

<H2>DOE HAMMERS HOME REINDUSTRIALIZATION</H2>

The big new word in Oak Ridge these days is reindustrialization. You can hardly step foot on federal property without hearing somebody use that term.<P>

    It means different things to different people, but the U.S. Department of Energy sees it as an opportunity to turn a lot of would-be negatives into a feel-good festival.<P>

    DOE is faced with the enormous task of cleaning up the Oak Ridge site, which formerly housed a uranium-enrichment operation and other World War II-era nuclear facilities no longer needed for their original purposes.<P>

    If, however, the Department of Energy can generate enough interest among private companies, the government's burden could be reduced exponentially.<P>

    Exchanging cleanup services for some of the wealth ensconced in the K-25 mess -- such as tons of nickel and other recyclable metals -- is one possibility. Another option is convincing companies to make a home in the surplus facilities, which could reduce or even eliminate the need for some decontamination and decommissioning activities.<P>

    Beyond that, the effort gives DOE a chance to satisfy local communities in the post-Cold War period. The federal agency is committed to help with economic development to offset the impact of defense downsizing.<P>

    And the conversion of K-25 from a drain on taxpayers to a high-value industrial park would be the kind of success story DOE desperately needs -- locally and, even more so, in Washington.<P>

    DOE has said it would like to walk away from K-25 in about 15 years. Thus, the project is sometimes called Vision 2010.<P>

    Just how important is this to DOE? Well, pretty darn important.<P>

    The project was discussed at a staff meeting last week of Lockheed Martin managers at the K-25 site. A subsequent memo described that contractor discussion:<P>

    ``The message being sent from DOE to K-25 is that the success of this site after this fiscal year depends on how we create an economy aside from DOE funding. Reindustrialization is top priority -- above TSCA Incinerator, waste management and all other activities. K-25 will be commercialized or the gates will be padlocked.''<P>

    That almost sounds like a threat, doesn't it?<P>

 <B>   VROOM:</B> Gosh knows they have a difficult time with their vehicles at DOE's K-25 site.<P>

    It's a big place, covering hundreds of acres, and big places inevitably have big problems.<P>

    One day an employee backs his car into a parking space instead of using the appropriate front-first method. Oooh. The next day a worker leaves a car running while getting out to move a barrier. Aaah.<P>

    It seems like there's always a major controversy at the federal plant.<P>

    Well, I got a tip the other day that an employee got a speeding ticket March 6 for whizzing past the K-25 cafeteria going 16 miles an hour in a 15 mph zone. Naturally, I investigated.<P>

    Mark Musolf, the plant's spokesman, said there was no such crime on the logs. Of the 13 speeding citations issued at K-25 on that date, the closest thing to that report was an employee ticketed for going 19 mph near the cafeteria, he said.<P>

    Musolf emphasized that speeding had been a persistent problem near the plant's cafeteria.<P>

    One question: Are people hurrying to get there or get away from there?<P>

  <B>  COST CONTROL: </B>While we're talking about K-25 issues, it appears that folks there are trying awfully hard to help the taxpayers get their money's worth out of a new $1.2 million change-house built last year.<P>

    The facility has been trouble from the get-go. There were problems with the heating and air-conditioning, not to mention a lack of hot water that added shivers to the showers.<P>

    ``It just hasn't functioned the way it was supposed to,'' a plant spokesman confirmed.<P>

    The good news is that the bad work at K-25 is still under warranty, and vendors are being held accountable for repairs.<P>

   <B> CHEMICAL CONCERNS:</B> A group of K-25 workers concerned about cyanide exposures at the facility have asked for a broader investigation to include other chemicals.<P>

    Workers reportedly want the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to do a complete examination of potential health issues at the Department of Energy plant.<P>

    Meanwhile, since the K-25 workers complained of health effects associated with cyanide levels in blood and urine samples, some employees at DOE's Y-12 Plant several miles away have raised similar issues.

<HEAD><TITLE>WILL BECKNER'S HIRING HURT LOCKHEED MARTIN?</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF>

<IMG SRC="/images/mungersm.gif" ALT="" BORDER=1 HSPACE=5 ALIGN=left><B>FRANK MUNGER</B><BR>

<br>
<I>March 27, 1996</I>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><HR NOSPACE Size=1><H2>WILL BECKNER'S HIRING HURT LOCKHEED MARTIN?</H2>

I've received dozens of responses to recent columns critical of Dr. Everet Beckner, the high-ranking official at the U.S. Department of Energy who left his government job for an executive position at Lockheed Martin, DOE's largest contractor.<P>

    One of those responses stands out. It came from a Lockheed Martin employee in Oak Ridge.<P>

    ``Your article about the Beckner shenanigans was right on! . . . Of course, you know that we will all have to endure another round of ethics training as a result of your story.''<P>

    The last sentence, while light-hearted, conveyed a serious message.<P>

    Ever since Martin Marietta succeeded Union Carbide as DOE's chief contractor in 1984, I've heard regularly from Oak Ridge employees who believe the corporation sets a double standard for ethical behavior.<P>

    While preaching ethics to the masses, management at Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) has engaged in questionable practices that brought unwanted attention and an unwelcome image to the whole company.<P>

    In the past decade or so, whenever the Pentagon slapped the company's wrist for not following rules or when someone else in Washington pointed out an inappropriate act, an order would come down to Oak Ridge from Bethesda, Md., to shape up. That might prompt a new pamphlet on ethics, creation of a new ethics office, a series of meetings or, as the Lockheed Martin employee bemoaned, ``another round of ethics training.''<P>

    This, of course, brewed resentment.<P>

    Oak Ridge workers asked: ``Why are those folks always pointing the finger at us? We ain't misbehavin'. It's them.''<P>

    Is it any surprise that Lockheed Martin's September 1995 Ethics Survey found that employees didn't trust the company to uphold ethical standards? About a third of the Oak Ridge workers surveyed said they'd witnessed conduct that either violated the law or the company's ethics guidelines.<P>

    In the current edition of Energy Systems News, Gordon Fee, president of the Oak Ridge-based subsidiary, said he agreed with a statement made by Lockheed Martin Chairman Norm Augustine: ``When it comes to ethics, anything short of perfection is failure.''<P>

    Fee added: ``We must work to fix our real or perceived deficiencies.''<P>

    What kind of example do you think it sets when Lockheed Martin's newly established Energy and Environment Sector -- which oversees the company's Oak Ridge management work for DOE -- hires Beckner to be vice president for technical operations?<P>

    Do Lockheed Martin's employees think it is appropriate for a DOE official to jump ship and go to work for a DOE contractor he solicited? The overwhelming feedback I've received from Oak Ridge workers is negative toward such moves, even if the hiring actually were to help the company get more work from the government.<P>

    It's not a given, of course, that Beckner's hiring will help Lockheed Martin's relationship with the U.S. Department of Energy. Some believe it could actually reduce the company's chances of landing new contracts or retaining old ones.<P>

    Lockheed Martin is awaiting word on whether DOE will extend its two Oak Ridge contracts: one for management of Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the other for operation of the Y-12 and K-25 sites, plus environmental work at two uranium facilities in Kentucky and Ohio.<P>

    Lockheed Martin also is a partner in a major contract proposal to manage cleanup activities at DOE's Hanford nuclear operations in Washington state.<P>

    One long-time Washington observer of DOE said he was stunned by Lockheed Martin's hiring of Beckner. ``That could kill them before every SEB (Source Evaluation Board) in the country,'' he said.<P>

    Source Evaluation Boards are federal teams established to review proposals and make recommendations on contract awards. In recent years, as more and more contract awards have been protested by losing bidders, the evaluation boards have become more and more sensitive to issues with a possible bearing on the process -- even those far outside the actual proposals.<P>

    There are concerns about anything that suggests influence or favoritism.<P>

    Would the Beckner issue make a board skittish about giving more work to Lockheed Martin -- already DOE's biggest contractor -- for fear of being accused of favoritism?<P>

    More on this issue later.<P>

<H1>WHEN DOE OFFICIAL COMES KNOCKING . . .</H1>

Last week, I wrote about Dr. Everet Beckner, a high-ranking official at the Department of Energy who left his post Feb. 2 and -- three days later -- joined the payroll at Lockheed Martin, DOE's largest contractor.<P>

    Beckner, who was DOE's principal deputy assistant secretary for defense programs, said he never misused his influence as a federal officer. He justified his actions in the context of earning a living.<P>

    He said he either had to make a move to find new employment or plan on staying at the federal agency for another two years. He said he would have felt obligated to stay at DOE and help with the transition of administrations. He apparently doesn't think President Clinton and Hazel O'Leary will be back for another term in Washington.<P>

    Indeed, Beckner indicated time was of the essence.<P>

    ``You may not believe this,'' he said in a telephone interview, ``but I'm not a young man.''<P>

    The physicist is 61 years old.<P>

    Beckner, the No. 2 defense officer at DOE, said he recused himself from activities pertaining to Lockheed Martin -- and some other companies, too -- when he decided last fall to go job shopping while still employed at agency headquarters in Washington.<P>

    He said he contacted Lockheed Martin about a possible job and, in December, accepted a position as vice president for technical operations in the Energy and Environment Sector, which oversees the company's DOE contracts.<P>

    Apparently there is nothing illegal about Beckner's maneuver. To date there is no evidence that he violated any federal rules by pursuing employment at a government contractor.<P>

    As I said last week, however, I believe it is wrong. Actually, I said it stinks, and I still believe that, as do many others based on the feedback I've received.<P>

    I think the general public expects more of our government officials.<P>

    Such acts suggest sleaze, even if none's there. Jumping from federal service to contractor service immediately raises questions about what's been going on behind the scenes. What sorts of relationships existed that smoothed the way for such an opportunity?<P>

    Beckner, of course, is not the only federal official to make himself available to a contractor -- not by a long stretch.<P>

    That doesn't make it right.<P>

    Nor is the label of inappropriateness applied solely to high-ranking DOE officials who leave the agency for contractor havens.<P>

    I would expect people to raise similar questions if I suddenly left my job at The News-Sentinel and joined the information spinners at DOE or one of its contractors. Astute readers would rightly wonder what facilitated that kind of job mobility.<P>

    There is more at stake, however, in Dr. Beckner's situation. Despite his assurance that he's never misused his influence, it seems impossible that his influence wouldn't be a factor in a job application at Lockheed Martin. Let's consider a few particulars.<P>

    For the past couple of years, Lockheed Martin's (and before the merger, Martin Marietta's) contract status in Oak Ridge has been up in the air.<P>

    As DOE pondered whether to renew the company's contract -- or contracts -- to operate the agency's Oak Ridge facilities, it was an open secret that the defense programs unit at DOE headquarters opposed the contract extension and wanted to seek new competition.<P>

    Later, apparently as a compromise among the agency's top brass, DOE extended the Oak Ridge contract for a couple of years while a longer-term strategy was formulated. That process is still active.<P>

    Beckner likes to emphasize that he was simply the No. 2 guy in defense programs, reporting to Assistant Secretary Victor Reis, but it's important not to understate his power in that position.<P>

    Therefore, think about the scenario as Beckner shopped for a job last year. If he lands a good position, he leaves. If not, he sticks around for a couple of years.<P>

    How do DOE contractors react when he shows up at the corporate doorstep and asks for career help? Do they spurn his services and then worry about whether he'll hold it against them later? Or do they welcome him on board and worry about whether the quick turnaround will damage their image?<P>

    More on this situation later.

<H1>FED FINDS A FRIEND AT LOCKHEED MARTIN</H1>

     Dr. Everet H. Beckner was a honcho in the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons program.<P>
    As principal deputy assistant secretary for defense programs, Beckner had broad oversight responsibility for work at the weapons laboratories and production facilities -- such as the Y-12 warhead plant in Oak Ridge. He held DOE's No. 2 defense position for about five years.<P>
    On Friday, Feb. 2, Beckner left his powerful job at DOE.<P>
    On Monday, Feb. 5, Beckner began his new job at Lockheed Martin -- the Department of Energy's largest contractor.<P>
    The situation stinks.<P>
    It may be legal. It may be allowed under federal regulations. But, all the same, it stinks.<P>
    That's my opinion. Beckner, naturally, doesn't agree.<P>
    The 61-year-old physicist doesn't think he acted unethically or inappropriately. Beckner said he understands how some people could question the move on the surface, but he said he resents anyone drawing negative conclusions after they've studied the facts.<P>
    Beckner said he endured the same kind of criticism years ago. That was when he assumed a DOE role in Washington where his day-to-day decision-making had a significant impact on his former employer -- Sandia National Laboratories.<P>
    Well, I'm sure Beckner resents me because I believe his movement into and out of the government illustrates the arrogance of individuals who have been running the weapons program for years.<P>
    In his new job, Beckner is vice president for technical operations at Lockheed Martin's Energy & Environment Sector Ä the newly established sector with principal responsibility for the corporation's far-flung DOE contracts.<P>
    Lockheed Martin, of course, now manages Sandia, as well as the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory and DOE's Oak Ridge installations -- including Y-12, the K-25 site and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.<P>
    DOE has not yet released all the paperwork associated with Beckner's departure. Susan Beard, the deputy assistant general counsel for standards of conduct, outlined three major restrictions Beckner would face after leaving the agency.<P>
    Two of the restrictions involve representing another entity in communications with the federal government, especially as relates to certain work associated with his previous employment. One of those restrictions is a lifetime ban. The other has a two- year limit.<P>
    The third restriction is specific to DOE. For one year after leaving DOE, Beckner is not allowed to communicate back to the department on behalf of anybody for anything -- except for social purposes. This is the so-called ``no-contact rule.''<P>
    Guess what, folks?<P>
    Beckner has applied for a waiver on all three restrictions.<P>
    Beckner, however, said he has no intention of becoming a company salesman making the rounds at DOE. He said the waivers, if approved, would be tailored to his job description at Lockheed Martin and simply allow the limited kind of access needed to do his job -- helping the contractors and the DOE.<P>
    He said he took the Lockheed Martin job mostly because it would be behind the scenes, working to improve operations at sites -- such as Y-12 -- and not involve a lot of interfacing with DOE. He said he took this job because he thought it, in particular, would avoid these kinds of critical questions.<P>
    For the life of me, I couldn't understand his reasoning on that last statement. How you can go from a top job at DOE to a job -- presumably a lucrative one -- at the agency's largest contractor and not expect criticism is at odds with reality. <P>
    The decision on whether to grant those waivers will be made by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary in consultation with the director of the Office of Government Ethics, Beard said.<P>
    Meanwhile, Beckner said he accepted the job with Lockheed Martin on Dec. 23, 1995.<P>
    As of Oct. 25, in a letter to Assistant Secretary Victor Reis, Beckner recused himself from activities related to Lockheed Martin. As part of his job-hunting strategy, he also recused himself at the time from DOE discussions involving other companies -- although he declined to name those companies.<P>
    Beckner said he approached Lockheed Martin about a job, not the reverse.<P>
    He insists that if people ``bother to check the story,'' they will see that he's never misused his influence.<P>
    More on this situation later.

<TITLE>OAK RIDGE FACED EARLY WASTE CHALLENGE</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">

<IMG SRC="/images/mungersm.gif" ALT="" BORDER=1 HSPACE=5 ALIGN=left><B>FRANK MUNGER</B><BR>
E-mail:  <A HREF="mailto:73302.1254@compuserve.com">73302.1254@compuserve.com</A><br>
<I>March 6, 1996</I>

<H1>OAK RIDGE FACED EARLY WASTE CHALLENGE</H1>

A few months ago, I wrote about Oak Ridge National Laboratory geologist Stephen Stow and his defense of World War II-era environmental practices at the laboratory known then as Clinton Laboratories.<P>

    The ORNL scientist's 100-page report has now been published. It's titled, ``Attitudes and Practices Regarding Disposal of Liquid Nuclear Waste at Clinton Laboratories in the Very Early Years: A Historical Analysis.''<P>

    Stow's research showed that nuclear pioneers at Oak Ridge were actually quite concerned about potential hazards of liquid radioactive wastes generated during those early operations and took great pains to deal with them safely. This counters a common perception that wastes were simply dumped in the woods or otherwise disposed of untidily with little forethought.<P>

    While environmental practices were not in any way comparable to current-day standards, Stow maintains that the level of care was quite extraordinary given the state of knowledge available at that time.<P>

    In other words, it could have been a lot worse. He addresses that point in this excerpt:<P>

   ``In evaluating the actions from 50 years ago, one must do so in light of what was known at the time and in the relationship to what the practices of the time were. It is in this perspective, perhaps, that the greatest admiration is deserved.<P>

    ``Although probably not fully recognized at the time, the waste materials generated at the Clinton Laboratories can be said to have represented the greatest disposal challenges within the entire Manhattan Project.<P>

    ``True, much greater amounts were generated at Hanford (in Washington state), but the toxic mixture of fission products, uranium, plutonium, transplutonium elements, nitrate and hazardous metals in a mobile liquid form at a location with rainfall and surface water used for drinking -- coupled with nearby population centers -- certainly elevated the risk at Clinton Laboratories.''<P>


    <B>NOT NORMAL:</B> Lateral moves are not so unusual these days in the corporate world, where the effects of downsizing have made the frequent shifting of personnel a necessity.<P>

    It's no longer demeaning to accept a new assignment that doesn't qualify as a promotion. Presumably, the same holds true in a federal bureaucracy. However, it is unusual to see top executives swap jobs. That's happening at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge Operations.<P>

    Oak Ridge boss Jim Hall wants to flip-flop the roles of two of his key managers.<P>

    Bob Dempsey currently is the assistant manager for environmental management, and Rod Nelson is the assistant manager for defense programs. Under the proposed plan, which has been tentatively OK'd at DOE headquarters, the two men would trade offices.<P>

    In a Feb. 26 staff memo, Hall said the move would accomplish ``several objectives.'' Here's the explanation:<P>

    ``Bob's prior experience with the Defense Department should be an asset in dealing with DOE program sponsors while his environmental management background will help in preparing for the `reduced footprint' at Y-12.<P>

    ``Rod's project management background, combined with his experience in the safety and health and program management areas, will be valuable to the environmental restoration and waste management programs as we continue to address streamlining, downsizing and process improvement initiatives.''<P>

    If all of that is true, why now? One suspects there's more here than is being said.<P>

   <B> BAMA, BAMA:</B> Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, DOE's contractor at K-25, has hired an expert team from the University of Alabama to review the company's handling of the cyanide situation at K-25.<P>

    As previously reported, more than 20 employees at the Oak Ridge plant believe their health has been affected by cyanide exposures at K-25 -- although a source of the toxic substance has not been documented.<P>

    The Alabama group recently spent several days at K-25, met with concerned employees and took a look at the sampling program at the federal facility. A Lockheed Martin spokesman said this work would not interfere with a similar review by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which was invited to Oak Ridge by K-25 workers.

<TITLE>TOM GRUMBLY REVISITS WARM AND FUZZY</TITLE>

E-mail:  <A HREF="mailto:73302.1254@compuserve.com">73302.1254@compuserve.com</A><br>
<I>February  28, 1996</I>

<H1>TOM GRUMBLY REVISITS WARM AND FUZZY</H1>

Last week's workshop, mini-summit, conference -- or whatever the heck you want to call it -- was billed as a nonpartisan look at the future of environmental management in Oak Ridge.<P>

    Of course, when you've got a Republican congressman (Zach Wamp) and a political appointee from a Democrat administration (Tom Grumbly) as the featured speakers, you can hardly expect their comments to be politically neutral. They weren't.<P>

    For his part, Grumbly seemed intent on making Oak Ridgers believe they've got a trusted friend in the White House.<P>

    Grumbly emphasized that Vice President Al Gore -- his former boss when Gore was a congressman and he was a committee staff chair -- supported all federal programs in Oak Ridge, not just the environmental work for which Gore is most often linked.<P>

    Beyond that, the acting undersecretary of the Department of Energy had lots of nice things to say about Oak Ridge.<P>

    Some of his remarks may have been superficial and self-serving, but it's worth noting that he hasn't always been so kind. When he was DOE's environmental chaplain, he passed down a few unflattering reviews of the Oak Ridge effort, especially in the early part of his tenure.<P>

    The Oak Ridge camp was criticized particularly for a poor job in characterizing environmental hazards and budget priorities, leading some observers to question whether the operations in Tennessee were getting their just due.<P>

    Grumbly and Joe La Grone, DOE's former manager in Oak Ridge, reportedly didn't get along so well, and that may have been on Grumbly's mind as he heaped praise on the current leadership at the Oak Ridge Operations office.<P>

    When asked if the budgeting weaknesses had been corrected in Oak Ridge, the DOE official responded:<P>

    ``Absolutely. I think they have a very difficult job here because the base programs of waste management form such a large piece of what we have here.<P>

    ``Until recently -- until Bob Dempsey, Jim Hall and Steve Richardson took over -- there wasn't enough granularity to actually see all the things that were being accomplished. I'm satisfied now that that problem has been fixed, and I expect to see Oak Ridge do considerably better in the budget process in the future.''<P>

    Hall succeeded La Grone as DOE's Oak Ridge manager last year. Richardson is the new deputy manager, and Dempsey heads the environmental management programs.<P>

    Like a good politician, however, Grumbly didn't want to leave the impression that Oak Ridge hasn't been getting all the federal money it should have in recent years. That might leave an unfavorable impression, especially with the state's environmental regulators.<P>

    ``Let me say this,'' Grumbly began, covering tracks as he went. ``I firmly believe within the confines of the tightening budget that the site has gotten what it needs in order to deal with its environmental compliance and other major activities that are required to go on here. In that respect, I think Oak Ridge has gotten its fair share.<P>

    ``But I think this is a competition, and as the budget goes down, there are hard choices that have to be made. And I think with the new team (Hall et al) that you have in place and with the continued work of Lockheed Martin (the obligatory pat for the DOE contractor), that it's doing a better and better job of making its requirements known.''<P>

    Obligatory pats are one thing, but Grumbly caused a few jaws to drop during a luncheon speech when he started passing out kudos individually.<P>

    While waxing eloquent on the reindustrialization of Oak Ridge and DOE's plans to privatize the K-25 plant by the year 2010, Grumbly paid high homage to Linc Hall -- Lockheed Martin's vice president for environmental stuff.<P>

    Grumbly said that if he had 10 Lincoln Halls, DOE could finish the job at K-25 in five years, instead of the 15 currently projected.<P>

    One can only hope that Mr. Hall's new reputation as a quick worker serves him well.<P>

    Does Grumbly think 2010 is a realistic goal (presuming there's only one Linc Hall to spur things along) for cleaning up K-25 and converting the federal plant to private uses?<P>

    Yes, but the undersecretary's answer carried a stipulation or two.<P>

    Grumbly said he thought DOE could clean K-25 to ``brown-field'' standards and convert ``significant parts of it'' to private uses.<P>

    ``I'm not going to say everything, because there's too much uncertainty.... I'm pretty certain now that if we can rally around a strategy that says, look, we don't have to clean everything up to pristine standards in order to make substantial reuse of parts of the site, then we can see that 2010 Vision brought to light. I think we're not going to be able to return large parts ... to the way it was prior to 1944, at least not with the technologies that we currently have or the money we're likely to have.<P>

    ``But I think we can make progress.''<P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>NIOSH MULLING CYANIDE ISSUES AT K-25</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">

<IMG SRC="/images/mungersm.gif" ALT="" BORDER=1 HSPACE=5 ALIGN=left><B>FRANK MUNGER</B><BR>
E-mail:  <A HREF="mailto:73302.1254@compuserve.com">73302.1254@compuserve.com</A><br>
<I>February  21, 1996</I>

<h1>NIOSH MULLING CYANIDE ISSUES AT K-25</h1>

It may be a few weeks before NIOSH (the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) decides what, if any, course of action to pursue at the Oak Ridge K-25 site, where workers have complained of possible cyanide exposures.<P>

    Leo Blade, a industrial hygiene engineer at NIOSH, was among those who conducted a preliminary review of the situation at K-25 recently. He is part of the federal agency's Hazard Evaluation and Technical Assistance Branch in Cincinnati.<P>

    Although NIOSH representatives made no commitments, Blade said he and his colleague, Karen Worthington, left Oak Ridge feeling that a follow-up investigation of some type would probably be a ``worthwhile activity.''<P>

    Blade was extremely cautious, however, about characterizing the situation at K-25. He noted, ``I don't feel I have a complete story.''<P>

    There are a number of potential options available -- such as environmental monitoring at the site or medical examinations of workers -- if NIOSH decides to explore the problem. More than 20 workers at K-25 have reported health effects they believe are tied to cyanide levels documented by urine and blood analyses.<P>

    Blade reviewed results from air and water tests done by Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, which manages K-25 for the U.S. Department of Energy. To date, those samples have not uncovered any abnormal levels of cyanide at the plant. Lockheed Martin also says it has not found evidence of any current-day source of cyanide at K-25.<P>

    NIOSH officials won't pursue an investigation unless they think they can make a significant contribution beyond work already underway at the plant. Blade indicated there has to be sufficient evidence of a problem to justify more detailed studies. Those issues will be discussed internally with health and environmental staffers at NIOSH before a decision is made.<P>

    Blade said he and Worthington benefitted from cooperation by Lockheed Martin and DOE while in Oak Ridge.<P>

    ``I just want to make that point emphatically,'' he said. ``I felt they were extremely helpful and tried to make our first visit as smooth as possible ....  We got a lot accomplished in a very short time, and I think it's because they were cooperative.''<P>

    That observation is notable, of course, because several K-25 workers said they got a negative response when they tried to report their concerns to supervisors at the Oak Ridge plant.<P>

    Indeed, some reportedly were told that the cyanide issue was sensitive and weren't allowed to have their lab results put into their medical files at K-25. One woman said she was turned away from the plant's medical unit -- and not allowed to talk to a staff physician -- when the nature of her problem was disclosed to the support staff.<P>

    K-25 concerned workers, meanwhile, have done a tremendous amount of research themselves and are well informed on the way cyanide reacts in the environment and its potential health effects.<P>

<P>

    DO IT RIGHT: I'm continually impressed by the loyalty and concern shown by retirees from the government's Oak Ridge nuclear facilities.<P>

    Even though many of these men and women have been retired for years, even decades, they still closely follow activities at the plants -- especially the one or ones where they worked -- and want to make sure things are done right.<P>

    The Y-12 retirees became a visible force when the future of the weapons plant became a public issue, and they were instrumental in the formation of Citizens for National Security, an advocacy group.<P>

    Likewise, the K-25 devotees are interested in the future of their plant -- a former uranium-enrichment facility -- which the government plans to clean up and turn over to private industry by the year 2010.<P>

    Rod Shaffer, an engineer who worked at K-25 for many years, said he fears the metals recycling program now underway may shortchange the ultimate D&D (decontamination and decommissioning) tasks needed at the Oak Ridge plant.<P>

    Shaffer is concerned that recyclers will tackle the easy-to-do buildings -- those containing uranium with a low percentage of U-235 -- and make big bucks off the recoverable metals. Unless much of that money is put into a pool, he wonders if enough funds will be available to tackle the technically difficult problems to be faced in Buildings K-25 and K-27, where deposits of highly enriched uranium increase the criticality hazards.<P>

    ``It seems like nobody wants to talk about that,'' he said.<P>

<H1>A LOOK AT DOE'S ANNUAL ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT</H1>

The Department of Energy this year didn't hold a press conference to release the latest environmental monitoring report for the agency's Oak Ridge reservation.<P>

    The annual event was cancelled for lack of interest. In recent years, attendance by members of the news media had declined. The questions were often the same -- and, to a large extent, so were the answers.<P>

    The news media wanted to know if operations at the government's nuclear facilities were harming folks who live and work in the region. DOE and its contractor representatives traditionally concluded that the health effects were minimal or nonexistent.<P>

    Beyond that, of course, were extraordinary quantities of data on pollution emissions and waste operations, accompanied by charts that detailed recent trends.<P>

    The event itself, however, lacked in purpose. Reporters are able to ask questions on environmental topics throughout the year, whenever news surfaces, and a press conference really wasn't needed.<P>

    Besides, DOE's annual monitoring report had become so predictable it lacked in news value.<P>

    Although the documents remain useful as a reference tool and source of background information, the inherent attitude of the work is defensive. The narrative often seems obsessively concerned with convincing readers that there are no problems instead of simply sharing the scientific results and providing a state-of-the-times environmental assessment.<P>

    The public can obtain copies of the report from DOE's Oak Ridge Operations office.<P>

    Here are sample tidbits gleaned from the pages:<P>

    DOE uses seven meteorological towers to help gather information on wind, temperature and other weather conditions -- as well as track the potential dispersion pathways for contaminants. The information is fed into computers dedicated to the monitoring effort. The tallest towers are 330 feet high. Others are 200 feet and 100 feet tall. Two are located near the Y-12 Plant, while three are at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and two at the K-25 site.<P>

    About 880,000 people live within a 50-mile radius of the DOE complex.<P>

    The Oak Ridge reservation was added to the Superfund National Priority List in December 1989. This designation establishes a level of urgency to the cleanup tasks needed in Oak Ridge and helps secure federal funding for that work under the scrutiny of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state of Tennessee counterparts.<P>

    Among the different food stuffs analyzed for possible radioactive contamination is honey. Several bee colonies are located on DOE's Oak Ridge reservation, and sampling results indicated that the ``effective dose equivalent'' -- estimated radiation risk to the whole body -- was 0.2millirem for a hypothetical person who ate a kilogram (2.2pounds) of the sampled honey during a year.<P>

    A person receives about 10millirems of radiation from a normal chest X-ray.<P>

    DOE and its contractors calculate that the maximum radiation exposure to any individual in the region as a result of air and water contaminants in 1994 would be 5 millirems.<P>

    The highest radiation rates off-site from the DOE reservation were detected at a point on Poplar Creek -- adjacent to waste storage areas at K-25 -- and a site on the Clinch River near an area once used for a nuclear experiment. The report said that the Clinch River nuclear site had since been cleaned up, but a new radiation survey has not been conducted to reassess the results.<P>

    The report said if a person fished for 250 hours at either site, he or she could receive a radiation exposure of about 1millirem.<P>

    In organized deer hunts held on the DOE property during 1994, 495 deer were killed and harvested. Of those, eight were confiscated because they contained radioactive contaminants above recommended guidelines.<P>

    Of the 1.2 million cubic meters of waste generated annually on the Oak Ridge reservation, 94 percent of that is sanitary-industrial waste. Of the 175,000 cubic meters of solid waste stored at the Oak Ridge plants, most of it is either low-level radioactive waste by itself or rad waste mixed with hazardous chemicals or radioactive scrap metal. A small amount of the stored waste -- about 1percent -- is transuranic wastes, a particularly hazardous classification that involves radioactive elements heavier than uranium.<P>

<TITLE>K-25 PROGRAM MAY BE MOVING TOO FAST</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">

E-mail:  <A HREF="mailto:73302.1254@compuserve.com">73302.1254@compuserve.com</A><br>
<I>February  7, 1996</I>


<BR CLEAR=ALL><HR NOSPACE Size=1><H1>K-25 PROGRAM MAY BE MOVING TOO FAST</H1>

The ``mining'' of K-25, as it's often called, is a long-term project to remove and recycle the vast tonnage of metals in the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge installation -- once used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons and power reactors.<P>

    Supporters and participants are touting the project as an economic boon to the region. They cite the potential for recovery of precious metals and broad reuse of scrap metals. The estimated value of the K-25 inventory is in the billions of dollars.<P>

    Proponents also insist the mining project will speed the cleanup of K-25 and make it more available and alluring to private companies wishing to locate at a premium site with an existing infrastructure. The federal government has said it wants to be out of K-25 by the year 2010, paving the way for the site to become a 21st-century industrial park.<P>

    Few detractors have spoken out publicly against the K-25 project, which is rapidly building momentum as firms seek recycling contracts they hope will prove lucrative.<P>

    There are, however, some concerns expressed privately -- from would-be participants in the programs and interested observers. I've heard from a surprising number of critics in recent months who are worried that the whole thing is moving a little too fast.<P>

    Some are concerned that the accelerated cleanup and recovery program will actually have negative consequences on the environment. Many of the metals, of course, are contaminated with radioactive contaminants as a result of nuclear missions over five decades. There is a particular concern about recycling nickel tainted with radioactive technetium, which has proved to be elusive in almost every separation process.<P>

    Others are skeptical of the contracting process and wonder if some companies already have been chosen by DOE to lead the way at K-25. Some see DOE's ongoing relationships with industry leaders -- such as Scientific Ecology Group, a Westinghouse subsidiary -- as a barrier to becoming involved in the mining program. A representative of one company new to the Oak Ridge scene said the government's recycling program has the appearance of a done deal. He alluded to local companies building new facilities without any contracts in hand.<P>

    Neither of these concerns is particularly unusual. Most projects this size spawn questions and doubts before proceeding. Nuclear cleanups inevitably must address environmental fears. Federal contracting is routinely second-guessed and shadowed by suggestions of impropriety.<P>

    What's unusual is the pace of the program seems to have outrun the normal kinds of scrutiny -- public and otherwise. There doesn't seem to be a lot of breathing room allowed.<P>

    An accelerated program has a lot of good connotations, including cost savings. It's almost a novel idea in government circles. However, one wonders whether the Oak Ridge program may not come to a dead halt if it doesn't slow down to answer its detractors.<P>

 <B>  BIG AND BIGGER:</B> So, what is the attraction for businesses thinking about using surplus facilities at DOE's K-25 plant?<P>

    Often cited are the existing utilities and infrastructure already available. Businesses looking at virgin sites are sometimes put off by the time and cost of preparing a property for industrial use.<P>

    Plus, there's the access to water (Clinch River) and highways (58 and 95 lead to interstates 40 and 75).<P>

    One factor not often mentioned is the sheer size of some of the K-25 buildings being offered for private use.<P>

    For instance, the K-1401 maintenance building at the Oak Ridge plant has 473,181 square feet. Included in that building is a 48,000-square-foot machine shop and a 30,360-square-foot ``jig and fixture'' shop. Large bay areas include a series of cranes.<P>

    The K-1220 building, which formerly housed a centrifuge test facility, has 16,800 square feet. This includes at least four bay areas, including one that is 360 by 60 feet and 175 feet high.<P>

    There are two laboratories on the surplus block -- each with more than 15,000 square feet.<P>

    And still another available facility -- K-1037, once used for experiments on a laser process for enriching uranium -- has 334,115 square feet.<P>

    Of course, the really, really big buildings -- such as the mile-long, U-shaped K-25 building once part of  the gaseous diffusion operation -- are not yet up for grabs.<P>

<H2>NATIONAL FISHING WEEK FILLED WITH TRAPS FOR UNWARY</H2>

<I>By Sam Venable, Columnist</I><P>

If you read the comics page -- and who doesn't? -- you know Garfield the cat and his goofy-geek owner, Jon Arbuckle, have been on a fishing trip for the past few days.<P>

   There is a very good reason why: This is National Fishing Week, and cartoonist Jim Davis, creator of the fat cat with an insatiable appetite for lasagna, is the honorary chairman.<P>

   ``Fishing, like Garfield, is truly for everyone, young and old,'' Davis said in a prepared statement. ``There are no cultural, financial, gender, physical or mental barriers. Just drop your line in the water and enjoy. There are more than 50 million anglers in the United States. With your help we can interest many others in a sport that is truly universal and truly fun.''<P>

   Fine. I truly agree with everything Jim Davis truly says -- with three exceptions.<P>

   As an anglerperson myownself, I'm here to tell you there DEFINITELY are financial, physical and mental barriers to fishing. I speak with a lifetime of experience in this regard.<P>

   The first myth we must dispense with is this nonsense about ``no financial barriers.''<P>

   Clearly, Jim Davis has spent too much time in the cane pole section. He does not realize that today's angler is a fine-tuned machine who must stay on the cutting edge of technology in order to master the sport. Translation: Dough, and I ain't talking carp bait.<P>

   Before you make the first cast, you must go to a banker and establish a $400,000 line of credit to cover boat, motor, trailer, plus a four-wheel-drive vehicle to tow everything with; not to mention (we're talking bare minimum from here on out) a dozen graphite spinning and casting rods; three fly rods of finest Tonkin cane, in various weights; 15 suitcase-sized tackle boxes filled with crankbaits, spinnerbaits, buzzbaits, jerkbaits, jigs, plastic worms and grubs; 25 assorted bottles of pork rind; spoons, spinners (not to be confused with spinnerbaits); depth finders, pH meters, thermometers; dry flies, wet flies, nymphs, streamers; 155 miles of monofilament, braided line, Spiderwire, fly line, leader material and backing; fly-tying vise, feathers, dubbing, thread, hooks; waders, hip boots and dip nets (one for boat, one for fly-fishing vest, which I forgot to mention); two fillet knives (one electric, one manual); polarized eyeglasses; subscriptions to Field & Stream, Outdoor Life, Sports Afield; and memberships in Trout Unlimited and Bass Anglers Sportsman Society.<P>

   Now, for the ``no physical barriers'' malarkey. Try hiking to, and wading silently along, some secluded mountain stream with even one-tenth of the aforementioned equipment. I rest my case.<P>

   Finally, let us broach the matter of ``no mental barriers.'' This one covers a multitude of sins.<P>

   Anyone -- and there are at least 50 million of us, as Jim Davis points out -- who spends that kind of money and energy in the name of recreation has dubious mental capacity. Even worse, we use it attempting to outwit a cold-blooded animal whose brain is the size of a pea.<P>

   It's too late for addicts like me. But I implore the impressionable youth of America: Just say ``no'' to fishing.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>TSK, TSK. WHITE HOUSE OCCUPANTS ARE A BIT SLOPPY</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="/images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top><!--IMAGE--><I>June  9, 1996</I>
<TD><H2>TSK, TSK. WHITE HOUSE OCCUPANTS ARE A BIT SLOPPY</H2>

<I>By Sam Venable, Columnist</I><P>


I have read, and re-read, stories about the presence of Hillary Rodham Clinton's fingerprints on those Whitewater documents, and the only conclusion I can draw is that White House custodians need to do a better job of keeping the place clean.<P>

   If you've been following the Whitewater case as it evolves -- no small feat in itself, as this thing is more confusing than a dozen O.J. Simpson trials -- you know the fingerprints of which I speak. They're the ones Mrs. Clinton, the late Vince Foster, and four other people left on some of the first lady's old billing records.<P>

   Depending on whose version of this revelation you listen to, these fingerprints either:<P>

   (A) Exonerate Mrs. Clinton of all wrongdoing.<P>

   (B) Prove her guilt beyond the shadow of a doubt.<P>

   Democrats in Washington believe option A is correct. Republicans in Washington believe option B is correct. Nobody else in America cares.<P>

   Still, this situation begs a very important question: Shouldn't we, as taxpayers, expect better custodial service on our property?<P>

   After all, it's our White House. It doesn't belong to Bill and H.R. Clinton any more than it belonged to the Bushes, the Reagans and other first families down the line. Since we're footing the bill for routine cleanup and maintenance of the premises, I think it's only fair that we demand top-notch performance.<P>

   Shoddy work is nothing to trifle with. If we let the custodial staff get away with not wiping off fingerprints, then the next thing you know, the windows won't get washed, and coffee cups in the executive silver service set will be permanently smudged with lipstick. I say crack the whip on these slackers, by gummies!<P>

   At the same time, it's not unreasonable to ask the Clintons to be more mindful of their role as stewards.<P>

   What does it say about their personal characters if they go about leaving dirty fingerprints willy-nilly through the White House? People with half a degree of class just do don't that sort of thing.<P>

   This reflects poorly on the upbringing Mr. and Mrs. Clinton had, and it surely makes well-mannered folks from Arkansas wince in embarrassed pain. What's next -- wet undies flapping in the breeze from a clothesline in the rose garden?<P>

   Indeed, if the Clintons can't keep the joint any cleaner than that, I propose we ask them to wear gloves whenever they are using our property.<P>

   Just buy a box of those disposable rubber gloves -- the kind found in every doctor's and dentist's office in America these days -- and suggest, quietly but firmly, the Clintons take full advantage of them.<P>

   Yes, these are strong measures. But perilous situations call for decisive action. As any homeowner will tell you, the best way to keep a house in tip-top condition is to stay ahead of little maintenance problems so they don't snowball into big ones.<P>

   Please, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton: Clean up your Whitewater mess before it gets dirtier!<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>MALASIAN PRODUCT MALFUNCTION MAY STYMIE SUMMER</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="/images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><I>June 11, 1996</I>
<TD width=470><H2>MALASIAN PRODUCT MALFUNCTION MAY STYMIE SUMMER</H2>

<I>By Sam Venable, Columnist</i><P>

Far be it from me to be cynical, but before everyone celebrates Kellogg's price rollback with a bowl of sugar-coated yummies, let's take a second look.<P>

   On Monday, the nation's No. 1 cereal manufacturer announced it is dropping the price on 16 of its most popular brands, including Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops, Cocoa Krispies and Corn Pops.<P>

   The cuts range from 4 to 28 percent, but they average 19 percent. This was Kellogg's response to a similar slash in April by one of its chief competitors, Post.<P>

   Don't expect an immediate difference in your grocery bill. In news stories about the Kellogg announcement, food industry analysts predicted it would take at least a couple of weeks for shoppers to see lower prices.<P>

   That's pretty much the same response I got Tuesday when I telephoned six supermarkets in the Knoxville area.<P>

   These things take time, the clerks told me. The rollback must be handed down from the corporate office to the district office to the local warehouse to the individual store, then fed into the scanner, blah-blah-blah.<P>

   I understand that. I also understand there is a basic difference between cereal and gasoline. Besides taste, of course -- plus the fact that gasoline, even in premium blends, does not contain the minimum daily requirement of eight essential vitamins and minerals.<P>

   In today's mobile society, cereal is not a must-have product. Gasoline is.<P>

   Despite what your and your children's tastebuds say to the contrary, the human body can function quite well without a daily ration of Frosted Flakes. An automobile, on the other hand, will not even clunk down the driveway without a dose of fuel.<P>

   That's why it takes two weeks for a cereal price rollback to show up at the grocery store, while a gasoline price increase occurs at your friendly local pump approximately 71/2 seconds after an oil tanker runs aground on the other side of the world.<P>

   No doubt there are experts, trained in the intricacies of petroleum production, who can better explain this phenomenon with charts and graphs.<P>

   But in reality, it boils down to The Good Ol' Boy Golden Rule -- if you've got the gold, you get to make the rules.<P>

   A few other questions to ponder as you pour on the milk:<P>

   If Post and Kellogg could afford to slash prices so drastically, how come they haven't done it before now?<P>

   Does this mean -- gasp! -- they were gouging consumers all along?<P>

   Will the fiscal slack within Post and Kellogg be taken up by trimming corporate jobs, salaries and benefits?<P>

   Or will the pain be felt by the little people on the other end of the flow chart?<P>

   Don't spend too much time trying to figure out the answers. The ugly truth is too depressing. Besides, your cereal's getting soggy.<P>

<TD WIDTH=470><H2>DOO-DADS MAY BE NAMED FOR GADGET- LOVING FATHERS</H2>

<I>By Sam Venable, Columnist</I><P>

I was at my father's house one day years ago and saw his latest play-pretty hanging above the bathroom sink.<P>

   It was a bar of magnetic soap.<P>

   Wait. That's not wholly correct. The soap itself wasn't magnetic; it was your basic, everyday Ivory or Zest or whatever brand he'd bought on sale. But it wasn't resting in a soap dish. Instead, it was dangling from the end of a short, small-diameter, magnetized rod attached to the tile.<P>

   ``This way, it stays dry and doesn't get all gummy,'' Dad explained, plucking the soap off its stand. He turned the bar over and pointed to a tiny metal tack embedded inside.<P>

   ``The kit came with a couple of these things,'' he went on. ``You stick one inside the soap and it hangs by itself, out of the way of the sink. When the soap's been used up, you put the tack inside another bar. I think it's a good idea.''<P>

   Of course he did. My dad was always intrigued by inventions, large or small. That's why, if he were alive today, it would be easy to buy him a Father's Day present.<P>

   It's been nearly a quarter of a century since Big Sam died. In that time, inventors have changed Americans' lifestyles with hundreds of products, many of which are much more practical, not to mention functional, than magnetic soap.<P>

   I know he'd love one of those gasoline-powered weed-cutting machines that use fishing line to trim hard-to-mow places. Big Sam owned the predecessor to these devices and thought it was the berries. But his weed-cutter ran on electricity and had a rotating metal blade. It cut weeds, all right. Also everything else in its path. And when he encountered a rock -- zing! -- nobody within 75 yards from safe from shrapnel.<P>

   Next on the Father's Day shopping list? How about a microwave oven?<P>

   Microwave technology had been perfected before my father's death, but everyday application in the home was nil. As much as Big Sam loved to eat, I know he'd have been tickled with one of these.<P>

   Same for today's television doo-dads: cable TV, big screens, remote controls, the works. Big Sam would have been first in line for a VCR, if for no other reason than to tape the Lawrence Welk show on Saturday nights when he couldn't be at home. Then again, he'd have been amazed to discover Lawrence Welk -- not to mention Jackie Gleason and some of his other favorites -- were available on the cable rerun station.<P>

   Assuming he could pry himself away from ESPN, that is. My dad was a physical education professor, a coach, a referee, the ultimate sports buff. On any number of occasions, he would tune his TV to one ball game, his radio to another, sit at his desk grading papers or filling out reports, never come up for air and never lose track. Between ESPN's 24-hour sports coverage and reporter Chris Berman's cornball nicknames, Big Sam would have achieved athletic nirvana.<P>

   He also would have liked a home computer. My father was the consummate record keeper. Going through his papers after his death, my mother found bundles of detailed notes, receipts, diagrams and plans on every project imaginable, home repairs to classroom assignments. An accomplished typist and inveterate tinkerer, he would have launched himself into cyberspace before the gift wrap hit the floor.<P>

   But I wouldn't have to spend a bundle to buy him a Father's Day present. I bet he would have appreciated a plastic, disposable razor -- even though it would have sorely rubbed against Big Sam's Depression-era, recycling grain to throw anything away. Once he realized how sharp these new razors are, though, he'd have ditched his Blue Blades and come on board.<P>

   Indeed, my old man would have marveled over the incredible changes that have occurred since his day. Bar codes. ATM banking. Resealable bottles and food bags. Cellular phones. Pocket calculators. Digital watches.<P>

   Heart bypass surgery.<P>

   If that operation had been as common in 1972 as it is in 1996, I'd be giving him a necktie today.<P>

<TD width=470><H2>MALASIAN PRODUCT MALFUNCTION MAY STYMIE SUMMER</H2>

<I>By Sam Venable, Columnist</i><P>

My wife and I took a mini-vacation last weekend. We visited some long-time friends in Virginia.<P>

   This was a short trip as far as the clock is concerned -- up there Saturday, back here Sunday -- but it covered over 700 miles. We had to cram a lot of visiting into a few hours.<P>

   On Venob's Vacation Vexation scale, this was an incredibly boring experience. No car trouble. No bad weather. No lost objects. No sickness. No interstate construction zones. I was about to think the world had slipped off its axis when we pulled into a rest area on Interstate 81 and rediscovered reality.<P>

   In one section of the parking lot, kids were screaming and crying. In another corner, a guy was under the hood of his car, jiggling wires. Two women who walked by me on the sidewalk were crabbing at each other. Another man was standing in front of a giant Virginia map and looking down at his own personal Virginia map, trying to figure out which was correct.<P>

   Whew. What a relief. That's the way vacations are supposed to be, and I was sorely afraid somebody had changed the rules when I wasn't looking.<P>

   I shouldn't have worried, of course. Even though Mary Ann and I didn't fulfill our sacred obligations as travelers -- we sincerely apologize and promise to do better -- there are plenty of other folks who don't ignore this responsibility to society.<P>

   Folks like Tom and Donna Butzbach.<P>

   The Butzbachs live in West Knoxville. He's a construction engineer with Lockheed Martin in Oak Ridge. Not long ago, they went trailer-camping near Dale Hollow Lake.<P>

   Donna kept a chronological list of the fun and frolic, which Tom transcribed and sent to me. I thought you might enjoy reading about their trip as you: (1) chart your own vacation plans and (2) guzzle a second bottle of Maalox.<P>

   Take it away, Tom:<P>

   ``Thursday: Left home with wife and two dogs. Trying to stop as we came off Pellissippi Parkway at Kingston Pike, realized I had forgotten to hook up the trailer brakes. Finally got to campground and into the only campsite available because we had forgotten to make reservations. Turned on the gas valve, and the regulator died. No hot water or stove.<P>

   ``Friday: Went trout fishing at dawn, caught my limit, and laid them on the table to clean. Decided to fix regulator first. Wound up driving 90 miles for a new one. While I was gone, all the electricity in the campground went out. Returned to campground and replaced regulator, but one tank valve wouldn't stop leaking. Didn't need stove anyhow because I had waited too long and trout were covered with flies.<P>

   ``Saturday: Donna had to chase bird out of restroom. Dogs got tangled up and attempted to kill each other. Decided to go swimming. No parking available, so I left Donna with inflatable raft, loaded with gear. Parked on far side of the dam and walked back to meet her. Carried everything to water. When raft started sinking, realized Donna had dragged it across the road, tearing holes in the bottom.<P>

   ``Sunday: Went fishing again. Broke best rod closing tailgate of truck. Started raining. Noticed awning of camper was leaking.<P>

   ``Monday: Rained on and off all day. When campsite flooded, remembered the need for making reservations.<P>

   ``Tuesday: Driving home, refrigerator access door blew off the back of trailer and was run over by every semi in Tennessee. Did not notice until too late. Got home and discovered we had left back door unlocked. Nothing missing. Started unloading gear and felt ill. Came down with 24-hour bug.''<P>

   All's well that ends well. Tom recovered, replaced the bum gear and went back to work so he could rest, relax and prepare for his next campout later this summer.<P>

   It oughta be a classic. He's taking his mother-in-law from New Jersey.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>MILE MARKERS ON LIFE'S BYWAYS DON'T ALWAYS ADD UP</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="/images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>June 20, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>MILE MARKERS ON LIFE'S BYWAYS DON'T ALWAYS ADD UP</H2>

<I>By Sam Venable, Columnist</I><P>

We're going to play Trivial Pursuit with the federal government today, thanks to the eagle-eyed observations of Claybourne Waldrop and Bob Lochbaum.<P>

   Waldrop would like for someone to tell him when he is -- or was -- supposed to die.<P>

   He was born Oct. 30, 1919. He consulted some life expectancy charts issued by the feds and discovered he was supposed to have kicked the bucket last year.<P>

   According to the stats, Waldrop was supposed to have lived 75.5 years, meaning he should have keeled over at midnight between April 30 and May 1, 1995. But he beat the rap.<P>

   Then last Oct. 24, Waldrop read a new set of federal longevity figures. This time, he was supposed to live 75.7 years, which meant he should have checked out at midnight between July 12 and 13, 1995.<P>

   ``However, since I was not advised until Oct. 24 and don't have a clue as to how to die retroactively, I plead innocent in this case for those 0.283516 years (103.5 days) that I overshot,''  he says.<P>

   Waldrop has his own solution: ``Since all of my ancestors were good rebels, I am going to rebel against Washington and expect to die a typical American natural death -- in a hospital while under the care of medical doctors. Actually, since I have never spent a single day in a hospital (not even born in one; in the sticks of Alabama in 1919 it would have been even more dangerous to try to get my mother to a city slicker hospital than to let her give birth at home), I would prefer to fall dead just outside the door if anyone tries to take me inside a cotton-pickin' hospital!''<P>

   I say we refer Waldrop's request to members of some high-level congressional subcommittee and let them review it for, oh, 75.9 years. In the meantime, let us consider Bob Lochbaum's observations, which also have to do with numbers supplied by the federal government.<P>

   Lochbaum is a retired mechanical engineer who admits an obsession for getting numbers correct.<P>

   ``It drives my wife crazy when we're on the interstate,'' he said. ``I'll make note of mile markers and check them on my speedometer and watch to see if they're properly spaced.''<P>

   However, Lochbaum's more pressing issue has to do with a different kind of mileage: the marked distances on certain trails in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.<P>

   Lochbaum is a big-time hiker. He has trod each of the 153 named trails in the Smokies, some of them many times. In so doing, he has noticed some contain bogus information.<P>

   This is not a casual observation. Lochbaum has measured each trail, one foot at a time, with a precision measuring wheel.<P>

   ``Overall, the Park Service has done an excellent job,'' he told me. ``The vast majority of distances are accurate. Some of the others aren't.<P>

   ``For example, on the Forney Creek Trail at the intersection of the Jonas Creek Trail there is a sign saying it is 6.1 miles up to the Forney Ridge Trail. The actual distance is 7.3 miles. That's a strenuous hike to begin with, and the extra distance makes a real difference if you're carrying a 60-pound pack and nightfall is approaching.''<P>

   Want another? On the Bote Mountain Trail at the intersection of the West Prong Trail a sign indicates it is 0.6-mile on out to the Finley Cane Trail. Wrong, says Lochbaum. It's 0.3-mile.<P>

   And on the Cooper Road Trail, where it intersects with the Hatcher Mountain Trail, a sign says it's 2.8 miles down Hatcher Mountain to the Little Bottom Trail. However, at Little Bottom the sign says it's only 2.6 miles back up Hatcher Mountain to Cooper Road.<P>

   ``If those two have to be different,'' Lochbaum said with a laugh, ``at least it's nice that the shorter distance is the one going uphill.''<P>

   And if it's any consolation to Tennesseans, Lochbaum says most of the errors are on the North Carolina side of the park.<P>

   Figures. Over here, we've always strived for pinpoint akkuracy.<P>

<TD WIDTH=470><H2>A PHILOSOPHER'S CHIPMUNK SLAM LOSES HIS LISTENER</H2>

<I>By Sam Venable, Columnist</i><P>

My wife called me to the kitchen window the other day. She pointed toward the woodpile by the back fence.<P>

   ``Isn't it so cute!'' she exclaimed.<P>

   ``What?'' I replied. ``The woodpile? Cute?''<P>

   She rolled her eyes. ``No. The chipmunk.''<P>

   I looked again. Sure enough, there stood a chipmunk on its back legs, surveying the scene. Content no danger was near, it dropped to the ground and continued feeding on leftover seeds or acorns or whatever it is chipmunks eat this time of year. It stood again, cheek pouches full. Then it scampered into a crevice at the base of the logs -- its hideout, I suppose.<P>

   ``Those are precious little animals,'' Mary Ann said.<P>

   ``Wrong,'' I answered. ``They're lucky little animals with a good public relations manager.''<P>

   Mary Ann gave me one of her patented looks. ``What on earth are you talking about?''<P>

   ``Chipmunks are lucky to have fuzzy tails and little stripes down their backs. Otherwise, they'd be called mice. People don't say `ooh' and `aah' when they see mice. They scream and set a mouse trap. People don't buy expensive wildlife prints of mice, either. With the exception of Mickey and Minnie, people don't spend any money at all on mice, except to kill them.''<P>

   I was on my soap box by now. Mary Ann was wishing she'd never brought the subject up.<P>

   ``If you stop to think about it, the world is full of inconsistencies like that. Take carp. They're a fish, just like bass or trout. But carp don't have a fancy PR consultant like bass and trout do.<P>

   ``Right now, Sevier County is trying to attract the new headquarters of the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society. It could be worth millions of dollars. But you couldn't find a community in the United States that wants to be headquarters of something like the Carp Preservation Society.''<P>

   I paused to take a breath. Mary Ann took the opportunity to duck out of the room.<P>

   ``Just look at our yard. What do you see in places? Crabgrass, the curse of suburbia.<P>

   ``Crabgrass is green, just like Kentucky 31. It covers bare spots faster than Kentucky 31. With some good spin doctoring, crabgrass could be the crown jewel of the lawn. But no. Fools like me spend tons of money to kill crabgrass, then we turn right around and spend tons more money for seed, fertilizer and water trying to grow Kentucky 31. It doesn't make any sense.''<P>

   I heard the door to the deck close quietly and saw Mary Ann walk into the back yard, shaking her head and throwing her hands in the air. She tends to react that way when I launch into a philosophical discussion.<P>

   ``Think about the food we eat,'' I philosophized, aloud and alone. ``As long as human beings are going to eat meat, there's no reason why it can't come from horses. Can't be any worse for us than beef or pork.<P>

   ``Farmers raise cows and pigs for slaughter, and most people never think twice about it. But if a farmer raised horses for the meat market, it would create a world of stink. TV crews would show up at the place. So would angry picketers carrying signs. The poor farmer would probably be forced to move.''<P>

   I looked out the window again. Mary Ann was standing in the shade of a stately oak tree in the back yard -- have you ever heard anyone describe a mimosa as ``stately''? -- watching the cute little chipmunk, which had re-emerged and was feeding again. She seemed to be enjoying herself immensely.<P>

   I picked up the newspaper. The first story that caught my eye was about those 20 candidates running for the 1st Congressional District seat being vacated by Jimmy Quillen.<P>

   And I couldn't help but think that all 20 were doing their best to convince voters they're a chipmunk-bass-trout-Kentucky 31-horse-oak candidate, while everyone else in the race is mouse-carp-crabgrass-cow-pig-mimosa material.<P>

   ``It's a crazy world,'' I said to myself.<P>

   Had she been there, Mary Ann surely would've agreed.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>IT'S HOT FUN IN THE SUMMERTIME . . . BUT HOW HOT IS HOT?</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="/images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>June 23, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>IT'S HOT FUN IN THE SUMMERTIME . . . BUT HOW HOT IS HOT?</H2>

If you think it's been hot around Knoxville the last few days, you oughta see what's cookin' several miles up the road.<P>

   Ninety-three million miles, to be exact.<P>

   Scientists at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., recently took the temperature of gaseous particles blasting off the sun. It was a rip-snorting 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than any temperature ever recorded.<P>

   There's more. John Kohl, one of the Smithsonian researchers involved with the study, says temperature measurements Up Yonder are still climbing. So keep the ice trays full.<P>

   Don't ask me how Kohl and his ilk arrived at their multimillion-degree conclusion. I'm sure they used physics instead of a thermometer.<P>

   Thermometers are itty-bitty things. Even though a rectal thermometer appears to stretch 50 feet from end to end -- particularly when deposited in your own end -- this instrument is exceedingly too short to take an accurate reading from a distance of one or two miles, let alone 93 million. But I digress.<P>

   Compared to what's happening on the sun, our paltry high-80's and low-90's seem downright frigid. I'm almost tempted to run out and buy a new snow shovel, not to mention heavy boots and coats, since a blizzard could strike by the middle of next week.<P>

   Relative temperatures notwithstanding, though, Knoxvillians are going to roast over the next few days. Fortunately, we don't have to singe in the process.<P>

   Ever since sunscreening chemical compounds were developed a few years ago, we humanoids are no longer forced to endure the pain of a beet-red sunburn.<P>

   Sunscreens are among the true wonder products of the 20th century. Properly applied, they will keep you from turning into a strip of bacon as you work or play under the summer sun.<P>

   Alas, there is a downside to the process. By the time you finally make a selection from the dozens of brands and styles available, the sun already will have set. The only thing you have to worry about then is stumbling in the dark while walking back to your car in the parking lot.<P>

   Don't take my word for it. Check out the sunscreen sales counter at your friendly local drugstore or supermarket.<P>

   First, which brand suits your fancy? To name just a few: Coppertone, Banana Boat, Panama Jack, Tropical Blend, Hawaiian Tropic and Tropic Isle, plus a generous selection of generics.<P>

   Next, do you want liquid, lotion, spray, stick, cream or gel?<P>

   With aloe vera, vitamin E, coconut oil, cocoa butter, lanolin or collagen?<P>

   Scented or fragrance-free?<P>

   That's just for starters. You must also decide between ``non-greasy,'' ``oil-free'' and ``dry oil'' formulas, which seem like they belong in the automotive section, not skin care.<P>

   Next comes the BIG decision: the level of ``SPF,'' or sun protection factor. SPF ranges from 2 to 50.<P>

   Best I can tell, level 2 is about like a thin coating of Pam that will protect you from sunbeams for a good, oh, 14 minutes.<P>

   On the other end of the spectrum, level 50 provides a virtual body condom capable of deflecting ultraviolet rays, cosmic rays, X-rays, sting rays and James Earl Rays until the turn of the century. My suggestion is to find a median, happy or otherwise.<P>

   Hang on, sun worshiper; you're still not ready for the checkout aisle.<P>

   Do you want rub-proof sunscreen? Waterproof? Sweat-proof? Sand-proof?<P>

   And in a bit of alchemic/marketing brilliance I don't yet understand, you can pick a sunscreen that is ``waterproof,'' and provides ``essential moisturizers'' at the same time.<P>

   Perhaps this is the stuff we'll need if the '96 heat wave worsens and temperatures rise to 180 million degrees Down Here.<P>

   ``Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, please.''<P>

   ``Is that you, Mrs. Clinton?''<P>

   ``Why, uh, yes. How did you know?''<P>

   ``Voice prints. We had a machine installed a few days ago. Most amazing device we'd had up here in ages. It's even more efficient than the polisher that keeps our streets of gold so shiny. In less than one-thousanth of a second, it analyzes a caller's voice and tells us who he or she is.''<P>

   ``Wow. That is a fancy piece of work. I've used some high-tech stuff over at the FBI, but nothing like that. No wonder you knew me right off the bat.''<P>

   ``No offense, Hillary -- you don't mind if I call you Hillary, do you? -- but I don't need the voice print machine in your case. I'd recognize you anywhere. So would any operator up here.''<P>

   ``I suppose I have been on the horn a lot recently.''<P>

   ``For sure. You ever thought of subscribing to our frequent caller service? With the volume you've been making, it'd be a lot cheaper.''<P>

   ``That's not a bad idea. Can you send me some details?''<P>

   ``Sure. In care of the White House?''<P>

   ``Right.''<P>

   ``No problem. It'll go out first thing tomorrow morning. Now, you were wanting to speak with Mrs. Roosevelt again?''<P>

   ``Yes, if she's not busy.''<P>

   ``Unfortunately, she is. Ever since the news came out about your conversations with her, this place has been a madhouse. Nosy newspaper reporters are calling at all hours of the night and day. It's awful!''<P>

   ``Tell me about it.''<P>

   ``The big TV networks are hounding us, too. Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw, Ted Koppel -- they all want exclusive interviews. Not to mention the folks from `60 Minutes', `20/20' and `Prime Time Live.' We haven't drawn this much media attention since Oral Roberts said God was going to call him home if he didn't raise that pile of money.''<P>

   ``Shucks. I sure was hoping to speak with Mrs. Roosevelt. Can't you just put me on hold and buzz her?''<P>

   ``Not likely. No offense, Hillary, but you're not on the short list of Mrs. Roosevelt's dearest friends right now.''<P>

   ``Yeah, I guess I did kick up a stir.''<P>

   ``A stir? That's putting it mildly. Mrs. Roosevelt had been enjoying a very peaceful stay since 1962. Lounging by the pool, singing with the heavenly choir, bingo on Thursday nights. But ever since you went public about those conversations with her, the poor woman hasn't had a moment's rest.''<P>

   ``What about Mohandas Gandhi?''<P>

   ``Different division, as you know. I could ring over there and see if he's busy, but it'd be a waste of time. The reporters and TV guys have all those lines tied up, too. You'll never get in.''<P>

   ``Isn't there anyone I can talk to? Please! I need some advice right now! The radio talk shows are carving me apart. Leno and Letterman are going to have a field day with this. It's the hottest street corner and lunch counter conversation in America. Find someone! Anyone! What about Jackie Onassis?''<P>

   ``Sorry. She's still getting used to the place. She has ordered no interviews whatsoever.<P>

   ``How about Jack Kennedy?''<P>

   ``Nope. His line's always busy. You ought to know that.''<P>

   ``Huh? What do you mean?''<P>

   ``He and your husband chat nearly every day.''<P>

   ``That's odd. Bill never has mentioned it. What do Jack and Bill talk about?''<P>

   ``I can't say -- official policy, you know. But just between us girls, they got on a conference call with Marilyn Monroe the other day, and they laughed and hollered and whooped it up till -- you'll pardon the expression -- all hell nearly broke loose.''<P>

<TD WIDTH=470><H2>FIREFIGHTERS, GOOD GREENS, A SCOOTER AND A ROCKET FOOL</H2>

<i>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel columnist</i><P>

News and views from TV Land:<P>

   * A new show about firefighters has torched a bonfire under the folks it supposedly portrays.<P>

   Perhaps you've seen this program, ``L.A. Firefighters,'' which is carried by the Fox network. It's a fast-action dazzler with screeching brakes, flashing lights, smoke, mirrors and other essential elements of techno-drama.<P>

   Firefighters in Los Angeles are not amused. They're protesting to Fox and have called for a nationwide boycott of sponsors.<P>

   Maybe it's the heat or maybe it's just California, but I can't imagine anyone would watch a TV program about (take your pick) police officers, firefighters, doctors, lawyers or journalists and think they're seeing raw, uncut, everyday action. Nor am I alone in this opinion.<P>

   ``I've seen 11/2 episodes,'' said Charlie Moye of Rural/Metro. ``It's fun to watch, but a lot of things are incredibly inaccurate about the technical aspects and safety procedures. I guess that's the way they have to do it to make it entertaining.''<P>

   Much the same response came from Knoxville Fire Department spokesman Norman Hammitt. ``I haven't heard any comment one way or the other from our people,'' he added.<P>

   Sure, if the name of the program was ``Knoxville Firefighters,'' perhaps folks around here would protest mightily. That's especially true if each week's script rehashed those lame hillbilly stereotypes that typically emanate from Hollywood.<P>

   But there's an ugly occupational truth we all must learn: Most jobs tend to become routine at best, boring at worst, especially after you've been in them for any length of time.<P>

   From crime fighting to space probing to professional football quarterbacking, the disparity between ho-hum detail and frontline drama runs about 9:1. The only way to package it for TV, and make it more exciting than a Maytag commercial, is to boil down two years' worth of action and suspense into every episode.<P>

   I think that's why I still enjoy those old Andy Griffith reruns. They're entertaining, even when the hottest action in town is a new addition to the blue-plate special at the diner.<P>

   * And speaking of downhome dining, does any place serve better turnip greens than Cracker Barrel?<P>

   If everybody who's hot and bothered about ``L.A. Firefighters'' would gather at Th' Barrel and light into a big mess of greens, laced with hunks of ham meat and drizzled with vinegar, they'd forget what the fight was all about.<P>

   * Producers of police sit-coms could've had fun the other day when Knoxvillian Foster Piciacchia drove (by car) to the driver's license office to procure a learner's permit for his newly acquired motor scooter.<P>

   ``I couldn't get one,'' said Piciacchia. ``I'm too old. They said I had to be 15 to get a learner's permit. I'm 68.''<P>

   Piciacchia drove home and puttered around his neighborhood on the scooter until he felt prepared to take a test. Then he drove back to the license office in his car, followed by a neighborhood friend, age 15, on the scooter.<P>

   Still no dice.<P>

   ``The scooter had a tail light out,'' he told me. ``They said I couldn't take a test on it until the light was repaired.''<P>

   Piciacchia's solution?<P>

   ``I'm selling it. It's too much hassle. I'll just ride my bicycle.''<P>

   * Cop show producers also missed a golden opportunity for live, fast-paced footage recently in Arizona. I learned about it via an E-mail message from Knoxvillian Rick Harrington. He'd gotten it off the Internet.<P>

   Seems this good ol' boy got hold of some rocket fuel and tried it in his Chevy. Wasn't much left but a grease spot.<P>

   As Rick noted at the bottom: ``What are the most common last words of a redneck?<P>

   ```Watch this!'''<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>RUNNER/LAWYER JOHN SMARTT HAD `HEADY' FLAME RUN</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="/images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>June 28, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>RUNNER/LAWYER JOHN SMARTT HAD `HEADY' FLAME RUN</H2>

<I>By Sam Venable, Columnist</I><P>

John Smartt was the quintessential Modern Sports Hero -- East Tennessee variety -- Thursday morning as he carried the Olympic torch on the final leg of its journey through Knoxville. Consider:<P>

   * Throngs of adoring fans turned out at 6 a.m. to cheer him on, many of them his fellow members of Second Presbyterian Church. ``We oughta take up an offering,'' one quipped.<P>

   * He had an official photographer who recorded every moment of the gala morning, from torch lighting to take off. ``Actually, it's just my home video camera,'' said Bill Miller. ``John's been my friend for a long time.''<P>

   * His personal hairdresser was there. ``I've been cutting John's hair for 16 years,'' said Denny Ledford of Union Avenue Barber Shop. ``I wanted to get his picture for the front window.''<P>

   * He signed dozens of autographs -- without charge, a serious breach of Modern Sports Hero protocol -- after the event.<P>

   As for the celebrated run itself?<P>

   ``It was a heady, memorable experience, almost a spiritual experience,'' said the 77-year-old Smartt. ``But it was over in a hurry.''<P>

   It certainly was. Torchbearers only carry the flame for one kilometer each. That's roughly half a mile, barely a warm-up for folks like Smartt who jog regularly.<P>

   Brint Adams, president of Knoxville Track Club, carried the flame along the western end of Neyland Drive. Then he hoofed back to the starting point at James White Fort.<P>

   ``I ran a lot farther coming back than I did with the flame,'' he said.<P>

   No matter what the distance, though, each torchbearer shared a piece of history. It's not every day a flame ignited halfway around the world winds through K-Town en route to the Olympics, and hundreds of East Tennesseans rolled out of the sheets early to witness it.<P>

   Some never went to bed in the first place.<P>

   ``I had to work late Wednesday night and couldn't get to the World's Fair Park,'' said bail bondsman Marty Roper. ``I wanted my kids to see this, so my wife and I stayed up the rest of the night to make sure we'd get here on time.''<P>

   How did Eleanor Roper pass away the wee hours before everyone climbed into the family car and drove downtown?<P>

   ``I cleaned house,'' she replied.<P>

   By the time the Olympic flame reaches Atlanta for the start of the Summer Games, it will have traveled 15,000 miles. In case you were wondering, yes, this is the same flame that was lit March 30 in Olympia, Greece. In spite of Mother Nature's fury and humankind's flubs, one flicker and a backup always remain burning.<P>

   ``They're called the `Mother Flame,''' said Jim Bollinger, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, which is sponsoring the torch run. He pointed to two tiny lanterns burning inside the van that follows the torchbearers on their appointed rounds. ``They never go out.''<P>

   Good thinking. Smartt's son, John Jr., recalled that earlier this year, a torchbearer near San Francisco was carrying the flame via bicycle. He hit a pothole, deep-sixed, and -- whoosh! -- no more fire. A flick from the Mother Flame, however, rekindled the process.<P>

    True, that may not have been the way things worked in 776 B.C. when the Greeks started this Olympics business. But in 776 B.C., there weren't TV contracts, fireworks displays, a youth flag corps, country music stars, public relations crews, $275 souvenir torches, official hotel suites and corporate sponsors, either. And I seriously doubt onlookers were treated to a breakfast of melon and muffins, as were the folks who turned out Thursday morning.<P>

   ``It's been a real show,'' said Don Barker, who watched the flame move along Chapman Highway on Wednesday afternoon, then came back for more the next morning. ``I don't think Chapman Highway's ever been that crowded. It took me 45 minutes to go one mile.''<P>

   Just wait. By the time the world converges on Atlanta, that'll seem like Mach 2 speed.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>DECREES, LAWS, RULES: WE'RE REGULATING OURSELVES TO DEATH</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="/images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>June 30, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>DECREES, LAWS, RULES: WE'RE REGULATING OURSELVES TO DEATH</H2>

The awesome power of God does not come in calibers and isn't dispensed with a trigger.<P>

   Officials of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints made that point perfectly clear a few days ago when they officially decreed firearms do not belong at prayer meeting.<P>

   ``Churches are dedicated for the worship of God and as havens from the cares and concerns of the world,'' read a statement from the organization's main office. ``The carrying of weapons, concealed or otherwise, within their walls is inappropriate, except as required by officers of the law.''<P>

   It's a sign of the times, I suppose. Given the modern notion that every waking hour of every day must be regulated by some type of official writ, not to mention gang warfare in the inner cities and concealed-weapons laws in the legislatures, it was only a matter of time before someone had to spell out, for the record, that thou shalt not carryeth thy Uzi with thy Bible.<P>

   Still, I find it odd something like this would have to be mentioned at all.<P>

   Why does anyone need a gun in church, for heaven's sake? To make sure everybody closes their eyes during prayer?<P>

   (Come to think of it, I do know one instance when a gun might have come in handy. There used to be a flicker that drove our congregation crazy by pecking, very loudly, on the wood siding outside our sanctuary. Right in the middle of the sermon, that hateful bird would crank up. I always thought a strategically placed BB would've convinced the varmint to look for more suitable pecking grounds, but the priest never called upon my services. Just as well. I probably would have missed and taken out the stained glass.)<P>

   If there must be an official policy about these things, so be it. The last thing I want to worry about on Sunday morning is having the roll Up Yonder called prematurely because some guy in the next row had a .44 and an extreme dislike of my necktie.<P>

   Besides, you never know who's packing heat. It's like a hillbilly joke I heard years ago:<P>

   Violence was on the rise in the backwoods community, thanks to moonshining, family feuds and run-of-the-mill knifings, ear-loppings and eye-gougings. So the preacher decided to make it the subject of his next message.<P>

   ``Brothers and sisters!'' he exhorted from the pulpit, ``let the Lord do the fighting for you!<P>

   ``If someone hits you, don't hit back! Let the Lord fight your enemies! He's coming soon!<P>

   ``If someone cuts you, don't cut back! Let the Lord fight your enemies! He's coming soon!<P>

   ``If someone shoots you, don't shoot back! Let the Lord fight your enemies. He's coming soon!''<P>

   Just then, the preacher flung his arms to make another point. A pearl-handled revolver flew from beneath his robe and clattered to the floor.<P>

   Silence fell across the church.<P>

   Finally, someone in the back yelled out, ``Hey, preacher! If the Lord's gonna fight all them enemies fer us, and he's comin' so soon, how come you're carryin' a pistol?''<P>

   His Reverendness never missed a beat: ``Well, somebody's gotta hold 'em till he gets here!''<P>

SOON COVER EVERYTHING </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, Columnist</em></p>
<p>Forget the calendar, the heat, the humidity and anything else traditionally 
associated with the arrival of summer.</p>
<p>If you want a sure sign summer has fluttered into the bosom of East 
Tennessee, just watch for folks like Jean Steidle to grab a broom and start 
sweeping furiously.</p>
<p>This activity has nothing to do with dirt and dust removal. Rather, it involves 
de-bugging of the highest magnitude.</p>
<p>``They're just starting to hatch,'' said Steidle, who, with her husband Jerry, 
runs Blue Springs Boat Co. on Watts Bar Lake. ``I had to sweep a bunch of 
'em off the dock the other morning. It'll be this way for at least a couple of 
weeks, maybe a lot longer.''</p>
<p>``They'' are mayflies. And they're on the way by the multiplied millions.</p>
<p>But don't panic and grab the Raid. Except for regular sweep-ups of their 
dead bodies, these bugs aren't a problem. They're beautiful in appearance, 
with delicate, lacy wings and long, pointed tails. They don't sting, bite or 
nibble garden veggies. And if you don't live around water, you might not see 
them at all.</p>
<p>Mayflies are among the most common of all aquatic insects. According to 
TVA environmental technician Gary Williams, 622 separate species have 
been identified in the United States alone. They range in color from cream to 
yellow to green to brown, and in size from itty-bitty ones barely visible 
without bifocals all the way up to jumbos nearly three inches from stem to 
stern.</p>
<p>It is these big boys -- locally known as ``willow flies'' -- that cause the 
broom brigade to sweep into action. They generally are found along the 
Tennessee River system, particularly in Watts Bar and Nickajack reservoirs.</p>
<p>East Tennessee's willow flies have a lifespan of one year, Williams says. But 
humans only see them during their final 24 hours. The rest of their time is 
spent in developmental stages in sediment at the bottom of the lake. They 
emerge from the water as adults -- often by the tens of thousands, usually 
just before dark -- and expend every ounce of their energy in search of a 
mate. Then they kick the bucket, also en masse. That's where the brooms 
come in.</p>
<p>``In the adult stage, they don't have well-defined mouths or digestive 
systems,'' said Williams. ``They can't eat at all.''</p>
<p>They do, however, cling to everything in their path: limbs, leaves, rocks, 
houses, walls, boats, shirts, hats, faces, arms, whatever.</p>
<p>They also are attracted to bright light and will swarm in humongous clouds 
around street lights. I've seen hatches in downtown Kingston, within spitting 
distance of Watts Bar, that looked like they came from an Alfred Hitchcock 
movie. When these bugs died a few hours later, they covered the ground like 
fallen leaves.</p>
<p>``I haven't heard about many willow flies yet this year,'' said Mary Crowe, 
who works at City Hall in Kingston. ``But if they're hatching down the lake, 
it's just a matter of time before they get up here. Then we'll be crunching 
through them for awhile.''</p>
<p>Tell the folks in Ohio about it. A couple of nights ago near Toledo, a massive 
hatch of mayflies smothered a power plant, causing a brownout for 290,000 
homes and businesses.</p>
<p>Officials of the Toledo Edison plant said their equipment was so full of dead 
mayflies, the bugs themselves began conducting electricity from one to 
another. Several transformers shut down, and voltage dropped for upwards 
of 20 seconds.</p>
<p>I've never heard of a power interruption caused by mayflies around here. 
But several years ago, they did contribute to a big traffic accident near 
Kentucky Lake. There were so many dead and dying bugs on a bridge, the 
pavement became slick as ice, causing cars to slide into each other.</p>
<p>Those are ever-so-rare occurrences, of course. Most of the time, there's 
only one thing you really have to worry about in the thick of a willow fly 
hatch: Even though this is an awesome spectacle to witness, try to keep your 
mouth closed.</p>
<p>Unless you enjoy the taste of bugs.</p>

FOR AN ET FAMILY </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, Columnist</em></p>
<p>Sometime late Friday, when the last blast of fireworks echoes off the ridges 
of East Tennessee, the Simpsons and the Bolings and several dozen friends 
will go out to eat.</p>
<p>And try to regain their sanity.</p>
<p>``It'll be the first chance we get to rest,'' says Carrie Simpson.</p>
<p>Rest is a precious commodity for the Simpsons and the Bolings this time of 
year. It's the price they pay for being in the fireworks business during the 
July Fourth holidays.</p>
<p>Simpson oughta know. She represents the second of three Loudon County 
generations who sell things that go boom in the night.</p>
<p>Her father, Bert Boling, started the business in 1955, peddling firecrackers 
and bottle rockets from a portable stand at Dixie Lee Junction.</p>
<p>Over the years, the pace has, well, exploded. Sales today are made from 
one of four retail stores -- Bimbo's Fireworks World, Fireworks Factory 
Outlet, and Tennessee Fireworks Factory Outlet, all in Lenoir City, plus the 
West End Fireworks Factory Outlet at Dixie Lee Junction.</p>
<p>But it remains a family affair.</p>
<p>Bert Boling and wife, Jeannette, are still involved in the day-to-day 
operation. So are Carrie Simpson and her husband, Eddie; as well as their 
daughter, Stacie Smith, and her husband, Russell. Plus Carrie's brother, Ed 
Boling, and his wife, Charlotte. Plus their kids, Wendy and Greg. Plus 
Greg's wife, Marta. Plus Russell's sister, Morgan. Not to mention nearly 
three dozen full-time workers and at least that many part-timers during the 
Fourth of July season.</p>
<p>``Between June 20 and July 5, we do 75 percent of our year's retail 
business,'' said Simpson. ``On July 6, all we do is sleep.''</p>
<p>In case you haven't perused a fireworks store recently, please be advised 
these aren't your father's firecrackers anymore. The inventory looks, and 
reads, more like the lineup of an ammo depot at a military installation.</p>
<p>There are ``comets,'' ``rockets'' and ``mortars'' labeled with names like 
Whistling Buster, Nebula, Great Balls of Fire, Coconut Grove, Blue Inferno, 
Roaring Volcanoes, Cajun Jamboree, Jurassic War, Green Heaven, Fire 
and Thunder, Dyno Blaster and Hurricane. Just for starters.</p>
<p>At what price? You name it.</p>
<p>I walked the aisles at the Tennessee Fireworks Factory Outlet myownself 
and saw everything from ``Fire Ants'' for 25 cents a pack all the way up to 
the 38-item ``Block Party'' assortment pack priced at $249.99.</p>
<p>``People shop around a lot these days and compare prices,'' Simpson noted. 
``The market has gotten very competitive since the late 1980s.''</p>
<p>Take a look at major interstate exits around Knoxville and see for yourself. 
Fireworks can't be sold in Knox County, but merchants have been quick to 
set up shop just across the border, particularly at the Lenoir City exit of 
Interstate 75 and the Sevierville exit of Interstate 40.</p>
<p>Even though this is Crazy Week for fireworks sellers, there's enough 
business throughout the year to keep the lights on.</p>
<p>``We get a lot of tourist traffic,'' Simpson said. ``Plus, we stay busy in the 
wholesale line, too.''</p>
<p>Most of the stock comes from China, the rest from Texas. In 1986, 
Simpson and her brother, along with their spouses, spent 10 days in China 
lining up suppliers.</p>
<p>The hundreds of thousands of cracklers, flashers, sparklers and boomers 
East Tennesseans will ignite this holiday season began their journey toward 
the United States in January. They reached Lenoir City in May.</p>
<p>``When a truck shows up, the whole family turns out to unload it,'' said 
Stacie Smith. ``It might be 1,500 to 2,000 cases. Everybody pitches in. It 
takes about three hours.''</p>
<p>I had to ask: Does this family celebrate special occasions with fireworks?</p>
<p>``We sure do,'' Smith replied. ``When Russell was still in the military and we 
were headed for Hawaii, they threw a big party for us. Somebody lit a roll of 
16,000 firecrackers. They kept going off for nearly half an hour.''</p>

SPOTTED, AS IS GATLINBURG </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, Columnist</em></p>
<p>All around East Tennessee:</p>
<p>* I don't know if it's a case of humans moving into wildlife land or vice versa, 
but there's no doubt the people and the critters are seeing a lot more of each 
other around here.</p>
<p>A caller recently told me about glimpsing a red fox in Sequoyah Hills. Not 
long before that, another Sequoyah Hills resident told me about watching a 
sharp-shinned hawk nab a squirrel dinner right off a tree limb.</p>
<p>Deer are getting more and more plentiful all around the town; who hasn't 
seen them browsing along Pellissippi Parkway? And Canada geese! We're 
up to our collective shins in them. Just ask anyone who lives on or near the 
water -- or a golf course. Yes, the people wearing green shoes.</p>
<p>But the strangest wildlife encounter I've heard all year comes from Nelson 
Ross.</p>
<p>And I mean ``heard'' literally.</p>
<p>Ross, senior advancement officer at Carson-Newman College, lives just 
outside Jefferson City. About two weeks ago, he was awakened by the 
squalls of a cat. Not some kitty-kitty from across the street, either. We are 
talking bobcat.</p>
<p>A few nights later, Mr. Stubtail returned, and Ross was ready. He stuck a 
tape recorder out the window and captured the sounds. The recording was 
crisp and clear when he played it back to me over the phone.</p>
<p>``I believe if I'd left the tape running, I could have recorded him for 20 
minutes,'' Nelson told me. Not content to merely capture the sounds, Ross 
then tiptoed outside and shined a spotlight on the cat.</p>
<p>``I was within 40 yards of him,'' Ross said. ``The light didn't seem to bother 
him at all. He stared back at me for awhile, then nonchalantly stepped under 
a rail fence and walked away. He stopped once more, broadside this time, 
and gave me a good long look. It was a real thrill for me. When I came back 
inside, my wife asked what would I have done if the cat started walking 
toward me.</p>
<p>``I thought a minute and said, `I reckon I'd climb a tree.' But then I 
remembered cats can climb too. So I said, `I reckon I'd hit him with my 
flashlight.' ''</p>
<p>Kids, don't try this at home.</p>
<p>* The tourist city of Gatlinburg got a glowing review recently from a 
newspaper columnist in another mecca for visitors. In fact, Bo Poertner, 
local columnist for the Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel, said his region could learn 
some valuable pointers from the folks in G'burg.</p>
<p>``Gatlinburg could teach Daytona Beach and Volusia County some lessons 
about how to make the most of its natural beauty -- as well as its history -- 
to attract family tourists,'' he wrote in the June 11 edition.</p>
<p>``Gatlinburg wraps itself in its natural surroundings. The town of 3,400 
stretches along two miles of the Little Pigeon River and is cuddled on the 
southern end of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Dogwood trees 
and flower planters line the main street. The northern entrance to Gatlinburg 
is breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p>``Contrast that to the main entrance to Daytona Beach -- sprawling 
International Speedway Boulevard with its tangle of restaurants, shops and 
gas stations. Gatlinburg has restaurants, shops and gas stations, but they 
weave unobtrusively into the town's fabric with landscaping and sign 
restrictions.</p>
<p>``In addition to appealing appearance, Gatlinburg gives families a reason to 
come to town and stay awhile . . . . Daytona Beach, content for so many 
years to exploit Bike Week, college spring break and auto racing, has been 
slow to respond to the enormous potential of family tourism.''</p>
<p>Kind words. Of course, Bo didn't mention The Burg's legendary traffic jams, 
its tacky tourist shops or that embarrassing little matter of restrictions against 
swimming, fishing and wading in the Little Pigeon because of bacterial 
pollution from sewers.</p>
<p>But hey, who's worried about details?</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>July 7, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>BOTH SHEER BRAWN AND TINY CHISELS NEEDED FOR THIS ART </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, Columnist</em></p>
You surely debated this question in grade school: If a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, does it make any noise?<P>

   I'm not going to wade into that fray. It has been argued, without resolve, by scholarly minds far too long. But I will propose a secondary question and give you an ironclad answer:<P>

   When the tree falls a second time, how much noise does it make?<P>

   A lot. Mostly unprintable.<P>

   I learned this truth the other day in Sevier County when I dropped in to watch Mike Copas and Barry Simpson at work.<P>

   Copas and Simpson are two talented woodcarvers whose commissioned pieces command thousands of dollars. To hear them tell it, their art is simple to create. They just take a block of wood and cut off the stuff that doesn't belong. Yes, and winning the Super Bowl is simply a matter of throwing a football.<P>

   At the present time, Copas is engaged in a life-sized statue of an African crowned eagle. The piece was commissioned by a physician in Ohio and will take 18 months to complete. It's being rendered from a walnut log that stands 4 feet tall and measures 40 inches in diameter.<P>

   Copas cut this log from an 8-footer he purchased from a lumberyard in Bryson City, N.C. Getting it across the mountain to Sevier County was an experience he isn't likely to forget.<P>

   ``Jeff Price, a friend of mine, has a pickup truck, and he agreed to help me get that log, plus a basswood log,'' said Copas. ``I don't think either of us realized how heavy they were.''<P>

   At the lumberyard, it took a forklift to seat the logs into the truck. Then they started back to Tennessee, weaving slowly through tourist traffic in Cherokee, N.C. The trip up steep, winding Highway 441 was even slower.<P>

   ``We started smelling that delightful `mechanical aroma' just before we got to Newfound Gap,'' Copas chuckled. ``When we started down the Tennessee side, the truck was pretty much on its own.''<P>

   No harm done, though. Price was able to jockey the rig safely all way to Copas' driveway.<P>

   A looong, steeep driveway.<P>

   ``I told Jeff to really hit it, or we'd never make it to the top,'' said Copas.<P>

   So done. Copas and Price and the truck arrived at the summit just fine.<P>

   Unfortunately, the two logs -- not to mention the truck's tailgate and the bedliner -- stayed behind, amid much clattering and banging.<P>

   ``I had to hook a chain to 'em and drag 'em into place with a backhoe,'' said Copas. ``I cut the walnut log in two, and then had to wait until four or five guys came over so I could stand it up on end and start working on it.''<P>

   Copas whacked out the general scene with a chainsaw and now is engaged in more subtle wood removal with various gouges and chisels. Before the project is complete, he'll be doing details with tiny tools not much larger than a toothpick.<P>

   Copas hasn't named this piece yet. But based on his description of what happened that day, perhaps something on the order of ``The Eagle Has Landed'' might be appropriate.<P>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>July 9, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>BATTERY INDICATOR CREATES 
INVENTIVE IDEA FOR FOOD, ETC. </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, Columnist</em></p>
<p>One of the hottest new items on the market today is a flashlight battery with 
a built-in tester, right on the side.</p>
<p>According to advertisements I've seen, all you've gotta do is squeeze a 
button on the battery, then read the gauge. It supposedly gives you an 
indication, in percentages, of the battery's expected life.</p>
<p>I haven't tried one yet, but the theory sounds good. It means no more 
surprises in flashlights, radios, cameras, games, toys and the jillions of other 
devices powered by AAA's, AA's, C's, D's and others of their ilk.</p>
<p>(Hmmm. Then again, maybe the cure is worse than the ailment. In the old 
days, we flicked a flashlight on to see if the batteries were charged. It was an 
alpha-or-omega affair. If the thing worked, we pronounced the batteries 
healthy and didn't replace them. If it didn't work, we threw out the old 
batteries and bought replacements. Under this new system, however, we'll 
have to wonder if, say, 50 percent is good enough to keep, as opposed to 
27 percent or 78 percent. Why does life have to be so complicated?)</p>
<p>In any event, this is a step in the right direction. I just hope researchers come 
up with other items that have built-in gauges to help us shop more wisely.</p>
<p>Food is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Right now, most food products come complete with a nutrition label listing 
fat content, calories, essential vitamins and minerals and other numbers 
which, allegedly, help consumers make healthy choices.</p>
<p>Big deal. This information, however factual, has lost its impact. We shoppers 
have become numb to charts and lists. We need something with flash and 
color.</p>
<p>Like a Fat-O-Gauge.</p>
<p>You pick up a box of chocolate chip cookies and squeeze a button on the 
side. Immediately, it shows the percentage increase in your waistline if you 
nibble the contents. On more advanced models, two images of your body 
might appear on the back -- one before eating the cookies, one after. Now 
that's effective consumer information!</p>
<p>The same concept could be incorporated into clothing.</p>
<p>Presently, there is no device to prevent the sale of hideous garments to 
irresponsible adults. We walk into a store and try on a loud, obnoxious sport 
coat. It looks dashing. We buy it.</p>
<p>But when we get home and model it for the rest of the family, disaster 
strikes. Our spouse faints, and the kids run out the door screaming, 
``Aaaaaiiiiee! The other kids will laugh at me for months!''</p>
<p>Not with the Nerd-O-Gauge.</p>
<p>Just slip the coat on, press the button and -- voila! -- it shows your GQ 
(Geek Quotient) in big, bold numbers. Press the button again, and it lets you 
see yourself in the coat through the eyes of everyone else.</p>
<p>This is going to take some fine-tuning, of course. Something to tone down 
the harsh realities.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the food and clothing industries could dry up overnight.</p>

PUT IN THE ROUND FILE </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, Columnist</em></p>
<p>If someone offered me a mountain of money through the mail -- iron-clad, 
no strings attached, all perfectly legal -- I probably wouldn't take it.</p>
<p>And I bet you wouldn't, either.</p>
<p>Not that we're allergic to cash, for goodness sakes. Far from it. Once we 
realized we had blown a chance at millions of bucks, you and I would quite 
likely wind up kicking ourselves to bloody pulps.</p>
<p>But that's the problem. We have become so numbed by offers of instant 
riches through the mail these days, we don't take any of them seriously.</p>
<p>I got to thinking about this peculiarity of modern living earlier this week when 
I went to the mailbox and, for the 10,001st time, extracted a sweepstakes 
envelope. It swore up and down that a pile of money -- nearly three million 
dollars -- was sitting in a bank vault, just waiting for the Venables to walk up 
and claim it.</p>
<p>Naturally, I pitched the letter into the trash.</p>
<p>The next day, I happened to be visiting some friends, Gene and Anne 
Horner, in Cumberland County. Their mail arrived as we were talking. Sure 
enough, they also received a sweepstakes letter. It was from a different 
company than the one I'd heard from. Apparently a much poorer company. 
The Horners were only offered a paltry one million dollars.</p>
<p>It also went into the round file.</p>
<p>``If I can't get the full three million they offered you,'' Gene mused, ``I ain't 
takin' anything.''</p>
<p>See what I mean?</p>
<p>It's not just sweepstakes letters. It's virtually any envelope we get that 
doesn't bear first-class postage. Americans have grown so accustomed to 
shoveling bulk-rate manure from their mailboxes -- offering ``free'' cars, 
``free'' luxury vacations, ``free'' boats -- they probably wouldn't recognize a 
legitimate letter if it hit them over the head.</p>
<p>Case in point: In the fall of 1993, President and Mrs. Clinton invited several 
thousand crafters to create handmade ornaments for the White House 
Christmas tree. This request was genuine. There was nothing politically 
partisan about it. The letters came on official White House stationary and 
gave specific instructions about what size the ornament could be, how to 
ship it, deadlines and other necessary information.</p>
<p>I interviewed several whittlers, weavers, carvers, stitchers and other talented 
folks who were asked to submit ornaments. Almost to the person, they told 
me that when their particular letter arrived, they thought it was some kind of 
sleight-of-hand involving fund raising. Not until they read, and re-read, the 
fine print, did they start to think it wasn't bogus.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how, or when, this postal cynicism began. Are we simply wiser 
in the ways of the world these days? Or were mailings more honest Back 
Then?</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, I know it wasn't always this way, particularly for young 
men of my generation. When we got a form letter from the government that 
started out, ``Greetings,'' we knew it was for real.</p>

<p>Carson Brewer, who can fit a yard of story into an inch of space, wrote the 
definitive sentence on Jesse Butcher in 1984:</p>
<p>``Jesse would choke if he couldn't talk.''</p>
<p>Seven words. Perfect description.</p>
<p>Jesse Butcher had to talk, by golly, and he did it well. Whether there was a 
story to tell, a joke to pass on, advice to impart, or your basic good-morning 
howdy, Jesse was never at a loss for something to say. Usually funny. I 
guarantee that when his many friends gather for graveside services this 
morning, their ``Jesse tales'' will flow right along with their tears.</p>
<p>But as deeply as we shall miss Jesse, who died Wednesday at 81, we 
cannot linger in sorrow.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is cause to rejoice because Jesse's suffering has finally ended. 
Cancer had been consuming him for years. Slowly, painfully, that wretched 
disease took a mountain of a man and reduced him to a bed-ridden 
skeleton.</p>
<p>Even as his strength ebbed, though, Jesse never lost his sense of humor or 
his infectious wit.</p>
<p>``The doc asked me the other day what I'd been eating,'' he said during one 
of our visits. ``I told him hamburgers and beer.</p>
<p>`` `Hamburgers and beer!' he hollered. `That's not what I told you! It'll make 
you sick!' I said, `Sure, it makes me sick. But the stuff you told me to eat 
makes me sick, too -- and it don't taste near as good as hamburgers and 
beer!' ''</p>
<p>I spent quite a bit of time at Jesse's house over the last few years. 
Photographer Paul Efird and I are working on a book about Southern 
Appalachian people, and Jesse was the first to be interviewed. During those 
sessions, I discovered a man who left his mark on the hills and valleys of this 
region in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>As a game warden for the old Tennessee Game and Fish Commission, Jesse 
was the arresting officer in a landmark case that worked its way to the 
Tennessee Supreme Court and set the standard for search and seizure in 
wildlife law enforcement. ``That was an expensive victory,'' he quipped. ``It 
took forever for the case to get through the courts. By the time it ended, the 
state had spent more money storing the car I'd confiscated than we got for it 
at the auction.''</p>
<p>After service to the wildlife agency, Jesse went on to a long and successful 
career as an automobile salesman. Not surprising, given his gift of gab. Yet 
one of his most vivid memories from that era was quite painful:</p>
<p>``The only thing I ever regretted was when I sold this young boy a '57 
Chevy. It was loaded. Had a big V-8 engine, stick shift, the works. I sold it 
to him at 2 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon, and he was killed at 8 that 
night. Drag-racing at 100 miles per hour. I mean to tell you, that bothered 
me for a long, long time.''</p>
<p>Jesse's greatest claim to fame came later in life, literally by accident.</p>
<p>In 1977, he was helping a friend cut locust poles. He slipped and fell. The 
chainsaw landed on his right wrist, leaving little more than a bloody stub. 
After emergency surgery came a lengthy period of rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Doctors had one idea. Jesse had another.</p>
<p>``They had me a-squeezin' Play-Doh,'' he said. ``There ain't much future in 
that.''</p>
<p>Jesse and his wife, Roxine, enrolled in the Joe L. Evins Craft Center near 
Smithville and began weaving baskets with a passion. Through the years, 
they created many beautiful, museum-quality pieces of folk art.</p>
<p>I don't know exactly what the hereafter is like, but I'm laying good money on 
this:</p>
<p>Somewhere outside the central business district, where the streets of gold 
turn to gravel, where hymns from the heavenly choir fade and a chorus of 
beagle music swells, where purple martins flit around gourd houses and 
crickets chirp and a cold watermelon awaits the knife, there's going to be a 
shade tree and several stumps for sitting and some white oak splits soaking 
in a bucket of water. And right there amongst the bib-overalled angels will 
be Jesse Butcher, telling a story and making 'em laugh.</p>

<HEAD><TITLE>IN RUSSIAN PLAN, COULD MUDSLINGING BE TAX-DEDUCTIBLE?</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>July 16, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>IN RUSSIAN PLAN, COULD MUDSLINGING BE TAX-DEDUCTIBLE?</H2>

The leader of one of the Russian republics has come up with a fund-raising plan that's so brilliant, I'm amazed nobody Over Here has copied it.<P>

   This man's name is Mentimer Shaimiyev. He is the president of Tatarstan. He has deemed it illegal to insult him.<P>

   No, I am not making this up. I read about it the other day in a news dispatch from Russia.<P>

   ``The president can be criticized,'' said the ITAR-Tass news agency, ``but he must not be insulted.''<P>

   First offenders are subject to a fine of $800, roughly 20 times the monthly minumum wage. Fines for repeat offenders can range as high as $1,400. Newspapers and magazines that report an insult can be assessed upwards of $6,000, plus have their offensive publications confiscated.<P>

   Can you imagine what would happen if this became law in the United States?<P>

   We'd have no national debt, that's what. Woosh! It would be gone inside of two months, and the nation's coffers would start gushing leftover funds like an Oklahoma oil well.<P>

   Never mind that our deficit has been multiplying, kajillions of dollars a minute, since George Washington and Bob Dole played together as little boys. Once President Shaimiyev's plan went into effect, the United States could set up permanent housekeeping on Easy Street.<P>

   Consider ``Slick Willie,'' an insult President Bill Clinton has had to endure since he was governor of Arkansas. It covers a multitude of alleged sins -- from sexual hanky-panky to questionable financial deals to political flip-flops.<P>

   You know an insult like that makes the Prez flinch. Yet there's nothing he can do but grin and bear it.<P>

   Until now.<P>

   Get out your pocket calculator and start figuring how much ``Slick Willie'' money would flow into the Treasury under the Shaimiyev rule.<P>

   On second thought, forget a pocket calculator. It doesn't have near the capacity for this type of computation. We'll need something much larger for the job -- like the computer Congress uses when doling out mega-billions in pork barrel projects.<P>

   And that's just for one insult. Try to imagine the implications across the board, Republican and Democrat, as the 1996 presidential race heats up this summer. Boggles the mind, doesn't it?<P>

   Once the two sides start paying to sling dirt at each other, there won't be a bank vault big enough to hold all the money. Not to mention how much more will pile up in gutters and alleys when radio talk show hosts, the tabloids and everyone else in the media -- ``legitimate'' or otherwise -- ante up. There won't be one red cent left in America!<P>

   Saaay, wait a minute. Maybe this isn't such a hot idea after all. What's the use of paying off the national debt if it bankrupts us in the process?<P>

   We'll all wind up out of work, on welfare, no homes, no groceries, no clothes, no hope for the future.<P>

   Get used to ``Slick Willie,'' Mister President. Better you than us.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>WHERE GORDON SISK TRODS, THE RAIN IS CERTAIN TO SPLATTER</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>July 18, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>WHERE GORDON SISK TRODS, THE RAIN IS CERTAIN TO SPLATTER</H2>

Forget what you heard on TV about Atlantic storm patterns, cold fronts, warm fronts, prevailing winds and other meteorological gibberish.<P>

   The real reason Hurricane Bertha turned abruptly and headed north up the Eastern seaboard the other day is because Gordon Sisk lured it.<P>

   ``When is the last time you heard about a hurricane in Washington, D.C.?'' Sisk asked over the telephone as rain fell outside his dormitory room. ``Need I say more?''<P>

   Sisk is an American history teacher at Knoxville's Central High School who literally brings his subject to life. You've probably seen him, dressed in period clothing, playing the role of James White at various civic functions.<P>

   Sisk is in Washington this summer to work on his master's degree. He's enrolled in the American University, studying the U.S. Constitution on a James Madison Memorial Foundation fellowship.<P>

   This is no picnic. It's a high-pressure course with 200 or so pages of text to consume every night, plus a lengthy paper due every week. It's designed to teach the teachers more about the most important document in our system of government.<P>

   The James Madison fellowship is paying for Sisk's study in dollars, and Washingtonians are paying for his presence in wetness. Just ask anyone who knows him: Wherever Gordon Sisk goes, the rain is sure to follow.<P>

   That's because he is a charter member of Team Rainmaker.<P>

   ``We ought to rent ourselves out to farmers in Texas,'' said Sisk. ``We can end a drought anywhere.''<P>

   Team Rainmaker is a group of Central teachers who go hiking and backpacking together. Except in this case, it's more like doing the backstroke in boots. The others -- who have long since grown accustomed to being wet behind the ears, not to mention other body parts -- are Alvah Bible (health and phys ed), John Miller (business) and Lynn Hill (science).<P>

   For six years, Team Rainmaker has been whittling away at the Appalachian Trail. The guys manage to hike a new section of the famed Georgia-to-Maine path every year -- a pace, Sisk estimates, that should take them 35 years to wrap up the entire journey.<P>

   ``We started at Springer Mountain, Ga., during a Christmas vacation,'' Sisk recalled. ``We were on a three-day hike, and it either rained or sleeted every day.''<P>

   That pretty much set the agenda for future outings. It took portions of three consecutive Christmas vacations to complete the Georgia leg of the AT, Sisk said, and it rained at least part of every day they were out.<P>

   ``That first trip was pretty rough,'' he added. ``We've all gotten a lot better gear since then. If anyone wants to field test a Gore-Tex coat or boots, they oughta come with us.<P>

   ``We did four days through Tennessee earlier this summer. It rained every day. On two of those days, we really got hammered.''<P>

   Even when they're not on the Appalachian Trail, these guys can cause the weather to mess up. On a winter outing to the Big South Fork River and Recreation Area, they endured one night when the mercury dipped to 20 below.<P>

   ``We took a picture of me holding an egg I had just cracked and tried to cook,'' he said. ``The egg is just hanging there, full of crystals.''<P>

   Although Hurricane Bertha is now little more than a wet, expensive memory to folks up and down the Eastern United States, I caution those living in the Washington area to not relax their guard. Sisk doesn't finish his classes until early August, so there's plenty of time for a second dose.<P>

   Which begs another question: If Sisk is responsible for the deluge Up There, how come the drought also broke Down Here?<P>

   ``Simple,'' he replied. ``Somebody on Team Rainmaker probably went camping.''<P>

<TD WIDTH=470><H2>RESEARCHERS COULD USE A LIST OF THINGS WORTH RESEARCHING</H2>

<i>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel writer</i><p>

What do Southern white men think when they read about an experiment that supposedly measures their ``honor and integrity?''<P>

   They think the people who conduct hokey experiments ought to find honest work.<P>

   At least that's the opinion of the Southern white man who is writing this column.<P>

   Perhaps you saw an account of the experiment. It appeared on the front page of The News-Sentinel last Tuesday and has been the talk around town ever since.<P>

   The test was conducted at the University of Michigan under the direction of psychologist Richard Nisbett. Here's how it worked:<P>

   Male students were asked to fill out a questionnaire, then take it to a table at the end of a narrow hallway. En route to the table, though, their path was blocked by another guy working at a file cabinet. (A Southern white male question: What kind of moron would put a file cabinet in a narrow hallway in the first place?)<P>

   The file cabinet person closed the drawer and let the student pass. On the return trip, however, the file guy acted mad about having to close his drawer again. He slammed it shut, bumped the student with his shoulder and called him ``an insulting, scatological name.'' (Another Southern white male question: Did it rhyme with ``elbow'' or ``nithead''?)<P>

   When the student completed the trip, his saliva was checked to see if there was an increase in testosterone. (Yet another Southern white male question: Is that where testosterone comes from? Aiiiiiiii!)<P>

   The results: Southerners showed a 12 percent increase in testosterone. Northerners showed none.<P>

   And that, according to the learned Yankee scientists, proves Southern white men are quicker to react to save their ``honor and integrity'' than Northern white men.<P>

   Horse puckey. This test proves nothing of the kind. On the contrary, it proves Northern white men have neither the desire nor the glands, salivary or otherwise, required for this function.<P>

   Southern white men have long known this truth. If Southern white men had not moved north in vast numbers during the Industrial Revolution and married Northern white women, Northern whites would have surely perished from the face of the planet. True, this diluted the purity of Southern white blood, but because we are people of great honor and integrity, we seen our duty and we done it.<P>

   This experiment wasn't even necessary; the researchers acknowledged as much. They noted that Southern white men are not accustomed to public displays of impolite behavior like the hallway scene, ``whereas it may be part of everyday rudeness in the North.''<P>

   Do tell.<P>

   Those learned Yankee scientists want to know what provokes ALL males -- Southern, Northern, Eastern, Western, white, black and everything in between?<P>

   It's wasting good time and money trying to prove the obvious.<P>

<TD WIDTH=470><H2>POLITICAL PARTIES PROVIDE PLENTY OF POPULAR POSITIONS</H2>

<i>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel writer</i><p>

What we have here is history in the making.<P>

   In a show of bipartisanship not seen in half a century, the Republicans and the Democrats are working hand-in-hand to create jobs.<P>

   This joint effort isn't on a huge scale yet, but just give it time. If the present trend continues, unemployment will completely disappear before the November elections.<P>

   I speak, of course, of the giant labor pool that will have to be tapped to provide dress-up characters for political rallies.<P>

   The Democrats launched this novel concept with Chicken George in the 1992 campaign. Mocking incumbent President George Bush for his reluctance to debate, they dressed someone up in a chicken outfit and had him walk through the audience whenever Bush made an appearance.<P>

   It was a brilliant move. As anyone trained in hard-hitting sound bite journalism will tell you, a goof in feathers makes better news than some bore who drones ceaselessly about crime, the economy, defense spending, blah-blah-blah. Chicken George attracted abundant TV attention and cost Bush a number of votes.<P>

   Playing on that success, the Democrats unveiled Butt Man in 1996. A guy dressed up like a cigarette shadows Bob Dole at every appearance, ridiculing his claim that cigarettes aren't necessarily addictive.<P>

   No dummies, the Republicans came up with Reefer Man, who, one party official said, symbolizes ``the failure of the Clinton administration and state Democrats to address the explosion of illicit drugs . . . ''<P>

   Don't you see where this is going? Of course you do. And I'm sure that employment agencies, placement services, temp businesses and other companies who supply personnel for the job market see it too. As we speak, they are furiously building inventories.<P>

   Any day now, I look for Gun Man to start accompanying Butt Man at GOP events and ridicule the Republicans for their efforts to repeal the assault weapons ban. A few days later, the Republicans will unveil Bullet Hole Man to show what happens to innocent victims of crime when they aren't allowed to protect themselves.<P>

   Or perhaps the Republicans will take the initiative by suiting up Red Tape Man to underscore the Democrats' fondness for regulations. This would be countered by Iron Lung Man to mock the Republicans for dragging their feet on clean air legislation.<P>

   The new concept isn't limited to men, by any means. The Republicans can send Aborted Baby into the fray to do battle with the Democrats' Pregnant Woman. And both parties could mine the rich depths of the national debt issue by running Poverty Child into the crowd.<P>

   Trust me. This thing can't miss. By the time nominations begin, entire delegations of costumed characters will be tripping over themselves in convention halls.<P>

   Get in on the ground floor of this wonderful investment opportunity, folks. Start buying costume stocks today.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>EVEN PRESIDENTS CAN HAVE TROUBLE GETTING THE SHOT</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="News-Sentinel Online" width=578 height=167></center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>July 25, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>EVEN PRESIDENTS CAN HAVE TROUBLE GETTING THE SHOT</H2>

Anybody who ever picked up a camera and flubbed the chance for a great photograph can sympathize with Bill Clinton.<P>

   The president's latest predicament -- the latest one that doesn't involve political, legal or ethical matters, I should say -- happened during the opening ceremonies of the Olympics in Atlanta.<P>

   Like most of the 83,000 in attendance, Hizzoner shot a bunch of pictures of the festivities. Unlike the other 83,000, however, he didn't have to take his film to a supermarket, a photo shop or a 24-hour developing service.<P>

   Instead, White House aides asked the Associated Press to process it for him. The AP jumped at the chance, figuring on being able to transmit one of The Prez's pictures.<P>

   Nope. The film was blank.<P>

   Apparently the leader -- the narrow end of the film that fits into the winder doo-hickey, as they say in the darkroom -- didn't engage. As a result, the film didn't advance. While President Clinton snapped away, thinking he was capturing the pageantry in 35-millimeter units, his film stayed happily coiled in its container.<P>

   Mr. Clinton shouldn't feel bad. Hundreds of thousands of photographers, professional and amateur alike, have suffered similar fates. These folks will tell you a pesky glitch can occur any time, any place, even with an automatic camera.<P>

   If it's not the film advance, it's the wrong f-stop. Or failure to change the ASA when switching from black and white to color. This truism is inevitable. It's the photographic version of Murphy's Law.<P>

   Which leads to another truism about graphic goofs: They never happen with a run-of-the-mill opportunity. Invariably, it's when a once-in-a-million chance comes along.<P>

   ``I did it on my mother and father's 50th wedding anniversary,'' confessed Ed Thompson of Thompson Photo Products. ``I guess I was excited, just like the president. I forgot to make sure the film was advancing. It wasn't.''<P>

   Gary Heatherly has been there, done that, too. On a recent trip to the Virgin Islands, he photographed a spectacular sunrise. At least that's what he thought. Returning to his Knoxville studio, Heatherly discovered he was a victim of Clintonitis: No film advance.<P>

   Jack Rose also knows the feeling. He was shooting for the Associated Press during Johnny Majors' last season as head football coach at the University of Tennessee.<P>

   The Vols lost a game, and as the team filed back into the locker room, a disgruntled fan showered Majors with a cup of ice. Rose was the only news photographer to capture the ugly incident.<P>

   ``I made the mistake of saying I had the picture before I looked at my negatives,'' Rose said.<P>

   Oh, he had it all right. Unfortunately, it was blurred and unusable. That's because Jack had forgotten to take his camera off the auto-focus function he'd been using to shoot the game.<P>

   You're not alone, Mr. President. When it comes to camera calamities, we all feel your pain.<P>

<TD WIDTH=470><H2>TV COVERAGE OF OLYMPICS BRINGS THOUGHTS ON ADS</H2>

Olympic thoughts as we stay glued to the tube for more delayed broadcasts:<P>

   * As dramatic as the athletic feats are, I find myself enjoying some of the commercials almost as much. This is a summer version of the Super Bowl.<P>

   Delta, Coke, Wheaties and Bell South Mobility have produced some gems. But my favorite has to be the one featuring ``Pretzel Boy.''<P>

   You know what's awful, though? I can't tell you the brand name of those pretzels. Conversely, I do remember the brand name involved with the worst commercials I've seen. It's Nissan and those stupid ``Smile'' and ``Drive Happy'' bits.<P>

   Such results are the kind that send Madison Avenue executives into screaming fits. And off window sills.<P>

   * Speaking of seizures, can you imagine the corporate/civic angst if that spectacular opening ceremony had been rained out?<P>

   Or if, gasp, Dream Team III keeps playing un-Dream Teamish and actually gets whipped?<P>

   * One more time on commercials: People who've lived in the Tennessee Valley for any length of time can't miss the hypocrisy of TVA's self-serving advertisement.<P>

   You've surely seen it -- the one where foreign canoeists and kayakers cry out for ``water'' in their native tongue and then are rewarded with a plume of whitewater flowing down the Ocoee.<P>

   It takes unmitigated gall for TVA to brag about its role in supplying this resource.<P>

   Twenty years ago, that same agency fought whitewater enthusiasts tooth and toenail. Cooperation with the 1996 Olympics notwithstanding, TVA had to be bashed over the head before it grudgingly recognized the economic value of whitewater recreation.<P>

   For that matter, shouldn't the Forest Service share some of the glory for designing the Ocoee River course? Certainly. But I suppose the Forest Service doesn't have the money to spend on high-dollar commercials.<P>

   * You know you're getting old when the television cameras sweep across the audience and you can relate more to the parents, nervously biting their lips and wringing their hands, than you can to the athletes out there on the floor.<P>

   * I trust Atlantans are holding up under the strain of this event as they try to lead ``normal'' lifestyles.<P>

   I have an aunt who lives there. She told me she's treating the Olympics like a major snowstorm: Stock up on groceries, stay home, watch TV, and ride it out.<P>

   * Van Michael of Sweetwater is in the Olympic spirit in more ways than one. He thinks East Tennesseans might have missed a great opportunity to hold a parallel event.<P>

   ``While the rays of the sun over Mount Olympus kindle the Olympic flame which is carried to symbolize the spirit of competition, it occurs to me that the rising of the moon over Max Patch would also kindle spirits in Cocke County,'' he says. ``This spirit, while it might fill a torch, might be better preserved and contained with a cork.<P>

   ``The vessel could be carried, by people who truly appreciate that spirit, to Knoxville by the scenic route through such major cities as Del Rio, Carson Springs, Chestnut Hill and Seymour. There could be a salutation as the spirit is passed from runner to runner or, as the case may be, walker to walker, until its arrival at the site of the games in Knoxville.<P>

   ``Just as the Olympic torch is shepherded by a mother of the flame in the event the torch is somehow quenched, the spirit of Cocke County could be accompanied by a sufficient supply to refuel the vessel should it become empty as it weaves its way to Knoxville. Upon its arrival, it could be a symbol brought to the stand where it could be used to fuel a flame, but that would be a horrible waste. I would suggest that it be liberally dispensed among those in attendance so that all who attend could truly enjoy the spirit of the summer games.''<P>

   I'll drink to that. With or without the pretzels.<P>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>July 30, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>TERRELL BURKHART IS A CHAMPION 
IN SPITE OF PROBLEMS </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>There are two reasons why Terrell Burkhart can be called Knoxville's official 
Iron Man.</p>
<p>First, he swept the overall competition in the 1996 Jake and Venob's 
Summer Games, a series of fund-raising tournaments cartoonist Jake Vest 
and I host each year for the Helen Ross McNabb Mental Health Center.</p>
<p>To win the championship, Burkhart posted the best all-around score of 463 
participants in sporting clays, bass fishing and golf.</p>
<p>But the second, and far more important, reason Burkhart can be considered 
a man of steel is because that's exactly what he's carrying around in his 
body.</p>
<p>We are talking Mr. Metal here. When this guy goes through an airport, the 
bells and whistles can be heard for miles. He is not the ideal person to be 
standing beside when lightning starts tickling the heavens.</p>
<p>You see, Terrell has a pair of 71/2-inch steel rods in his back, along with the 
necessary pins and hooks to hold them in place. They'll be with him for the 
rest of his life.</p>
<p>Not a pleasant situation, perhaps. But in light of the perilous alternatives he 
faced last September 22, Burkhart considers himself a very fortunate 
person.</p>
<p>Burkhart was in Jackson County, preparing for the upcoming archery season 
for deer. He and his brother-in-law, Steve Bell, were hanging their tree 
stands.</p>
<p>``We'd been at it all day, and I guess I was getting tired,'' said Burkhart, 44, 
purchasing manager for TVA.</p>
<p>``I had climbed a big white oak, about 22 feet up, and when I snapped my 
safety belt in place, I hooked it into a plastic ring instead of the metal one. 
When I put my weight against it to start working on the stand, the ring 
broke, and I went out of the tree.''</p>
<p>It was one of those good news/bad news situations.</p>
<p>``I didn't hit any limbs on the way down and I didn't get knocked 
unconscious,'' he said.</p>
<p>``Unfortunately, that enabled me to realize just how badly I was hurt. I could 
feel this tingling sensation all through my body. I was scared to death I'd 
been paralyzed.''</p>
<p>Burkhart was more than two miles from a paved road. He and his 
brother-in-law made the decision to try to get out of the woods rather than 
wait for help.</p>
<p>``It probably wasn't the smartest thing to do. We both knew it could lead to 
further damage to my back. But it was so remote where we were, there was 
no way they could have even gotten a helicopter in to get me out.''</p>
<p>Bell managed to lash his brother-in-law backwards to a 4-wheeler, 
supporting his back against the vehicle's carrying frame.</p>
<p>Ever-so-slowly, they traveled about one mile through the rugged terrain until 
other buddies arrived with a 4-wheel-drive truck. They transported Burkhart 
to a small hospital in Gainesboro. From there, he went by ambulance to UT 
Medical Center.</p>
<p>``I was in a lot of pain by that time, but they couldn't give me anything until 
they figured out how much damage I had,'' he said.</p>
<p>Burkhart underwent surgery and remained in the hospital for 10 days.</p>
<p>``I've got a fine wife,'' he said. ``Carolyn stayed with me night and day. I 
couldn't have made it without her.''</p>
<p>Burkhart's recovery has been just shy of miraculous.</p>
<p>He was back at work, full-time, the week of Thanksgiving and was released 
from the doctor's care by mid-December. Shortly after Christmas, he 
resumed playing golf and hunting deer -- from a lower elevation.</p>
<p>``My brother-in-law found a place where I could sit on the ground,'' he said. 
``I got a 4-pointer that day.''</p>
<p>Any lingering effects from the ordeal?</p>
<p>``I do get a little tired if I stand too long,'' Burkhart said, ``but after a couple 
of Advils, I'm fine.''</p>

DAYS: START BAILING </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>Gather around, children, and let Uncle Venob tell you what it was like 
before the monsoons arrived.</p>
<p>Yes, children, Uncle Venob realizes this news comes as a surprise to your 
young ears, but there was a time when East Tennessee was not a tropical 
rain forest. Strange as it may seem, moss and mildew did not grow on our 
walls. Nor did mushrooms and waist-high grass flourish in our yards.</p>
<p>Instead, we grew dust.</p>
<p>Can you spell that word, children? D-u-s-t. It rhymes with ``rust.''</p>
<p>Dust and rust both are brown, but they never occur at the same time. I know 
you are familiar with rust, because that's what your bicycles are made of -- 
especially if you didn't follow Uncle Venob's advice to bring them indoors 
way back yonder when the monsoons began.</p>
<p>Many of you younger ones have never seen dust at all. The older ones 
probably barely remember it.</p>
<p>Dust is ground-up dirt.</p>
<p>It is formed by -- what's that, Ralphie? You don't know what dirt is? Oh, 
yes. Silly Uncle Venob. If you children have never seen dust, then it stands 
to reason you've never seen dirt. Let Uncle Venob start over.</p>
<p>Dirt is dried-up mud.</p>
<p>No, children. Uncle Venob is not pulling your leg. Mud actually does dry up. 
If you live long enough, you will see it for yourself. The sun -- that's the big, 
hot, yellow ball in the sky; I know you've seen it in pictures -- comes out 
and heats the mud and it turns crumbly.</p>
<p>Try to imagine a big pile of brown corn meal. That's what dirt looks like. 
And when it dries some more, it turns into tiny particles called dust.</p>
<p>East Tennessee used to be one of the country's leading suppliers of dust. It 
was everywhere. We grew dust in our lawns, on farms, alongside country 
roads, and in baseball parks.</p>
<p>Dust was such an -- what's that again, Ralphie? Yes, baseball used to be 
played right here in East Tennessee. Trust your Uncle Venob. I know you've 
only seen it on TV, but there really was a time when children just like 
yourself went outside, without a raincoat, and played baseball in the dust.</p>
<p>Now, where was I? Oh, yes; I was talking about the history of dust.</p>
<p>East Tennessee was a hub of dust production in the Southeast. We exported 
it to people in underprivileged countries. Dust was so common, it was taken 
for granted. Why, I can remember when it was so dusty, some people 
would actually pray for rain.</p>
<p>Of course, we call those people ``heathens'' now because they have ruined 
our natural environment and put dust on the endangered species list. The 
very mention of this mass destruction beings a tear to Uncle Venob's eye. 
And believe me, more moisture is the very last thing we need. So let's drop 
the subject for now.</p>
<p>Besides, it's time for recess. Go put on your rubber boots, your swimsuits 
and your life jackets, and Uncle Venob will meet you on the playground.</p>

GUILT ASSUMPTION </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel Columnist</em></p>
<p>Before the nation's press corps charges, tries, convicts, sentences and 
executes Richard Jewell for planting that bomb in Atlanta's Centennial Park 
last weekend, let us pause one-tenth of a second and remember Abraham 
Ahmad.</p>
<p>Does Ahmad's name ring a bell? Probably not. Which, for his sake, we 
should be grateful.</p>
<p>But in the latter part of April 1995, Ahmad's name was printed in 
newspapers and broadcast across airwaves all over the United States.</p>
<p>He was the ``Middle Eastern man'' with ``wires and other electrical 
equipment'' in his possession who had been detained by British authorities at 
the London airport in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing.</p>
<p>Remember him now? Ah, yes. That guy.</p>
<p>Before Timothy McVeigh was arrested in connection with the attack, U.S. 
authorities -- hiding under their convenient ``condition of anonymity'' -- 
named Ahmad as a suspect.</p>
<p>That was all the media, along with the American public, needed. Even 
though no charges were ever brought against Ahmad, everyone knew he 
was guilty.</p>
<p>Then a strange thing happened on the way to the lynch tree.</p>
<p>Ahmad turned out to be one of those poor souls who was in the wrong 
place at the wrong time. An American citizen of Jordanian birth, Ahmad is a 
businessman who lives in Oklahoma City. He happened to be traveling to 
visit his father in Jordan. The ``electronic equipment'' he carried consisted of 
three home videotapes.</p>
<p>Ahmad has since sued the United States government, seeking nearly $2 
million in damages for himself and his family. In court documents filed last 
November, he alleged a number of injustices, including illegal search and 
detainment.</p>
<p>His lawsuit also discussed what happened after his name was published: 
``These false comments and improper release of information led to a rash of 
defamatory press reports, a tidal wave of press harassment of the other 
members of the Ahmad family, and hostile and abusive behavior by the 
Ahmads' neighbors and other local residents.</p>
<p>``Reporters started to show up at the Ahmad house . . . in such numbers that 
(his wife) had to call the police to remove them from the yard. People drove 
by shouting obscenities and threw trash in the Ahmads' yard. Eventually, 
Mrs. Ahmad had to take her daughters to a friend's apartment to escape the 
media and public onslaught. This invasion of privacy has had consequences 
for the mental health of the Ahmad family that continue to this day.''</p>
<p>No doubt much the same turmoil has occurred in the life of Richard Jewell, 
the hero-turned-suspect in the Olympics bombing.</p>
<p>As I type these words Thursday afternoon, Jewell has not been charged with 
so much as jaywalking. The press reiterates that fact -- after painting him 
with a broad ``guilty'' brush.</p>
<p>I watched in disbelief Tuesday night as NBC's Tom Brokaw told sports 
announcer Bob Costas that the FBI is trying to ``sweat him out.'' Brokaw 
went on to opine, in effect, that the feds ``probably have enough evidence to 
charge him and bring him to trial, but not to convict him.''</p>
<p>No need to. The press will do it instead.</p>
<p>On Thursday, our newspaper carried a syndicated column by Chicago's 
Mike Royko, who also pointed out that Jewell hasn't been charged. Then 
Royko described Jewell as ``a pudgy nobody, a face in the crowd, who 
apparently likes working in rent-a-cop jobs where he can wear a uniform 
and a badge and has some authority.''</p>
<p>Translation: String him up by his thumbs.</p>
<p>So while everyone else in this business is offering predictions, let me add two 
of my own:</p>
<p>1. Whether or not Jewell is charged, whether he is guilty or innocent, the 
press will cry torrents of crocodile tears after this saga ends and pledge to 
never jump the gun again. Until next time.</p>
<p>2. If Jewell isn't charged and subsequently decides to sue for defamation of 
character, Tom Brokow can call him by a new name: ``Boss.''</p>

<TD WIDTH=470><H2>AS A SAYING GOES: `IF THERE'S SMOKE, THERE'S A SEWER'</H2>

Today's sermon is called ``Why Struggle To Dig Up a Column About the Trials of Daily Living When Readers Will Supply a Much Better One For You?''<P>

   * Harry Freedman of Oak Ridge sat down in his kitchen to eat a barbecue sandwich the other day when smoke began boiling out around his 13-year-old microwave oven.<P>

   No, the microwave wasn't running at the time, but smoke is smoke. Freedman was certain the unit had caught fire, so he unplugged it and set it on the floor. Still the smoke billowed. So he carried it outside. When he looked back, smoke was still pouring -- from the wall.<P>

   Immediately, Freedman recalled that years ago, his washing machine used to occupy the same space. The smoke was coming from a wall box holding the original plumbing. He dashed downstairs where the laundry appliances are now housed, fully expecting to see them engulfed in flames. But all was quiet.<P>

   That's when he glanced outside and saw an Oak Ridge Utility Company crew pumping smoke into the sewers to check for leaks.<P>

   Said Freedman: ``After the utility people put a large blower in my kitchen and stuffed a rag into the offending drain, I carried the poor microwave back to its rightful location and was able to finally sit down and finish my barbecue.''<P>

   * Steve Richardson charts the evolution of 20th century American medicine by describing what happens when a mother calls the doctor about her child's fever.<P>

   ``In 1956, the doc would have said, `Give her a children's aspirin and I'll see her at your house by 3:30 this afternoon.' In 1966, the doc would have said, `Give her a children's aspirin and bring her to my office at 1:30 this afternoon.'<P>

   ``In 1976, the doc's nurse would have said, `Give her some Tylenol and we'll try to work her into the doctor's schedule sometime this afternoon.' In 1986, the doc's nurse would have said, `Give her some generic acetaminophen and if she's still running a fever tomorrow morning, call me again.''<P>

   ``In 1996, the doc's answering service says, `Here's the phone number for Dr. Kevorkian.'''<P>

   * A Jefferson County reader, who begged not to be identified, recently made a one-cent error when she deposited her paycheck.<P>

   The bank caught the mistake, of course, and corrected it with an official ``Miscellaneous Debt'' voucher for one penny.<P>

   It took 78 cents worth of postage to get all that business straightened out.<P>

   * Fred Shanton of Powell reports that a friend of his was about to sell some land along Clinton Highway. When buyer and seller met to ink the deal, the proposed contract included language from the Environmental Protection Agency that described a 500-year flood plan.<P>

   ``According to the plan, most of Clinton Highway and about half of Powell will be under water in 500 years,'' said Shanton. ``I suppose we'll be getting around in boats instead of cars.''<P>

   Yes, the deal fell through.<P>

   And, I can only assume, both sides repaired to the nearest marina.<P>

<p>The Knoxville News-Sentinel has taken a bold and historic move to position 
itself at the outer limits of technology.</p>
<p>We have installed automatic flushers in the men's restroom.</p>
<p>I haven't spoken to any News-Sentinel women about this situation, but since 
the automatic flushers are limited to urinals, I can only assume this a 
male-only development. If the women want equal treatment, by golly, let 
them stand up and be counted. Even if it makes an awful mess.</p>
<p>I realize automatic urinal flushers are not new in regular society. But 
newspapers loathe change of any kind. Thus, you can understand why 
several members of our staff are spending more time than normal in the john, 
getting acquainted. With the new flushers, I mean.</p>
<p>One of our editorial staffers -- I am not making this up but won't mention his 
name because the big cheeses might frown on his research, however noble 
its intentions -- has taken it upon himself to fool the auto-flusher.</p>
<p>He told me he stood in front of a urinal, without making a deposit, and then 
stepped away.</p>
<p>No flush.</p>
<p>Then he tried spitting into the porcelain bowl. The flusher immediately 
activated, leaving: (1) him delighted to have hoodwinked a piece of 
techno-plumbing and (2) me in awe that a human being can generate such 
tremendous volume in a single blast of spit.</p>
<p>Alas, when he tried the same test a few days later, the opposite results were 
noted.</p>
<p>Clearly, more experimentation is needed, so if your newspaper is late some 
morning in the new few weeks you'll know the reason why.</p>
<p>After working in The News-Sentinel building -- and operating its old-timey 
flush urinals -- for nearly 30 years, I must admit this abrupt change has taken 
some getting used to. Old habits are not shed easily. I still find myself 
reaching for the handle on occasion.</p>
<p>Still, the strangest adjustment involves the gadgets themselves.</p>
<p>You see, they have a tiny sensor panel on the front. It's a small, dark piece 
of plastic that looks exactly like a tiny television screen.</p>
<p>I was, uh, ``standing around'' in the restroom one day not long ago when 
another staffer walked up and stood beside me. (Our south wall facilities can 
accommodate three standers at a time, a condition loudly and painfully 
referred to as ``three of a kind'' when a fourth stander enters the room in 
urgent need of relief.)</p>
<p>The guy looked suspiciously at the flusher for a few seconds, then cast his 
eyes in my direction.</p>
<p>``How you reckon that thing works?'' he asked.</p>
<p>``You haven't heard?'' I replied. ``They sent around a memo on it the other 
day. All the flushers have a built-in camera. They take pictures of everybody 
who uses them. Back in the personnel department, they're building a photo 
file on every man in the house.''</p>
<p>Not that I'm making a scientific survey or anything, but I have noticed that 
ever since, when I happen to be in the restroom and that guy walks in, he 
always goes into a stall.</p>
<p>And shuts the door quickly.</p>

TO ASHEVILLE MULLED </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel Columnist</em></p>
<p>Three Latin words make up the official state motto of North Carolina: ``Esse 
Quam Videri.''</p>
<p>According to the encyclopedia, they mean, ``To be, rather than to seem.''</p>
<p>Which shows you should not believe everything you read in an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>The real translation is, ``You can't get here from there.''</p>
<p>Don't take my word for it. Just ask anyone from Tennessee who has 
attempted to travel to or from Tar Heel country via Interstate 40.</p>
<p>``Attempted'' is the key word. Nothing actually moves on Interstate 40 in 
North Carolina, at least not on the stretch between the Tennessee line and 
Asheville.</p>
<p>You know why? Because there is no Interstate 40 between the Tennessee 
line and Asheville.</p>
<p>I don't care what it says on the map; I don't care what someone told you at 
a service station. Don't believe it. It's Tar Heel propaganda.</p>
<p>Interstate 40 in North Carolina is most certainly not a highway. It is not a 
road, lane, thoroughfare, street, boulevard, byway, goat path or deer trail, 
either.</p>
<p>It is a parking lot.</p>
<p>I speak with years of experience in this matter. Six times over the past eight 
summers, I have vacationed at beaches in North Carolina. Not once in that 
period has Interstate 40 between the state line and Asheville flowed freely in 
both directions.</p>
<p>I don't know if the Guinness record-keeping people compile statistics on 
road blockages and traffic jams, but if they do, North Carolina's Interstate 
40 is a cinch to win. The state's budget for orange barrels and flashing lights 
is surely greater than the gross national product of many emerging nations.</p>
<p>I've had a lot of time to think about this situation -- so does anyone who 
ventures onto that stretch of asphalt -- and it finally dawned on me why 
North Carolina has decided to maintain Interstate 40 as a perpetual parking 
lot.</p>
<p>Envy.</p>
<p>If its neighbors can be famous for massive traffic snarls, North Carolina can 
be too. This is the highway version of keeping-up-with-the-Joneses.</p>
<p>Think about it. Georgia used to get all the glory with its siege of road 
construction around Atlanta. Then along came Tennessee with Malfunction 
Junction in Knoxville. All North Carolina asks is its turn in the limelight.</p>
<p>How much longer will this condition persist? Years. At least that's what one 
woman at the welcome center told me. About the time one stretch of the 
interstate gets patched, another needs repairing. Or else a rock slide occurs. 
Or a tunnel caves in.</p>
<p>But despair not. Tennesseans intent on visiting North Carolina between now 
and the year 2050 still have one option for bypassing Interstate 40 in its 
entirety.</p>
<p>Open your Latin textbook and read it aloud for yourself: ``Preparidus tu est 
Deltium.''</p>
<p>Which, loosely translated, means, ``Delta is ready when you are.''</p>

FAMILYTOWN? AND MUSICAL WHAT! </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel Columnist</em></p>
<p>Unfinished business as the summer of '96 sweats its way down the stretch 
toward Labor Day:</p>
<p>* Fame evaporates quickly. If you doubt it, try rattling off the names of those 
young women who won Olympic gold medals in swimming and gymnastics 
for the United States. Yes, those same young women whose determined 
faces were on nearly every TV screen, magazine cover and newspaper front 
in America just a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>But in the world of natural science, one name remained at the forefront for 
more than half a century: Roger Tory Peterson.</p>
<p>Peterson, who died in late July at the age of 87, was the John James 
Audubon of this century. Through his paintings and field guides -- millions of 
which were published in more than a dozen languages -- he taught 
generations of folks throughout the world how to identify and appreciate the 
flora and fauna of this planet.</p>
<p>Longtime residents may recall that Peterson used to visit Knoxville for bird 
talks and film shows at Lawson McGhee Library. I still have a field guide he 
autographed for me, a fifth-grader at the time.</p>
<p>More than 40 years later, it's the book I still reach for when an unfamiliar 
bird flutters into view. It's just as accurate now as then and surely will be two 
centuries hence. Assuming we won't have over-populated, polluted or nuked 
ourselves and the birds into oblivion by then.</p>
<p>* In the history of this county, has there been a road-improvement project 
that has dragged slower than the widening of Cedar Bluff Road from 
Interstate 40 to Kingston Pike?</p>
<p>How long has this half-mile stretch been under construction? Four years? 
Five? And it's still not complete.</p>
<p>Every few weeks or so, work crews will show up and move a utility pole. 
Or pave a lane. Or put down sod. Or paint a line. Then they vanish like the 
mist, not to be seen for another month.</p>
<p>Officials blame part of the delay on conflicting city-county-state jurisdictions. 
Perhaps. But I also suspect a strong link to the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p>
<p>Surely the road folks have studied under, and been influenced by, TVA -- 
whose snailpace construction of the Watts Bar nuclear facility became a 
career for many of its employees.</p>
<p>* Residents of Panama City, Fla., who want to rid their town of its 
hell-raising reputation, are looking to East Tennessee for the answer.</p>
<p>Several recent letters to the editor in Panama City newspapers have praised 
Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge for developing family-oriented entertainment.</p>
<p>Wrote Joyce Webb of Panama City: ``Their streets are clean, and there are 
no eyesores such as strip joints, girly shows, topless bars or billboards of 
half-dressed women.''</p>
<p>True. We do appreciate the comments and offer thanks that nudity in our 
mountains is still mostly associated with skinny dipping.</p>
<p>Yet the term ``eyesores'' is a relative one. The billboards and other 
commercial clutter in and around Pigeon Forge may not feature bare butts, 
but they still form the cornerstones of Tacky Town, U.S.A.</p>
<p>* I-Am-Not-Making-This-Up Dept.: A company in Budapest, Hungary, has 
begun manufacturing a singing condom.</p>
<p>The device works like a musical greeting card. As it unfurls, a tiny computer 
chip begins playing a melody.</p>
<p>One of the tunes available -- again, I stress this is straight off the news wires 
-- is an old communist song, ``Arise, Ye Worker.''</p>
<p>We wouldn't tolerate such a commie ditty here in the good ol' capitalistic 
U.S.A., of course.</p>
<p>But red-blooded selections like ``I Feel Good'' by James Brown, 
``Celebrate Good Times'' by Kool and the Gang and ``Let the Good Times 
Roll'' by Ray Charles are certainly worth consideration.</p>
<p>Not to mention the Starland Vocal Band's ``Afternoon Delight.''</p>

AND WIDE </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel Columnist</em></p>
<p>Please forgive Ernest Payne if he chuckles as today's teachers file back to 
the classroom for in-service training exercises.</p>
<p>When he broke into the profession, the training period was considerably 
shorter.</p>
<p>``It was 1953,'' says Payne. ``I was 18 years old and got hired the day 
before school started. My first assignment was Maple Creek, a one-room 
schoolhouse in Whitley County, Ky. It was three miles off the nearest paved 
road. Fortunately, I had a 1947 Willys Jeep, so I could get there.</p>
<p>``The superintendent gave me a coal bucket and a shovel, a well bucket and 
a chain, a water bucket and a dipper, a box of chalk, six erasers, five gallons 
of oil, a brand new broom and a school register. Then he slapped me on the 
back and said, `Go get 'em, big boy.' ''</p>
<p>For the next 40 years, that's precisely what Payne did. His teaching career 
spanned 12 different schools in three states -- from six grades in one tiny 
room to hundreds of students in sprawling, modern facilities.</p>
<p>``It was the best of times,'' says Payne. ``I've got some great memories. The 
only thing I regret is that I didn't keep a diary.''</p>
<p>Payne, who lives in Clinton, has packed a lot of living into 62 years.</p>
<p>In addition to teaching and principal careers in Kentucky, Ohio and 
Tennessee, he served 26 years with the National Guard, finished his 
bachelor's (Cumberland College) and master's (Union College) degrees, and 
hired himself out for a variety of summer jobs -- everything from driving a 
truck to building swimming pools. Officially retired from ``public works'' 
these days, he helps cure country hams at his son Mark's Cold Water Farms 
operation.</p>
<p>Payne grew up in the Maxey community of Whitley County, just north of 
Jellico. He attended a one-room schoolhouse throughout his own elementary 
education. It was good training. After Maple Creek, he was transferred to 
Black Oak and Lot schools -- huge, by comparison, at two rooms each.</p>
<p>``I reckon it would be a shock to teachers who'd never been in that sort of 
situation, but I was used to it. When you teach six grades at once, the 
students get lots of repetition. By the time they finish, they've heard each 
lesson six times!''</p>
<p>Payne also experienced a novel accounting system in those early days.</p>
<p>``Sometimes there wouldn't be enough money coming into the county to pay 
the teachers on time.</p>
<p>``They'd give us a warrant from the bank that would discount $2 off our 
paycheck. Basically, what we were doing was borrowing against our 
paychecks until the county got some money.</p>
<p>``My first year, I made $1,560. That was good money back then.''</p>
<p>But what if the county ran slap out of funds?</p>
<p>``That happened once,'' he replied. ``We were supposed to have school for 
nine months, but the superintendent told us to shut down after eight. That 
was the only way the county could balance the books.''</p>
<p>Payne moved on to schools in Xenia, Ohio, before coming to Anderson 
County. There, he served at Rosedale, Shinliver, Marlow, Medford, South 
Clinton, Norwood and Dutch Valley schools. He retired in 1993.</p>
<p>``Things are a lot more technical and a lot more complicated today,'' he said. 
``I think the teachers got a lot more backing from the parents in the old days. 
There weren't any drugs and crime to worry about, either.''</p>
<p>What's the funniest memory he has of those early years?</p>
<p>``It was at Christmas time, and one of the little boys in my school had gotten 
a harmonica,'' Payne replied. ``He was playing it, and this woman asked if 
she could see it. She played it awhile. She was pretty good, too.</p>
<p>``What nobody realized, though, was that she was dippin' snuff. She gave 
the harmonica back and the little boy blew into it with no problem. But then 
when he sucked on it -- well, bless his heart, it liked to gagged him.''</p>

MILLION OF 'EM </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>Which is more difficult to endure: coming within an inch of one million bucks, 
or missing by a mile?</p>
<p>John Miller will be happy to answer the question -- once his heartbeat 
returns to normal.</p>
<p>``I don't even know if I have a heart at this point,'' said Miller, a business 
teacher at Central High School, who surely is still pondering the what-ifs of 
missing a mountain of money by about the same margin that the words 
``instant riches'' take up in this sentence.</p>
<p>Miller was one of 21 qualifiers who competed Sunday afternoon in the final 
round of the Million Dollar Shootout at Egwani Farms golf course. This was 
the last event in Jake and Venob's 1996 Summer Games, a fund-raiser for 
the Helen Ross McNabb Center. Each person was allowed one stroke at 
the No. 18 hole from 135 yards out on the fairway.</p>
<p>Miller's shot hit 6 feet above the pin, then slowly rolled backward. As a 
groundswell of screams and cheers rose from the gallery, his ball passed 
within one inch of the cup. It didn't stop rolling until it was 24 feet, 7 inches 
away, landing Miller in third place.</p>
<p>What would he have done had the ball dropped?</p>
<p>``I would've called my principal the first thing Monday morning and said two 
words: `I'm retiring','' Miller laughed.</p>
<p>The chances of a hole-in-one -- anytime, anywhere -- are slimmer than the 
waistline of an Olympic gymnast. But you never know . . . </p>
<p>How would they react if their shot turned the trick? That's the question I 
posed to all of the finalists.</p>
<p>Herewith several of the more novel answers, some delivered with tongue 
planted firmly in cheek:</p>
<p>Carol Hornstra: ``Change my telephone number to unlisted.''</p>
<p>Charley Connatser: ``Pass out.''</p>
<p>Susan Conway: ``Write the Helen Ross McNabb Center a very nice 
check.''</p>
<p>Perry Bullard: ``I've got 9 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. It 
wouldn't last long.''</p>
<p>Jeff Fleming: ``Buy a house in the Caribbean and take lots of golf lessons.''</p>
<p>Calvin Howard: ``Pay off my Visa bill and donate the rest to the Helen Ross 
McNabb Center. Given the size of my Visa bill, this wouldn't be a huge 
donation.''</p>
<p>Mike Atkins (winner of the consolation prize, a pontoon boat from Rodgers 
Marine): ``Buy a condo in Aspen, a condo in Florida, and retire.''</p>
<p>Ken Harrell: ``Take care of my family, then play a LOT of golf.''</p>
<p>Brian Floyd: ``Buy a golf resort guidebook and start reading, slowly, on 
page one.''</p>
<p>But of all the people I quizzed, perhaps Chris Allen spoke the truest, wisest 
words. If his ball had plopped into the cup and transformed him into a 
millionaire, Allen said he'd be too stunned to make a quick, rational decision.</p>
<p>``I'd probably wait at least a month before I did anything,'' he added. ``That 
is, after I had jumped into the air, run, screamed -- and cleaned my shorts.''</p>

<p>The only thing I know is what I read in the papers.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's why I stay confused all the time and wind up having to ask so 
many questions.</p>
<p>Such as:</p>
<p>* Why is there such a big stink about that student who showed up at Gibbs 
High School with blue hair?</p>
<p>Good grief. When I was in school, many of the people I came in contact 
with every day had blue hair.</p>
<p>They were called ``teachers.''</p>
<p>* Now that Jack Kemp's military service record has come out -- he got a 
medical exemption when his Army Reserve unit was called to active duty 
during the Berlin Wall crisis in 1961; at the same time, not-so-coincidentally, 
Kemp was a star quarterback for the San Diego Chargers, passing for 
2,686 yards and 15 touchdowns while his buddies shouldered rifles in 
Germany -- will this dampen the shouts of ``Draft dodger!'' hurled at 
President Bill Clinton?</p>
<p>Not for a minute.</p>
<p>But right or wrong, for better or for worse, it's clear that both men did the 
same thing: Used the system to get excused when their country beckoned.</p>
<p>* How come the most important daily news about a presidential campaign is 
where the various candidates stand in the polls?</p>
<p>Between now and November, it matters not one whit where Bob Dole, Bill 
Clinton and Ross Perot stack up in these so-called ``scientific'' surveys.</p>
<p>There is only one poll that counts. It is taken in voting booths.</p>
<p>* Do you find it ironic that just one generation ago, young people were 
always angry at an old president, and now old people are always angry at a 
young president?</p>
<p>This is something the AARP, and new member Bill Clinton, might want to 
discuss.</p>
<p>* Why do people send campaign money to Ross Perot?</p>
<p>If Perot's own personal billions couldn't buy him the presidency in 1992, he 
dang-sure isn't going to make it on nickel-and-dime contributions from the 
flock.</p>
<p>* Now that Rep. Susan Molinari has joined the ever-growing list of 
politicians from all stripes who admit smoking dope during their hellion years, 
when will the embarrassing questions change to reflect a new era?</p>
<p>I can just see some nervous, perspiring candidate in, say, 2016, stammering 
to reporters, ``Well, yes, now that you mention it, I did experiment with red 
meat back during the '90s.</p>
<p>``But I swear I only chewed it. I didn't swallow.''</p>
<p>* Since it's becoming more apparent everyday that the FBI is distancing 
itself from security guard Richard Jewell, does anybody believe the Olympic 
bombing will ever be solved?</p>
<p>You gotta wonder how much important evidence was overlooked or 
ignored as the feds and the press stumbled over each other to tie a noose 
around Jewell's neck.</p>
<p>* Even though former University of Tennessee quarterback and all-around 
nice guy Heath Shuler has been relegated to second string -- perhaps on a 
permanent basis -- by the Washington Redskins, aren't there still a bazillion 
other jocks who'd love to trade places with him?</p>
<p>Yes, pride is important. And nobody questions Shuler's work ethic or his 
spirit.</p>
<p>But with $19 million in the bank and all his body parts functioning without 
regular visits to an orthopedic surgeon, Shuler is far better off than 99 
percent of the guys who sacrifice themselves each year to professional 
football.</p>

GUARD OUR SHORES </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>When a young Indianan named Charles Doughty took in a stray dog back in 
the early 1940s, he figured all he was getting was a good pet.</p>
<p>Little did Doughty know his pooch would eventually wind up in the archives 
of military history in Tennessee.</p>
<p>``He was just a scraggly little German shepherd pup, but he grew up to 
weigh over 100 pounds,'' recalled Doughty. ``I named him `Leroy.'</p>
<p>``We became real pals. If I wasn't in school, we were together. My 
grandfather had a farm several miles from my home. We were always cutting 
through the backcountry to get over there.''</p>
<p>Circumstance forced Charles and Leroy to part company in 1943. They 
didn't get back together until three years later. But now, more than half a 
century after the fact, some very significant moments from Leroy's life are 
being chronicled at the Tennessee State Library in Nashville.</p>
<p>Charles Doughty lives in Jefferson City these days. He is retired from 
Magnavox after serving 44 years with the company, the last few as 
production manager in Greeneville.</p>
<p>But way back when, he lived with his folks in an Indiana town called Speed, 
population 450.</p>
<p>``About all Speed had was a cement plant,'' Doughty mused. ``Nearly 
everybody worked there.''</p>
<p>Those who weren't off fighting in World War II, that is. Doughty himself 
would soon ship out for Navy service in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Leroy was destined for active military duty too. Except in his case, it was 
with the Coast Guard.</p>
<p>``There was a military program called War Dogs,'' Doughty said. ``They got 
dogs from people all over the country and trained them to help patrol the 
coastal areas for spies.</p>
<p>``Somehow, the Coast Guard heard about Leroy. Some men showed up 
and asked if we would loan him for the program. We said yes.''</p>
<p>That's how Leroy earned his keep for the next few years. He underwent 
guard dog training at Fort Robinson, Neb., and then patrolled with Coast 
Guard units in Miami and Key West, Fla., and Curtis Bay, Md.</p>
<p>``He was a good dog going in and a better dog coming out,'' said Doughty. 
``His trainer liked him so much, he asked if he could keep Leroy after the 
war. We said no way.''</p>
<p>Doughty himself wasn't discharged until 1946. But when he and Leroy got 
back together, it was like they'd never been apart. Their friendship resumed 
and remained intact until the dog's death in 1952. Doughty's folks had 
moved to Sellersburg, Ind., by then, and that's where Leroy is buried.</p>
<p>But one very significant thing about Leroy did change during the war.</p>
<p>His name.</p>
<p>``Somebody must not have liked that name for a guard dog,'' Doughty said 
with a laugh. ``They changed it to `Boy'. That's what it says on his discharge 
papers, and that's what we called him the rest of his life.''</p>
<p>Discharge papers? For a dog?</p>
<p>You better believe it. I've seen a photocopy of them with my own peepers. 
Boy was honorably discharged on Nov. 19, 1945.</p>
<p>The story of Doughty's dog came to the attention of the State Library folks 
while they were compiling information for the World War II veterans' 
survey.</p>
<p>You may have heard about this program. It's a commemorative book that's 
being put together as part of the Tennessee bicentennial celebration. The 
state is asking all World War II vets to share their stories for the project.</p>
<p>The deadline for filling out a survey is Sept. 15. If you're a vet, or belong to 
the family of a deceased serviceman from that era and wish to participate, 
call 1-800-200-8366 or write Carolyn Bracket, Statewide Projects 
Director, Tennessee 200 Bicentennial Celebration, 211 Seventh Ave. North, 
Suite 403, Nashville 37243.</p>
<p>Tell 'em Leroy -- er, I mean Boy -- sent you.</p>

OF LIVE BUGS?? </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>You may not have heard much about it -- what with the presidental 
campaigns, civil unrest in Russia, rumors of life on Mars, back-to-school 
news, and the latest football updates from Big Arnj Country splashed all 
over the papers -- but nearly three dozen connoisseurs gathered in 
Lanesboro, Minn., the other day to dine on a most unusual meal.</p>
<p>Bugs.</p>
<p>These people were participants in the ``Buggette Feast.'' It was organized by 
a man named Rhan Flatin.</p>
<p>Flatin is a naturalist who may have stayed in the outback too long. He is 
compiling a cookbook of insect recipes and invited other gourmands of the 
creepy-crawly to join him.</p>
<p>According to a story about the festivities that I read, Flatin and his associates 
merrily gnawed on such delights as live caddis flies, wax worms, 
grasshoppers, bees, not to mention cricket Marsala with angel-hair pasta 
and honey-glazed ants over ice cream for dessert.</p>
<p>This was not their maiden voyage on the Insect Express. The diners 
described each entree with much the same rhetoric associated with a 
wine-tasting ceremony.</p>
<p>As Steve Jacobson said of beetle larvae: ``Very subtle -- almost a pine nut 
flavor.''</p>
<p>Thanks just the same. You got any bread?</p>
<p>Although I'm sure there have been occasional ingestions of the accidental 
variety -- a drowned gnat in iced tea, for instance -- I have never 
intentionally eaten a bug. But I figured if anyone had, it would be Lowell 
Branham.</p>
<p>Lowell is a copy editor here at The News-Sentinel. We have been friends 
for nearly 30 years. A lifelong hunter-fisherman-hiker-canoeist-camper, he 
also writes a weekly outdoor column for the Scripps Howard News 
Service.</p>
<p>I have spent enough time in the woods and waters with Lowell to realize his 
culinary horizons stretch significantly farther than mine. Only a person with 
his vast experience would describe the taste of a honey locust blossom as, 
``Sorta like redbud.''</p>
<p>Oddly enough, Lowell only had one bug-eating experience to relate. It too 
was accidental, but he remembers it as ``not bad; not bad at all.''</p>
<p>It happened in August of 1972 when he and H.E. Bittle made a two-day 
float down the Clinch River from Sneedville. Yes, the same H.E. Bittle who 
grew up to become a state representative, proving the tragic, long-term 
consequences of insect experimentation in one's youth.</p>
<p>``We didn't pack much food,'' said Lowell. ``We figured we could catch all 
the fish we could eat. But there'd been a big rain, and the river was muddy 
as chocolate milk.</p>
<p>``We camped at the mouth of War Creek, where the water was flowing in 
clear. But the fishing still wasn't good. We only managed to catch two 
smallmouth bass. By the time we got 'em cleaned, and I had the fire going, it 
was dark.''</p>
<p>Lowell turned on a flashlight to inspect his skillet as the grease heated. It was 
flecked with several small, black bugs.</p>
<p>``I got a paper towel and was tryin' to get 'em out,'' he noted. ``About that 
time, H.E. turned on his light and said, `Forget it. Look out here'.</p>
<p>``I turned toward the creek and looked in the glow of his light. It was a solid 
cloud of those bugs. Billions of them were hatching. Some sort of midge, 
best we could tell. I've never seen anything like it before or since. They 
covered everything. Our fish looked like they'd been heavily sprinkled with 
pepper.''</p>
<p>But guess what? They were yummy.</p>
<p>``It was sort of a vinegary taste,'' Lowell said. ``It actually complemented the 
fish.''</p>
<p>A new dining experience notwithstanding, the memory of this trip is still 
painful for Lowell.</p>
<p>``When we got off the river the next day, I realized I'd left my cars keys at 
the put-in,'' he sighed. ``I had to hike back while H.E. stayed in the shade. 
Even worse, when I finally got to my car, the battery was dead.''</p>
<p>If they'd brought steaks -- not to mention a can of Off -- none of this would 
have happened.</p>

TO LAUGH AT ONESELF </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>Time has a way of smoothing life's rough edges and renewing one's 
perspective.</p>
<p>That's good. Without the passage of time, I couldn't relate the story you're 
about to read, at least not without elevating my blood pressure to record 
heights. Again.</p>
<p>In fact, time has been downright bountiful. The more I tell this story, the 
funnier it becomes. I'm almost to the point of wishing someone had been 
running a video camera in my driveway on the morning of July 27 and 
recorded the events as they unfolded. It surely would win first prize on 
``America's Funniest Home Videos.''</p>
<p>July 27 was the day of the bass tournament portion of Jake and Venob's 
Summer Games, a series of fund-raising activities cartoonist Jake Vest and I 
host each year to benefit the Helen Ross McNabb Center. At 6 a.m., 170 
anglers were due to blast off from the Fort Loudoun-Tellico launch ramp 
and start casting for more than $15,000 in cash and prizes.</p>
<p>I wasn't competing in the tournament but needed to be there early to help 
McNabb staff and volunteers kick it off. Then, an hour later, I was going to 
rendezvous with a News-Sentinel photographer and ferry him around the 
lake.</p>
<p>Shortly after 5 a.m., I opened the garage door, backed out my truck, 
parked it in the driveway, pulled my bass boat from beneath its shed, and 
prepared to drop it onto the trailer hitch.</p>
<p>This is neither a new nor a difficult task. I have been trailering boats of 
various descriptions for more than a quarter of a century. It is something I 
can do in my sleep -- which, the more I think about, could have been at the 
root of all evil.</p>
<p>There is a downhill pitch to my driveway, but this had never posed a 
problem. Until July 27.</p>
<p>I'm still not exactly sure how it happened. All I remember is, just as I neared 
the truck's rear bumper, the boat decided to roll backward. I leaned in the 
opposite direction to stop it.</p>
<p>Physics has never been my strong suit, but I learned a very important lesson 
at that moment: No one, not even a person of my girth, shall impede the 
progress of an 18-foot bass boat when it takes a notion to roll downhill. 
Within say, oh, .005-second, we were off to the races.</p>
<p>Determination, however, is one of my strong suits. I was not about to let a 
stupid boat get the better of me. I held on, heels dug to the max, and 
bulldogged that puppy back down the concrete.</p>
<p>At 5 a.m., one rarely thinks clearly. But when one is bulldogging an 
out-of-control bass boat and realizes the choices for termination of the 
journey are (1) Kingston Pike, 300 yards away, or (2) his wife's rose 
garden, 10 feet away, one can make a decision with crystal clarity.</p>
<p>The roses took a terrible beating.</p>
<p>So did every other form of vegetation in the place until the stern of the boat 
slammed into a large pine tree. This abrupt halt produced three immediate 
results.</p>
<p>1. It planted the stern approximately 1/2-inch inside the heart of the tree.</p>
<p>2. It dumped approximately 16 bushels of pine needles into the boat.</p>
<p>3. It launched me, approximately 20 feet away on the trailer tongue, into 
sub-lunar orbit.</p>
<p>Ah, but the fun was only beginning.</p>
<p>I tried pushing the boat back uphill until every vein in my neck and disc in my 
spine bulged like balloons. I tried backing the truck into position and 
hooking to the trailer until I realized the angle was impossible. I tried slowly 
counting to 10 to collect my wits and made it all the way to 13/8 before 
screaming, ``#@$%&amp;!''</p>
<p>Indeed, it wasn't until I woke up both my son and my wife and enlisted their 
shoulders that the boat was pushed back into position and attached to the 
truck. A full hour after the hateful episode began, I left home.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, the tournament went fine. Yes, of course, the rose garden is 
none the worse. The pine tree still gushes sap where it was smitten, the stern 
of my bass boat has a customized dent, and my back has finally quit hurting.</p>
<p>My pride may take a little longer.</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=150><!--IMAGE--><i>August 29, 1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>CAR THAT MAY BE KING OF THE 
ROAD IN TOWN THIS WEEK </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>Wherever and whenever the rubber meets the road, Irv Gordon will be 
there.</p>
<p>``I brought my new car on a Friday afternoon,'' says Gordon. ``I took it to 
the dealership the following Monday morning for some scheduled work. By 
then, I had already racked up 1,500 miles.''</p>
<p>Thirty years later, Gordon is still piling on the miles. With the same car.</p>
<p>``It's got a little over 1,490,000 right now,'' says Gordon. ``By the time I get 
back home, it'll be over 11/2 million.''</p>
<p>Or, as any Volvo owner would say, ``Not bad.''</p>
<p>Gordon, 55, is a retired schoolteacher. He lives on New York's Long 
Island. But don't look for him to be home often.</p>
<p>He's in Knoxville this week for a meeting of the Volvo Club of America. It's 
the second of three such gatherings he'll attend this summer. The next is in 
Los Angeles. He'll get there by car, of course. His car. The same red, 
two-door, P-1800 he bought in 1966 for $4,150.</p>
<p>Although Gordon had the engine rebuilt at 600,000 miles, his car uses the 
original engine block. The front seats have been re-upholstered once. And, 
among other repairs, it has received two water pumps, two master cylinders, 
two clutches -- and four coats of paint.</p>
<p>``I live half a block from the ocean and don't have a garage,'' he explained. 
``The finish really takes a beating from the salt air.''</p>
<p>Sure, there are a couple of other drawbacks to owning a 30-year-old car. 
Since this buggy was produced long before air-conditioning was a given, 
interior cooling is accomplished by rolling down the window. And in the 
absence of a stereo system for CDs, there's an AM-FM radio, an innovative 
accessory Back Then.</p>
<p>``But it doesn't leak, squeak or rattle,'' says Gordon. ``It still rides well, 
burns no oil and gets between 25 and 35 miles per gallon of gas, depending 
on the driving conditions. Even the clock still works.''</p>
<p>Before you ask: No, Gordon isn't a paid spokesman for Volvo. Nor is his 
car sponsored by the company. Volvo did give him a new car in 1987 when 
his turned 1 million miles. And his P-1800 once was flown to Europe for an 
automobile show. Other than that, it's been all up to him.</p>
<p>Is his mileage a world record?</p>
<p>``It certainly is for Volvo,'' Gordon replied. ``There's several Mercedeses 
with over 1 million miles, but I've passed them. There's also a guy in 
California with a VW that's supposed to have 11/2 million miles on it. But 
he's gone through 14 or 15 engines and about a dozen transmissions.''</p>
<p>Although he is fastidious about maintenance -- an oil change every 3,000 
miles and replacement of any part when it starts to show signs of wear -- 
Gordon can't explain why his car refuses to age.</p>
<p>``Good Swedish steel, I suppose. All I know is, I turn the key and it starts.''</p>
<p>There have been a few dings along the way, including a couple of what 
Gordon calls ``bashed-in noses.'' But a trip to the body shop later, and his 
machine was back on the road each time.</p>
<p>Gordon expects to hit 2 million miles -- ``the first million is always the 
toughest,'' he laughed -- but he realizes nothing lasts forever.</p>
<p>``I suppose that some day, I'll go out and find a big pile of red rust with four 
tires.''</p>
<p>At least he won't have to buy new wheels immediately. Besides his original 
car and the one the company gave him in '87, Gordon owns five others. All 
Volvos, of course.</p>
<p>The Volvo club's big bash is being held this weekend at the Hyatt Regency. 
About 50 vintage cars will be on display in the hotel's parking lot. On 
Sunday morning, conventioneers will hold an auto cross at Clayton Volvo on 
Clinton Highway.</p>
<p>Some 150 Volvo addicts are in town for this event. Their awards banquet is 
at 7 Saturday night. That's the same time 102,544 Tennessee football 
addicts will watch the kickoff of the UT-UNLV game less than a mile to the 
west.</p>
<p>Big deal. In matters of cars or sports, Volvo owners have always been a 
breed apart.</p>

FOOL ME TWICE . . . </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel Columnist</em></p>
<p>After eight weeks in Minnesota, David Etnier figured there might be a few 
changes around his house. You know, the usual stuff -- a fallen limb here, a 
patch of weeds there.</p>
<p>But when he strolled into the back yard of his Rocky Hill home a few 
mornings ago, the very last thing he expected to see was a freshly covered 
grave, complete with headstone.</p>
<p>Actually, the grave was the second thing Etnier saw. The first was a series of 
red plastic markers along the back line of his property that read 
``Resurveyed.''</p>
<p>Huh? Resurveyed? The property he'd owned for 30 years? The same 
property that backs up to a private church cemetery?</p>
<p>``That's sure what it looked like,'' said Etnier.</p>
<p>Etnier is a zoology professor at the University of Tennessee. Yes, the same 
UT zoologist who discovered East Tennessee's most famous fish, the snail 
darter. He and his wife Liz spend their summers at a remote family cabin on 
the Minnesota-Ontario border, usually returning just in time to start classes 
for fall semester.</p>
<p>But this year, it looked like they'd be spending most of the fall in court.</p>
<p>``We dug out our deed and put a tape measure to our yard,'' he said. 
``According to our calculations, their grave was on our property.''</p>
<p>All of this happened on a Sunday morning, meaning the Etniers would have 
to wait at least 24 hours before taking legal action against the church. Good 
timing. For it gave them an opportunity to sit back, take a few deep breaths, 
and look at the situation in detail.</p>
<p>``All of a sudden, it dawned on me that the date of death listed on the 
headstone was 1995, not 1996,'' said Etnier.</p>
<p>``Then I looked at the chain-link fence that runs between our yard and the 
cemetery and noticed that nothing had been disturbed on the cemetery's 
side. No stairsteps or anything had been built over the fence, either.</p>
<p>``That's when,'' Etnier said, a grin widening across his face, ``I started 
suspecting my graduate students might have something to do with it.''</p>
<p>A former graduate student, as it turned out.</p>
<p>Gerald Dinkins, who studied under Etnier during the '80s, now works as a 
private environmental consultant in Knoxville. He and Etnier have remained 
good friends through the years and delight in pulling practical jokes on each 
other. Seems that Dinkins was working in Kentucky over the summer and 
discovered the headstone, along with several other pieces of broken granite, 
in a landfill. It didn't take him long to launch a plan of attack.</p>
<p>``The thing must weigh 400 pounds,'' said Etnier. ``It took Gerald and two 
other guys to lug it into the back yard and dig the hole.''</p>
<p>Will this be a permanent addition to the West Knoxville landscape?</p>
<p>``I haven't decided,'' Etnier replied. ``I'm certainly going to leave it there for 
a while. Not everybody has a grave in his back yard, you know. It's really 
something to see.''</p>
<p>As for Dinkins?</p>
<p>The professor chuckled fiendishly.</p>
<p>``He needs to be very careful.''</p>

skill for drinking socially? </strong></font><p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>I have always been in awe of people who can belch on command. </p>
<p>This is an Important Life Skill that, along with sticking two fingers in my 
mouth and whistling sharply, I never mastered as a kid. </p>
<p>Not that I'm totally whistle- or belch-impaired. </p>
<p>I can pucker my lips and whistle up and down any musical scale, complete 
with flats, sharps and vibrato. I can whistle dogs back to the house at night. 
And, thanks to graduate studies in the marshes of Louisiana, I can whistle 
wood ducks, teal, wigeons and pintails into a spread of decoys. </p>
<p>But when I stick two fingers in my mouth and try to produce one of those 
shrill zreeeeets! audible for half a mile, all I do is blow slobber. </p>
<p>Same with belching. I can gulp a Coke and uncork a thunderous braaaaack! 
Among Olympic belchers, however, this is considered cheating -- not to 
mention its associated risk of carbonated-bubble burns to the nose and 
throat. </p>
<p>But never have I been able to swallow air and send it back in volume like the 
pros do. </p>
<p>(This is not necessarily a Guy Thing, either. My 22-year-old daughter, a very 
prim, proper, high-heeled young lady who learned to spit like a champion 
during my tobacco-chewing years, can swallow three or four times and belt 
out her name -- ``Meeeegaaaaan Veeeeenabllllle'' -- deeper than a Seattle 
foghorn. It makes a father proud.) </p>
<p>Whatever the form of belching, though, timing is critical to its success. </p>
<p>In the fifth grade, the time to belch and impress everyone in class is the 
precise moment the teacher turns her back. Bad timing can be disastrous, 
leading to serious consequences that range from a trip to the principal's 
office to getting shot. If you doubt my word, think back to June 1995, when 
a truck driver was arrested on Interstate 75 in Anderson County for firing his 
pistol at another driver who had belched repeatedly over the CB radio. </p>
<p>But perhaps the most graphic illustration of belch timing came to light 
Thursday in Knox County General Sessions Court during the 
drunken-driving trial of Hugh Ray Wilson. </p>
<p>Wilson, owner of Hoorays Sports Bar &amp; Grill, was arrested last April. 
According to police, he blew a 0.21 on the alcohol breath test, more than 
double the state's level of presumed intoxication. </p>
<p>Wilson's lawyer argued that his client may have belched during a 20-minute 
period prior to the test. This is critical to the defense because state law says 
the breath test cannot be administered until 20 minutes have passed between 
belches, hiccups or any other disturbance to the stomach and lungs. </p>
<p>Wilson's case was continued, so it'll be several days before we learn, among 
other points of law: (1) how long the accused paused between belches, (2) 
how high each blast registered on the Richter scale, (3) whether he said 
``Excuse me'' each time. </p>
<p>Whatever the outcome, though, it is clear that command-belchers could 
ostensively postpone a breath test, in 191/2-minute segments, for days or 
even weeks. Thus, they have a distinct advantage over the rest of society in 
these matters. </p>
<p>Somebody call the ACLU and order a case of Cokes. This -- braaaack! -- 
could get interesting. </p>

SUBLIME TO THE RIDICULOUS </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>In an attempt to create a kinder, gentler nation, an animal rights group has 
asked the citizens of Fishkill, N.Y., to find a new name for their town.</p>
<p>I am not making this up. The group PETA recently sent a letter to Fishkill 
Mayor George Carter requesting the change.</p>
<p>``Fish are able to feel pain,'' said Davey Shepherd of PETA headquarters in 
Norfolk, Va., ``and therefore to use them for your enjoyment is wrong.''</p>
<p>(Point of order. PETA in this case means People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals. It should not be confused with another group called PETA -- 
People Eating Tasty Animals -- that formed a few years ago to combat the 
animal rights folks. Personally, I'm thinking about organizing PETA -- People 
Enjoying The Antics. But just as sure as I do, a group of lawyers will form 
PETA -- People Envying The Action -- and sue the pants off me. So forget 
I mentioned it.)</p>
<p>No, the town is not going to drop the name it has had since being settled by 
the Dutch in the 1600s. As Mayor Carter pointed out, the ``kill'' portion of 
the word has nothing to do with ending life. Instead, it's Dutch for ``stream.''</p>
<p>Good. Put a stop to this nonsense before it goes any farther. Changing the 
names of cities, towns, communities and geographical locations across this 
country to appease the animal extremists would be a major undertaking. If 
you don't believe it, stroll through a couple of atlases like I did.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, these gastly links to hunting, fishing and related activities 
would have to go:</p>
<p>Trappers Lake, Col.; Killbuck, Ohio; Fishtrap, Ky.; Gunsight, Mont.; 
Gunpowder Falls Creek, Md.; Winchester, Tenn.; Hunter, Mo.; Hooks, 
Texas; Knife River, Minn.; Buckskin, Ind.; Shooting Creek, N.C.; Shooters 
Hill, Ind.; Arrow Creek, Mont.; and Arrowsmith, Ill.</p>
<p>Naturally, the exploitation of animal body parts by humans is a travesty. So 
out with the likes of:</p>
<p>Birdseye, Ind.; Rabbit Ears Peak, Col.; Horseheads, N.Y.; Beaverhead, 
N.M.; Hogshead Mountain, Conn.; Buckeye, W. Va.; Doe Ear Creek, 
S.D.; Monkey's Eyebrow, Ky.; Moosehead, Maine; Owls Head, Maine; 
and Gnaw Bone, Ind. Not to mention the Calfkiller River in Virginia.</p>
<p>While PETA's at it, why not eliminate any hint of mayhem and destruction? 
Such as:</p>
<p>Savage, Minn.; Slaughter, La.; Slaughters, Ky.; Hanging Rock, W. Va.; 
Hanging Limb, Tenn.; Lynchburg, Tenn.; and Graves, Ga. Particularly 
painful, and certainly in need of redemption, are Scalp Level, Pa., and Cut 
Off, (yeee-iiii!) La.</p>
<p>Indeed, one could go for a total environmental cleansing and get rid 
ecologically unpleasant locations. Including:</p>
<p>Deadwood, S.D.; Sulphur, La.; Stinking Creek, Tenn.; and Dry Creek, 
Miss.</p>
<p>But if this foolishness does get out of hand and municipal names are changed 
from sea to sea, there's one that shouldn't be touched. In fact, we oughta 
make it the nation's capital:</p>
<p>Looneyville, W. Va.</p>

1996</i> </td><td width=470><h2>AN UNFORGETTABLE MINUTE IN THE 
LIFE OF BILL MONROE </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel columnist</em></p>
<p>My most vivid memory of Bill Monroe occurred on a dreary Sunday 
afternoon several years ago when the legendary ``Father of Bluegrass'' made 
an appearance at the Museum of Appalachia in Norris.</p>
<p>This was the final day of the museum's annual Fall Homecoming, and it was 
a washout.</p>
<p>One of those cold, foggy, soak-to-the-marrow-of-your-bones October 
rains had started the night before. It did not slacken one iota the next day.</p>
<p>Trampled by thousands of feet -- and then sloshed, and then waded -- the 
grounds had turned into a sea of mud, despite a vain attempt at absorption 
via hundreds of bales of straw. This was the hillbilly version of Woodstock.</p>
<p>None of which was any concern to the followers of Monroe's high, 
lonesome sound.</p>
<p>It didn't matter to them that a full menu of professional football was on the 
tube. They couldn't have cared less that other people were holed up in 
houses, warming their toes by a cheery fire. No, indeed. What did matter 
was that the patron saint of the mandolin was about to be in their midst. Clad 
in everything from raincoats and ponchos to plastic garbage bags, they sat in 
lawn chairs and waited.</p>
<p>Shortly before the show began, wood-whittler Jimmy White approached 
me, worry on his face.</p>
<p>``There's a little old lady out there who doesn't have anything to protect her 
from the rain,'' he said. ``Let's see if we can get her some help.''</p>
<p>We found John Rice Irwin, the museum's owner, and explained the situation. 
For goodness sakes, he exclaimed; bring her to the back of the stage where 
she can watch the show in the dry.</p>
<p>So done.</p>
<p>She must have been 80, not much younger than the star himself. Lived above 
LaFollette, she said. Had all of Bill Monroe's records from way back in the 
early years. And now, she told Jimmy and me, she was going to get to see 
him live, in person. Surely life couldn't get any better than this.</p>
<p>As Monroe and his band were being introduced, Jimmy and I lingered 
backstage ourselves, just to watch this dear mountain woman as she 
watched her hero perform.</p>
<p>She sat still as the songs began. Almost transfixed. Save the steady tapping 
of her feet in time with the tune, there was virtually no movement to her at all.</p>
<p>Just before the final number, Irwin walked to the center of the stage and 
took the microphone.</p>
<p>``We've got a special guest for you, Bill,'' he said. ``She's come a long way 
to see you.''</p>
<p>He motioned to Jimmy and me. We led her, eyes still fixed on Monroe, to 
the front. Irwin made introductions all around and told the headliner and the 
audience about this fan of more than half a century.</p>
<p>From all I've heard and read about Bill Monroe, he could be a moody, 
cantankerous performer. But I believe right then, he was touched to the core 
of his heart.</p>
<p>He took the woman's hand, and the two old folks stared into each others' 
eyes for a moment, looking back perhaps to a time when music from 
Nashville crackled into the hills and hollows on Saturday nights. Finally, the 
Country Music Hall of Famer, the Grand Ole Opry superstar, the man who 
had entertained presidents and princes spoke, just above a whisper:</p>
<p>``You are a lovely lady. I'm so glad you came to hear me. This song's for 
you.''</p>
<p>Then slowly, ever-so-tenderly, he kissed her on the cheek.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something, children: I have seen plays and I have seen 
operas and I have seen movies. But never have I heard such a collective sigh 
as occurred that very instant.</p>
<p>Monroe cranked up his signature ``Blue Moon Of Kentucky'' as Jimmy and 
I led the woman back to her seat. A sweet smile creased her lips. She 
closed her eyes and rocked her head slowly from left to right.</p>
<p>When I looked back at the crowd, I noticed Kleenexes and hankies were 
being passed all around. It sure wasn't because of the rain.</p>

<HEAD><TITLE>DOGS, PELICANS, CRICKETS ARE NEWS ON A FRIDAY 13TH</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF><center><A HREF="/"><IMG SRC="../../images/flag.gif" ALT="A Publication of News-Sentinel Online" BORDER=0></A><center><BR clear=all><Table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0><TR><TD valign=top WIDTH=150><!--IMAGE--><I>September 13, 1996</I>
<TD WIDTH=470><H2>DOGS, PELICANS, CRICKETS ARE NEWS ON A FRIDAY 13TH</H2>

I can't spend too much time on any one topic today. This is Friday the 13th, and I want to stay flexible. You never know when a black cat, sidewalk crack, ladder or turned-over salt shaker might appear and really mess things up.<P>

   * Unfinished Business: My recent column about Leroy, the farm dog that served in the Coast Guard during World War II, prompted a response from Knoxvillian Dave Ming.<P>

   Ming spent his time in the Navy aboard the USS Washington -- which must have been a blessed ship. Even though it participated in several engagements and sunk a enemy battleship unassisted, Ming said nobody in the entire crew was so much as scratched.<P>

   Perhaps Zero should get the credit.<P>

   ``Zero was our mascot,'' said Ming, who sent a copy of the ship's newsletter. ``He got his name from the black circle around his right eye.''<P>

   Zero came on board with one of the ship's officers and stayed for the duration. He had his own health record, pay account, liberty card and two tailor-made uniforms: whites and dress blues. He was a member of the 1st Division and manned (dogged?) his own battle station in Turret One.<P>

   The article ended with a description of Zero on liberty: ``It is a heartwarming sight to see him swagger ashore with his campaign bars pinned to his blues. He heads eagerly for the bright lights, knowing that where there are bright lights there are lamp posts. But lamp posts moored in concrete are rather tame for a dog accustomed to a heaving deck, and he is soon ready to go back aboard ship and resume his duties.''<P>

   Another who recalled canine combat duty was Knoxvillian J.P. Humphrey. An infantry heavy weapons platoon sergeant, he remembered when guard dogs often accompanied the troops.<P>

   But Humphrey's most humorous anecdote from the war involved a different animal. He happened to be on the beach at St. Augustine, Fla., when a U.S. military amphibious airplane, patrolling for German U-boats, flew by.<P>

   ``Flew'' being a relative term.<P>

   ``It appeared their speed would not exceed 5 or 10 miles per hour,'' he said. ``This particular day, a flock of pelicans used the plane at their point and followed directly behind it in a perfect V.''<P>

   * More Unfinished Business: An Oliver Springs reader, who pleaded not to be identified -- ``Please DO NOT use my name'' highlighted with a yellow marker -- had more suggestions about my column on musical condoms.<P>

   (Yes, there is such a thing. They're being made in Europe and ``sing'' via a tiny computer chip.)<P>

   The reader liked the numbers I suggested but proposed several others, including that country classic, ``Help Me Make It Through the Night.''<P>

   * ``C.L. McElroy,'' whoever you are, Kenny Carey has your trophy.<P>

   Carey, who lives in Greenback, found the ornate, silver-plated cup at a garage sale. He paid all of $2 for it.<P>

   ``It's from the Women's National Aeronautic Association's air race, Jan. 13-15, 1930,'' said Carey. ``I'd like to get it back in the proper hands.''<P>

   You can call Carey at 856-2181 -- and, mayhaps, arrange for one of those slow, amphibious military fly-bys like J.P. Humphrey described. That way, Kenny can fling it to you.<P>

   * I am a firm believer in ``the signs.'' Trouble is, I don't know how to read and interpret them.<P>

   Based on my observations, East Tennessee is waist-deep in walnuts and muscadines this fall. Does this mean we're going to have a bad winter? If so, how do you explain my observation, in three different locations, of sweet, fragrant honeysuckle in full bloom this late in the season?<P>

   * I have spent the last two nights trying to find a hateful cricket that has taken up residence somewhere between my fireplace and a wall.<P>

   At one point, I wanted to mash this 400-decibel chirping monster with a hammer. But that would be too quick, too easy, too humane.<P>

   Now, I want to catch him and put him in a cage and -- at regular intervals during the day when he's trying to sleep -- ring an alarm clock.<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>COMING SOON TO YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS: BIG ORANGE CHOPPERS</TITLE>

<TD WIDTH=470><H2>COMING SOON TO YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS: BIG ORANGE CHOPPERS</H2>

Fans of Tennessee football have unlimited opportunities to strut their colors.<P>

<P>

   They dye Big Orange streaks in their hair and paint Big Orange decorations on their faces and fingernails. They wear Big Orange suits and dresses to every game -- not to mention Big Orange shirts, Big Orange neckties, Big Orange shoes and socks and Big Orange sunglasses. They carry Big Orange shakers and Big Orange cushions into Neyland Stadium and sneak-sip Big Orange firewater from a Big Orange flask. They drive Big Orange cars, Big Orange trucks, Big Orange vans. And when they die, they get buried in Big Orange caskets.<P>

<P>

   Kid stuff.<P>

<P>

   It's all so temporary. With the exception of the casket, there's no permanency whatsoever.<P>

<P>

   Ah, but then there are the few, the proud, the tattooed.<P>

<P>

   ``We do about 75 Big Orange designs a year,'' says Dusty Hill of Mountain Tattoo, 4117 Airport Highway.<P>

<P>

   ``The most popular style is `VOLS' in orange, with a white star over the O. I've done a bunch like that on ankles and upper arms. Another favorite is `UT' in block letters, with the T superimposed over the U. Then sometimes, fans bring in their own design.''<P>

<P>

   Although tattooing is the rage among teenagers and twentysomethings these days, Hill said most of those asking for a Big Orange imprint are much older.<P>

<P>

   ``They're just everyday folks who support Tennessee,'' he noted. ``Usually, this is their first tattoo. Not long ago, one of my partners tattooed `Big Orange Country Forever' on (former Vol basketball coach) Ray Mears' wrist.''<P>

<P>

   If you've got the fever that bad, the procedure takes from 20 to 45 minutes and runs $50-$75. But if you really want to put your loyalty (not to mention your money) where your mouth is, hang on just a little longer. If my hunch is correct, you'll soon be able to have Big Orange teeth.<P>

<P>

   Dr. Fred Scott, a dentist in North Canton, Ohio, has begun installing decorative crowns on the choppers of Cleveland Indians fans.<P>

<P>

   Based on a spot check of dentist offices and dental labs in Knoxville, the fad hasn't caught on here. Yet. But I figure the lines will form if Tennessee prevails over Florida, as Big Orange craziness knows no threshold, pain or otherwise.<P>

<P>

   ``About 7 years ago, I made a Chicago Cubs crown,'' said Brownie Schweitzer of S&H Crown & Bridge Inc., 310 Simmons Rd. ``I've also done several with diamonds in them. But I haven't had any requests for Big Orange designs.''<P>

<P>

   One problem is size. By the time ``VOLS'' or ``UT'' is reduced to fit on the side of a molar, someone must be kissing-close to see it.<P>

<P>

   Schweitzer also said porcelain crowns are heated to 1,800 degrees to give them a high gloss. It's hard to find a nontoxic paint that will withstand such treatment.<P>

   Plus, there's this matter of color. ``I'm not sure how many people would want orange teeth,'' he said with a laugh.<P>

   All depends on the outcome of next Saturday's game.<P>

WILL CERTAINLY GET YOU </h2>
<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel Columnist</em></p>
<p>As a former police reporter, I have heard some classic dumb-crook stories.</p>
<p>Such as the guy who robbed the old Bank of Knoxville years ago and made 
a speedy escape on foot. So speedy his hat flew off. Yes, the same hat that 
had his name and address printed inside.</p>
<p>I've heard tales about lamebrains who locked themselves out of their 
getaway cars, who forgot to load their guns before a shootout with the cops, 
who didn't realize their partner in crime was an undercover agent until the 
handcuffs were slapped in place.</p>
<p>But those cretins are Ph.D.s compared to the poor ol' boy who made a 
serious miscalculation a few nights ago when he broke into a store in 
Jefferson County.</p>
<p>Get out your yardsticks. We're going to be taking some measurements in this 
essay. They're important to the outcome.</p>
<p>The store in question is Rimmer's Sporting Goods. It is a small block 
building, 48 feet by 96 feet, that sits on South Highway 92 between 
Interstate 40 and downtown Dandridge.</p>
<p>Close to the store was an old wooden platform, 3 feet long and 1 foot wide, 
that had been there for more than a year.</p>
<p>A few nights ago, someone heaved a chunk of concrete -- 12 inches long, 6 
inches wide, 4 inches thick -- onto the rear roof of the store.</p>
<p>Apparently the would-be thief had cased the building inside and out and 
assumed the empty space between the roof and the ceiling would provide 
quick and easy access to the interior.</p>
<p>And apparently the would-be thief assumed the platform would make a 
suitable ladder.</p>
<p>And apparently the would-be thief assumed the chunk of concrete would 
make an effective battering ram to open a hole in the roof.</p>
<p>All three of which were good assumptions and good measurements.</p>
<p>But the would-be thief failed to make one exceedingly important assumption 
and measurement.</p>
<p>He failed to take into account a small room, 11 feet by 7 feet, next to the 
minnow tank.</p>
<p>It's the room where the store's owner, Larry Rimmer, sleeps.</p>
<p>``I moved in there 11 years ago when I got a divorce,'' Rimmer said. ``I 
figured everybody knew I lived in the store.''</p>
<p>Apparently not.</p>
<p>When Rimmer heard noises from above, he reached for his bedside 
telephone, called 911, and then calmly waited, accompanied by a 12-gauge 
shotgun loaded to the hilt with 00 buckshot.</p>
<p>Presently, ceiling material and a light fixture fell to the floor. Then down came 
a pair of feet.</p>
<p>``I didn't need to turn on a light,'' Rimmer said. ``There was enough light 
from the Coke machine to see what was happening.''</p>
<p>The would-be thief's calculations, correct or otherwise, ended abruptly when 
police arrived en masse. They captured the suspect -- identified as a 
16-year-old lad from Washington County with a history of juvenile offenses 
-- in a nearby grocery store parking lot.</p>
<p>As they say down in Cell Block D, ``Hoo-boy.''</p>

<p><em>By Sam Venable, News-Senitnel Columnist</em></p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>s members of every generation grow older, they undergo the ''simply can't 
believes.'' </p>
<p>They simply can't believe the music that's popular. </p>
<p>They simply can't believe the clothes kids wear. </p>
<p>They simply can't believe the prices at grocery stores. </p>
<p>They simply can't believe so-called ''advancements'' in technology. </p>
<p>Indeed, they simply can't believe how everyday life has changed -- inevitably 
for the worse -- since back in the Age of True Enlightenment when they 
were young. </p>
<p>This is a time-honored tradition that has been handed down, generation to 
generation, since Ug Paleolithic complained to Ug Jr. that we're all going to 
hell in a handbasket. Assuming Ug knew what a handbasket was in the first 
place. </p>
<p>I understand this phenomenon and accept my role in it. I grumble about 
today's music and fashions with the same contempt my father reserved for 
Elvis and blue jeans. </p>
<p>All that notwithstanding, I simply can't believe that I just threw away another 
set of contact lenses. </p>
<p>(Yes, I know. This is a ''simply can't believe'' in and of itself. One generation 
ago, geezers simply couldn't believe youngsters would stick something 
foreign into their eyes to improve their vision. These days, geezers like me 
simply can't believe youngsters will lie down and let a doctor carve on their 
eyeballs to improve their vision.) </p>
<p>I started wearing contacts in college 30 years ago. In today's parlance, they 
were ''hard'' lenses because they were made of rigid plastic. They felt like it 
too. </p>
<p>No, that's not wholly correct. Hard contacts felt like a roofing shingle. They 
itched and burned and caused your eyes to blink and water like you'd just 
been exposed to 30 minutes of Mojave Desert winds. </p>
<p>You only got one set of contacts Back Then. If a lens popped out of your 
eye, you had to get down on the ground and grope around for it. If today's 
kids will consult their history books and thumb all the way back to the 
ancient 1960s, they will likely find a photograph of basketball players on 
their hands and knees, searching for an errant contact lens. No basketball 
game could be played Back Then without at least three timeouts for contact 
lens recovery. </p>
<p>Hardly anybody wears hard contacts anymore. They have been replaced by 
''soft'' lenses that look and feel like a sliver of Saran Wrap. Soft contacts are 
so thin and so slick, you honest-to-gosh cannot feel them in your eye. </p>
<p>What's more, they're disposable. You wear 'em for a set amount of time (my 
wife changes hers every two weeks; mine last for two months), and then 
throw 'em away. </p>
<p>That's the part I find so unsettling. </p>
<p>I can't help it. Even though I've done it dozens of times, I simply can't believe 
I'm actually chucking perfectly good contacts into the can. </p>
<p>Oh well. My father, a Gillette Blue Blades man, simply couldn't believe the 
concept of disposable razors. </p>

Venob's ultimate game plan wins</font><p><font size=2><i>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel columnist</i></font></p>
<p><!--dateline--><br>
<font size=5>F</font>or the sake of the economy of their respective states, Tennessee and 
Florida should not -- repeat, not-- play football against each other this 
Saturday. </p>
<p>Yes, I know the Vol-Gator matchup has been billed as a clash of the titans. </p>
<p>Yes, I know it has national championship implications for both schools. </p>
<p>Yes, I know it has the potential for drawing the largest crowd to witness a 
football game in the flesh, plus untold millions more on The Tube. </p>
<p>Yes, I know this athletic event has become a hypefest, fanned to the 
temperature of molten lava by passions normally associated with tent revivals 
and political campaigns. </p>
<p>And that's precisely why Tennessee and Florida should back off and milk 
this thing for ALL it's worth. Or, in football parlance, go for a touchdown 
instead of merely settling for a first down. </p>
<p>Think about it: The hype about this contest has been steadily building for two 
piddly little weeks -- and yet everything will be over by Saturday evening. </p>
<p>One team will win, one will lose. Each side will retreat for another 12 
months. Over and out, hoo-hum. </p>
<p>But if Knoxville and Gainesville could find a way to generate this kind of 
steam for months and months at a time, think what a gold mine it would 
produce! </p>
<p>This plan is so obvious, not to mention lucrative, I'm surprised neither 
school's athletic development office has thought of it. I call it the Simpson 
Scheme in honor of that jockmeister-marketing genius himself, O.J. 
Simpson. </p>
<p>You remember O.J., don't you? Of course you do. From the white Bronco 
chase to the jury's not-guilty verdict more than a year later, his criminal trial 
absolutely captivated America. </p>
<p>It was the center of attention in news programs and talk shows, beauty 
parlors and beer joints, boardrooms and bedrooms, country clubs and 
coffee clubs, the Internet and the backyard fence, coast-to-coast. And now 
O.J.'s civil trial promises to do the same thing. </p>
<p>So why not Tennessee-Florida? </p>
<p>Why not let this goose continue to lay golden eggs, just like it did with O.J.? </p>
<p>Why ruin a perfectly nasty interstate war with well-executed blocks, tackles, 
receptions and TD's? </p>
<p>Here is Coach Venob's game plan: </p>
<p>* Send Phillip Fulmer and Steve Spurrier packing and replace them with 
Johnny Cochran and Christopher Darden. </p>
<p>* Dismiss the cheerleaders from both sides and select alternates from the 
jury pool. </p>
<p>* Put Lance Ito in charge of the officiating. </p>
<p>* Let the whole thing brew, stew, simmer, boil, bubble and fume on CNN 
for the next six or eight months. </p>
<p>We're talking millions of dollars in new revenue, folks. Maybe even billions. </p>
<p>Or maybe -- just maybe -- enough to guarantee season tickets for every 
man, woman and child within a 10-mile radius of Neyland Stadium. </p>

<p><!--dateline--><br>
<font size=5>Y</font>ou know the world is at relative peace when the most riveting news from 
opposite sides of the globe involves bathroom hygiene. </p>
<p>Perhaps you've seen these stories yourself. (If not, you obviously haven't 
spent enough time perusing leftover newspapers in the stall.) </p>
<p>A few days ago, the American Society for Microbiology reported that 
millions of folks don't wash their hands after visiting the john. That revelation 
came on the heels of a decree by the Singapore government, announcing 
fines for people who don't flush after using public restroom facilities. </p>
<p>The microbiology project involved 6,333 men and women in five cities. 
Researchers hung out in public restrooms, acting like they were combing 
their hair, while unwitting subjects did their business. Then the researchers -- 
who surely have the most perfectly coiffed locks this side of Jimmy Johnson 
-- wrote down whether or not a subsequent hand scrubbing occurred. </p>
<p>According to the report, New Yorkers led the ranks of the unwashed, while 
Chicagoans were among the most clean. </p>
<p>Researchers also said the lowest rate of washing occurred among men at an 
Atlanta Braves game. Only 46 percent took time for soap and water before 
heading back into the stands. </p>
<p>Inconclusive finding, I say. Much more research is needed. </p>
<p>Was this Beer Night, mayhaps? Was it a close game? Exactly when was the 
data gathered? </p>
<p>Inquiring minds want to know these things. You pump any baseball fan, 
Braves or otherwise, full of suds and then send him duck-walking to the 
porcelain midway through the 9th inning of a tie game, and I'll guarantee you 
the chances of a thorough scrubbing are remote indeed. </p>
<p>Inquiring minds also want to know more about the crackdown in Singapore, 
where non-flushers can be fined $106 on first offense and up to $709 for 
repeat offenses. </p>
<p>Huh? Fines? In Singapore? </p>
<p>I thought the favored mode of punishment for a misdemeanor in Singapore 
was a cane to the buns. Seems to me this would be the perfect time and 
place for it. </p>
<p>Then again, this could be self-defeating. If I walked into a public john and 
saw some sinister-looking cop standing there, idly tapping his palm with a 
cane while waiting on customers, I'd probably become involuntarily moist 
before I even touched the stall door, let alone the flush handle. </p>
<p>No matter the mode of punishment, though, the Singapore approach will 
likely get more attention than the potty law enacted a few years ago by the 
Tennessee General Assembly. </p>
<p>Surely you remember. It's the law requiring us to Wash Our Hands! for 
good health. The exclamation mark is a critical part of this regulation. It must 
be at least six inches tall, just like the letters. </p>
<p>Based on Tennesseans' typical reaction to trifling legislation, not to mention 
the unsavory condition of public restrooms, I can only assume lots of folks 
have showed politicians What To Do! with this law. </p>

<font size=5>T</font>his will come as a shock to the 107,608 people who briefly occupied 
Neyland Stadium last Saturday (minus the infidels from Florida, of course), 
but I peeked out my window early Sunday morning AND THE SUN WAS 
SHINING BRIGHTLY! </p>
<p>Yes. Cross my heart and hope to die, stick a needle in my eye. </p>
<p>Not only that, but blue jays called noisily from the oak tree out back, 
crickets chirped happily in the grass by the garden, and butterflies flitted 
about merrily, just as each had done last Friday morning when the world of 
Big Orange was pregnant with holy promise. </p>
<p>That world should have come to a complete and abrupt halt in the pouring 
rain Saturday afternoon after Tennessee and Florida teamed up to thrash 
Tennessee, 35-0, in the first 20 minutes of an alleged football game. </p>
<p>It was a perfectly awful thing to watch, whether in the wet flesh or a dry den. 
Never have I seen a Volunteer team self-destruct so quickly, nor so large a 
Volunteer audience grow so quiet and so numb for so long. By all rights, the 
Pride of the Southland band should have played a funeral dirge at halftime. </p>
<p>But enough of this moping. Uncle Venob will not allow his troops to wallow 
in the mire of gloom and doom. There's work to be done. </p>
<p>Like the phoenix rising from the ashes -- or Bill Clinton emerging victorious 
from Personal Disaster No. 1,576 -- we must bravely march onward 
toward the next challenge. </p>
<p>How? </p>
<p>By keeping a stiff upper lip? </p>
<p>By staring adversity squarely in the face? </p>
<p>By pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps? </p>
<p>By digging down into our reservoir of resolve? </p>
<p>By showing true grit? </p>
<p>Heavens, no. That cornball stuff went out with Brylcreme and The Saturday 
Evening Post. </p>
<p>This is the '90s, for goodness sake. Anyone with half a lick of New Age 
logic (not to mention daddy's money, a Lexus, a thick stock portfolio and a 
condo in Vail) knows the only way to succeed these days is through damage 
control. </p>
<p>That's why I have called upon the professional services of Dr. I.R. Nutz, this 
column's resident spin doctor. Dr. Nutz has used his vast wisdom and insight 
to spin last Saturday's 35-29 butt-kicking into a mere ''statistical 
downsizing.'' </p>
<p>I quote directly from his report: </p>
<p>1. ''UT fans may now redirect their hatred toward Alabama, where it 
rightfully belongs. In matters of Tennessee athletic animosity, Florida is a 
Johnny-come-lately. Florida should conjure up happy thoughts of spring 
break, sunny beaches, Mickey Mouse, all-you-can-eat shrimp and the 
University of Miami. Alabama, on the other hand, is a sworn, ancestral 
enemy of the fatherland, a despicable backwater inhabited only by those 
living in a permanent state of moral and intellectual bankruptcy. </p>
<p>2. ''Tennesseans won't have to interrupt their New Year's holiday season by 
traveling to New Orleans. This strikes at the very essence of 1990s family 
values. What could be more All-American than families gathering together -- 
at home -- to work out on the Stair Master and then drink a cup of 
non-alcoholic cheer to ring in the new year? </p>
<p>3. ''Additional VCR tapes won't be gathering dust in the closet. Tens of 
thousands of tapes of the '86 Sugar Bowl and the Miracle in South Bend lie 
dormant in homes throughout Tennessee, having not been watched since 
three months after either contest. Why add to the clutter with yet another? </p>
<p>4. ''This alleviates the tension that comes with sitting at the top of the heap. 
It's just like the days of the Old West. A skilled gunslinger could never kick 
back and enjoy his achievements. Instead, he had to constantly worry about, 
and be on the lookout for, the next young punk that rode into town.'' </p>
<p>There. Don't you feel better, now that Dr. Nutz, the spinmeister, has worked 
his magic? </p>
<p>Me neither. </p>

<!--SUBHEAD--><p><font size=2><i>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel Columnist</i></font></p>
<p><!--dateline--><br>
<font size=5>I</font>f anyone among the howling masses of Republicans, Democrats, 
Libertarians and Reformers is truly interested in preparing America for the 
challenges of the 21st century, I have found The Answer. </p>
<p>It is The Answer to fighting crime. </p>
<p>It is The Answer to controlling deficit spending. </p>
<p>It is The Answer to cleaning up the environment. </p>
<p>Indeed, it is The Answer to a host of problems that have stymied the leaders 
of our sovereign republic for decades. </p>
<p>The Answer is quick, efficient, inexpensive. And best of all, The Answer is 
so simple you can bump right into it. </p>
<p>I discovered The Answer in Florida last weekend while helping my daughter 
move from a third-floor apartment in Tallahassee to a third-floor apartment 
in Orlando. There apparently is a law in Florida that forbids apartment 
complex owners from renting space on the first two levels, but that's another 
matter. </p>
<p>I leased a rather large truck for the operation. So large, in fact, that the 
cargo section extended over the top, and off both sides, of the cab. Thus, 
traditional movement in and out of the cab was restricted to all but Smurfs, 
pythons, limbo dancers and other creatures who cast a short shadow. </p>
<p>One glance told me the leasing company's legal staff had already thought of 
the potential for accidents. </p>
<p>The interior and exterior of the cab were plastered with all manner of 
warnings, admonitions, caveats and notices -- in English and Spanish -- 
about what happens if you don't bend over to enter or exit. There was even 
an illustration showing a guy (I couldn't tell if he was English or Spanish; 
maybe German, for all I know) with giant X's for eyes. </p>
<p>Naturally, I ignored them. </p>
<p>Approximately .0005-second later, I realized the error of my ways. </p>
<p>That's when I saw The Answer. (Or, technically, ''Thx Xnswer,'' as my own 
eyes had been transformed by then.) </p>
<p>This was behavior modification in its purest form. </p>
<p>From the moment the truck smote my head, I remained in a permanent, 
flexed-knee, half-stooped state, ever mindful of what was above me. </p>
<p>Even now, more than 72 hours after the initial encounter, I find it difficult to 
get in or out of any type of motor vehicle without instinctively ducking and 
flinching like a well-beaten dog. </p>
<p>That's why I think The Answer can solve America's problems. </p>
<p>All we have to do is round up criminals, tax cheats, bureaucrats, career 
politicians, polluters, lawyers, health care magnates, corporate swine, 
apartment complex owners who refuse to rent space on the first two floors 
and other sinister forms of life and show them the error of their ways with a 
low, hard ceiling. </p>
<p>One dose and -- presto! -- they'll have a whole new outlook on life. </p>
<p>Trust me. This method really workx. </p>

<p><!--dateline--><br>
<font size=5>I</font> can just imagine Bob Heydet going over a checklist the next time he heads 
to Citico Creek for a day of trout fishing: </p>
<p>Rod and reel -- check. </p>
<p>Dry flies, wet flies, leader material -- check. </p>
<p>Waders -- check. </p>
<p>Extra set of keys and locksmith's telephone number -- check and 
double-check. </p>
<p>Then again, perhaps it would be a good idea for Heydet to avoid the 
mountains altogether, particularly the area around Citico Creek. There's bad 
luck in them thar hills, and we ain't talkin' finicky trout. </p>
<p>One summer morning about eight years ago, Heydet went fishing on Citico 
Creek with his then-teenaged daughter, Jean. </p>
<p>''I remember it well,'' the Knoxvillian said with a laugh. ''It was a Sunday. I 
should have been in church.'' </p>
<p>As her father fished, Jean went back to the car for a soft drink. She 
accidentally locked the keys in the trunk. Heydet had to walk to a telephone 
-- no small feat in the mountains -- call home, and get his son to bring 
another set. </p>
<p>''You ever try to give someone directions to Citico?'' he asked. ''It's one of 
those places you can't get to from here.'' </p>
<p>With that episode in mind, please fast-forward to last week when Heydet 
returned to Citico with his fishing buddy, Ed Glass. They were riding in Ed's 
car. </p>
<p>No, they didn't lock the keys inside this time. That's kindergarten stuff. In 
matters of keyology, Bob Heydet chairs the post-doctoral committee. </p>
<p>''We had finished fishing for the day,'' he explained. ''Ed was around back, 
taking off his waders. I saw his keys on the front seat, so I stuck 'em in the 
ignition, just to be helpful.'' </p>
<p>Unbeknown to Heydet, he was holding the key upside down. This 
transgression became oh-so-painfully apparent seconds later when neither 
the key nor the ignition switch would budge. </p>
<p>''It was hopelessly stuck,'' he sighed. </p>
<p>At least he didn't have to expend shoe leather this time. A van full of students 
from Hiwassee College happened along and gave the two men a ride to 
Tellico Plains. There, they hired a tow truck to fetch the car. </p>
<p>''The truck driver tried to yank the key out with Vise-Grips,'' Heydet said. 
''He managed to break it in two.'' </p>
<p>Thus, it was on to a locksmith in Madisonville. He not only tore the ignition 
assembly apart and removed the loose pieces, but then went to a nearby 
hardware store to make a new key. </p>
<p>Seven hours and $130 later, the two anglers were finally home. </p>
<p>And get this: </p>
<p>''The place where Ed and I were stranded is only about 50 yards from 
where I'd parked eight years ago,'' said Heydet. ''My wife gave me plenty of 
good-natured grief about that. But she got hers. Two days later, she called 
me. She'd locked her own keys in the car.'' </p>
<p>Heydet had to drive into downtown, through rush-hour traffic, to come to 
the rescue. </p>
<p>But I'll bet he chuckled fiendishly every inch of the way. </p>

<p><!--dateline--><br>
<font size=5>I</font>f Leonard Bell's gray, 1989 Dodge pickup truck ever gets stolen, the cops 
won't have to mess with an official description. </p>
<p>All they'll need to do is glance at the calendar. </p>
<p>Bell's truck is a traveling holiday extravaganza. Depending on the time of 
year, it'll either be a Halloween exhibit, a Christmas scene, a Valentine 
display or an Easter showcase, overrun with rabbits. </p>
<p>Right now, his buggy is festooned with pumpkins, witches, black cats and 
goblins. If you happen to spot Leonard as he drives from his home off Oak 
Ridge Highway to his job at the U.S. Postal Service facility on Weisgarber 
Road, you'll know it. Indeed, you can't miss it. </p>
<p>The plastic pumpkins in the rear of the bed stand more than 21/2 feet tall. 
There are smaller ones along the rim of the bed. If it's at night, everything will 
be glowing, thanks to wires running from his headlight switch. </p>
<p>''I've been doing this for the last 10 or 12 years,'' said Bell, who confesses a 
greater-than-average fondness for the holidays. Any holidays. </p>
<p>''I got the idea from an ol' boy who used to drive a mail truck from Atlanta. 
He showed up one day in October with a lighted, plastic pumpkin in his cab. 
I thought it looked pretty neat, so I decided to decorate my own truck.'' </p>
<p>That was then. This is now. </p>
<p>After Gawd-Hisself-only-knows-how-many trips to Wal-Mart, Kmart and 
Target, Leonard and Mary Bell surely own Knoxville's largest private supply 
of plastic holiday ornaments. Each piece is attached to a metal frame which 
is bolted to the bed. Bell says he can completely rig the truck in about 25 
minutes. </p>
<p>''I just keep everything stored in the basement till it's time for a new holiday,'' 
he said. </p>
<p>Bell brought out his Halloween display the first of October. It goes back into 
hiding the first of November. The day after Thanksgiving, out will come his 
Christmas wares: Santa Claus in a sleigh, a pair of three-foot-long reindeer 
''flying'' over the cab, plus a couple of Frosty Snowmen riding alongside. </p>
<p>Around the first of February, two large red plastic hearts take center stage; 
or rear, as the case may be. But when Easter rolls around, he gets really 
serious. </p>
<p>''I usually wind up with 20 to 25 rabbits in the back of the truck,'' Bell says, 
lending credence to the reproductive powers of bunnies, plastic or 
otherwise. </p>
<p>Officially, the Bells have three grown children and five grandchildren. But 
during the Christmas season, they ''adopt'' wee ones by the dozens. </p>
<p>''Whenever Mary sees inexpensive toys on sale during the summer, she buys 
them up,'' he told me. ''It's just little stuff -- cars, trucks, crayons. Then we 
drive around the malls and shopping centers and hand 'em out to the kids we 
see. That's how I spend my vacation.'' </p>
<p>Any plans for expansion to other holidays? </p>
<p>''I'd really like to fix up my truck for Thanksgiving, but I haven't been able to 
find a plastic turkey,'' he replied. ''My wife tells me not to worry, though. 
She says there's a great big turkey behind the steering wheel.'' </p>

<p><!--dateline--><br>
<font size=5>B</font>y golly, it is true what they say about plumbers: They're never around 
when you need one. </p>
<p>I searched desperately for a plumber for three days, but not because of 
busted pipes or a clogged sink. I needed to find out how to celebrate 
National Toilet Repair Month. </p>
<p>Yes, children. This glorious moment called October -- the home of brisk 
mornings, radiant sunsets, football homecomings, weenie roasts, brilliant 
foliage and crisp apples -- has been officially designated National Toilet 
Repair Month. So don't just stand there grinning, for Pete's sake! Go grab a 
mop! </p>
<p>There is commercial method to this madness, of course. Always is. That's 
why we have hundreds of ''official'' months every year. </p>
<p>The culprit in this instance is a California company that makes toilet 
replacement parts. Its name is Fluidmaster, and I wouldn't touch that line 
with a 10-foot plunger. </p>
<p>''October was selected because it is historically a strong sales period for 
toilet repair products,'' the company said in a news release. ''Many 
homeowners need repairs completed prior to holiday events and the arrival 
of house guests.'' </p>
<p>The announcement also carried a rousing battle cry from Fluidmaster's vice 
president for sales and marketing, Bob Connell: ''Why should snazzy 
showerheads and deluxe countertops get all the attention? Perhaps it's too 
easy to take a well-tuned toilet for granted.'' </p>
<p>Frankly, I've never given showerheads and countertops, snazzy and deluxe 
or otherwise, one whit of attention. But Bob seemed so sincere, I hated to 
dampen his enthusiasm. That's why I decided to check with some local 
plumbers and see what they had in mind for the big gala. </p>
<p>It's also why I remembered the old saw about never finding a plumber. 
These folks must have work piled up to their O-rings, for none was 
immediately available; they were all out on a job. </p>
<p>Alas, when they did get back to the shop and return my call, I realized they'd 
been too busy with valves and pipes to watch the calendar. Plumber Dave 
Powell said it best: ''National Toilet Repair Month? Never heard of it.'' </p>
<p>But don't think these wild and crazy guys can't party down with the best of 
'em when given an opportunity. </p>
<p>''The best way to celebrate is to put up a lawn ornament,'' said Mark Rose. 
''Since we always decorate a tree at Christmas, I reckon we could haul an 
old commode into the yard and wrap it with toilet paper. Maybe stick a 
toilet brush on top, like a star.'' </p>
<p>Henry Carson suggested a party for plumbers. ''We could all swap pipe 
wrenches,'' he said. </p>
<p>George Jones, business manager of Plumbers and Steam Fitters Local 102, 
proposed an essay contest to determine customer preference in toilet height 
and seat warmth. </p>
<p>''Anything to stay on top of the market,'' he told me. ''We don't want folks 
going back to little wooden shacks.'' </p>
<p>All good suggestions. But the award for originality surely goes to Dick 
Cubberley: </p>
<p>''I say we throw a 'pot' luck dinner.'' </p>

				<FONT SIZE="+3"><B>Checkers champ to play all day at Homecoming</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
				<FONT size="-1"><I>By Sam Venable, Columnist</I></FONT><P>
				<FONT SIZE="-1"><!--dateline--></FONT></DIV></B><BR>
				<FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT>ike any player about to engage in intense competition, Bob Butler knows a glance at an opponent&#39;s equipment can often be intimidating.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s sorta like how hustlers operate around a pool hall,&#39;&#39; Butler drawls around the stub of a well-chewed cigar.
<P>   &#39;&#39;If a feller talks his way into a game of eight-ball and then walks out to the car for his own cue, his opponents think, &#39;uh-oh&#39;. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean he&#39;s going to win. But it does show he&#39;s been around the game for awhile.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Butler&#39;s been around a game for quite awhile himself. Roughly 65 of his 70 years.
<P>   Thus, when he extracts his aged green-and-white checkerboard and sits down to play, the lads of the red-and-black ilk start to gulp and think a few &#39;&#39;uh-ohs&#39;&#39; of their own.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Oldtimers like me always use green and white,&#39;&#39; says Butler. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s easier on the eyes. That makes a lot of difference after you&#39;ve played checkers for eight or nine hours straight.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Eight or nine hours won&#39;t touch the agenda Butler faces this week. From Wednesday morning until Sunday night, he&#39;ll be taking on all comers at the 17th Fall Homecoming festival at the Museum of Appalachia in Norris.
<P>   Last year, for instance, he played 106 games during Students Day on Wednesday. Without a single loss.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I had to have some help that day,&#39;&#39; Butler chuckled. &#39;&#39;Quinton East of Oak Ridge came along with me. He played over 100 games with those kids himself. He&#39;ll be helping me again this year.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Butler has been starring at checkerboards -- and jumping and being crowned -- since his childhood in the tiny Bogard community at the foot of English Mountain. At home and at the local country store, he learned from the experts.
<P>   &#39;&#39;My grandfather, John McGaha, was the best player in Cocke County,&#39;&#39; Butler said. &#39;&#39;My uncle, Beecher McGaha, was the second-best.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Checkers was immensely popular in those slow-paced days before television, video games, shopping malls and other attractions of modern living.
<P>   But Butler cited another reason that&#39;s often overlooked when folks wax nostalgic about the not-so-good ol&#39; days: &#39;&#39;Unfortunately, a lot of people had too much time on their hands. There was an economic depression going on. Checkers helped pass a lot of time around here before things picked up.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Butler spent his working career as an electrician, traveling all over the United States on construction jobs. Invariably, a checkers game would erupt during off hours.
<P>   Then again, maybe not always strictly &#39;&#39;off.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;Once, we were working at this powerhouse, and a bunch of us started a game,&#39;&#39; he recalled. &#39;&#39;I made a board out of cardboard. We used nuts and washers for checkers.&#39;&#39;
<P>   And where did this game take place?
<P>   &#39;&#39;I ain&#39;t tellin&#39;!&#39;&#39; he laughed.
<P>   A longtime member of the American Checkers Federation, Butler estimates he has won 20,000 games throughout his life.
<P>   &#39;&#39;But I probably lost that many too,&#39;&#39; he pointed out. &#39;&#39;You gotta lose a lot to learn how to win.&#39;&#39;
<P>   He has participated in tournaments throughout the South. In 1972, he reached the pinnacle of his success by winning the majors division national tournament in Memphis.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The next highest division is masters,&#39;&#39; Butler said. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ll never get to that level. There aren&#39;t but about 40 masters in the world.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Even though students on a school field trip to the Museum of Appalachia may enjoy playing checkers with him, Butler acknowledges it&#39;s an ol&#39; timers game. And will always be.
<P>   &#39;&#39;For one reason, it&#39;s a pretty hard game to learn to play correctly,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Two, it&#39;s not a spectator sport. Three, it takes too long to play. Four, it doesn&#39;t have the worldwide appeal that chess does. And five, you don&#39;t ever see it on TV.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Even for someone like me who really enjoys checkers, that&#39;d be boring as hell to watch!&#39;&#39;

				<FONT SIZE="-1"><!--dateline--></FONT></DIV></B><BR>
				<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>&#39;m giving you fair warning right now.
<P>   Go check the antifreeze level in your car. Repair or replace your snow shovel. Lay in a good supply of firewood, candles, canned goods, flashlight batteries, blankets and books.
<P>   It&#39;s fixing to snow. Big time.
<P>   Hmmm, now that I&#39;ve brought the subject up, why not go all the way and react like a typical East Tennessean in the face of such news?
<P>   Jump up and scream, &#39;&#39;Yeiiiii! We&#39;re all gonna die!&#39;&#39; Then run -- do not walk -- to the nearest grocery store and buy every roll of toilet tissue in sight. Plus 30-40 dozen eggs, 50 loaves of bread, a case of peanut butter and at least one keg of beer.
<P>   There. Feel better? You won&#39;t four months from now, unfortunately. We&#39;ll all be up to our armpits in snow by then.
<P>   There&#39;s no way to escape it. Even if you hop in your car and blaze a trail southward toward the Florida or Louisiana coasts, the hateful cold weather will seek you out.
<P>   Sorry to ruin the start of Indian summer this way. I realize that right now, the only thoughts drifting through your head involve blue skies, red leaves and orange jerseys. But facts are facts. I just perused a long-range weather forecast in the 1997 Baer&#39;s Agricultural Almanac, and it doesn&#39;t look good for February around here.
<P>   The Baer people have been in the almanac business since 1825, so you know they&#39;ve had plenty of practice. Look in any history book and see for yourself: Hasn&#39;t it been hot, cold, wet, dry, snowy, rainy and foggy around the United States since 1825? I rest my, and Baer&#39;s, case.
<P>   Baer&#39;s has devoted more than 20 pages to moon charts and weather forecasts for 1997. In that entire space, though, Tennessee is mentioned only four times.
<P>   The way I figure it, that means we&#39;re going to escape most of the bad stuff. But on those rare occasions where we are cited by name, we&#39;d better pay very close attention.
<P>   The first notation is Feb. 8-11. That&#39;s when snow should come roaring out of Arkansas and cover everything from Tennessee to the Atlantic coast. Temperatures will warm shortly thereafter, but be not fooled. On Feb. 20-23, another blizzard will sink its icy teeth into our hides. This time, it&#39;ll come from Oklahoma and Kansas and howl toward the Atlantic coast directly by way of You-Know-Where.
<P>   We get a break after that, assuming Baer&#39;s is correct. Thanks to the omission of Tennessee, I can only assume we shall trip lightly into spring and early summer, enjoying a meteorological era of peace, tranquility and prosperity not visited upon the motherland since the dawn of creation.
<P>   But between August 16 and 18, look out. That&#39;s when huge thunderstorm will come belching out of the Great Lakes, spreading into Arkansas, Tennessee and the Carolinas. So while you&#39;re laying in all those winter supplies, it might not hurt to buy an extra umbrella.
<P>   You&#39;ll surely need it Sept. 12-15. That&#39;s when a second round of T-storms is due to strike Kentucky and Tennessee.
<P>   But at least there&#39;s one consolation. That&#39;s an open date for the Vols.

<!--SUBHEAD-->        <p><font size="2"><i>By Sam Venable, Columnist</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">F</font>orget what your preacher and
        accountant have been saying all these years. </p>
        <p>You're going to have to find a way to take it with
        you. </p>
        <p>At least that's the prospect facing the residents of
        Colma, Calif. The town is considering an initiative that
        would require a $5 business tax on each grave in a
        cemetery. </p>
        <p>We are not talking about a one-time deal. We are
        talking $5 a year from now on. </p>
        <p>Actually, the idea is not as crazy as it seems, even
        by California standards. </p>
        <p>From what I've read about the situation, cemeteries
        occupy the vast majority of land in Colma -- roughly 75
        percent of the town's area. Nearly one million bodies
        have been buried there since 1887. City leaders are trying
        to find a way for cemeteries to bear more of the cost of
        keeping the lights on. </p>
        <p>As you might expect, people in the cemetery business
        are not amused. </p>
        <p>I thought Steve Doukas, general manager of Colma's
        Greek Orthodox Memorial Park and Greenlawn Memorial Park,
        summed up the opposition best: ''This proposal is an
        abuse of people who can no longer stand up to defend
        themselves.'' </p>
        <p>That's telling 'em, Steve. But on the other hand, what
        else are these folks supposed to do? Take it lying down? </p>
        <p>Think about it. If this thing passes, it could
        revolutionize the funeral business. </p>
        <p>When Uncle Ferd kicks off, his headstone will have to
        be equipped with a slot to hold $5 bills. That way, the
        tax collector can pluck one out as he wanders through
        each cemetery. </p>
        <p>Or, if Uncle Ferd lived in cyberspace before entering
        eternal rest, mayhaps his ATM card could be left out for
        an easy withdrawal from his checking account. </p>
        <p>It's going to change the way grieving friends comfort
        the family, as well. No more sending floral arrangements.
        Instead, they'll chip in to make money trees. </p>
        <p>''I always liked ol' Ferd. Here's 10 bucks to see him
        through another couple of years.'' </p>
        <p>What I don't understand, though, is how the city
        expects to enforce a law like this. What are they going
        to do with cheats, scofflaws and other miscreants who
        evade the rules? </p>
        <p>Dig 'em up and kick 'em out? </p>
        <p>Send 'em to prison? </p>
        <p>Chain 'em together and make 'em pick up trash on the
        side of a highway? </p>
        <p>Hold 'em at a city pound -- like illegally parked cars
        that have been towed in -- until somebody in the family
        coughs up the cash? </p>
        <p>And think how future tax increases will be handled. I
        can just hear some TV anchor reading the news: ''In our
        top story tonight, the government announced today that
        the cost of living, and dying, rose 7 percent last year .
        . . .'' </p>
        <p>My advice to the people in Colma, Calif., is to stay
        healthy, whatever the cost. How can any pension, savings
        account, stock portfolio or retirement plan prevent the
        certain bankruptcy of $5 a year for eternity? </p>
        <p>If they die, they'll surely go belly up. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">A</font> few days ago I told you to gird
        your loins, not to mention other portions of your
        anatomy, for a whizbanger February, complete with at least
        two major snows. </p>
        <p>Apparently my warning wasn't strong enough. </p>
        <p>''The bad weather is going to come sooner than
        February,'' says Marie Weaver of Knoxville. ''Say, around
        Thanksgiving.'' </p>
        <p>So stop whatever you're doing right now. I don't care
        if the thermometer says 69 and you got a sunburn over the
        weekend. Nor do I care if you have big plans for the
        Thanksgiving holidays. You're just going to have to put
        everything on hold until this frightful weather lets up.
        If not and you wind up shriveling into a giant blob of
        frozen protoplasm while attempting to gnaw on a turkey
        leg or sip some eggnog, don't come running to me. Or Marie. </p>
        <p>If you recall, I took my forecast from Baer's
        Agricultural Almanac, which has been making
        meteorological prognostications since 1825. But Marie went
        to the supreme source: </p>
        <p>Wooly worms. </p>
        <p>Frankly, I don't know why wooly worms are supposed to
        be so all-fired smart when it comes to winter weather
        predictions. I mean, why can't other animals get a crack
        at it? </p>
        <p>You never hear anybody say, ''Oh, it's going to be a
        tough winter, all right; just look at the rabbits.'' Nor
        squirrels, goldfinches, mosquitoes, rattlesnakes or
        aardvarks, either. Instead, it's always wooly worms. </p>
        <p>And while I'm at it, how come it's always winter
        weather that gets foretold? </p>
        <p>You never hear anybody say, ''Boy, next summer's going
        to be long and hot and dry; just look at the wooly
        worms.'' </p>
        <p>But I digress. Indeed, I must digress if Marie and her
        wooly worms expect to have their say. </p>
        <p>''The wooly worms are half-black and their rear end
        doesn't have much black on it,'' says Marie. </p>
        <p>Pardon me, but I must digress again. </p>
        <p>What color are the wooly worms supposed to be if we're
        going to have a mild, pleasant winter? Pink and
        chartreuse, mayhaps? And wearing cute little bikinis?
        When you are not intimately involved with wooly worms,
        you don't know what signs to look for. </p>
        <p>''This means we won't have any spring again,'' she
        says. ''We'll just jump right into summer.'' </p>
        <p>As for the emergency supplies I recommended stocking
        up on? Forget it, says Marie. </p>
        <p>''You can get the books and flashlight batteries, but
        forget about the other stuff (such as food) because the
        power will be off, so we can't eat. </p>
        <p>''After the worst of the weather is over, we can make
        a beeline to the Laundromat and load 15 washers -- never
        mind that there is a line from there to Dogpatch. At
        least we will be clean for a few days. Until the next one
        hits.'' </p>
        <p>There is one other thing Marie says we all should do
        before East Tennessee is swallowed by winter: Wish
        everyone Happy Holidays. </p>
        <p>As she put it, ''The mail won't be able to run, and I
        wouldn't want to be late.'' </p>
        <p>Gosh dang. And I had such high hopes of watching
        Tennessee play in a bowl game. </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">I</font>f you have visited any
        supermarket, department store, shopping mall, factory
        outlet or discount house recently, you surely know
        Halloween is fast approaching. </p>
        <p>By ''fast approaching,'' I mean Halloween actually
        arrives within two weeks. In matters of holidays, ''fast
        approaching'' differs from ''approaching'' by a full
        month. </p>
        <p>Around Sept. 17, for example, Halloween begins
        ''approaching.'' That's when it leaves the ''on the
        horizon'' stage it has occupied since Aug. 17. But don't
        take my word for it. Ask any retailer. </p>
        <p>Conscientious home owners must be fully prepared for
        the big event. There is nothing more embarrassing than
        being caught empty-handed, and I'm not talking Baby
        Ruths. </p>
        <p>I'm talking about the really important stuff: </p>
        <p>Legal preparedness. </p>
        <p>That's why I sought the advice of Horace L.
        Horsehiney. </p>
        <p>As regular visitors to this column know, Mr.
        Horsehiney is director of the red tape division of the
        U.S. Department of Meaningless Erratic Dumb Details and
        Lunatic Excesses (MEDDLE). It's his thankless job to
        point out the boneheaded mistakes we mortals often make
        when planning for a holiday. </p>
        <p>Mr. Horsehiney presented three recommendations for a
        tort-free Halloween when neighborhood munchkins come
        around for their annual shakedown of sweets: </p>
        <p>1. Approach to the house. To avoid the possibility
        that costumed tykes might trip and fall between the
        street and your house, remove all trees, shrubs and
        bushes within 25 feet of any walkway and repave the
        entire driveway and sidewalk to cover any hairline cracks
        and uneven areas. </p>
        <p>Install lights at three-foot intervals along each
        route, as well as handrails -- padded and rounded on all
        corners. </p>
        <p>Finally, make sure that illuminated signs saying
        ''Please Watch Your Step,'' audibly and visibly, in
        English, Spanish and French are erected along each thoroughfare. </p>
        <p>2. Greeting the visitors. Since youngsters must stand
        on their tippy toes and stretch to reach a conventional
        doorbell -- thus subjecting their developing tendons and
        ligaments to all manner of strains, tears and
        overextensions -- home owners should spend the hours of 6
        and 11 p.m. positioned just inside the front door,
        listening for the approach of little feet. That way, they can
        open the door just as the kiddies step onto the porch. </p>
        <p>Don't open it too quickly, of course, lest they be
        startled. </p>
        <p>And by all means, none of the crude business of
        emitting a loud ''Boo!'' or other harsh noise. This could
        come back to haunt the home owner 35 years later when the
        tyke, undergoing analysis by a psychologist, recalls the incident
        in a flashback of horror. </p>
        <p>3. Presenting the goods. Use only commercially
        prepared treats that are hermetically sealed in a minimum
        of 12 layers of shrink wrap, boxed at the factory and
        secured with a government-approved padlock and label attesting
        they are free of contaminants. </p>
        <p>Before handing out each treat, home owners must also
        read aloud (again in English, Spanish and French) the fat
        grams, calories, cholesterol and vitamin content of each
        goody and make parents sign a waiver absolving the home owner
        of any future medical liability should consumption of the
        treat initiate tooth decay or weight gain. </p>
        <p>These three items are mere guidelines. For complete
        details, have your lawyer procure and inspect MEDDLE's
        1,475-page Halloween regulations for 1996. </p>
        <p>It's for your own good. After all, you're the one who
        could wind up getting sued. </p>
        <p>As Mr. Horsehiney pointed out, ''Our goal at MEDDLE is
        to make certain that holidays like Halloween remain the
        same safe, exciting -- and innocent -- celebrations we
        all remember as children.'' </p>

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">W</font>hether it's Bob Dole and Bill
        Clinton engaged in a presidential debate, or John and
        Jane Doe discussing family matters over the breakfast table,
        clarity is the key to effective communication. </p>
        <p>It's like your daddy used to preach: ''Say what you
        mean and mean what you say.'' </p>
        <p>A simple rule? Of course. Yet speakers, public and
        private, violate it all the time. Just ask anyone who's
        ever endured a staff meeting. </p>
        <p>The best illustration of miscommunication I've ever
        seen was recently given to me by a reader. It's one of
        those multi-photocopied stories that gets passed from
        friend to friend. I tried, to no avail, to find its
        source. So if you wrote it, sue me. </p>
        <p>The story involves an old-fashioned woman who was
        delicate and elegant, particularly in matters of
        language. She and her husband were planning a long
        vacation to Florida, so she wrote to a campground and
        asked for a reservation. </p>
        <p>She wanted to make sure the campground was fully
        equipped but didn't know how to ask about toilet
        facilities. She just couldn't bring herself to write the
        word ''toilet.'' After much deliberation, she finally
        came up with the old-fashioned term, ''bathroom
        commode.'' </p>
        <p>Still, she was uncomfortable. So she rewrote her
        entire letter, referring to the bathroom commode by
        initials. </p>
        <p>''Does the campground have its own B.C.?'' is the way
        she phrased it. </p>
        <p>The campground owner wasn't old-fashioned. He had no
        idea what the lady was talking about. After worrying with
        the letter for awhile, he showed it to several campers.
        They couldn't decipher ''B.C.'' either. </p>
        <p>Finally, he came to the conclusion it meant ''Baptist
        Church.'' </p>
        <p>So he sat down and wrote the following: </p>
        <p>''I regret taking so long replying to your letter, but
        I finally have an answer to your question. Yes, we have a
        B.C. It is located nine miles north of the campground and
        is capable of seating 250 people at one time. It sits in
        a beautiful pine grove and is open on Sundays and
        Wednesdays. </p>
        <p>''I admit nine miles is quite a distance away if you
        are in the habit of going regularly, but you will be
        pleased to know quite a number of people take their
        lunches with them and make a day of it. They usually
        arrive early and stay late. In fact, my daughter met her
        husband at the B.C. </p>
        <p>''The last time my wife and I went was six years ago,
        and it was so crowded we had to stand up the entire time.
        Sometimes it is so crowded there are five to a seat. It
        may interest you to know there is a supper planned to
        raise money for more seating. </p>
        <p>''It pains me very much not to be able to go more
        regularly, but it surely is not due to lack of desire on
        my part. It seems to be more of an effort to go as we get
        older, particularly in cold weather. </p>
        <p>''If you do decide to come to our campground, perhaps
        I could go to the B.C. with you the first time, sit with
        you, and introduce you to the other folks. We will be
        sure to have you a seat in front where you can be seen by everyone.'' </p>
        <p>Hoo-boy. And you thought the presidential debate was
        confusing? </p>

<font size=5>I</font>f you see David Hodson at Lynnhurst Cemetery next Sunday morning, I 
guarantee he'll have a smile on his face and a News-Sentinel in his hand. </p>
<p>He'll be there on a very important mission: To relay the news of Tennessee's 
football victory over arch-rival Alabama to his brother, Dennis. </p>
<p>But what if -- perish the thought -- Tennessee should lose next Saturday's 
contest? </p>
<p>''I'm not going out to the cemetery,'' Hodson replied. ''I don't want Dennis to 
know. He was always hard to live with after a loss.'' </p>
<p>To fully understand this story, you need to be a card-carrying, flag-waving, 
cheer-yelling Big Orange fan. That's what Dennis Hodson was for most of 
his 46 years. </p>
<p>''Dennis and I started hanging around UT when we were kids,'' said David, 
his younger brother by 21/2 years. ''We were selling Cokes, hot dogs and 
souvenirs at the football games by the time we were teenagers. I don't 
believe he missed a single home game from that time on. He had season 
tickets for at least 20 years, maybe longer.'' </p>
<p>Dennis, who worked in the meter department at KUB, often followed the 
Vols on the road. He did it in style behind the wheel of an orange and white 
Chevrolet pickup truck. </p>
<p>As any Tennessee stalwart can attest, Alabama is the evil empire, the land of 
the sworn enemy. Every time the Tide defeated UT -- which was often -- it 
cut like a sword into the center of Dennis' heart. </p>
<p>''He had some good friends in Alabama, and they'd all get together for the 
big game every year,'' David remembered. ''Each time, Dennis would say, 
'This is our year.' '' </p>
<p>Most of the time, unfortunately, it wasn't. The last time Dennis witnessed a 
Vol victory was in 1985 when Tennessee prevailed, 16-14. </p>
<p>Dennis Hodson died quite suddenly in 1993. </p>
<p>''He was the picture of health,'' David recalled. ''Then one day, he started 
getting sick. At first, the doctors thought it was kidney stones. They ran 
some tests and discovered he had colon cancer. It was quick. Five months 
after the disease was diagnosed, he was dead.'' </p>
<p>The Vols' losing ways continued. Well, yes, technically the 1993 game 
ended in a 17-17 tie that later became a win when Alabama was placed on 
NCAA sanctions. But that wasn't cause for great celebration. In '94, the 
Tide picked up where it had left off, winning 17-13. </p>
<p>Then came last season and a 41-14 Bama gut-stomping at the hands of 
Tennessee. </p>
<p>''I can just imagine how happy Dennis would have been,'' said David. ''That's 
why I did it.'' </p>
<p>What David did, bright and early the next morning, was drive to his brother's 
grave and leave copies of all the game stories, sidebars, headlines, statistics, 
photographs, the works. </p>
<p>''I used 6-inch landscaping staples to secure everything to the ground all 
around his grave,'' said David. ''I came back Thursday that same week, and 
it was all still there.'' </p>
<p>Did his brother read the glorious news? </p>
<p>''Why, I'm sure of it,'' David replied. ''He read every word.'' </p>

        <p>Between them, the new Mr. and Mrs. Hall have nine
        children, 25 grandchildren, 36 great-grandchildren and
        three great-great-grandchildren. </p>
        <p>How'd you like to have been in charge of refreshments
        for that crew? </p>
        <p>The bride and groom each are 87 years old. He's a
        retired Baptist preacher. She's a retired homemaker. </p>
        <p>Rev. Hall's first wife, Parlie Ann Hall, died last
        December. They had been married 69 years. The new Mrs.
        Hall was married for 38 years to Charles Story Sr. He
        died in 1970. </p>
        <p>* Recorded messages at business and government offices
        -- ''if you want such-and-such, press 4'' -- are an
        ever-present, and aggravating, part of daily life. </p>
        <p>Knoxvillian Margaret Cooper knows that. But she heard
        a first the other day when she dialed the Social Security
        Administration's 800 number. </p>
        <p>Here's the first directive she heard: ''To continue
        your call, please press 1.'' </p>
        <p>I tried it myself. Yup, same response. </p>
        <p>Amazing. You dial 11 numbers and then are told if you
        really, seriously, honest-to-gosh are interested in
        calling, you've got to dial one more. </p>
        <p>I wish somebody had asked about that during last
        week's presidential debate. </p>
        <p>* Ray Hubbard of Louisville inquires, ''How come when
        somebody's giving you directions that involve a traffic
        signal, they always say, 'Turn at the red light'? </p>
        <p>''What are you supposed to do if the light is green?
        Turn the opposite direction?'' </p>
        <p>Hmmm. That's another question I wish someone had asked
        at the debate. </p>
        <p>* Volena Maples, vice mayor of Lenoir City, wonders if
        Loudon County might be the nickname capital of the United
        States. </p>
        <p>She sent me a list of more than 200 nicknames of local
        residents. It was divided into 11 categories including
        animals (Kitty Sowards and Monk Early, for instance),
        sounds (Hoot Brown and Meow Burns), birds (Rooster
        Luttrell and Buzzard Neely) and foods (Butter Nelson and
        Beans Lane). </p>
        <p>Just think how much more interesting the presidential
        debate would have been if the questions had been asked to
        Big Daddy Dole and Cricket Clinton. </p>
        <p>* BIRD PARTS I: Even though everyone in America is
        required to eat at least 27 pounds of Halloween candy
        before entertaining thoughts of Thanksgiving, the
        Butterball Turkey Talk Hotline folks (1-800-323-4848) are
        already fielding calls. </p>
        <p>Two of the better ones logged -- I am not making this
        up -- were from the man who wanted to know if it was OK
        to use suntan oil to baste a turkey and the woman who
        asked if turkeys come from eggs. </p>
        <p>The answers, in order: no, yes. </p>
        <p>* BIRD PARTS II: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
        somehow got my name from a list of hunting license buyers
        and asked me to submit wings and tail feathers of ducks
        and geese I shoot this fall and winter. </p>
        <p>It's part of an annual survey the feds make to get a
        feel for the number, age and sex of waterfowl being
        bagged across the nation. They even sent me a bunch of
        heavy-duty envelopes for my, uh, ''replies.'' </p>
        <p>I don't mind participating in the project. I know it's
        the only way waterfowl managers can gather this type of
        biological information. Thousands of hunters are randomly
        picked to take part. </p>
        <p>But every time I swing by the post office and drop one
        of those body-part envelopes into a box, I can't help
        wondering if any hunters named ''Dahmer'' were asked to
        participate. </p>

				<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>s the presidential campaigns wind to a close, it&#39;s safe to assume Tennessee&#39;s contributions to the White House have been preached in elementary and high school classes from Memphis to Mountain City.
<P>   But here&#39;s a tidbit of Tennessee history I&#39;ll bet most teachers overlooked: At least two of our homegrown presidents were rotten to the core.
<P>   Before the DAR gets its crinolines in a crease and bashes down my door, let me hasten to point out that I&#39;m not talking about rotten administrations or rotten policies.
<P>   I&#39;m talking about rotten teeth.
<P>   Andrew Jackson suffered a lifetime of dental woes and had all his teeth extracted. Andrew Johnson was similarly plagued and often avoided public speaking because of pursed lips and a tendency to drool. James K. Polk likely had poor teeth too, but there are no records to prove it.
<P>   And while we&#39;re on the subject of pitiful presidential pearlies, chew on this: No matter what Miss Axehandle told you to the contrary in the 7th grade, George Washington did not have wooden teeth.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Washington&#39;s dentures were made of elephant and hippopotamus ivory,&#39;&#39; says Dr. Jack Ragsdale. &#39;&#39;They had a wooden dowel that ran throughout. That&#39;s probably where the myth comes from.&#39;&#39;
<P>   So how come Hizzoner is pictured frowning all the time?
<P>   &#39;&#39;He couldn&#39;t smile,&#39;&#39; Ragsdale replies. &#39;&#39;The upper and lower parts were connected by coil springs. If he opened his mouth, the dentures would literally fly open and come out.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Jack Ragsdale, 72, may know more about presidential mouths than Deep Throat ever dreamed. A native West Tennessean who took his undergraduate degree from Vanderbilt and DDS from University of Tennessee-Memphis, he practiced general dentistry in Illinois for 35 years. Since retirement, Ragsdale has combined his professional knowledge with a love of American history, poring over reams of presidential papers in search of something with teeth in it.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It all started in 1980 when I was preparing a Toastmasters speech on President Washington&#39;s dentures,&#39;&#39; Ragsdale told me via telephone from his home in Canton, Ill. &#39;&#39;I wanted to put that wooden-tooth myth to rest. The more information I gathered, the more interested I became.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Ever since, he&#39;s been combing records at the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution, sifting documents at various presidential libraries around the country, and pecking through data on the Internet. The result is &#39;&#39;a couple of file cases full&#39;&#39; of data he hopes some day to compile into a book called, &#39;&#39;Smile, Mr. President.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Among his findings:
<P>   * Just before a dentist in Washington, D.C., prepared to yank one of Abraham Lincoln&#39;s choppers, Abe produced a bottle of chloroform from his own coat pocket and took three or four deep whiffs. Apparently for naught. The procedure still hurt like the dickens.
<P>   * Herbert Hoover made more than 300 visits to the dentist during his life.
<P>   * Harry Truman may have had the best working relationship with dentists of any president, often changing his schedule to accommodate whatever the doc could arrange.
<P>   * Lyndon Johnson was just the opposite, making a dentist twiddle his thumbs for hours before showing up to get his teeth polished for a TV appearance. It was a wasted effort all the way around, for LBJ&#39;s teeth were small and rarely showed when he spoke.
<P>   * Despite his famous smile that political cartoonists dearly loved to exaggerate, Jimmy Carter has irregular teeth. Th&#39;Grin once took his dentist&#39;s order to floss too seriously, almost abrading his teeth.
<P>   * Jack Kennedy loathed visits from the presidential dentist. He&#39;d keep one foot on the floor all the time. If the doc turned around twice, JFK was outta there.
