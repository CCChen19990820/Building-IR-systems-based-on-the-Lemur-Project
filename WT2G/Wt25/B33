        <font size="5">I</font>f you liked Ike or were madly for
        Adlai, you're probably quite lonely these days. </p>
        <p>Catchy political jingles and slogans have long since
        gone the way of Burma Shave signs and five-cent Cokes. If
        I'm not mistaken, Jimmy Carter's ''The Grin Will Win'' in
        1976 was the last decent campaign rhyme spoken from coast
        to coast. </p>
        <p>Ah, but back in the days of your father's politics,
        there were some gems. I perused Laurence Urdang's book,
        ''Slogans'' at Lawson McGhee Library the other day and
        found examples like: </p>
        <p>* ''Make the White House the Dwight House'' and ''The
        Mighty Tower -- Eisenhower.'' Dwight Eisenhower, 1952,
        1956. </p>
        <p>* ''Adlai and Estes are the bestes.'' Adlai Stevenson
        and Estes Kefauver, 1956. </p>
        <p>* ''My pick is Dick.'' Richard Nixon, 1960. </p>
        <p>* ''LBJ for the USA.'' Lyndon Johnson, 1964. </p>
        <p>But if you're looking for a jingle in the '90s, you'd
        better stick with grainy sit-coms on Nick At Night
        instead watching the 6 o'clock news. </p>
        <p>''It's something I hadn't thought much about, but it's
        true,'' said Dr. Bill Lyons, a political science
        professor at the University of Tennessee. ''Rhymes are
        relics.'' </p>
        <p>How come? </p>
        <p>''A variety of reasons,'' Lyons answered. ''They
        probably reached a saturation point with voters some
        years ago. In addition, jingles don't work as well on TV
        as they did on radio and on buttons. </p>
        <p>''For that matter, you don't see as many buttons and
        bumper stickers as you used to. Certainly not catchy
        ones. About all you see are the names of the candidates
        themselves. </p>
        <p>''A lot of campaigning is done by direct mail these
        days. Also, negative campaigning doesn't lend itself
        quite as well to jingles.'' </p>
        <p>I'm not so sure about that, prof. </p>
        <p>Flip through a few more pages of ''Slogans'' with me
        and you may recall some acidic zingers along the lines
        of: </p>
        <p>* ''In Hoover we trusted, now we are busted.''
        Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 1932. </p>
        <p>* ''Phooey on Dewey.'' Harry Truman, 1948. </p>
        <p>* ''Hari-Kari with Barry.'' Lyndon Johnson, 1964. </p>
        <p>* ''Nixon and Spiro -- Zero.'' Hubert Humphrey, 1968. </p>
        <p>For better or for worse, though, I'd like to see a
        jingle comeback. If Bob Dole can send the Dodgers back to
        Brooklyn, why can't we all turn back the clock a few
        years? </p>
        <p>Even yawners like ''I'm not hintin' -- I'm all for
        Clinton!'' or ''On a roll with Bob Dole!'' would be
        welcome. </p>
        <p>''Bill and Al -- they're my pal!'' mayhaps? </p>
        <p>No? Then how does ''Bob and Jack are on the right
        track!'' sound? </p>
        <p>Still no go? Then let's try it on the down-and-dirty
        side: </p>
        <p>''Throw Bill and Gore straight out the door!'' </p>
        <p>''Big bu$ine$$ $pent on Dole and Kemp!'' </p>
        <p>Hmmm. Yeah, you're right. They smell pretty bad. </p>
        <p>But not as much as the bovine-processed promises both
        candidates are delivering. </p>

				<FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT>espite what politicians, military leaders and business executives might argue to the contrary, bigger isn&#39;t always better.
<P>   This is particularly true with pumpkins.
<P>   Sure, those jumbo jobs are something to look at. They make great newspaper photos this time of year. And they&#39;re worth some serious money.
<P>   Nathan and Paula Zehr of Lowville, N.Y., won $50,000 earlier this month from the World Pumpkin Confederation. The Zehrs submitted a 1,061-pounder, the heaviest ever recorded.
<P>   Bill Greer of Picton, Ontario, also topped the half-ton mark. His entry, certified by the Greater Pumpkin Commonwealth, weighed 1,006 pounds and won $3,000.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Prize money is just the start,&#39;&#39; says George Kilgore, agricultural extension agent in Fentress County and an expert on whopper pumpkins. &#39;&#39;The endorsements from seed companies and fertilizer manufacturers can really kick it on up.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The difference between a thousand-pounder and your average store-bought pumpkin is about like that of a pea and a watermelon.
<P>   Kilgore says a typical pumpkin, like the millions that will glow as jack-o&#39;-lanterns on porches throughout America tonight, weighs only about 20 pounds -- even if it seemed like 100 when you carried it in from the car.
<P>   But, fortunately for homeowners, that is the relative beauty of an average pumpkin: Once Halloween&#39;s over, there&#39;s not much to get rid of.
<P>   You can stuff it into the trash, compost it or turn it into pies. Try doing that with one of those sumo wrestler specimens that didn&#39;t quite make the short list.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Scotty Blair grew one this summer that weighed 641 pounds,&#39;&#39; Kilgore said with a laugh. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s sittin&#39; outside his home in Allardt. There&#39;s just not much else you can do with a pumpkin that size.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Especially when the stink sets in.
<P>   You know how bad a standard pumpkin smells when it goes bad? Multiply that by several hundred pounds.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There ain&#39;t nothing you can step in that&#39;s any worse,&#39;&#39; said Steve Jones, a Clinton grower who supplies thousands of pumpkins for the East Tennessee market. &#39;&#39;A rotten pumpkin is sorta like a Christmas tree in February, but at least the tree doesn&#39;t smell bad.&#39;&#39;
<P>   This is when bigger becomes badder.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The worst story I&#39;ve ever heard happened a couple of years ago to Martha Foster,&#39;&#39; Jones related. &#39;&#39;Her husband, Lynn, is agent manager for the Farm Bureau here.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I took a couple of 200-pounders to a Farm Bureau meeting, and Lynn won one of them as a door prize. He lugged it home and put it in a display in his front yard.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Like fish and house guests, the pumpkin eventually wore out its welcome. Near Thanksgiving, the Fosters noticed it was getting a little flat, so Martha tried to roll it to the driveway where Lynn could haul it off.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It busted and she went head-first inside,&#39;&#39; said Jones. &#39;&#39;The way Lynn tells it, she went in up to her shoulders.&#39;&#39;
<P>   It was definitely a door prize to remember.

        <p><font size="2"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">D</font>eep thoughts that crossed my mind
        while I was engaged in hand-to-leaf combat: </p>
        <p>* This country can do without a five-cent cigar and a
        better mousetrap. But we desperately need a self-cleaning
        rake. </p>
        <p>Raking would be a much more enjoyable task if the
        hateful teeth wouldn't clog up every other stroke. </p>
        <p>It's bad enough when you are attacking mounds of big
        leaves like maple, oak or dogwood. At least they have the
        decency to give you a few swipes in relative comfort
        before balling up. </p>
        <p>But pine needles -- or ''pine straw,'' as some
        Southerners call this seasonal mess -- are a nightmare.
        Particularly the long, silky needles of white pines that
        shower down like a muddy waterfall. </p>
        <p>They might as well be iron filings and your rake a
        magnet. One pass and -- glooommm -- the rake is nothing
        but an amber fuzzball. You have to stop, pull the cussed
        things out, and make one more sweep before -- glooommm --
        everything jams up again. </p>
        <p>Between downsized cybernerds in California and nuclear
        physicists at Oak Ridge who don't have any more bombs to
        build, somebody oughta be able to design a rake that
        cleans itself. </p>
        <p>This close to election day, I'm surprised Bob Dole or
        Bill Clinton hasn't promised $50 million in rake
        research. </p>
        <p>* How come trees never grow until it's time to gather
        their leaves? </p>
        <p>You stick a sapling into the ground, stake it against
        the wind, water it faithfully and what happens? </p>
        <p>Nothing. The ingrate stands there twiddling its
        cambium, a fuzzy faced vegetative teenager who stubbornly
        refuses to mature. </p>
        <p>Then one October morning -- ziiiiiip -- that wimpy
        little broom switch suddenly evolves into a giant sequoia
        and drops 450 tons of leaves. By the next April --
        zuuuuuup -- it's back to a dwarf again. </p>
        <p>Botanists claim the process doesn't work this way, but
        don't believe 'em. I have seen this phenomenon occur,
        year after year, in my own yard. </p>
        <p>* Is this not the warmest autumn we've had in eons? </p>
        <p>A couple of days ago, I had to soak myself in
        repellent to keep the mosquitoes at bay. If this was the
        Deep South, perhaps I could understand. But clouds of
        skeeters in hillbilly East Tennessee in late October? </p>
        <p>And get this: I have two irises in the front yard that
        are pregnant with blooms, just like it was the first of
        May. </p>
        <p>I strongly suspect a link, direct or otherwise, to two
        consecutive victories over Alabama. </p>
        <p>* Since our yard contains many different species of
        deciduous trees that drop their leaves over a wide span
        of time, I ask myself this question every fall: </p>
        <p>Is it more efficient to make several light rakings as
        the leaves accumulate, or one mega-dose after the deed is
        finally done? </p>
        <p>I have tried both. And I've come to the conclusion
        that the best way is to pay someone else to do it. </p>

        <font size="5">C</font>onsider: </p>
        <p>* I was in the express line of a grocery store the
        other night, carrying a box of cereal and a half-gallon
        of milk. The clerk took one glance and said, ''Looks like
        you're doing the cooking tonight.'' We both chuckled and
        made small talk as the transaction was completed. </p>
        <p>* Driving away from the store, I reached an
        intersection and was preparing to turn left. As I rolled
        to a stop, another car approached from the left. Its blinker
        indicated the driver wanted to pull into my lane of
        traffic. I flicked my headlights to say ''OK.'' He
        accelerated and flicked his own headlights, ''Thanks.'' </p>
        <p>* On the road near home, I saw one of my neighbors
        standing under the light beside his garage. I toot-tooted
        my horn to convey ''Hi.'' He threw his head back to
        indicate ''Hi to you.'' </p>
        <p>Three typical events of everyday friendliness and
        courtesy, wouldn't you say? The sort of no-brainer
        manners your mama and daddy taught by example? </p>
        <p>Not according to The Wall Street Journal. </p>
        <p>To hear this learned publication tell it, our actions
        were ''primarily manipulative,'' designed to get what we
        wanted as quickly as possible. </p>
        <p>I am not making this up. Go look at last Tuesday's
        edition and see for yourself. </p>
        <p>A front-page article by WSJ staffer Eleena De Lisser
        described how Yankees who have moved to the South have
        found yet another quirk about Dixie that ticks them off:
        Courtesy. </p>
        <p>I quote from the article: </p>
        <p>''It's the most irritating thing I can think of,''
        complains Diane Kuhn, an ex-New Yorker now living in
        Nashville, referring to the South's idea of highway
        hospitality. ''Drivers will let 12 cars enter their lane.
        I say you let one in. Maybe. If you're in a good mood.'' </p>
        <p>There's more: ''On any given day in the melting-pot
        South, simple 'hellos' uttered by strangers perplex folks
        from elsewhere ('Who was that?'). 'Yes, ma'ams' and 'no,
        sirs' strike some outsiders not as signs of respect but
        as unwanted reminders of one's advancing age. Favors
        extended -- an offer to house-sit or an automobile ride
        across town -- arouse suspicion.'' </p>
        <p>And another: Tina Spencer, a Philadelphia native who
        now lives in Acworth, Ga., bristles when a checkout clerk
        engages her in conversation: ''First you try to give them
        The Look and don't respond. But there are times I've had
        to physically take stuff out of their hands to stop the
        chitchat.'' </p>
        <p>It's nothing new, of course. Those of us who grew up

        invaders. </p>
        <p>We've been told dozens of times how much faster the
        snow is removed where they came from. And how much better
        the streets are. And how much more progressive the
        schools are. And how everyone's a much better driver. </p>
        <p>And now, we buffoons discover, human life is better Up
        Yonder because the people are rude. </p>
        <p>I defer to the late Louis Grizzard's marvelous
        comeback for such instances: ''Delta is ready when you
        are.'' </p>
        <p>And Honey, we'd be more than happy to give y'all
        directions to the airport. </p>

				<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n the entrepreneurial spirit of the 1990s, I officially claim, as personal and exclusive property, the following 25 excuses for not voting today:
<P>   1. One vote won&#39;t make any difference.
<P>   2. All the candidates are basically alike.
<P>   3. All politicians are crooked, so why bother giving them another opportunity to rip me off?
<P>   4. The weather is going to be bad, and I don&#39;t want to get (fill in blank) wet, cold, windblown.
<P>   5. The weather is going to be good, and I want to (fill in blank) go fishing, work in the yard, wash the car, play golf.
<P>   6. There&#39;s a lot of road construction between my house and the polls.
<P>   7. There&#39;s going to be a crowd.
<P>   8. I meant to vote early but forgot.
<P>   9. My bum (fill in blank) knee, back, neck, leg is starting to hurt, and it&#39;ll only get worse if I have to wait in line.
<P>   10. All those goofs handing out campaign material will be outside the place, and I don&#39;t want to have to fool with them.
<P>   11. Whether unification passes or fails, the fat cats will still be in charge.
<P>   12. Nobody is telling the whole truth on (name of issue) so who can you believe?
<P>   13. (Name of issue) is too complicated, so why not leave it up to someone who understands it better?
<P>   14. My (fill in blank) wife, husband, brother, sister, mother, father, friend will simply cancel out my vote anyway.
<P>   15. The flu is going around, and sure as the world somebody&#39;ll cough or sneeze and I&#39;ll catch it.
<P>   16. Everybody knows that (fill in blank) the media, major political parties, big corporations, labor unions, organized crime bosses control the outcome in the first place.
<P>   17. The only things politicians really care about is getting re-elected.
<P>   18. I knew (name of candidate) when we were in high school, and (he/she) was always such a holier-than-thou, know-it-all jerk; I wouldn&#39;t give (him/her) air in a jug.
<P>   19. I&#39;ve got too much work to do.
<P>   20. I&#39;ve got to run out of town this morning, and it&#39;ll be a pain to get back before the polls close.
<P>   21. The traffic&#39;s bad enough around a school to begin with, let alone with all this election mess.
<P>   22. (Name of candidate) is a shoo-in already.
<P>   23. (Name of candidate) doesn&#39;t have a prayer of a chance of winning.
<P>   24. My car&#39;s in the shop and I don&#39;t want to bother asking my neighbor for a ride.
<P>   25. I want to catch up on my (fill in blank) reading, TV watching, sleep, housework.
<P>   There. If you can think up any other excuses, fine. But as far as these particular ones are concerned, hands off.
<P>   Like any good rich, conservative Republican, I have laid claim to them all. They are mine and mine alone, to use or not use as I see fit. You can&#39;t have any of them.
<P>   What if you do? Well, like any good bleeding-heart, liberal Democrat, I&#39;ll sue the pants off you.
<P>   See you at the polls.

				<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>f anyone can sympathize with Knox County election officials these days, it&#39;s gotta be University of Tennessee Head Football Coach Phillip Fulmer.
<P>   Think about it: Both had plenty of time to prepare for The Big One They Absolutely, Positively Cannot Afford to Blow.
<P>   And yet what happened to both?
<P>   They blew it.
<P>   For Fulmer, disaster struck Sept. 21 when Florida manhandled the Vols, 35-29. Despite a year of overall preparation and two full weeks of beat-the-Gators intensity, UT spent the first two quarters of the game digging itself into a 35-0 canyon. A gallant Vol comeback effort helped carve the deficit for statistical purposes, but the damage was long-since done.
<P>   For election officials, the nightmare-come-true arrived Tuesday when they sat down to count votes in the Knoxville-Knox County unification referendum.
<P>   Never mind that the unification charter commission had been working for a year to set the election in motion. Never mind that anti-unification forces had rallied to fight back. Never mind that early voters had been marking their ballots for more than two weeks. Never mind that officials knew the measure had to pass in both the city and county to be adopted.
<P>   In spite of all those months of preparation, all that money spent by both sides, all those meetings, all those public hearings, all that planning, all those speeches, all those billboards, all those commercials for and against, and all the stories and editorials in newspapers and on radio and TV, everything -- boooiiing! -- blew a mainspring as the score was being tallied.
<P>   Why?
<P>   Because, incredibly, some of the machines used in early voting apparently weren&#39;t programmed to separate city residents from county residents.
<P>   Hoo-boy. And these boneheads are the experts we trust to run our elections?
<P>   This itty-bitty detail could have voided the entire unification decision and sent the proposal back before voters for yet another campaign. As it was, unification was defeated by a large-enough margin that the blunder didn&#39;t matter.
<P>   Still, the questions remain: How in the name of common sense can a mistake like this go undetected until the 11th hour? Was there no trial run, no shakedown to work out the bugs? Who&#39;s in charge? Who&#39;s on first?
<P>   As I type these words, I daresay everyone involved in the election process in Knox County is busily covering his or her rear end to blame this snafu on either: (1) a computer or (2) someone else. In the next couple of days, we&#39;ll see more buck-passing than occurred during the U.S. House banking scandal. And then the bloodletting will commence.
<P>   That, fortunately for Phillip Fulmer, is one major difference between running a football team and running an election.
<P>   Coaches get to blow The Big One They Absolutely, Positively Cannot Afford to Blow for at least five seasons before the moving van shows up.

        <font size="5">C</font>harley Odom remembers when they
        called it ''Armistice Day.'' </p>
        <p>You may remember too -- the 11th hour of the 11th day
        of the 11th month of the year. The moment to commemorate
        the end of World War I. This was before the holiday got
        renamed Veterans Day, before it was bureaucratically
        designated as the fourth Monday in October, before a nationwide
        protest moved it back to its rightful place on Nov. 11. </p>
        <p>Strangely enough, Odom's most vivid memory of
        Armistice Day has nothing whatsoever to do with peace. On
        Nov. 11, 1943, he and 81 fellow Navy men were 600 feet
        deep in the South China Sea, praying to escape enemy depth
        charges. </p>
        <p>Odom was chief petty officer on the Billfish, a
        310-foot submarine assigned to patrol a 50-square-mile
        area on a 50-day mission. </p>
        <p>''Actually, we missed Armistice Day and several hours
        more,'' said the 83-year-old West Knoxvillian. ''We
        stayed down 29 hours.'' </p>
        <p>What's it like to be crammed inside a 19-foot-diameter
        tube with dozens of other men? </p>
        <p>''Smelly,'' he replied with a laugh. ''You breathe
        fumes from bilge water, battery exhaust, fear
        perspiration, diesel oil, unwashed bodies and, worst of all,
        odor from the heads (toilets). If that wasn't bad enough,
        you have to hear the same jokes over and over.'' </p>
        <p>Charley Odom is the E.F. Hutton of subs. When this old
        salt talks, people listen. </p>
        <p>He served in the Navy from 1934 until 1940. After the
        attack on Pearl Harbor, he re-enlisted and stayed with
        Uncle Sam until 1956. Some of the time he was on shore
        duty, helping teach the intricacies of diesel mechanics to
        other seamen, including a young Naval officer named Jimmy
        Carter. But there were plenty of months on -- or under,
        as the case may be -- the open sea. In fact, Odom
        estimates at least 10 solid years of his life have been spent
        beneath the surface of an ocean somewhere around the
        globe. </p>
        <p>Perhaps saltwater is the key to longevity. At an age
        when most folks have long-since slowed down, Odom doesn't
        miss a beat. </p>
        <p>As if he ever did. </p>
        <p>After discharge from the Navy, he earned a degree from
        the University of Tennessee and taught at Fulton High
        School for 20 years. He lap-swims at the Westside YMCA.
        He is an active ballroom dancer. He is completing his sixth
        semester of Spanish at Pellissippi State. And he
        participates in the writing group at the John T. O'Connor
        Senior Citizens Center. </p>
        <p>Charley recently sent me an account of Armistice Day
        titled ''Low on Food, Low on Water, Low on Oxygen.'' It's
        part of a book project he and his fellow senior writers
        are working on. Reading the piece, I was gripped -- again
        -- by the daily sacrifices men and women in military
        uniforms must make when there is a war to be fought. </p>
        <p>''What really had us worn out had been the depth
        charges,'' he writes of Nov. 11, 1943. ''As the
        destroyers roared over us like freight trains, we waited
        for the next one. Lights went out and valves flew open.
        While we crawled around in the dark, we were both macho
        and scared . . . </p>
        <p>''Deep water hovered over us like a mother hen, and
        shallow water was always our nemesis. Since enemy convoys
        carried oil and rubber from Borneo and other islands to
        Hong Kong and Japan, they hugged the coast. Sometimes we
        would go in on a dark night on the surface, fire on them,
        turn tail and fire from our tubes aft. Then we tried to
        outrun their escorts to get back to deep water.'' </p>
        <p>The Navy lost 52 subs and some 3,500 crewmen in World
        War II. Because of his extensive service, Odom says he
        had been shipmates with many of those who perished. </p>
        <p>''I think about them a lot,'' he told me. ''I'll
        remember a ship or someone's name and go look them up in
        a book. Many's the time, lying in bed at night, that I
        wonder whether they drowned, were crushed or
        suffocated.'' </p>
        <p>God bless them all. And bless folks like Charley Odom
        who make certain we never forget. </p>

				<FONT size="-1"><I>By Sam Venable, Columnist</I></FONT><P>

				<FONT SIZE="+2">K</FONT>noxville, my hometown:
<P>   * If you haven&#39;t seen &#39;&#39;Stomp&#39;&#39; at the Civic Auditorium, you&#39;ve missed one of the most entertaining shows that has ever played this area. There are four more opportunities: two performances tonight, two on Saturday. I absolutely, positively promise you will not be disappointed -- unless you&#39;re too late and all four shows are sold out.
<P>   This is one of those rare situations where the cornball phrase &#39;&#39;you have to see it (or hear it, as the case may be) to believe it&#39;&#39; actually applies.
<P>   There&#39;s not one word of dialogue. Instead, a cast of dancer-musicians creates the most delightful rhythms imaginable with brooms, mops, match boxes, cigarette lighters, buckets, sticks, rubber tubes, wheels, trash cans, dust pans -- yes, even the kitchen sink.
<P>   Which leads to one more thing I absolutely, positively promise: You will not be able to sit still during this performance. No matter if you are as rhythm-impaired as Al Gore, your toes will tap.
<P>   What we are talking about is refined noise. Individually, the clongs and clangs, dings and dongs, are the sort of stuff neighbors call the police to complain about. But blended together on stage, they become a masterpiece.
<P>   Perhaps the same theory could apply to another art form that recently has been displayed in Knoxville. A 22-year-old University of Tennessee student has been charged with felony vandalism after the cops busted him for allegedly defacing a railroad abutment.
<P>   The cops call Noah Gross a &#39;&#39;tagger&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;graffiti artist.&#39;&#39; The people on whose property his work has appeared surely have another name for him, one that involves body parts and questions Gross&#39; ancestry.
<P>   I don&#39;t blame &#39;em. Every time I see a wall, sidewalk, overpass or trash container &#39;&#39;adorned&#39;&#39; by these spray-painting morons, I think the caning cops of Singapore have the right idea.
<P>   Based on police reports, through, Gross&#39;s work is a far cry from Kilroy-Was-Here. His drawings appear to be quite elaborate. Authorities claim he even signs his work with the name &#39;&#39;Wise&#39;&#39; and keeps a detailed scrapbook of his accomplishments, complete with photos.
<P>   Gross faces a hearing Monday in General Sessions Court. If I were sitting on the bench, I&#39;d lay two judgments on him.
<P>   First, I&#39;d hand him a bucket, a scrub brush and a box of soap powders and banish him to the bridges, buildings and interstate ramps for artistic removal. Second, I&#39;d do everything possible to encourage him to channel his talents in a more productive direction.
<P>   If the creators of &#39;&#39;Stomp&#39;&#39; can turn ordinary, everyday garage noise into a highly acclaimed musical performance, perhaps Noah Gross can find an eager, appreciative (translation: money in their hands and commissions on their mind) audience as well.
<P>   * Gosh dang the luck, I missed Sen. Fred Thompson&#39;s call-in show Wednesday night on Community Television&#39;s Channel 12.
<P>   Those who did tune in certainly got more than political droning. Thanks to a glitch in the satellite feed from Scripps Howard Cable TV Co., they saw a partially scrambled, X-rated movie.
<P>   Given the alleged state of bed-hopping in Washington these days, the good senator might be onto something here. Mayhaps other politicians should try it.
<P>   Jimmy Duncan gets a lot of votes with free barbecue. Think what he could do with porn!
<P>   * If it&#39;s any consolation to local election officials who bungled the city-county unification referendum, we aren&#39;t alone.
<P>   The folks who count the votes in Salt Lake City are just as red-faced.
<P>   According to the Associated Press, election workers had to recount 287,580 ballots -- using fingernails and tweezers -- after some punch-card ballots were not properly processed. Thus, a scanner used to read them would not work.
<P>   Said county clerk Sherrie Swensen: &#39;&#39;It&#39;s a very slow process, very tedious.&#39;&#39;

		<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>t&#39;s the answer to every Southern redneck&#39;s prayers: A cotton plant that grows polyester.
<P>   I am not making this up. Perhaps you&#39;ve been hearing about this botanical-sociological breakthrough yourself. The report was published earlier this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and has been transmitted coast-to-coast by newspapers and television networks ever since.
<P>   In what borders on vegetative alchemy, researchers at a business called Agracetus in Middleton, Wisc., isolated bacteria that produce a polyester-like substance. They took the bacteria&#39;s DNA and forced it into the stems of cotton seedlings. When the plants matured -- voila! -- they produced a fiber with the potential to be warmer and more wrinkle-resistant than regular cotton.
<P>   This procedure is still in the experimental stage, of course. Scientists say it&#39;ll take three to five years, minimum, to refine the process to the point that it can be marketed. Nonetheless, they believe this could ultimately revolutionize the agricultural and textiles industries.
<P>   Perhaps.
<P>   But it scares the bejabbers slap out of me.
<P>   I&#39;m all for plant research. Without dedicated plant scientists like George Washington Carver, who spent years studying the lowly peanut, we&#39;d still be eating plain M&M&#39;s.
<P>   But this cotton-polyester business has the potential for out-and-out disaster.
<P>   Oh, it&#39;ll start innocently enough. Always does.
<P>   Farmer Brown drops a few seeds into the ground and out comes a cotton-poly plant yielding a miracle fiber that keeps consumers warm, holds color, won&#39;t shrink or fade, and doesn&#39;t need ironing. Happiness and prosperity will reign from the heartland of America&#39;s farm country to the blue-lighted aisles of Kmart.
<P>   But then, sure as God and Archer Daniels Midland made little green apples, the evil polyester gene will begin to mutate and take dominion over the cotton gene. The curse will grow like a cancer. Its tentacles will spread further than kudzu, gripping the land in a chokehold like the Mongolian Stomper used to perform every Saturday night on live wrestling.
<P>   Thus, when Farmer Brown fires up his combine for the harvest, he&#39;ll discover his plants heavy laden not with a high-tech friendly fiber but with (insert blood-curdling shriek here) -- 
<P>   Double-knits.
<P>   Yes, children. Itty-bitty leisure suits and bell-bottom pants -- lime green, no doubt, with white top-stitching -- will dangle from every stem.
<P>   They will sneer like John Travolta, taunting and mocking whatever fashion progress this country has made in the past 20 years. No plant or acre will be spared. The next thing you know, men will start wearing flare-collared shirts, gold necklaces and stack-heeled shoes, and dancing to disco music.
<P>   If this the future you want for your children, America?
<P>   If not, I urge you to grab a can of 2,4-D and spray with reckless abandon. Let us purge our sacred republic of this monster before it&#39;s too late.

        <font size="5">L</font>et's say Uncle Ferd -- beloved
        relative, friendly neighbor, longtime Sunday school
        teacher, all-around good guy -- kicks the bucket. Here
        are some immediate steps to take to properly pay your
        respects: </p>
        <p>Step 1. Fry a mess of chicken or bake a pie and take
        it to Uncle Ferd and Aunt Lida's house to help feed the
        family and friends. </p>
        <p>Step 2. Call the florist, order a spray of flowers and
        tell 'em to put everybody in the Sunday school class's
        name on the card. </p>
        <p>Step 3. Make sure your marryin'-and-buryin' suit is
        cleaned and pressed, particularly if Aunt Lida has asked
        you to be a pallbearer. </p>
        <p>Step 4. Go to the funeral home the night of receiving
        friends and make pertinent remarks like, ''Don't he look
        nice.'' </p>
        <p>And finally, the newest and most important -- </p>
        <p>Step 5. Grab a felt-tipped marker and scribble some
        tender words on Uncle Ferd's casket. Mayhaps something on
        the order of: </p>
        <p>I shore will miss the times we had, </p>
        <p>My dear ol' Uncle Ferd. </p>
        <p>But now it's time to say goodbye, </p>
        <p>'Cause soon you'll be interred. </p>
        <p>What's that? You've never heard of Step 5? Then
        obviously you don't keep up with the latest trends in
        undertaking. </p>
        <p>A funeral supply company in Texas -- I swear I am not
        making this up -- has just unveiled a casket that is
        designed to be written upon and comes complete with: (1)
        a special ''gloss pearlescent'' coating and (2) a set of permanent
        markers for your convenience. </p>
        <p>Don't take my word for it. Hear it straight from the
        York Group of Houston, the nation's second-largest
        manufacturer of hardwood and metal caskets and casket
        components: </p>
        <p>''While this product is new in our industry, for years
        we have received requests for caskets that could be
        written on, both from funeral directors and directly from
        families and friends who believed this was the most effective
        and appropriate expression of their grief,'' said George
        Foley Jr., executive vice president. </p>
        <p>''Until the York Expressions, no funeral service
        product invited family and friends to express their
        deepest feelings about their loved ones in a physical, tangible
        way. Ours does.'' </p>
        <p>''Society's needs are changing,'' added Mark
        Kowalczyk, a funeral director from Utica, N.Y. ''Today's
        grieving families are seeking to memorialize their loved
        ones in unique ways. I see this innovative product
        meeting that need.'' </p>
        <p>And one more: ''Active participation rather than
        passive observation is much healthier for the bereaved,''
        said Bill Bates, president of Life Appreciation Training
        Seminars in North Bay Village, Fla., who has trained some
        4,000 funeral home employees to counsel mourners. </p>
        <p>I know these learned people have a point. I know
        funerals are for the living. I know grief, if not
        addressed, can manifest itself in physical and emotional anguish
        for years -- indeed, for the remainder of the life of the
        survivor. </p>
        <p>But scribbling on a casket as if it was a high school
        yearbook or a cast on a broken arm? No thanks. Make mine
        plain pine. </p>

        <font size="5">I</font> guarantee this has happened. </p>
        <p>You're talking on the phone with someone from out of
        town, he or she asks for your number, and the first sound
        out of your mouth is, ''615, uh, I mean, 423 . . .'' </p>
        <p>Even though more than a year has passed since that
        abominable new area code was forced upon us, nobody is
        accustomed to it. Maybe we never will be. We are
        creatures of habit, and old habits die exceedingly hard. </p>
        <p>Now guess what? </p>
        <p>It's going to get worse. </p>
        <p>BellSouth announced the other day that Tennessee will
        probably be divided into seven area codes within the next
        10 years. </p>
        <p>According to company spokesman David May, the
        Nashville area (which has long been afforded
        most-favored-region status in matters of highways, parks
        and other government largess) will, of course, remain
        615. The rest of Middle Tennessee will become 931 in 1997
        or '98. </p>
        <p>Around the turn of the century, May estimated, 615
        will need further division, as will 901 (West Tennessee)
        and, you guessed it, 423. Meaning that before too many
        more years pass, we'll probably have to dial into different
        area codes to call Burlington from Farragut or Halls from
        Vestal. </p>
        <p>How can this be? </p>
        <p>According to BellSouth, Tennessee's current area codes
        can handle 8 million numbers -- each. That's a total of
        24 million. Now, consider that Tennessee's population is
        only 5 million. This means we already have the capacity
        for nearly five telephone numbers each! for every man,
        woman and child from Memphis to Mountain City. And yet
        we're running out of room? </p>
        <p>Apparently so. </p>
        <p>The main problem, officials say, comes from the recent
        boom in wireless communication -- pagers and cellular
        phones. When you combine that with all the business
        lines, fax lines, 800 numbers and everything else in the marketplace,
        the only alternative is to break existing area codes into
        smaller units. </p>
        <p>Far be it from me to argue with the experts. If we
        need more numbers, so be it. </p>
        <p>The question I want answered is this: What in the name
        of A.G. Bell do these cell-phoning, fax-sending people
        talk about all the time? </p>
        <p>You cannot walk into a supermarket, or drive along any
        street, or go to a football game, or grab a fast-food
        McMeal, without seeing folks yammering away on cell
        phones. Nor can you attempt to send or receive a letter,
        note or missive to or from anyone, anywhere without
        having them say, ''What's your fax number?'' </p>
        <p>How did these people exist 20 years ago? Were they
        mute? Did they not communicate with anyone else at all?
        And now, have they suddenly been smitten with the gift of
        gab? </p>
        <p>Oh, well. Everything that goes around, comes around.
        This cycle will repeat itself every few years, with more
        and more area codes and longer and longer telephone
        numbers, until one day some genius discovers an even newer,
        far more improved system: </p>
        <p>You just pick up the receiver and say, ''Sarah, get me
        the diner . . .'' </p>

<font size=5>K</font>noxville, my hometown: </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/blkbul.gif" alt="*" align=bottom hspace=5 width=14 height=14> Jack Gillard, the Ann Arbor (Mich.) News columnist, picked himself 
quite a fight when he complained about the size of the University of 
Tennessee's Neyland Stadium. </p>
<p>His caustic comments of Nov. 3 apparently were faxed throughout Big 
Orange Country, riling the natives from Union City to Unicoi County. I 
wrote a reply to Gillard on Nov. 8. Phil Williams and Billy Kidd, two 
morning deejays on WIMZ-103.5, broadcast Gillard's telephone numbers -- 
home, office and fax -- and encouraged their listeners to give him a ringy. </p>
<p>They did. Big time. </p>
<p>A few days ago, the Ann Arbor paper devoted almost an entire section front 
to my column and the avalanche of angry responses from Down Here. The 
piece was headlined ''Big Jack Attack.'' </p>
<p>It was all in good fun, of course. Gillard has since sent me some News 
trinkets as a peace offering. I'm mailing him a copy of my latest book -- so, 
harrumph, he can see what real columning is all about. </p>
<p>As this fray ran its course, I received about a dozen letters from folks who 
had moved to East Tennessee from Up There. With only one exception, 
they cited their fondness for this region, its seasons, its people. Several 
writers, however, did mention our quirky figures of speech. Especially ''I 
don't care to.'' </p>
<p>As the natives know, when we say, ''I don't care to'' do something, it means 
we don't mind at all. But to ears that have never heard the expression, it 
sounds like, ''I don't want to.'' </p>
<p>In a spirit of warmth, cooperation and outreach to our brothers and sisters 
from foreign lands, I don't care to point this out. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/blkbul.gif" alt="*" align=bottom hspace=5 width=14 height=14>It's official. The Christmas holidays are here, even if you haven't begun 
to thaw the Thanksgiving turkey. So, in keeping with America's commercial 
obligation to stay well ahead of the calendar, let me wish you and yours a 
Happy Easter. </p>
<p>I saw my first Christmas-decorated house on Sunday, Nov. 10, off Highway 
33 near the Knox-Union County line. Last Monday, I spied my first 
Christmas tree lot. Later that same morning, I saw my first ring-billed gull of 
the season. </p>
<p>Ring-bills are the sea gulls that invade our parking lots, sometimes by the 
hundreds, during winter. We see more every year. They summer in coastal 
areas but move inland when the weather turns cold and spend several

		<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he World Series of chess is coming to Knoxville, so unless you want to be left out of conversations with your friends and co-workers, learn the game now.
<P>   You&#39;ve got until April 25. That&#39;s when some 5,000 chess enthusiasts will square off at the convention center for the 1997 Super Nationals.
<P>   Nonetheless, the sooner you acquire the basics of this game, the better you&#39;ll be able to follow the action next spring.
<P>   I learned chess from my son, Clay. It was part of our lifelong commitment to cultural exchange.
<P>   I taught Clay valuable life skills -- how to propel green peas into the living room with a spoon, how to hold the maximum number of grapes in your mouth without (1) choking and (2) getting caught by Mom, how to generate the greatest volume from northern and southern portals of the body, important stuff like that. Clay taught me how to play chess, understand physics and identify the constellations. It&#39;s been a marvelous learning experience for both.
<P>   Chess is played on a checkerboard with a bunch of weird pieces. There is the pawn, which looks like a chocolate drop; the knight, which looks like a horse with its body chopped off; the rook, which looks like an unfinished chimney; the bishop, which looks like a chocolate drop wearing a beret; the queen, which looks like the column from a Civil War mansion; and the king, which looks like the queen with a cross on top.
<P>   Chess closely parallels the goings-on in corporate America. The pawns (employees) are supposed to protect the king (CEO). They are slaughtered off mercilessly as the game progresses. But just before the king (CEO) is slashed, someone says &#39;&#39;checkmate&#39;&#39; (golden parachute) and the two former adversaries go off to sip cognac or stuff grapes into their mouths.
<P>   The pawns can only move one space at a time, except on the first move when they can go two. They can only capture another piece by moving diagonally, unless accompanied by Col. Mustard into the billiard room while carrying a wrench.
<P>   The knights move in an L-shaped pattern, advancing down the board until they reach the opposite end, at which time the owner triumphantly announces, &#39;&#39;Crown me!&#39;&#39;
<P>   Rooks can move any number of spaces, vertically or horizontally. If, during the course of one of these moves, they land on Boardwalk they may collect $200. However, they have to give up one turn throwing the dice.
<P>   Bishops can only go diagonally, which should tell you something about their character from the beginning. Always keep a close eye on your opponent&#39;s bishop, especially if you suspect he&#39;s trying to draw to an inside straight.
<P>   The king and queen are typical bluebloods -- pampered and privileged, but without a clue. The queen can move in a straight line in any direction, but the king, his dorkness, can only stumble along one space at a time.
<P>   That, in a nutshell, is how chess is played. It gets more detailed as your skills increase, of course. On any given day next April, there will be hundreds of masters of the game in Knoxville.
<P>   And, boy, is it going to be loud if they all shout, &#39;&#39;Yahtzee!&#39;&#39; at the same time.

				<FONT SIZE="+3"><B>Ol&#39; time religion takes a back pew to cyberprayer</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
				<FONT size="-1"><I>By Sam Venable, Columnist</I></FONT><P>
				<FONT SIZE="-1"><!--dateline--></FONT></DIV></B><BR>
				<FONT SIZE="+2">H</FONT>ear the words of Rev. Venob, brothers and sisters: If you&#39;re looking for a dose of that old-time religion, you might not find it in cyberchurch.
<P>   In case you haven&#39;t noticed, they&#39;re doing things a little differently in the pulpit these days, and I ain&#39;t talking about the Revised Standard Edition or the new Book of Common Prayer.
<P>   Up in Carrollton, Va., for example, one church has decided to blend the lottery with the Lord. At Sweet Haven Holy Church of God -- Rev. Venob is not making this up -- parishioners have a chance to pocket bucks for showing up.
<P>   According to a news dispatch I read a few days ago, Bishop Nathaniel Johnson hands out play money at the start of the service. Folks who find a bill with the preacher&#39;s initials on the back win between $10 and $100 in U.S. government cash. There are up to four winners each Sunday -- provided they stay until the end of the two-hour proceedings.
<P>   In Israel, a computer company has updated the concept of Dial-A-Prayer and Fax-A-Prayer by offering a Jewish prayer service via e-mail.
<P>   The company, Virtual Jerusalem, accepts on-line prayers from worshipers, prints them out, and takes them to the Wailing Wall. Since the web site (http://www.virtual.co.il) was established several months ago, it has forwarded more than 2,000 prayers to the wall. There is no charge for this service, by the way.
<P>   Said president Avi Moskowitz: &#39;&#39;You know that your prayer is going to the closest place that you can get to God.&#39;&#39;
<P>   No harm in either approach, I suppose. But they are going to take some getting used to. What&#39;s more, they raise some interesting questions.
<P>   At the Virginia church, for instance, are winners supposed to tithe immediately?
<P>   Probably. You might be able to hide from the church treasurer or the IRS, but when the preacher hisownself is counting out those greenbacks, right there in front of Gawd and everybody, it&#39;d take a certified Scrooge not to cough up a 10 percent rebate, minimum.
<P>   As for the e-mail prayer idea, what happens when the computer jams or crashes? Does this disconnect you with the Big Guy?
<P>   This is happening more and more. Louise Kehoe, writing about Internet congestion for The Financial Times, calls the World Wide Web the &#39;&#39;World Wide Wait.&#39;&#39;
<P>   You don&#39;t have to take her word for it. Anyone who tried to monitor election results via computer on Nov. 5 knows what I&#39;m talking about. Apparently the web was bound up so tight that night, two tons of Ex-Lax wouldn&#39;t have provided relief.
<P>   I know this makes Rev. Venob a born-again geezer, but religion sure was a lot more simple in the days before ministerial kickbacks and electronic praying.
<P>   Why, Rev. Venob even remembers back to a quaint, innocent time when the two most pressing worries on Sunday morning were how long the sermon would last and whether there&#39;d be enough funeral home fans to go around.
<P>   All the children say, &#39;&#39;Amen!&#39;&#39;

        <!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><font size="5">I</font>t stands to reason that during
        this week of gluttony, we'd get to sink our choppers into
        two surveys of Americans' eating habits. </p>
        <p>It also stands to reason that one of these surveys was
        conducted on behalf of Kentucky Fried Chicken. </p>
        <p>Huh? Chicken? During turkey week? </p>
        <p>Yes. This is brilliant marketing strategy. </p>
        <p>Fifty-one weeks out of the year, chicken has to
        compete with turkey, beef, pork, lamb, fish, hamburgers,
        hot dogs and other meats on the menu. But during the
        Thanksgiving holidays, the only other player is turkey
        (with mayhaps a sugar-cured ham on the sidelines). Either
        way, the competition is thinner, and fried chicken has
        the potential for making a strong economic showing -- a
        case, you might say, of two birds in the hand beating a
        rack of ribs in the bush. </p>
        <p>(Then again you might not say anything of the kind, so
        pass me another serving of whatever's on the platter and
        forget I mentioned it.) </p>
        <p>The KFC survey was conducted by a company called RGA Communications
        Research and was made through telephone interviews with 1,815
        adults. It asked a bunch of boring questions about how
        often the family eats together, what they talk about, who
        prepares the meal, what they eat, who cleans up,
        blah-blah-blah. The findings are a statistician's dream,
        replete with percentages and probabilities that, if
        combined with the Colonel's secret spices and herbs and
        placed end-to-end, would stretch from the KFC restaurant
        on Cedar Bluff Road to the one in Halls. </p>
        <p>But one thing's perfectly clear: When it comes to
        meals, what Dad does best is eat. </p>
        <p>Without getting into the fine print, suffice to say
        that the father places a distant third to the mother and
        children in matters of deciding to cook or buy carry-out,
        what's on the menu, making mealtime conversation,
        cleaning up afterwards and other aspects of din-din. </p>
        <p>Sounds good to me. All in favor, say aye -- as soon as
        you finish chewing, I mean. Then let's wander on down to
        the den and try to find a football game on the tube. </p>
        <p>The second survey involved restaurant dining and was
        conducted by a company called SanPellegrino USA. The
        results were gleaned from interviews with 500 adults who
        eat out at least once a month. </p>
        <p>What was the number one factor these people cited in
        an enjoyable dining experience? </p>
        <p>Before you pick up a knife and fork, let me tell you
        it wasn't the food. Not by a long shot. </p>
        <p>Instead, a vast majority (70 percent) said it was an
        ''attentive waitstaff.'' Which oughta make a lot of chefs
        wonder why they spent all that time and money in cooking
        school. </p>
        <p>Oh, and another tasty morsel: In which part of the
        country do the most diners want to make their waiter's
        acquaintance? </p>
        <p>The South, of course. By a wide margin, folks Down
        Here shake and howdy with the hired help more than they
        do Up There and Out Yonder. </p>
        <p>I'm not sure what all this proves, but I let me remind
        you of one thing: Venob certainly has enjoyed serving you
        this morning, and he'll be more than happy to help you
        figure the tip. </p>

				<FONT SIZE="+3"><B>Luck, laziness and libido combine to supply one turkey</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
				<FONT size="-1"><I>By Sam Venable, Columnist</I></FONT><P>
				<FONT SIZE="-1"><!--dateline--></FONT></DIV></B><BR>
				<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>hen the Venob clan sits down to a turkey dinner this afternoon, two of the things we should give thanks for are, in order, my lazy butt and the incredible power of sex.
<P>   Without either, we would not be savoring the smoked feast set before us.
<P>   The Venobs sometimes eat wild turkeys at Thanksgiving and Christmas -- &#39;&#39;sometimes&#39;&#39; being a critical word in this discussion. It depends on how successful I have been in the woods. Thanks to an aggressive wild turkey restoration program by the Wildlife Resources Agency and my skill at recognizing the dire need for vast amounts of &#39;&#39;field research&#39;&#39; during the turkey season, however, this hasn&#39;t been much of a problem in recent years.
<P>   Our bird came to dinner by his own undoing, and therein lies a tale. To appreciate it, you must understand a few givens about turkeys and turkey hunting.
<P>   Wild turkeys, despite the rubbish you hear around campfires and read in he-man outdoor magazines, are neither smart nor sly. They are paranoid.
<P>   Turkeys emerge from the egg convinced every sound and movement in the woods is an enemy, and they spend the rest of their lives worrying. Collectively, a flock of wild turkeys is jumpier than delegates to a Barney Fife convention.
<P>   Thus, when a wild turkey sees, hears or even suspects something is amiss, it runs or flies to the next ridge in approximately one-half second. If your only association with turkeys was a fifth-grade trip to Floyd Foster&#39;s fowl farm, you may not realize that a wild gobbler, when motivated, can outrun a veteran Washington lobbyist.
<P>   Ah, but the avian guard does drop briefly, just as it does in the human world with spies, TV preachers, politicians, corporate executives and others who ought to know better.
<P>   That is when sex enters the equation.
<P>   Turkeys breed in the spring. If, during that same period, you can (1) go without sleep, (2) lie successfully to your boss and wife, (3) spend hundreds of dollars driving to and from the mountains, (4) hike until you locate a gobbler on the prowl, (5) camouflage yourself to the max, (6) reasonably impersonate a hussy hen, (7) sit still while bugs drain your veins, and (8) pull a trigger, you can save the 10 minutes and $15 it takes to acquire a store-bought turkey in November.
<P>   Often, it happens rather quickly. I have sat down in the woods to call turkeys and been forced to swing into action almost as the leaves are settling at my feet. But this particular bird and I toyed with each other for almost two hours.
<P>   Why? Because of my aforementioned indolence and the awesome power of his libido.
<P>   I had watched this bird fly from a distant mountain to an adjacent ridge. I had listened to him gobble lustily to my calling. I was intimately familiar with this tract of forest and knew exactly how to creep downhill, cross the valley, and climb to his elevation undetected. But I simply was too lazy, too fat, too tired to make the hike.
<P>   So I did what any hard-to-get woman would do. I invoked The Rules. I shut up and paid no attention to him.
<P>   He couldn&#39;t stand it. Over the course of 60 minutes, he rattled the woods with gobbles. He marched to within 80 yards of where I sat and strutted for another 20 minutes. When the hussy hen didn&#39;t appear, he stormed off and refused to say another word.
<P>   Until I called to him one more time.
<P>   That fired him up again, and for nearly another half hour he stayed &#39;&#39;out there&#39;&#39; -- gobbling, puffing, strutting and swearing whips-and-chains sexual torment. Then he hushed. Five minutes later, he tip-toed into my gunsights.
<P>   Agreed, hunting has its cruel side. As much as I love being in the outdoors with rod and gun, and as rationally as I accept the role of predator and prey -- whether the predator creeps through the woods in Gore-Tex boots or pushes a shopping cart at Kroger -- taking the life of a wild, regal animal can be a perfectly awful thing to do.
<P>   But as Bill Clinton and Bob Dole both know, dabbling with hussies can get you in big trouble.

				<FONT SIZE="+3"><B>Be prepared for big shock at UT- Vanderbilt game</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
				<FONT size="-1"><I>By Sam Venable, Columnist</I></FONT><P>
				<FONT SIZE="-1"><!--dateline--></FONT></DIV></B><BR>
				<FONT SIZE="+2">U</FONT>ntold thousands of University of Tennessee football fans will be driving to Nashville on Saturday to watch the Vols conclude their 1996 regular-season schedule at Vanderbilt.
<P>   And, boy, will they be surprised.
<P>   Life moves at a different pace in the land of the Commodore, so be forewarned.
<P>   If the length and breadth of your Tennessee football experience has occurred within the confines of Neyland Stadium, you will experience a fair amount of culture shock the moment you find your seat at Vanderbilt Stadium and gaze upon Dudley Field.
<P>   Correction. You&#39;ll experience the first shock before you even take a peek at the field. As soon as your buns hit the planks, you&#39;ll know what I mean.
<P>   There is room to sit comfortably. Honest. I&#39;ve been there myownself and know whereof I speak.
<P>   Even though the official capacity of Vanderbilt Stadium is 41,600 -- less than half the size of UT -- you will experience the same amazing freedom of movement munchkins feel the first time they stretch out on a king-size bed.
<P>   There are two reasons for this phenomenon.
<P>   First, the seats themselves are larger. Vanderbilt athletic officials don&#39;t adhere to the Crunch-O-Matic philosophy adopted by UT. They don&#39;t have to because, unlike the situation in Knoxville, 750,000 frenzied alums and supporters are not clamoring for tickets.
<P>   Which brings us to the second reason there is room to stretch at Vanderbilt: Even during a spirited game, there&#39;s usually an inordinate amount of space between spectators -- three, four, sometimes five seats.
<P>   It won&#39;t be that way Saturday, certainly. Rarely is for a Vol-Commodore clash. Shortly before kickoff, an orange tidal wave will roll eastward from Memphis and westward from Johnson City and flood the house.
<P>   Vanderbilt faithful -- yes, Virginia, there are a few -- don&#39;t like to see this Big Orange tsunami, of course. They think it clashes with their suits and sport coats.
<P>   You will notice that these people behave differently from typical Neyland Stadiumites in several ways.
<P>   For instance, they tend to make casual conversation about fluctuations in NASDAQ, not point standings in NASCAR.
<P>   When they want to catch the attention of a concessionaire, they don&#39;t stand up and yell, &#39;&#39;Hey! Coke guy! Hey! Over here!&#39;&#39; Rather, they quietly clear their throat, snap their fingers once and command, &#39;&#39;Steward!&#39;&#39;
<P>   Nor are they prone to get into shoving matches if tempers flare. Instead, they merely remove a cellular telephone from their vest pocket, call Daddy, and have him send a man over to do the job.
<P>   Nonetheless, in the event you do wind up sitting next to Buffy and Wellington from Belle Meade, don&#39;t ignore them. Despite their strange looks and awkward mannerisms, these are human beings too. Please be nice to them.
<P>   Why, you might even offer &#39;em a chew of your Red Man.

        <p><font size="2"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>oday is a perfect opportunity to
        bring all you native Knoxvillians up to date on some
        old-time information. </p>
        <p>This stuff involves . . . huh? What's that? How do I
        know everyone out there in Readership Land right now is a
        certified, card-carrying native? </p>
        <p>Simple. Between last Wednesday afternoon and
        approximately 8 o'clock tonight, native Knoxvillians --
        along with homegrown folks who migrated to foreign lands
        -- have been the only occupants of this city. All the
        others have exited for a four-day holiday ''back home.'' </p>
        <p>The first matter we have to discuss is a picture
        postcard sent to me by Richard H. Beckett of Portage,
        Mich. </p>
        <p>This card shows a scene of Main Street, east of Henley
        Street. But it's nothing like you'd see today. The only
        buildings visible are the fronts of a couple of houses.
        Both sides of the street are lined with beautiful trees
        -- elms, I would suspect. And smack down the center of
        the wide thoroughfare are streetcar tracks. </p>
        <p>The card is addressed to Isabelle Hamilton, Lansing,
        Mich. The only message is ''Will be back Monday, Feb. 28.
        (signed) A.B.G.'' It is postmarked Feb. 23, 1910. </p>
        <p>A.B.G. -- whoever he or she was -- had it made. There
        was no Atlanta airport or Interstate 40/75 spider web to
        creep through back then. And, given the prompt mail
        delivery of that era, there's every chance Isabelle Hamilton
        received her postcard sometime before the Fourth of July. </p>
        <p>The next order of business is an old newspaper
        classified ad Beverly Riddell found in some belongings of
        her mother, who died two years ago. </p>
        <p>''It's from sometime in the '30s,'' said Riddell.
        ''Mother's sister was looking for a roommate.'' </p>
        <p>This room-for-lease was located in ''West Knoxville.''
        It's on Forest Avenue. </p>
        <p>Of course, back then the region of, say, West Town
        Mall, was so far out in the sticks that sunshine had to
        be piped in. And the tiny farm community of Farragut was
        adrift somewhere between Gay Street and downtown Chattanooga. </p>
        <p>Finally, I hold in my hands a photocopy of The New
        York Times from Sunday, Feb. 9, 1908. Fellow
        News-Sentinel staffer Jim Balloch came across it while
        doing some research at Lawson McGhee Library. </p>
        <p>The headline on one of the top stories shouts
        ''Knoxville's Ban on Liquor Fails.'' </p>
        <p>Check out the first paragraph: ''Knoxville has been
        for three months a prohibition town. While this is too
        early to judge the ultimate effect of prohibition in the
        largest Tennessee city that has yet been engulfed by the temperance
        wave, the trial here has been sufficient to demonstrate
        the axiomatic sociological truth that prohibition does
        not prohibit.'' </p>
        <p>The story goes into great detail about the mockery of
        trying to stamp out the liquor trade here. It describes
        the ''jug trains'' that came in daily from Middlesboro,
        Ky., as well as the farce of ''private clubs.'' </p>
        <p>''Many believe that almost as much liquor is drunk
        here as before prohibition went into effect,'' the Times'
        correspondent wrote. </p>
        <p>Given the daily drug reports from the cop shop, one
        wonders if anything has changed. </p>

        <font size="5">D</font>on't just stand there -- buy
        something! </p>
        <p>In case you have just arrived from another galaxy,
        planet Earth is in the midst of the Christmas shopping
        season. Meaning that anyone who cares one whit about the
        financial security of humankind should drop whatever he or
        she is doing, run to the nearest mega-mall or superstore
        and start throwing money around like a member of
        Congress. </p>
        <p>How much? </p>
        <p>According to one recent survey, the average U.S.
        shopper will spend $1,160 this Christmas season. Of that
        total, $900 will go for gifts, the balance for travel,
        entertaining and decorations. So if you haven't coughed up
        at least one measly grand since the Christmas shopping
        season officially started last July 4th, I urge you to
        limber up the ol' billfold and get cranking. </p>
        <p>(What's that? You say you have no intention of
        spending anywhere near $900 on presents this year? And
        you'd like to know who came up with those figures? Hmmmm
        . . .let me see. Ah, yes: It's a small cottage industry called
        ''American Express.'' You've probably never heard of
        them. They manufacture and distribute a thin plastic
        device. I looked at a sample of one of these quaint
        ''American Express'' products just now and can attest it bears
        no resemblance whatsoever to a silver bell, manger,
        angel, stocking, fruitcake, elf, ornament, sleigh,
        reindeer or other holiday icon. Thus, it is safe to
        assume (a) ''American Express'' has no vested interest in
        the Christmas season and (b) this was a completely
        impartial survey. There. Satisfied?) </p>
        <p>As you make your way toward the halls of commerce this
        time of year, it is important to remember the rea$on for
        the $ea$on. To assist in this important mission, I have
        listed the Ten Commandments of Christmas Shopping. </p>
        <p>I. Thou shalt worship the Gross National Product and
        National Consumer Spending Index with all thy heart and
        with all thy might. </p>
        <p>2. Thou shalt arriveth at thy mall before the cock
        crows and circleth the lot 70 times seven to findeth the
        parking space nearest the door. </p>
        <p>3. Thou shalt weareth thy holiday sweater, thy
        blinking Santa Claus necktie and thy Jingle Bell shoes
        and playeth ''Blue Christmas'' on thy car CD or stereo
        wherever thou shalt travel. </p>
        <p>4. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's Holiday Barbie
        and 101 Dalmatians CD-ROMs, lest thy neighbor cleave thy
        head with a Tonka truck. </p>
        <p>5. Thou shalt not buyeth a skillet nor a vacuum
        cleaner for thy wife, nor a hammer nor a lawn mower for
        thy husband, lest thou be labeled ''insensitive throwback
        from the Fifties.'' </p>
        <p>6. Thou shalt not buyeth any item that needeth
        assembly, lest thou be labeled ''ignoramus.'' </p>
        <p>7. Thou shalt bear in mind the term ''one size fits
        all'' applyeth only to gift certificates. </p>
        <p>8. Thou shalt keepeth all receipts. </p>
        <p>9. Thou shalt not thinketh about bills until January,
        when thou shalt wail and maketh loud lamentations. </p>
        <p>10. Thou shalt remember, ahem, that books maketh
        wonderful gifts. </p>
        <p>For much less than $900. </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Sam Venable, News-Sentinel
        columnist</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">N</font>ot that I'm superstitious or
        anything -- Yikes! Careful with that salt shaker! -- but
        has it dawned on you that this is the first Friday the
        13th we've had in December in quite awhile, and some very
        strange things are going on? </p>
        <p>The last time a December calendar fell this way was in
        1991, back when Bill Clinton couldn't get recognized
        outside of Little Rock -- why, shucks, you wouldn't even
        know him on a date -- and George Bush was beginning to
        toy with catchy new phrases for his second inaugural
        address, 13 months down the pike. </p>
        <p>Five years later -- get that black cat outta here! --
        Friday the 13th rears its ugly head in December once
        more, and look what's happening, particularly on the
        holiday front, at home and around the globe: </p>
        <p>* In East Tennessee, it's hot enough to be the middle
        of spring, not the middle of winter. Go for a sleigh
        ride? Naaa, we'd rather water ski. </p>
        <p>* For the first time in 18 years, Pope John Paul II
        has decided not to celebrate Christmas Day Mass in St.
        Peter's Basilica. </p>
        <p>* In Pensacola, Fla., shopping malls have banned
        caroling by church choirs and school choral groups
        because of complaints by merchants and customers. </p>
        <p>* Due to severe budget cutbacks, the city of
        Bethlehem, birthplace of Jesus Christ, announced it would
        have to scale down its Christmas decorations. </p>
        <p>* In Russia, 3,000 reindeer have died from starvation. </p>
        <p>Coincidences? I think not. </p>
        <p>This is one instance where triskaidekaphobia (the fear
        of the number 13) is well-founded. I am convinced that
        Friday, Dec. 13, 1996, has dedicated itself to
        Grinchizing the Christmas season for everyone. </p>
        <p>So be on your guard. In addition to triskaidekaphobia,
        there are several other fears you should be especially
        mindful of today. Among them: </p>
        <p><b>Ratholaphobia: </b>The fear TVA will blow $5.2
        million on a luxury private jet so its busy executives
        won't be burdened with having to travel on commercial
        airplanes like common members of the business community. </p>
        <p><b>Orlanaphobia:</b> The fear of going to the Citrus
        Bowl for the third time in four years. </p>
        <p><b>Pollutaphobia: </b>The fear that Champion
        International will continue to dump its foamy, brown,
        smelly toxic waste into the Pigeon River. </p>
        <p><b>Swissarmaphobia:</b> The fear, most commonly
        experienced by school students, of forgetting to leave
        your pocketknife at home. </p>
        <p><b>Peptobismaphobia:</b> The fear of catching the
        puke-and-poot bug that's going around town. </p>
        <p><b>Backorderaphobia:</b> The fear that every store in
        town has just sold out of the toys your child wants Santa
        Claus to bring. </p>
        <p><b>Cheeseballaphobia:</b> The fear of attending

        <font size="5">W</font>hen I read the news about Wes
        Cooley and David Michael Pecard, I remembered a bit of
        sage wisdom someone passed along years ago, back when I
        was a fledgling fisherperson: </p>
        <p>''Liars should have good memories.'' </p>
        <p>Your mother may have phrased it another way: ''Oh,
        what a tangled web we weave, when at first we start to
        deceive.'' </p>
        <p>However it's said, this is excellent advice. A good
        memory is an absolute must in the fabrication business.
        Without quick and accurate recall, a teller of tall tales
        begins to contradict himself. Before long, whenever he
        holds up his right hand and says, ''I swear to tell the
        whole truth,'' everyone else in the joint starts rolling
        on the floor in laughter. </p>
        <p>If you keep up with the news, you're probably familiar
        with Cooley and Pecard and their alleged skills at
        fibology. </p>
        <p>Cooley is a former U.S. representative from Salem,
        Ore. He won the office in 1994, partly because of his
        claim to have been a member of the Army Special Forces
        and a combat veteran in Korea. He also claimed to be a
        member of the academic honor society, Phi Beta Kappa. </p>
        <p>Cooley's story sounded good enough. But it didn't hold
        up to scrutiny. These claims, and others, turned out to
        be piffle. He subsequently withdrew from his re-election
        campaign and has since been indicted for making false
        statements. </p>
        <p>Pecard -- authorities in Arizona aren't even sure if
        that's his real name -- is in quite a pickle himself. He
        is jailed in Phoenix under $2 million bond on charges of
        fraud, forgery, theft and sexual abuse after allegedly
        using several fake ID's to bluff his way into a sheriff's
        department and fondle female prisoners. </p>
        <p>I don't know the details of either case, but I'd be
        willing to bet each hoax began to unravel when the
        perpetrators embellished once too often or nudged the
        envelope of believability half an inch too far. At that
        point, their lies imploded, bringing down the house. </p>
        <p>Far less serious and far more humorous was a situation
        I recall from the early 1970s, when I covered the
        outdoors for this newspaper. </p>
        <p>(Trust your Uncle Venob. He has a good memory,
        especially in matters of lies.) </p>
        <p>The story involves an angler and a fish that grew by
        several inches and pounds the longer it stayed out of the
        water. </p>
        <p>Nothing new about that, you say? Happens all the time
        around fish camps, sportsmen's lodges, sporting goods
        stores and boat docks? </p>
        <p>Of course it does. But this particular metamorphosis
        occurred within a matter of hours. By plotting the action
        on a map, I could chart its course, minute-by-minute,
        from Jefferson City to Knoxville. </p>
        <p>Rockfish were still a relatively new import to
        Tennessee waters in those days, and Cherokee Lake was the
        local hotspot. The current state record is a whopping
        601/2 pounds, but back then a 15-pounder was certified
        bragging material. Anything larger was spectacular. </p>
        <p>I was sitting at my desk one afternoon when an excited
        fisherman called from a dock on Cherokee. He had just
        caught a 17-pounder, by golly, and wanted to bring it by
        The News-Sentinel to show me. </p>
        <p>The guy apparently had friends scattered along Highway
        11-E, and they were just as anxious as he to spread the
        riveting news. About every 30-40 minutes, I'd get a phone
        call from one of them, each time closer to Knoxville. </p>
        <p>With each call, the fish grew. </p>
        <p>By the time the guy actually showed up at 208 W.
        Church Ave., I was certain he had smashed the state
        record, the U.S. record and, quite possibility, the world
        and galactic records. </p>
        <p>Instead, he produced a rockfish that -- I'm being
        generous here -- might have eclipsed 12 pounds. Thirteen
        at the outside. </p>
        <p>Alas, he didn't get his picture in the newspaper. </p>
        <p>Then again, he didn't find himself in the pokey under
        $2 million bond. </p>

        <font size="5">M</font>usings from near and far as we sip
        another cup of eggnog and ponder anew the question that
        crosses our mind every Christmas season: What the heck is
        figgy pudding anyway? </p>
        <p>* Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of the Interior, recently
        presented a ''corporate wildlife stewardship'' award to a
        company for its leadership role in protecting endangered
        species. </p>
        <p>Babbitt praised the company for being -- I quote
        directly from a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service dispatch
        -- ''among the first to provide practical solutions that
        allow us to enjoy a healthy environment while promoting
        economic growth.'' </p>
        <p>Mr. Secretary went on to say that this company ''has
        worked with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and its
        counterpart state agencies to develop solutions that
        protect wildlife . . . .'' </p>
        <p>Wow. What a caring company. In this day of the evil
        corporate empire, it does my heart good to discover there
        is a conglomerate with an environmental conscience. </p>
        <p>Just what is the name of this leader? </p>
        <p>How about ''Champion International.'' </p>
        <p>Yes, Virginia. The same Champion International whose
        paper mill in North Carolina has been fouling the Pigeon
        River for most of this century. The same Champion
        International that received another EPA wastewater
        permit, despite objections from everyone in Tennessee
        government from the governor on down. </p>
        <p>Oh, well. I suppose when human beings achieve
        ''endangered species'' status along the Pigeon River,
        Champion International will come to their rescue. And
        maybe receive another award from the government. </p>
        <p>Hel-LO, Washington! Any intelligent life out there? </p>
        <p>* Now that your blood is simmering, consider this
        verse from a recent newsletter of the Smoky Mountain
        Gator Club, the University of Florida's local booster
        organization. </p>
        <p>To the tune of You-Know-What: </p>
        <p>Once we had a coach on Rocky Crock, </p>
        <p>Some people called him Phat Phil. </p>
        <p>He always helped us out on Rocky Crock, </p>
        <p>And we all dream of him still. </p>
        <p>(Chorus) Rocky Crock, you'll always be, </p>
        <p>Second in the S.E.C. </p>
        <p>Poor old Rocky Crock, </p>
        <p>Rocky Crock, Tennessee. </p>
        <p>Once they thought they had a quarterback, </p>
        <p>Plucked him from a good family tree. </p>
        <p>But when it came to winning championships, </p>
        <p>He was zero to three. </p>
        <p>(Chorus) </p>
        <p>Over a hundred-thousand people came </p>
        <p>And sat in the Rocky Crock house. </p>
        <p>When the Gators finished eating them, </p>
        <p>They were as quiet as a mouse. </p>
        <p>Well, the words DO rhyme, although the beat -- I use
        the term ever-so-loosely -- is jerkier than Ernest P.
        Worrell on speed. </p>
        <p>But, as they say down at the jock dorm, ''facts is
        facts.'' Florida's drubbing streak against Tennessee
        would wear out the Energizer bunny. </p>
        <p>* Just when you think bureaucratese has replaced
        English as America's official language, along comes a
        delightful renegade. </p>
        <p>Brian Muirhead, flight systems manager of NASA's Jet
        Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., had this to
        say about problems with a sun sensor on the Mars
        Pathfinder: The sensor became ''contaminated in some
        way,'' he told reporters. ''Something is preventing the
        light going through it, like somebody ate candy and
        licked your sunglasses.'' </p>
        <p>NASA corrected the problem. And I hope Muirhead gets a
        medal for common sense. </p>
        <p>* Did you see the Louis Harris and Associates poll
        about how Americans feel about journalists? The poll
        where most people think we in the news business are
        ''arrogant'' and ''less compassionate''? </p>
        <p>Hey! Who asked those jerks, anyway? </p>
        <p>Sorry. I just couldn't resist that. Please accept this
        yummy bowl of figgy pudding as a gesture of my sincere
        humility. </p>

        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">I</font> was in Orlando, Fla., a few years
        ago to visit my daughter who was interning at Walt Disney
        World. One afternoon while she helped Mickey Mouse make
        more money, I took a long walk around her apartment
        complex. </p>
        <p>At first glance, this was your stereotypic, stuccoed,
        tile-roofed, palm-treed hangout for Florida
        twenty-somethings. There was the obligatory pool and
        tennis court, each designed for social gatherings instead
        of geezer activities like swimming and tennis. Plus acres
        of asphalt -- lined-off, numbered and speed-bumped. </p>
        <p>But as I neared one intersection, something caught my
        eye behind a row of oleander bushes. I stepped to the
        edge of the sidewalk, peered through the foliage and saw
        a small marsh. </p>
        <p>I'm relying on memory here, but I'd guess the thing
        was roughly two or three times the size of the floor plan
        of a typical suburban house. Yet it was a full-fledged
        wetland. </p>
        <p>Red-winged blackbirds called from the cattails and
        willows. Wading birds stalked small fish and frogs in the
        shallows. Dragonflies skittered hither and yon. I heard
        the quiet ''szzchweep'' of a drake mallard and, cutting
        my eyes skyward, watched the greenhead coast in on
        motionless wings and settle gently on the surface of the
        water. </p>
        <p>In the midst of Metropolis? </p>
        <p>You better believe it. And the more I walked around
        the apartment complex, the more of these mini-marshes I
        found, each teeming with plants, fish and wildlife.
        Because of their location, they surely had been created
        as part of the apartment construction. I have no idea how
        many of these little refuges exist in the Orlando area,
        but if my daughter's complex is typical, they have to
        make a significant contribution to the native flora and
        fauna of that bustling tourist region. </p>
        <p>I mention that episode in hopes the two factions in
        the Turkey Creek wetland fight might make a sincere
        effort to find common ground. </p>
        <p>Surely you've heard of this controversy. It centers
        around a piece of marshy land in West Knox County that
        developers want to use for an extension to Parkside Drive
        and environmentalists want to preserve. Although I'm not
        intimately familiar with the fine print, I'm here to tell
        you a compromise is possible. </p>
        <p>No, not a win-win for everyone. But not a lose-lose
        either. </p>
        <p>Since this is the Christmas season, let me propose a
        wish list: </p>
        <p>I wish the pro-development side would drop the ''tree
        hugger'' and ''mosquito factory'' slurs and realize a lot
        of fine folks, who may or may not live in West Knoxville,
        are genuinely concerned about Mother Earth. Further, I
        wish the pro-developers would admit this is a NIMBY thing
        for them; everybody wants strict air and water law
        enforcement (do the words ''Pigeon River'' ring a bell?),
        just as long as their particular factory, highway plan,
        subdivision project or other high-dollar deal isn't
        stifled by them. I also wish the pro-developers would
        quit harping on the fact that the Turkey Creek wetland
        didn't used to be wet; geophysical changes constantly
        occur, by the hand of humans or not. And finally, I wish
        the pro-developers would understand that because American
        wetlands -- which are far from ''wastelands'' -- have
        been drained with reckless abandon for two centuries, the
        precious few remaining ones are that much more valuable. </p>
        <p>As for the environmentalists, I wish they would
        understand that not every piece of ''wildlife habitat''
        has to be vast, uncharted wilderness; the burgeoning deer
        population in Knox County is proof alone. Further, I wish
        they would realize that these developers have, as best I
        can tell, gone above and beyond the call of duty to
        soften the negative impact on the ecosystem. What's more,
        I wish they would appreciate that business interests,
        whether driven by conscience or regulation, are more
        willing than ever to incorporate wildlife mitigation into
        their plans instead of merely cranking up the bulldozers.
        </p>
        <p>Despite what you hear from both camps, this is not a
        black-white issue. There is an abundance of gray, if
        either side is willing to notice. </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        <p><font size="2"><i>By Sam Venable News-Sentinel
        Columnist</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">I</font>'m going to tell you a story
        that's 121/2 years old. In the business of daily
        newspapering, this is ancient history. </p>
        <p>But it's not ancient to Dewey Wyrick. The events are
        as fresh in his mind right now as they were the June
        morning in 1984 when he met, alive and in the flesh,
        Santa Claus. </p>
        <p>Wyrick is an artist who lives in Rockford. You may
        remember his tender ''Storyteller'' portrait that was
        quite popular during the Tennessee Homecoming '86
        celebration. </p>
        <p>A copy of that painting is reproduced here. See the
        little girl sitting on her ''grandfather's'' lap? That's
        Wyrick's own daughter, Brooke, who is now a senior at the
        Webb School. The lad with the coonskin cap is an amalgam
        of the generic ''boy next door.'' </p>
        <p>But the old guy with the flowing white hair and beard?
        That's Santa. </p>
        <p>''That was his real name -- Santa C. Claus,'' says
        Wyrick. ''He had a driver's license and Social Security
        card to prove it.'' </p>
        <p>At one time, the man was known as LeRoy Scholtz. He
        had his name legally changed to Santa Claus in 1980. He
        lived in New York and worked for a modeling agency.
        Wyrick still has some old newspaper and magazine ads
        featuring Scholtz in his Santa attire. They're realistic
        enough to make you believe all over again. </p>
        <p>Scholtz/Santa came into Wyrick's life that June
        morning in '84 as he was working on a drawing of the Old
        Mill in Pigeon Forge. </p>
        <p>''He just walked up and started a conversation,''
        Wyrick recalled. ''Said he liked my work because it
        featured children. To be honest, I thought he was some
        kind of nut at first. Here it was the middle of summer,
        and he had on a long-sleeved shirt with Christmas
        decorations. His car even had a reindeer painted on the
        side.'' </p>
        <p>Santa gave Wyrick a photo of himself and his
        grandchildren and asked the artist to reproduce it.
        That's exactly what he did, creating a mock-up of what
        would later serve as the basis of his Homecoming piece. </p>
        <p>Wyrick tried to contact the old man and set up a
        promotional tour. Despite leaving messages at talent
        agencies, all he got were dead ends. </p>
        <p>''When I finally reached him, he was ill and somewhat
        incoherent,'' Wyrick said. ''I cancelled my production
        plans and altered the faces in my painting.'' </p>
        <p>The Homecoming portrait and poster were released in
        November 1985 and were well-received. Just one month
        later, however, Wyrick got word that Santa had died, sick
        and alone, in a Chicago hotel. The story ran in
        newspapers all over the country, including The
        News-Sentinel. </p>
        <p>Wyrick donated part of the proceeds from the sale of
        the poster to East Tennessee Children's Hospital and the
        Christian Academy of Knoxville. </p>
        <p>Said the artist: ''I always felt this would've made
        Santa happy.'' </p>

        <p><br>
        <font size="5">C</font>ROSSVILLE -- Normally, rock
        quarries are no place to take a vehicle, but on this day,
        with the help of a three-day cold snap and four-wheel
        drive, we drive through the sandstone depression across
        frozen mud and sheets of ice. </p>
        <p>The quarry belongs to Charles Davis, a native of
        Crossville and a third-generation quarryman and stone
        mason. The vehicle belongs to David Rose, also from
        Crossville, and president of Tennessee Building Stone,
        the largest supplier of Crab Orchard sandstone on the
        Cumberland Plateau. </p>
        <p>The quarry has been in Davis's family for 40 years.
        Davis inherited it from his father Cecil, a renowned
        stone mason. The quarry is known for producing
        earth-toned rock -- browns and buffs as opposed to pink
        and blues. </p>
        <p>A light dusting of snow covers the loose slabs and the
        multihued cross-sections of cap rock. With a little
        imagination, you could be standing in the Painted Desert
        of Arizona rather than in a three-acre rock quarry off
        Rock Quarry Road. </p>
        <p>''Seven years ago I thought this was played out,''
        said Davis. ''David here talked me into shooting just one
        more bench, and we found a fresh seam.'' </p>
        <p>''You find a place on a hill or a creek where there's
        an outcropping of stone, and you take your chances from
        there,'' said Rose. </p>
        <p>The rock is called Tennessee quartzite. Found within a
        50-mile radius of Crab Orchard, it ranges in color from
        pale red to gray-blue and is prized the world over for
        its tight grain and density. </p>
        <p>There are at least 20 stone companies in the
        Crossville-Crab Orchard area. The larger ones are
        equipped with industrial-sized saws that render 10-ton
        blocks into hearths and mantle pieces. Many, like Charles
        Davis', are family operations consisting of a phone, a
        rock yard and two or three people to work a small quarry.
        </p>
        <p>Davis has what's known as a flagging quarry. It
        produces flagstone and wafer-thin pieces of sandstone
        that can be used as wall veneer. There is a motorized saw
        that chops stone into brick-sized chunks, called rubble,
        but for the most part, the rock is separated into
        sections by hand, with a wedge and a maul. </p>
        <p>Rose, whose company owns or has contracts with a dozen
        quarries on the Cumberland Plateau, compared quarrying
        sandstone to surface mining. </p>
        <p>''It's a crap shoot,'' he said. ''You can spend weeks
        removing the overburden and never hit a good slab. The
        majority of quarries around here have been worked out and
        abandoned, but over the years the demand has grown to
        where people are coming back to work them some more.'' </p>
        <p>After the heavy equipment exposes a seam of sandstone,
        Davis and his crew bore a series of holes 5 feet deep and
        shoot the rock with explosives, breaking off a bench
        approximately 8 feet wide, 5 feet deep and 150 feet long.
        </p>
        <p>Working from the end, the quarry crew then skims off
        sheets of rock by hand, using wedges and mauls to
        separate the sandstone along its natural fissures. </p>
        <p>''The thinner rock is the money rock,'' said Davis.
        ''It lays flat. Also, nice square and rectangle pieces
        bring five times as much as irregulars.'' </p>
        <p>Rose said that while Tennessee quartzite costs a
        little more than brick -- about $90 a ton -- the real
        cost is in the installation since the rocks have to be
        individually cut on the building site. </p>
        <p>''It's not the kind of trade they teach in vocational
        school,'' he said. ''If you don't start as somebody's
        helper, there's no way to learn how to lay and cut rock. </p>
        <p>''Charles here and I were laying stone when we were
        teenagers. I was never fast enough, so I gave it up.'' </p>
        <p>Davis said his quarry has been a good provider for 11
        years and that he's keeping his fingers crossed it'll
        produce for several more. His quarry adjoins several
        others. In fact, an aerial view taken above Rock Quarry
        Road would reveal that all the quarries are essentially
        mining the same ridge. </p>
        <p>At the end of Rock Quarry Road is the old Crab Orchard
        quarry, which has been worked as hard as any. On this
        day, only one person is breaking rock in the freezing
        cold, and his name is Chester Stone. Using a chisel and
        maul, he splits the slabs horizontally into 100-pound
        sheets, which he wrestles into the back of his pickup
        truck. </p>
        <p>''He's probably being paid by the ton,'' said Davis.
        ''There are easier ways to make a living, but he's
        working at his own pace. If it wasn't so cold, there'd be
        others out here doing the same thing.'' </p>

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Richard Powelson, News-Sentinel Washington bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>ASHINGTON -- President Clinton will have a successful second term if he can keep cutting federal spending significantly every year and make steady progress toward a balanced budget, former Gov. Ned McWherter said.
<P>   McWherter, attending his third presidential inauguration, said in an interview: &#39;&#39;I think those are the (key) issues . . . to continue on the course of reducing the deficit, work toward a balanced budget.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Tennessee&#39;s governor from 1987 to 1995, McWherter said he was pleased that Clinton got on a middle-of-the-road approach to many issues in the last couple years of his first term and began reducing the deficits in the federal budget.
<P>   McWherter was among the more moderate Democrats who advised Clinton in 1995 and 1996 to keep on a centrist course.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think he did that, and that overall is what really contributed to his re-election,&#39;&#39; McWherter said. &#39;&#39;People realized that he was governing from the center.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Another big need that the Clinton administration should address in its second term, he said, is getting the rising cost of the massive Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security programs under control.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They just absolutely need to be dealt with . . . in an orderly, responsible way that doesn&#39;t do tremendous damage to the people on the receiving end. I think you&#39;ll see that happen.&#39;&#39;
<P>   During McWherter&#39;s second term, the state got permission from federal officials to reform its Medicaid program into a lower-cost, managed-care system that was  renamed &#39;&#39;TennCare.&#39;&#39; McWherter said he hopes the federal government and all states will adopt similar Medicaid reforms across the country.
<P>   In the 1996 presidential campaign, McWherter was Tennessee chairman of the Clinton-Gore campaign. After Clinton carried Tennessee in 1992 by only five percentage points, and the state in 1994 elected more Republicans to the U.S. House and Senate and also gave them the governor&#39;s office, McWherter recommended that Clinton and Gore visit Tennessee often before the 1996 election. They did and carried the state, though narrowly.
<P>   McWherter said it will be very difficult but not impossible for Democrats and Republicans to agree on many more budget cuts to balance the budget. He said the budget problem is such a major one for the country that both parties must put aside partisanship to solve it.
<P>   Here is McWherter&#39;s approach to progress on the issue: &#39;&#39;The wishful thinking would be . . . (for) the Republicans and Democrats declare a political truce for 10 months, or 12 months or six months, and say: &#39;We&#39;re going to come together and do what needs to be done that&#39;s responsible and orderly to put the country in the right direction and not have any partisanship displays and not talk (critically) about each other.&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;And then, kind of like you do at a basketball game, blow the whistle and say: &#39;Toss the ball; we&#39;re ready to go.&#39; I don&#39;t know how they will ever do it unless they do something like that.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Clinton and McWherter both served as governors of adjoining southern states for a time and became friends. They still talk occasionally about federal and state issues, but McWherter continues to have no interest in moving to Washington to work, he said.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Tom Humphrey, News-Sentinel Nashville bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- Tennessee&#39;s ban on anti-obesity drugs that are widely used in other states will be reconsidered on Tuesday by the board that imposed it.
<P>    The state Board of Medical Examiners meeting comes as the crusade to repeal Tennessee&#39;s prohibition of so-called &#39;&#39;phen/fen&#39;&#39; treatments moves to the state Legislature. A bill to overrule the board&#39;s ban has already been introduced.
<P>    &#39;&#39;They&#39;re under political pressure,&#39;&#39; says Sharon Segal of Knoxville, who heads a coalition of phen/fen advocates. 
<P>    The board, which is responsible for enacting rules on the practice of medicine in Tennessee, has declared doctors may not write prescriptions for the controversial anti-obesity drugs. Tennessee is the only state with such a far-reaching prohibition, prompting those who want the drugs to get them in other states.
<P>    The Tennessee Medical Association, which represents doctors statewide, recently petitioned the board to reconsider its prohibition. A board subcommittee will take up the topic Tuesday morning in Nashville, followed by consideration of any recommendation by the full board that afternoon.
<P>    Segal says the TMA move was &#39;&#39;a great big plus for us,&#39;&#39; but she is none too optimistic that the board will backpeddle from its longstanding ban. The board listened to pleas from Segal and others for a repeal of the ban last year, but then board Chairman O.M. McCallum said the panel would await results of studies of the treatment before acting.
<P>    &#39;&#39;They&#39;re doing this under duress,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;They may just throw us a bone.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Such a token move, she said, could involve changing state rules on the prescriptions but leaving them overly restrictive -- or announcing an intention to come up with new rules while postponing the effective date.
<P>    Sen. Steve Cohen, D-Memphis, has introduced a bill that would allow doctors to write prescriptions for phen/fen, more properly known as fenfluramine and phentermine, as appetite suppressants to treat chronic obesity.
<P>    In a letter to McCallum, Cohen said &#39;&#39;thousands&#39;&#39; of overweight Tennesseans are traveling to other states for phen/fen.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This is an inconvenience to our citizens, as well as, I would imagine, placing their health at risk as some of these (out-of-state) clinics apparently do very little for the patient except prescribe the drugs when there may be other medical needs,&#39;&#39; he wrote.
<P>    &#39;&#39;These decisions are best handled by a professional board and not by the Tennessee General Assembly, but 49 other states and our citizens tell us that the board has failed to meet the needs of Tennessee citizens.&#39;&#39;
<P>    McCallum said last year that the board wanted to see results of a recently launched study of phen/fen that is under way at the University of Tennessee School of Medicine in Memphis.
<P>    McCallum said there is much concern that phen/fen treatment aggravates pulmonary hypertension and causes death in a significant number of persons treated.
<P>    Advocates say there have already been adequate studies on the risks entailed in taking the diet pills and a decision on the risks vs. benefits should be left to treating physicians.
<P>    Seagle, who heads the Tennessee Coalition to Lift the Ban on Schedule Four Anti-Obesity Medications, said she has lost about 100 pounds, thanks to phen/fen. Many morbidly obese persons, who risk death without major weight loss, cannot afford to travel out of state for the drugs, she says.

		<FONT SIZE="+2">J</FONT>anuary is Radon Awareness Month, and in observance the American Lung Association and Knox County Health Department are urging all local residents to test their homes for dangerous levels of the radioactive gas.
<P>   Radon typically moves up through the ground to the air above and into your home through foundation cracks and other openings. Homes act like a vacuum and trap radon inside, where it continues to build up and can be deadly at high levels.
<P>   Unfortunately, any home could have a radon problem. The good news is the gas can be detected by testing, which is easy and inexpensive.
<P>   The Health Department is sponsoring a Radon Test Program, and Knox County homeowners may purchase a radon test kit for a nominal fee by participating.
<P>   The program is being funded by a $10,000 grant through the Washington, D.C.-based National Association of Counties.
<P>   The Health Department received the grant last May and will continue the program through April this year to promote radon awareness.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Our first year we concentrated on giving away the test kits to entice people to check their homes,&#39;&#39; said Frank Duncan, an environmentalist and radon program manager at the Health Department.
<P>   Duncan estimated some 750 kits have been given away. Now, the Health Department sells the kits for $4 and is focusing more on educating the community about the dangers of radon. The ALA also has kits available.
<P>   In addition, the Health Department and ALA offer booklets about radon -- &#39;&#39;Home Buyer&#39;s and Seller&#39;s Guide to Radon,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Consumer&#39;s Guide to Radon Reduction: How to reduce radon levels in your home,&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;A Citizen&#39;s Guide to Radon.&#39;&#39;
<P>   To register for the Radon Program or for more information about acquiring kits or the booklets, call the Health Department at 544-4242 or the ALA at 602-7922.

<P>   * My Place -- A program of Knoxville&#39;s Community Development Corporation for children ages 5-12 with a focus on providing inner-city children with tools needed to survive and overcome the effects of violence, $40,000.

<P>   * Summer Program for Inner City Youth -- a continuation grant to allow Emerald Avenue Urban Youth and Leadership Foundation to operate its summer youth program for pre-schoolers through 12th graders in three inner-city communities, $40,000.
<P>   * Teens as Teachers -- A program of the Knox County Health Department that trains teens to teach younger students about the dangers and consequences of tobacco use, $3,649.
<P>   * Think First Program -- A program to help reduce the incidence of non-fatal head and spinal cord injuries through education or youth, $6,250.
<P>   * West Knox County Senior Center -- To the Knox County Alliance of Seniors to establish a senior center in West Knoxville, $43,350.
<P>   * Youth at Risk After-School Program -- To support the Morningside Heights Homeowners Association in providing a structured after-school program, $6,000.
<P>   Agencies that are sponsoring projects were asked to submit proposals for funding, and then council members recommended appropriate projects to the Community Health Improvement Committee of the Covenant Health board of directors for approval.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   More than $1,300 in alleged counterfeit money was confiscated early Satruday morning, Knoxville Police Department officials said. 
<P>   KPD Officer Carlene Johnson answered the call Saturday to an unidentified East Knoxville location, where she was told she would find a bag of money, said Monty Boone, a KPD public information officer. 
<P>   Boone said Johnson found 27 $50 bills in the bag. Police realized the money was fake when they discovered, &#39;&#39;All the serial numbers (on the bills) were the same,&#39;&#39; Boone said. 
<P>   KPD has turned the money and the investigation over to the U.S. Secret Service, Boone said.

<P><h3>Girl who admitted killing mom competent for trial</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   COOKEVILLE -- A 16-year-old girl who admitted stabbing her mother to death is mentally competent to stand trial, according to psychiatrists for the state.
<P>   Tiffany Taylor is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Teresa Parramoure, 38. The woman&#39;s body was discovered Nov. 26, a day after Taylor sought treatment for a stab wound. She told doctors she fell on a knife.
<P>   Authorities said the hospital notified the Putnam County Sheriff&#39;s Department and the girl changed her story, telling investigators she had been kidnapped and raped by a Jackson County man who had a knife.
<P>   Her father, Parramoure&#39;s ex-husband Ronnie Taylor, took the girl home with him.
<P>    The next day, he decided she needed some clothes and took her to Parramoure&#39;s trailer, where he discovered the body.
<P>   Judge John Hudson told defense lawyers at the hearing Friday that they can have the girl evaluated by psychiatrists of their choice. But he said the state should not have to pay for the second opinion.

<P><h3>Cumberland Gap names Woods superintendent</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   CUMBERLAND GAP -- A veteran park ranger and manager who is assistant superintendent at the Virgin Islands National Park will become superintendent of Cumberland Gap National Historic Park, officials said Friday.
<P>   Mark Woods, 36, will take over the post on Sunday, Jan. 26, said Jerry Belson, head of the National Park Service&#39;s southeast field area. 
<P>   Woods will succeed Charlie Vial, who recently retired after a 32-year Park Service career. 
<P>   Woods, a native of Greenville, S.C., began his career with the Park Service in 1980 as a seasonal park ranger at Ninety Six National Historic Site, a Revolutionary War park near Greenwood, S.C.
<P>   He also has been assigned to Kings Mountain National Military Park in South Carolina, Andrew Johnson National Historic Site in Tennessee and Cumberland Island National Seashore in Georgia.
<P>   Prior to his assignment in the Virgin Islands, Woods was superintendent for five years at Guilford Courthouse National Military Park at Greensboro, N.C.

		<basefont size="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>State Supreme Court more moderate</B></font><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Study: Changes on bench cause shift</FONT></BASEFONT><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By Randy Kenner, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Tennessee Supreme Court moved from being conservative to moderate following the 1990 elections, when three justices were replaced, according to a new study.
<P>   Also, if the state&#39;s high court agrees to hear an appeal, it tends to change the lower court&#39;s decision.
<P>   And its ruling will probably be a more liberal one than it would have been prior to 1990, the study contends.
<P>   According to University of Tennessee journalism professor Daniel J. Foley&#39;s survey of 610 opinions from 1989-1996, the court actually tends to be conservative in deciding criminal cases and liberal in civil ones, with one glaring exception -- death penalty cases.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I wouldn&#39;t ever say this court is a liberal one,&#39;&#39; Foley said last week. &#39;&#39;On criminal cases, it was a shift from very conservative to more moderate.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Foley&#39;s study shows a five-member court that&#39;s been badly split for years over the most publicized issue it faces -- the death penalty.
<P>   Former Justice Penny J. White was ousted from the court in a yes-no referendum last year, primarily because she sided with the majority in reversing the death penalty in the case of a man who raped and then stabbed to death a 79-year-old Memphis woman.
<P>   White&#39;s ouster was widely seen as an indicator of voter dissatisfaction with the court&#39;s decisions on the issue.
<P>   &#39;&#39;In no area was there greater contrast between the old and new courts, or among individual justices on the new court, than on capital punishment,&#39;&#39; Foley wrote in &#39;&#39;Tennessee Supreme Court: A Statistical Analysis of an Ideological Shift After the 1990 Election.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The article is included in the Tennessee Law Review.
<P>   &#39;&#39;This study included 12 death penalty cases that were appealed to the old court, of which the justices upheld the death penalty 11 times or 92 percent of the cases,&#39;&#39; Foley wrote. &#39;&#39;The study also included 16 cases appealed to the new court, of which the justices voted for the death penalty eight times or 50 percent of the cases.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Although few people have seen Foley&#39;s work, some are already raising concerns that it&#39;s difficult -- no matter what criteria is used -- to define a judicial decision as &#39;&#39;conservative&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;liberal.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Court of Criminal Appeals Judge Gary Wade also suggested that it wouldn&#39;t be hard to be considered more liberal than the pre-1990 court, which consisted of five white males, four of whom were older than 67.
<P>   &#39;&#39;That might be like saying Ronald Reagan was to the left of Attilla the Hun,&#39;&#39; Wade said.
<P>   Wade questioned the use of the terms in a letter to Foley.
<P>   &#39;&#39;For example, the use of traditional terminology such as &#39;liberal&#39; and &#39;conservative,&#39; while at one time reasonable classifications of judicial philosophy, in these days of political partisanship are charged with emotion,&#39;&#39; Wade of Sevierville wrote.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Where I come from, the word &#39;liberal&#39; in any context is a fighting word.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Foley, a Montanan who worked as a reporter and editor for 17 years before joining the faculty at UT five years ago, said the study grew out of a public affairs reporting class project about two years ago.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It started off as a classroom project, and when I got the numbers, they were so interesting that I thought maybe I can get something published out of this,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   As part of the survey, he used eight different criteria to determine whether a decision could be categorized &#39;&#39;liberal&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;conservative.&#39;&#39; Foley admitted that it&#39;s an inexact methodology and there will always be exceptions to each category.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think if we get enough cases we can overcome those sort of defects,&#39;&#39; he added.
<P>   His main findings:
<P>   * The court, from 1989-1995, either reversed or modified the previous ruling in 62 percent of the cases it heard. Foley wrote that the justices and other court observers weren&#39;t surprised.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They don&#39;t grant &#39;cert&#39; (agree to hear a case) to tell the world that the Court of Criminal Appeals was right,&#39;&#39; Knox County Public Defender Mark Stephens said Thursday.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They grant &#39;cert&#39; in an effort to clarify the status of the law.&#39;&#39;
<P>   * Despite the high rate of reversal, a lot of cases aren&#39;t being reversed. For example, in fiscal year 1994-1995, the Supreme Court granted 98 of the 903 applications for permission to appeal.
<P>   * The court is almost always unanimous in its decisions. During the survey period, the court issued 550 unanimous opinions and 60 split decisions.
<P>   * There would be a whole lot more unanimity if it weren&#39;t for the death penalty. While such cases accounted for only 6 percent of the total decisions, those cases accounted for 40 percent of the split decisions.
<P>   * Foley&#39;s study indicated that 58 percent of the court&#39;s decisions between 1989-1995 were &#39;&#39;conservative&#39;&#39; on criminal appeals while 60 percent were &#39;&#39;liberal&#39;&#39; on civil appeals.
<P>   The old court voted liberal in 43 percent of its decisions, while the new one did 58 percent of the time.

		<FONT SIZE="6"><B>Nepotism claims raise controversy in McMinn</B></font><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Commissioner alleges registrar violated law by hiring in-law</FONT><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By Ron Clayton, Special to The News-Sentinel</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>THENS, Tenn. -- In the midst of nepotism allegations, a McMinn County Election Commission member is leaving her post and has asked that veteran 20-year Registrar Loretta Sliger also step down.
<P>   Willene Mason was appointed to the commission two years ago. Her stint ended when local election officials learned from a state policy manual that Mason, also a secretary at Niota Elementary School, couldn&#39;t sit on the commission without violating a state regulation barring county employees from serving on election commissions.
<P>   If she were a teacher, however, Mason wouldn&#39;t be barred from election commission service, she said. Mason said she wasn&#39;t aware of the policy when she was appointed.
<P>   Mason alleges Sliger has violated the law in hiring her daughter-in-law to work in the office and in her approval of relatives of other commission members for work in part-time paid positions.
<P>   When questions about Sliger&#39;s practices were raised late last year, the commission asked county attorney Vance Baker for an interpretation of the law.
<P>   A letter from Baker indicated Sliger could be in violation of the election law for hiring her daughter-in-law, Kathy Sliger, who has since left her job with the commission, officials said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;You told us this statute didn&#39;t apply to you,&#39;&#39; Mason told Sliger during a special called commission meeting Thursday.
<P>   Sliger said she understood her office was exempt from the nepotism law.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The commission told you that if they could not hire their relatives to work in the office or the election process, you should not have your relatives working in the office,&#39;&#39; Mason told Sliger at the meeting.
<P>   Mason also alleged that while she was a precinct officer in 1994, Sliger told her to dismiss one of that precinct&#39;s workers so a commission member&#39;s daughter-in-law could work the precinct.
<P>   &#39;&#39;You have put the commission in violation of the law,&#39;&#39; Mason told Sliger on Thursday.
<P>   After calling for the registrar&#39;s resignation, Sliger asked commissioners for their opinions.
<P>   Those officials, many of whom were apparently surprised by the controversy and asked for time to review the law, promised to review the matter and all pertinent records before making a decision.
<P>   &#39;&#39;My daughter-in-law was hired by the election commission,&#39;&#39; Sliger said, &#39;&#39;not by me.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The county has no nepotism laws, but a portion of the registrar&#39;s salary is paid through state funds, which is why the county attorney has said he believes the nepotism statute could apply to the office.
<P>   However, State Coordinator of Elections Brooks Thompson said Friday that election laws concern the hiring of election commissioners or their relatives and do not address relatives of the registrar.
<P>   Thompson said state law specifically classifies registrars as county employees and states &#39;&#39;nothing shall be construed on their status as state employees.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Further legal opinions may be sought.
<P>   &#39;&#39;All Mr. Baker did was issue a letter on general nepotism,&#39;&#39; Sliger said. &#39;&#39;This might take an attorney general&#39;s opinion.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Commissioners have until their February meeting to make a decision on Sliger, said Mason, who plans to seek an attorney general&#39;s opinion, if necessary.
<P>   Mason&#39;s resignation is effective Jan. 31.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Louise Durman, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he wink is gone.
<P>   But Margie&#39;s back.
<P>   For years, Knoxvillians looked to television weather anchor Margie Ison for information, and a wink at the end of her broadcast.
<P>   Ison has been a weathercaster at WATE and at WBIR over the last 25 years.   She &#39;&#39;retired&#39;&#39; from weather reporting in 1989, but returned full time in November to WATE-Channel 6, for Good Morning Tennessee and noon news reports.
<P>   The wink she used to give came about when students at schools where she would speak asked her to say hello to them on television. She would tell them  time didn&#39;t permit that but she would give them a wink.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It became a trademark,&#39;&#39; she says, &#39;&#39;but no, I don&#39;t do it any more.&#39;&#39;
<P>   She&#39;s petite and a sharp dresser, hardly changed in appearance though she&#39;s a grandmother of four. Her easy, friendly approach is somewhat like &#39;&#39;comfort food.&#39;&#39; People believe her -- and quote her reports.
<P>    &#39;&#39;After her first day back we were inundated with phone calls, E-mail, cards and letters,&#39;&#39; says WATE news director Martha Dooley. &#39;&#39;It has been absolutely phenomenal. We are thrilled.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Ison has attended seminars and workshops across the country to learn technology, but decided against going to college to become a meteorologist. She now uses the vital information that comes to the station through computers to interpret reports.
<P>   Complete computer information was new when she returned to WATE, but she is learning quickly. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s getting easier and easier,&#39;&#39; she says.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The weather hasn&#39;t changed. I&#39;ve lived the weather. I can look at weather systems and spot patterns.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The station&#39;s two meteorologists, Matt Hinkin and Ken Weathers, give her support.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We have a team concept,&#39;&#39;  Hinkin says. 
<P>    &#39;&#39;Margie has a lot of experience doing weather in East Tennessee and has a repertoire with the audience.&#39;&#39; He adds, &#39;&#39;She&#39;s as sweet as sugar.&#39;&#39; Hinkin has been at WATE seven years.
<P>   Ison&#39;s known around the area simply as Margie and many viewers consider her a friend. She thinks that&#39;s partly because she learned to look in the camera and talk one-on-one: &#39;&#39;Hey, (thinking of a friend), you&#39;re going to need a jacket today,&#39;&#39; she&#39;ll report.
<P>   Besides giving the weather, Ison has a weekly series, &#39;&#39;Six Heroes with Margie.&#39;&#39; In it, she gives recognition to people in the community who &#39;&#39;make a difference with their giving.&#39;&#39;
<P>    In 1989, wanting a change of pace, she quit providing weather reports and began &#39;&#39;Margie on Location&#39;&#39; sessions with country music personalities. WBIR had decided to put &#39;&#39;heavy-duty concentration&#39;&#39; on celebrity interviews, says Jim Hart, who was station manager at WBIR for 13 years with Ison. He is now senior vice-president for television of Scripps-Howard Broadcasting.
<P>   Asked if it makes a difference that Ison is not a meteorologist, he replied, &#39;&#39;A different kind of credibility goes with the seal (of meteorology), but no one has greater connection with the audience.&#39;&#39; 
<P>   &#39;&#39;She had a great enthusiasm for what she did and viewers picked up on it,&#39;&#39; says Hart. He also cites her responsiveness to people when she is out in public.
<P>   WBIR-Channel 10 news anchor Bill Williams, who worked with Margie,  calls her a &#39;&#39;terrific communicator and broadcaster.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;It was good to work with her. She knew weather patterns,&#39;&#39; he says.
<P>   Ison started as a weekend weather reporter in 1969 for Channel 10, left to join WATE full time in 1971, left WATE in 1979 to rejoin WBIR, remaining until July, 1995.
<P>   She spent the next year decorating their home in Fountain City and doing some freelance work until WATE wooed her back last fall.
<P>   The studio had an opening for a morning weathercaster and Martha Dooley viewed tapes of prospects from across the country. None were really &#39;&#39;right,&#39;&#39; she explains.
<P>     &#39;&#39;I kept thinking of Margie,&#39;&#39; Dooley says. They had been friends since working together at WATE previously.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Margie is from East Tennessee and people believe her,&#39;&#39; says Dooley. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;I was nervous about calling her, but finally I got the courage and left a message on the answering machine.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;I have been so fortunate,&#39;&#39; Ison says of her career. &#39;&#39;Most of the time I am not looking for a change.&#39;&#39;
<P>    One of her endearing characteristics is her ability to remember people and names.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I use word association,&#39;&#39; she says, but says occasionally it backfires, such as a time she called a woman whose last name was Wolf, &#39;&#39;Mrs. Fox.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Margie arises at 3:15 a.m. at the home she and husband Jim, who is retired from TVA, have in Fountain City. She does her own makeup and dons her own clothes at home. (The performers do have a clothing &#39;&#39;allowance.&#39;&#39;)
<P>   She reports to work about 4:45 a.m. for Good Morning Tennessee, now expanded to 90 minutes, 5:30 to 7 a.m. She finishes after the noon weather reports. She&#39;s in bed by 7:30 p.m.
<P>   &#39;&#39;When you get up that early, 7 is like 11 p.m. I am learning to be a morning person.&#39;&#39; 
<P>   She says her friends asked how she would be able to handle the early hours since they know mornings aren&#39;t her best time. She laughs and says she signed a short-term contract to see how it works out.
<P>   Her current schedule doesn&#39;t give her time for speeches to the many groups who ask her (she used to do a lot of public speaking plus some singing). &#39;&#39;You have to be very selective about what you can do at night.&#39;&#39;.
<P>  Ison is 5 feet, 2 inches tall and thin. &#39;&#39;I watch my fats, but I have never had a weight problem,&#39;&#39; she says.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think a positive attitude can lesson the character lines. When you&#39;re happy it shows.&#39;&#39;
<P>   She grew up in Cookeville where her father was the late Rev. S.E. Wood, a Baptist minister. Her mother, who was a teacher, is now 89.
<P>   She met future husband Jim while she was in high school and he was in Tennessee Tech.  They married before she graduated from high school. They lived in Chattanooga before moving to the Claxton community where they lived about 20 years before moving to Fountain City.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Jim has always been wonderful to support me and my career,&#39;&#39; she says. He stays involved in church and community organizations.
<P>   The Isons&#39;  have two daughters. Debbie is married to Dan Stidham and they have two sons, Alex and Josh, and live in Knoxville. Jill is married to Marine Major David McMillan, and their home is in Quantico, Va., with daughters Brigitte and Brittany.
<P>    All were here for Christmas holidays.
<P>   Asked how she&#39;d liked to be remembered, Ison replies, &#39;&#39;As a good communicator.&#39;&#39;

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Knoxville Police Department is hoping to get more bang for taxpayers&#39; bucks in efforts to curb drug trafficking in the city&#39;s housing projects, authorities said.
<P>   The agency is phasing out its current method of paying officers overtime to work off-duty security for Knoxville&#39;s Community Development Corporation, which operates the city&#39;s housing projects, KPD Lt. Don Green confirmed this week.
<P>   Instead, the $1 million KCDC grant money will be used to pay officers at the normal &#39;&#39;straight-time&#39;&#39; rate, he said.
<P>   The amount of the grant is fixed, so the move won&#39;t necessarily save taxpayers&#39; money. It will, however, allow KCDC to stretch those dollars by paying more officers to patrol in and around the high-crime housing projects, Green said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;re running more (security patrol) shifts than ever before,&#39;&#39; Green said.
<P>   KCDC operates the city&#39;s housing projects and administers the security grant, which requires that extra patrol efforts be designated to help eliminate drug trafficking. However, by mutual agreement, KPD provides the manpower for that security effort.
<P>   When the program was initiated, Green said KPD did not have enough officers to work both KCDC security and regular patrol shifts. So, he said, officers worked and were paid overtime to do the job.
<P>   Since then, KPD has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in community policing grants to fund salaries for more officers. The city also has provided funding for more KPD officers.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Now, we have the officers to assign to KCDC as part of the normal work week,&#39;&#39; Green said. &#39;&#39;The ranks have grown.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Green said KCDC officials also have promised to fund the security positions for the next three to five years even if the federal grant were eliminated.
<P>   Right now, the program is in transition, with some officers still earning overtime and others accepting permanent, straight-time security positions, Green said. He expects the change to be complete by spring.
<P>   The change has prompted some grumbling among KPD officers whose paychecks were boosted by the overtime pay. Green acknowledged that, saying, &#39;&#39;officers were dependent on it.&#39;&#39; 
<P>   But Green also noted officers were overworked by the overtime procedure. It was not unusual, under the current funding method, for officers to work a regular shift and then spend another six to eight hours patrolling for KCDC. Green said the new plan should eliminate officer fatigue and stress.
<P>   Police Chief Phil Keith said officers&#39; complaints were without merit.
<P>   &#39;&#39;You can&#39;t expect the taxpayer to pick up (the cost of paying officers) time and a half,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;The benefit is to the taxpayer.&#39;&#39;

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT>olice allege a 61-year-old Mechanicsville man arrested in a drug raid that yielded a cache of drugs and more than $20,000 in stolen property has been dealing drugs for nearly 50 years.
<P>   Hollis Nathaniel Ross allegedly greeted Knoxville Police Department officers with a loaded pistol when they kicked in his 1405 Boyd St. door during the Friday night raid, authorities said.
<P>   The raid, conducted by KPD&#39;s Repeat Offenders Program, or ROP, unit with help from officers working off-duty security for Knoxville&#39;s Community Development Corporation, yielded heroin, cocaine, synthetic morphine, tranquilizers and marijuana, as well as between $20,000 and $30,000 in stolen property and eight guns, ROP Officer Jeff Thornburg said.
<P>   According to Thornburg, Ross was first arrested for selling drugs in 1953. In between prison stints, Ross allegedly has been dealing drugs ever since, Thornburg said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;He&#39;s basically been dealing drugs his entire life,&#39;&#39; Thornburg said.
<P>   Thornburg said officers had a search warrant for the house. They &#39;&#39;started knocking on the door and didn&#39;t get a response,&#39;&#39; so they forcibly entered the house by kicking the door, he said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;(The officers) were met by Mr. Ross, who was standing there with a pistol pointed at them,&#39;&#39; Thornburg said.
<P>   Ross allegedly just had finished &#39;&#39;cooking and cutting&#39;&#39; 22 grams of crack cocaine, according to Thornburg. Crack is a crystalized and more potent form of powder cocaine. After pointing the pistol, Ross turned and ran into his kitchen, Thornburg said. Ross tossed the pistol into a trash can but was captured before he could flee from the house, the officer said.
<P>   Officers also discovered 18 grams of heroin, which Thornburg said is a &#39;&#39;heck of a lot of heroin for Knoxville.&#39;&#39; Also found in the house were 300 Dilaudid pills, a synthetic morphine that sells on the street for $60 a pill. Dilaudid, a highly addictive drug which is usually crushed and then injected by the user, was popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s but has waned in popularity in recent years.
<P>   &#39;&#39;He had a smorgasbord of drugs,&#39;&#39; Thornburg said.
<P>   Thornburg said it appeared Ross had been trading drugs for stolen loot, including shoplifted goods still in the original packaging, items stolen in burglaries and stolen guns.
<P>   Ross was charged with five felony drug charges, a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge and other state offenses. Thornburg said his case will be forwarded to federal authorities for possible prosecution because penalties in U.S. District Court are stiffer than those levied by state judges.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Morgan Simmons, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT>ive freshwater mussels native to the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers in Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia have been added to the federal endangered species list.
<P>   Listed in the endangered category are the Cumberland elktoe, oyster mussel, Cumberlandian combshell, purple bean, and rough rabbitsfoot.
<P>   Noreen K. Clough, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Southeast regional director, said the listing of the five mussels is not expected to have any significant impact on private landowners or on water projects.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There are 24 federally listed mussels presently in the Tennessee and Cumberland river systems, many of which have been listed for 10 years,&#39;&#39; said Clough. &#39;&#39;These listed species have had little effect on ongoing private land activities such as logging, agriculture, land development, and home construction.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The decision to list the species as endangered follows a comprehensive study on the impact of the listing on private landowners and consideration of public comments submitted during two public meetings.
<P>   The ranges of all five species have diminished significantly, and the mussels now exist in relatively small, isolated populations. The Cumberland elktoe inhabits very localized portions of the Cumberland River system in Kentucky and Tennessee, while small numbers of the oyster mussel and Cumberland combshell can be found in portions of the Cumberland and Tennessee River basins in Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia.
<P>   The purple bean and rough rabbitsfoot currently survive in a few river reaches in the upper Tennessee River system in Tennessee and Virginia.
<P>   &#39;&#39;These species were eliminated from much of their historic range by impoundments, siltation, and water pollution that has degraded their habitat,&#39;&#39; said Clough. &#39;&#39;Poor land-use practices have contributed to a deterioration of water quality, and their restricted ranges now make these species very vulnerable to toxic chemical spills.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The United States has 297 recognized species and subspecies of freshwater mussels, and Native Americans once made extensive use of the mussels or their shells for food, tools and jewelry.
<P>   Mussels have been called &#39;&#39;Mother Nature&#39;s 911 call&#39;&#39; because they are generally the first animals to die when a river&#39;s water quality deteriorates.
<P>   In the 20th century, mussels have suffered a greater decline than any other wide-ranging animal group in the United States.
<P>   Clough said that now that these five mussels are federally listed, they will be eligible for Endangered Species Act funding for conservation and recovery activities.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Listing draws attention to their plight and encourages federal and state agencies, local governments, conservation organizations, and private citizens to take an active role in their protection,&#39;&#39; she said.

<P>
<P>   When a clerk at an area Weigel&#39;s store denied a would-be thief the money in the till, he made off with the whole cash register instead, authorities alleged.
<P>      Samuel Wolfenbarger, 31, who gave Glenda Lane and Townview Drive addresses, was charged with theft over $500 and aggravated assault in connection with the 11:17 p.m. at the Weigel&#39;s, 411 E. Summitt Hill Drive, police said.
<P>   Knoxville Police Department Patrol Officer Kristina Norris wrote in a report a man gave a Weigel&#39;s clerk money to buy a candy bar. However, when the clerk opened the cash register, the suspect reached in and tried to take money from the till, she wrote. The clerk unsuccessfully attempted to slam the suspect&#39;s hand in the drawer, but the suspect picked up the register and fled into the Townview Terrace apartment complex across the street, the report stated.
<P>   Two employees and the store manager chased the suspect, and the manager tackled him, police said. The suspect&#39;s head was cut in the fracas, according to police. KPD H-squad officers, including Norris, Ron Trentham, Ivan Green, Chris Baldwin, were at Townview on a &#39;&#39;crime suppression&#39;&#39; operation and quickly intervened, Trentham said.
<P>
<P><h3>Sevier Boys and Girls Club official fired for inappropriate behavior</h3>
<P>
<P>   SEVIERVILLE -- The executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of the Smoky Mountains has been fired for inappropriate behavior and is being investigated by police.
<P>   Jim Arwood, president of the Boys and Girls Club board of directors, said the group met Thursday and decided to fire Dale Bynum, who has been director of the club since January 1990.
<P>   Arwood declined to comment on what Bynum did that was inappropriate.
<P>   Sevierville Police Chief Robbie Fox confirmed Thursday that his department is investigating the allegations.
<P>
<P><h3>Two Virginia men are killed in 2-vehicle wreck in Hawkins County</h3>
<P>
<P>   Two Virginia men were killed Friday in Hawkins County when a tractor trailer pulled in front of their car on US Highway 11W, authorities said.
<P>   Thomas Freeman Jr., 41, of Emporia, Va. and Al L. Woodruff Jr., 33, were killed in the accident reported at 9:54 p.m., a dispatcher with the Tennessee Highway Patrol said.
<P>   The driver of the tractor trailer, James R. Baker of Jonesborough, Tenn., was not injured. Charges and citations are pending further investigation, the dispatcher said.
<P>
<P><h3>Ambulance driver involved in fatal wreck gets pretrial diversion</h3>
<P>
<P>    BLOUNTVILLE -- An ambulance driver accused of causing a fatal accident won&#39;t have to go to trial or serve any time behind bars.
<P>    The record of Earl Morphew, 38, of Chilhowie, Va., will be expunged if he successfully completes two years&#39; probation.
<P>    Prosecutors said Friday they had no legal standing to refuse his request for pretrial diversion. Morphew will be required to speak to emergency personnel groups about the dangers of emergency response. He will be banned from driving an ambulance.
<P>    Police said he ran a red light and struck a car while responding to a call in June. A 17-year-old girl died in the collision.
<P>
<P><h3>42-year-old Bluff City man is banned from Cherokee National Forest for year</h3>
<P>
<P>    GREENEVILLE -- A federal magistrate banned a hunter from the Cherokee National Forest for a year.
<P>    The ban against Ronnie Greene, 42, of Bluff City stemmed from charges he drove an all-terrain vehicle on a closed road in November. He had been cited previously on similar charges.
<P>    During the hearing Friday, Greene also was put on probation for a year and ordered to pay a $500 fine.
<P>
<P><h3>Jonesborough school suspends boy for allegedly trying to start gang
<P></h3>
<P>   JONESBOROUGH -- A fourth-grade boy was suspended from Jonesborough Elementary School by officials who said he was trying to start a gang.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know if it meets the full definition, but the children involved were knowledgeable of gang activities, and this can plant a seed in young minds,&#39;&#39; said Assistant Principal Bill Bowman on Thursday.
<P>   Bowman conceded there was no evidence of any gang activity.
<P>   &#39;&#39;My son, the ringleader, is a kid who sleeps with the light on,&#39;&#39; said Danny Holmes. &#39;&#39;His only organized activity is playing baseball.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Holmes likened the situation to that of Johnathan Prevette of Lexington, N.C., the 6-year-old who was disciplined for kissing the cheek of a girl in his class in September.
<P>   The school has a zero-tolerance policy on gangs, Bowman said.
<P>   The Washington County Board of Education has no written policy on gang activity, said schools director Grant Rowland, but principals have discretionary powers.
<P>   The boy was suspended Wednesday for three days.
<P>
<P><h3>Bristol man sentenced to federal probation for computer crimes</h3>
<P>
<P>    GREENEVILLE -- A computer hacker got three years of federal probation for illegally trafficking computer passwords for access to a Middle Tennessee State University system.
<P>    Robert Hicks, 26, of Bristol also was fined $4,000 Friday. And he must pay restitution of $1,614 to MTSU. Prosecutors said he got computer account names and passwords from Wendell Dingus, which allowed him to get into the school&#39;s system. Dingus, 29, of Kingsport pleaded guilty earlier this month to similar charges. Sentencing for Dingus is scheduled for March 3.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Maggie Jackson, The Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>hen Elliot Beddor is in New York on business, he stays at a small hotel where the staff knows him. There and in other cities, he takes in the sights when his schedule permits. His nap schedule, that is. Elliot, the 15-month-old son of a Minneapolis retailing executive, is one of a growing legion of pint-size travelers who tag along when Mom or Dad takes a business trip.
<P>    About 15 percent of the 275 million business trips taken in 1995 included children, up from 12 percent of 222 million trips in 1990, according to the Travel Industry Association of America.
<P>    As in olden days, many trips involve a working dad, stay-at-home mom and kids. But increasingly, working parents are going on the road with one or two children, and perhaps a nanny. Call it adventure travel cum briefcase.
<P>    With teddy bear in tow, the youngest travelers sightsee or swim in the hotel pool while their parent works. Older children go to kids&#39; camps proliferating at hotels that are eager for such business. In-between or after work, the fun begins.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I get to see more of Elliot when I travel than when I&#39;m home,&#39;&#39; says his mom, Gail Dorn, vice president of communications and community relations for Dayton Hudson Corp. &#39;&#39;In between meetings, he&#39;s right there.&#39;&#39;
<P>    On a recent trip to New York, Dorn finished morning meetings in time to meet Elliot at a restaurant for lunch. As he chomped on peas and tortellini, guzzled orange juice and gurgled at waiters, Dorn pondered with his nanny, Cheryl Anderson, over which museum Elliot would take in that afternoon.
<P>    Of course, taking baby along is often tricky. Changing a diaper in a closet-sized airplane bathroom is a challenge. An earache on the road is doubly painful to all. And novel foods don&#39;t always sit well.
<P>    Once Elliot accompanied Dorn to a business dinner at a New York restaurant and happily sampled mango sorbet and other tidbits. But back in the hotel elevator, up came Elliot&#39;s dinner -- all over a group of businessmen sharing the ride.
<P>    &#39;&#39;To this day, the hotel staff teases me and Elliot about that night,&#39;&#39; laughs Dorn, who also travels with her stepchildren Paige, 12, and Paris, 10.
<P>    Parents say the effort is worth it, providing not only extra time with their children but also opportunities for children to see the working world and the wide world.
<P>    T.J. Cline, a 21/2-year-old who has flown more than 100 times, is &#39;&#39;friendly because he&#39;s used to being around so many different people,&#39;&#39; says his mother, Nancy Lieberman-Cline, a professional basketball player. &#39;&#39;To me, there&#39;s only been an upside to taking him with me.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Boston consultant Khouri Jamison-Carlen also finds that she&#39;s more effective in her work when her 14-month-old is near. &#39;&#39;I&#39;m not worrying, wondering, missing her. She&#39;s there. I&#39;m able to focus better,&#39;&#39; she says.
<P>    A child might say the same. &#39;&#39;Sometimes I miss my Mom. I&#39;d rather be on a trip with her,&#39;&#39; says Elayna Schranz, the 6-year-old daughter of Hilton hotels executive Joanie Flynn. Elayna names new foods, hotel pools and airplane rides as her favorite parts of such trips.
<P>    For many parents, business trips are a staple of work life. Yet they&#39;re also growing shorter (3.1 nights on average) and more frequent (5.73 trips a year) -- a trend conducive to taking a child along.
<P>    At the same time, in an era of dual-career couples, single parents and far-off grandparents, it&#39;s often easier to bring a child on a trip than to arrange extra child care.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The option of Mom staying home and taking care of the kids, as in the Ozzie and Harriet era, is often no longer there,&#39;&#39; says Nancy Dunnan, an associate editor at the Travel Smart newsletter.
<P>    Older working parents also have the means and desire to bring kids along on business trips, notes Christine Tempesta, president of KiddieCorp, which cares for children during conventions and other business meetings.
<P>    Tempesta&#39;s 11-year-old business has grown up to 20 percent a year as both hotels and companies wake up to this trend.
<P>    If a hotel or convention center can&#39;t babysit the children accompanying a meeting, Tempesta steps in. She can create a day-care center or preschool at almost any site in 26 cities, using managers and toys dispatched from her San Diego headquarters and local helpers.
<P>    Caring for children of the business traveler has become a point of competition for hotels, says Jim Austin, spokesman for the Phoenix Point Hilton at Squaw Peak resort, where roughly 30 percent of visiting children are with parents on business, up from 23 percent in 1994.
<P>    To entertain them, Squaw Peak provides &#39;&#39;Coyote Camp,&#39;&#39; where children ages 3 to 12 learn about Native American culture or Arizona&#39;s history for $45 a day.
<P>    Other Hilton hotels extend camp into the evening or add special activities for children visiting on business, says Elayna&#39;s mom, Joanie Flynn, director of leisure and resort marketing for Hilton. Other chains are making similar efforts.
<P>    In an age of burgeoning work-family benefits, companies are extending a helping hand. The costs of bringing a child are almost always borne by employees, but companies are trying to help in other ways.
<P>    Eli Lilly & Co., Deloitte & Touche and others open either company day-care centers or back-up child-care programs for employees&#39; visiting children. A Chicago manager traveling to Los Angeles on business could, for example, put his child in a Los Angeles center during a business trip.
<P>    Xerox Corp. is currently writing a booklet for employees on business travel with children, partly as a result of employee interest in bringing children to the company&#39;s main training center in Virginia.
<P>    Dayton Hudson allows Dorn to keep half her travel savings if she stays over a Saturday night -- a boon for her travel costs. But perhaps more importantly, the company supports her desire to bring Elliot.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t believe it creates any distractions at all,&#39;&#39; says Larry Gilpin, executive vice president of human resources at Target Stores, a Dayton Hudson division. &#39;&#39;I think it may even increase (Dorn&#39;s) ability to focus and concentrate on the business she&#39;s there for.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Jerry Dean, News-Sentinel business writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> Knoxville firm&#39;s proprietary technology is fueling a $350 million coke manufacturing and co-generation power project that promises to provide large, reliable quantities of coke and electricity to an Indiana mill while meeting environmental standards.
<P>   Federal Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 specified Knoxville&#39;s Sun Coal and Coke Co.&#39;s process by name as setting the standard for &#39;&#39;maximum achievable control technology.&#39;&#39; That is because its process is emission-free and generates none of the toxic byproducts of conventional coke ovens, according to Bud Davis, a spokesman for Sun Co. of Philadelphia, of which the Knoxville firm is a subsidiary.
<P>   Michael Dingus, president of the Knoxville firm, said construction is under way at the East Chicago, Ind. site on his firm&#39;s coke manufacturing plant. The plant, set for initial production by March 1998, is designed to provide Inland Steel Co. vast, reliable supplies of coke and electricity for at least 15 years.
<P>   Sun, Inland and Primary Energy Inc. of Merrillville, Ind., jointly announced their plans in November. Inland has signed a contract to buy 1.2 million tons of the plant&#39;s coke, used in iron manufacturing processes at Inland&#39;s Indiana Harbor Works.
<P>   Sun, under its agreement, is spending $185 million to design, build, finance and operate the cokemaking portion of the project, which incorporates Sun&#39;s proprietary nonrecovery coke technology on a 95-acre Indiana Harbor Works site. Inland has bought all its coke from other outside suppliers since 1993, when it closed the last of its operating coke oven batteries. 
<P>   Sun anticipates using the proprietary process to build more plants, making the company a signficantly larger player in the marketplace.
<P>   Sun&#39;s nonrecovery process burns all volatile gases produced in the coke-manufacturing process except sulfur, a residual contaminant removed from the flue gas during the electrical co-generation process. 
<P>  Dingus said the concept had been considered for nearly two decades, but only came together for this larger commercial project when the three firms agreed to pool their efforts, aided by governmental agency programs.
<P>   Sun and Primary Energy have worked with Indiana economic development officials and those of the City of East Chicago, the Northwest Indiana Forum and Northern Indiana Public Service Co. in obtaining economic development and tax incentives for the project. The project will receive EDGE (Economic Development for Growing Economies) credits, job-training grants, enterprise-zone expansion and tax credits and abatements. 
<P>   Primary Energy, a NIPSCO Industries subsidiary of Merrillville, Ind., will design, build, finance and operate the part of the project intended to remove sulfur from the coke plant&#39;s flue gas. Heat from the plant will be used to produce steam for electricity.
<P>   Inland President Dale E. Wiersbe said the project will cut Inland&#39;s coke costs significantly, thus making Inland iron production more competitive. 
<P>   Sun &#39;&#39;has been refining the technology for this environmentally benign method of making coke since the 1960s at a plant in Vansant, Va.&#39;&#39; Wiersbe said. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;Sun has successfully manufactured coke, using this process, for many years,&#39;&#39; he added.
<P>   Davis, the Sun spokesman in Philadelphia, said similar nonrecovery-process plants had been built for coke manufacture in Australia as early as 1914, and more recently in Mexico. But he said nothing on the scale of the Indiana project had been built using what is known as the Jewell-Thompson nonrecovery coke oven. It was designed by the late B. Ray Thompson, whose Elk River Resources Inc. of Knoxville was sold to Sun Co. and renamed Sun Coal and Coke.

		<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>hat&#39;s the wackiest small business in America?
<P>   Each year, NewsReach, a monthly small-business newsletter based in Jamison, Pa., compiles a list of some of the most unusual new business ventures. Some examples:
<P>   * Alligators under your bed. A bed and breakfast inn run by the operators of Wildlife Gardens in Houma, La., offers overnight stays in cabins built atop a well-stocked Southern swamp. The $60 fee includes breakfast and alligator views.
<P>   * Have Doggie, We&#39;ll Do. &#39;&#39;We pick up where your dog left off,&#39;&#39; promises this Chicago-based waste-removal business. Contract pooper-scoopers pay weekly visits to homes, condos, even some park district sites. 
<P>   * Divorce Magazine. Bridal magazines have succeeded without flocks of long-term subscribers. Why not a magazine for wedding bells gone sour -- those one-in-three marriages that don&#39;t last -- figures an enterprising publisher who hopes to fashion a city-by-city success with articles like &#39;&#39;Should I tell my ex about the affair?&#39;&#39;
<P>   * Ashes to asteroids. A Houston-based company called Celestis Inc. promises a high-tech approach to dispersing the ashes of a loved one. For $4,800, including a commemorative video of the launch and on-Earth memorial service, the company will send seven grams of an individual&#39;s cremated remains into space aboard a rocket.

<P>
<P>   <B>SURGING FORWARD -- </B>Knoxville is among the 140 markets where the Coca-Cola Co. is introducing &#39;&#39;Surge,&#39;&#39; a new &#39;&#39;fully-loaded citrus soda.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The beverage should be arriving in store shelves and vending machines this week, and Surge will be promoted with two commercials during Super Bowl XXXI.
<P>   Coke is targeting &#39;&#39;free-spirited youths&#39;&#39; ages 12-21 and &#39;&#39;hardworking young adults&#39;&#39; ages 21 to 34 as potential buyers for the green-colored concoction.
<P>   The &#39;&#39;fully-loaded&#39;&#39; apparently refers to the addition of maltodextrin, a complex carbohydrate. Also being promoted is its low carbonation and wide-mouth can that makes, the company said, for easy &#39;&#39;drinkability.&#39;&#39; 
<P>
<P>

<P>   <B>ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT -- </B>Even the best hotels can do better, according to a survey of business travelers.
<P>   Westin was ranked No. 1 among 11 upscale hotel chains rated by business travelers, according to J.D. Power and Associates and Frequent Flyer Magazine.
<P>   Out of a perfect score of 1,000, Westin got 670 points; followed by Renaissance, 642; Hyatt, 637; Marriott, 633; and Omni, 629.
<P>   &#39;&#39;While our readers may never need to buy another bar of soap or another bottle of shampoo . . . they are a very demanding group of people,&#39;&#39; John Migs, publisher of OAG Frequent Flyer Magazine.
<P>   J.D. Powers would not release results for hotels scoring below the industry average of 626. 
<P>   Factors driving travelers&#39; satisfaction and their contribution to the overall guest satisfaction survey, were: guest room, 33 percent; price and value, 22 percent; arrival process, 22 percent; departure, 13 percent; and food and beverage, 11 percent.

<P>    <B>ON THE ROAD</B> <B>--</B> The recreational vehicle industry is hoping for a big increase in sales in the coming years as baby boomers edge toward retirement. The Recreational Vehicle Industry Association says the average RV owner is 48 years old, with most of the purchases among 55- to 64-year-olds. The association says older RV buyers tend to purchase more expensive vehicles, most likely because they have more disposable income than people with young children.

		<FONT SIZE="+2">J</FONT>im Simpson of Volunteer Realty&#39;s commercial division was named by the Knoxville Association of Realtors as the 1996 Realtor of the Year at KAR&#39;s annual banquet, held Friday, Jan. 17, at the Hyatt Regency.
<P>   A committee of past award recipients chose Simpson, based on active participation in KAR, the Tennessee and National Associations of Realtors; his community service record; and the quality of his business relationships with clients and fellow KAR members.
<P>   Realtors also installed Dick Scarborough of Farragut as KAR&#39;s 1997 president and recognized 224 area Realtors for posting &#39;&#39;outstanding years&#39;&#39; with sales exceeding $1 million. 
<P>   Scarborough reported 6,946 Knoxville area homes were sold during 1996 at an average price of $117,113. That exceeds the average 1995 price of $110,718 for the 6,536 homes sold that year.
<P>   Scarborough, owner and president of AAIM Century 21 Real Estate Co. in Farragut, said lower interest rates helped boost 1996 home sales. Average home prices have risen steadily from $70,012 in 1986 and $94,786 in 1991, Scarborough said.
<P>   Simpson, a 1975 real-estate graduate of the University of Tennessee, has been active in both committee work and leadership positions within the association, and he was KAR&#39;s 1994 president. 
<P>   He served eight years on KAR&#39;s board of directors and six years on the Tennessee Association of Realtors board.
<P>   Simpson, 1996 president of the Tennessee Commercial and Investment Realtors, was elected 1997 vice president of the Tennessee Association of Realtors. 
<P>   A specialist in selling commercial and investment real estate, Simpson is a certified commercial investment member as designated by NAR&#39;s Commercial Investment Real Estate Institute.
<P>   Scarborough, president of AAIM Century 21 for 30 years, is a Niles, Ohio, native who was reared in Harriman, Tenn. 
<P>   Scarborough has served on the KAR Board, has chaired its committees, has served as three-term president of the East Tennessee Real Estate Brokers Council and has served on the National Brokers Communication Congress.
<P>   Other KAR officers installed Friday were B.J. Swinehart of RE/MAX Preferred Properties, president-elect; Rod Ferguson of RE/MAX Preferred Properties, vice president; and George Wallace of Coldwell Banker Wallace & Wallace, treasurer. Installed as directors were Jim Ford of Volunteer Realty, Al Gibson of Realty Executives and Michael Wood of Wood Realtors.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Bill Luther, News-Sentinel sportswriter</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>HARLOTTE, N.C. -- New faces and names often lead to better results in auto racing.
<P>    Ken Schrader, 41, is excited about such an opportunity. After nine seasons with Hendrick Motorsports, the St. Louis native looks to owner/crew chief Andy Petree for guidance to victory lane.
<P>    Schrader, who enjoys just being in a race car, has four victories, 60 other top-five finishes and more than 100 from sixth to 10th. But those aren&#39;t the numbers anticipated when he departed the USAC midgets and sprint cars in 1983.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve had a lot of top 10s, but that&#39;s not what you race for even though I&#39;ve finished in the top 10 in points seven times since 1985,&#39;&#39; Schrader said. &#39;&#39;I haven&#39;t done as well as I wanted to.&#39;&#39;
<P>    With two years remaining on a contract with Rick Hendrick, Schrader chose to join Petree and the Skoal Bandit crew, and continue to drive Chevrolet Monte Carlos.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This was a change I wanted to make. Rick was kind enough to work with me and gave me an opportunity I wanted to pursue,&#39;&#39; said Schrader, who is winless in the last 170 Cup races. &#39;&#39;This move is not like I was shuffled out and looking for a ride.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Schrader doesn&#39;t take this opportunity as being another start in the sport.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Andy is a leader and I&#39;m by no means a rookie going into this deal,&#39;&#39; Schrader said. &#39;&#39;Andy knows what the car should be like, and basically I know the feel when I get in it. I think we&#39;ll be competitive and quickly.&#39;&#39;
<P>    As a crew chief, Petree has been a winner and expects to achieve the same accomplishments as an owner. He guided Dale Earnhardt to two championships (1993-94) and 15 victories during three years with Richard Childress Racing.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We have the talent and resources,&#39;&#39; said Petree, who led now-retired Harry Gant to nine wins in four seasons. &#39;&#39;We should win races, and I expect this team to be a top 10 in points. We want to be considered one of the top teams in this sport. When we accomplish that, then a NASCAR championship is in sight.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Schrader will enter the 1997 season with the same goal -- victories.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t feel that I&#39;ve had any highlights to this point of my career,&#39;&#39; Schrader said. &#39;&#39;I won the Busch Clash (at Daytona) a couple of times and had a good record in The Winston (currently held at Charlotte) -- second, second, second, third, fourth, third -- until the last two years.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Being part of a multi-car team had nothing to do with Schrader&#39;s decision to succeed Robert Pressley as Petree&#39;s driver.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This was just an opportunity to work with Andy, not the multi-car team,&#39;&#39; Schrader said. &#39;&#39;I can say I know because it&#39;s been like that ever since I&#39;ve been there. Rick has done better than anybody, and I think it&#39;s fairly obvious it works.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Schrader might have remained with Hendrick had Petree decided to step aside as crew chief.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Yes, that was most definitely what I wanted. It was a major concern,&#39;&#39; Schrader said. &#39;&#39;Andy also did a great job with Harry (Gant). That&#39;s what led to him going to the Childress operation. It was probably one of the better places for a crew chief to shine, but he had plenty of success before that, too.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Andy has everything in his shop that Rick Hendrick has,&#39;&#39; Schrader said. &#39;&#39;Quite frankly, I&#39;m looking forward to being the center of attention. I like the fact we have one team to concentrate on.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I have a lot to prove and I&#39;m with the team to do it. I have a lot of faith in Andy Petree.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Michael Silence, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">K</FONT>nox County Registrar at Large Irene Lovely said Friday she will retire &#39;&#39;shortly&#39;&#39; from that job of 18 years.
<P>   She would not be more specific on when, saying she was drafting a letter to notify Election Commission members of her intentions. She indicated that letter would be filed with the Election Commission office next week.
<P>   Already, one name has surfaced as a possible successor.
<P>   Laura Nichols, long active in Kids Voting and wife of Knox County District Attorney Randy Nichols, said Friday she is interested in the job that pays about $63,000 a year.
<P>   On Lovely&#39;s announcement, commission-member-to-be Mike McClamroch said, &#39;&#39;I think it is the appropriate action for this situation.&#39;&#39;
<P>   He was referring to last November&#39;s foul-up over early vote totals in the Knoxville-Knox County unification vote. No one in the election office made provisions for separating city and county votes -- a crucial mistake because in order for the question to pass, it had to win with both city and county voters.
<P>   But Lovely said her decision had nothing to do with that turmoil, which after the election she accepted responsibility for.
<P>   In fact, she told The News-Sentinel last summer the November election would be her last and that she was looking at retiring in Florida.
<P>   The voting fiasco, though, had created rampant talk about whether Lovely would retire or be fired. And that was fueled by Lovely taking off a number of days since the election in either vacation time or personal leave.
<P>   She said Friday she was using up that accumulated time before retiring. Her announcement follows a month of turnover for the Election Commission.
<P>   Last month, Republican Hazel Showalter died. This month, Republican Courtney Pearre resigned to take the position of legal counsel to Gov. Don Sundquist, and this week, Democrat Thomas &#39;&#39;Tank&#39;&#39; Strickland Jr. said he would resign before starting a job as the city&#39;s director of community relations.
<P>   Last week, Republicans nominated replacements for Pearre and Showalter. They are McClamroch and fellow lawyer Steve Roth.
<P>   Now the Knox County Democratic delegation must select a replacement for Strickland.
<P>   Knox County Election Commission Chairman Dennis Francis said Friday it will be up to the commission to select Lovely&#39;s replacement. Lovely is a Democrat, and the Election Commission is controlled by Democrats, 3-2, because the Democrats control the state House.
<P>   Nichols said she&#39;s interested in the job &#39;&#39;that&#39;s obviously something very important.&#39;&#39;
<P>   She said if the situation arose with her running the office and her husband appearing on the ballot, she would work with commissioners to handle that matter.
<P>   She said she&#39;s checked Tennessee law and found nothing to prevent her from serving as the registrar.
<P>   Randy Nichols was elected in 1994 to serve the remaining four years of the late Ed Dossett&#39;s term. Assuming he seeks re-election, he would run again in 1998.

		<FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>ocke County&#39;s top executive said Friday the Environmental Protection Agency should give the county the same consideration it afforded Champion International when it granted the company a variance based on economic impact.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We have always had a very high number of families receiving food stamps, welfare, Medicaid and other benefits,&#39;&#39; said County Executive Harold Cates. &#39;&#39;To my knowledge, the socio-economic impact of this polluted river on Cocke County was never considered.&#39;&#39;
<P>   From the state line, 37 miles below Champion&#39;s Canton, N.C., paper mill, the Pigeon River flows 30 miles through Cocke County before emptying into the French Broad River, near Douglas Lake.
<P>   Cates said that pollution on the Pigeon River has hampered county efforts to recruit industry and develop recreation-based tourism.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve lived with the stigma of a dirty river for so long, it has hurt the whole community,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;People want to locate industry where there is a good quality of life, not on a river with a reputation as one of the most polluted in the United States.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Cates said that prior to becoming Cocke County exective, he was employed by the Tennessee Department of Human Services, where he dealt with people on a daily basis who were economically deprived due to the county&#39;s weak economy.
<P>   Cocke County is one of nine counties in Tennessee that the state has classified as economically depressed. The Appalachian Regional Commission also named Cocke County as one of the eight most economically distressed counties in Tennessee.
<P>   &#39;&#39;This river has been a liability to Cocke County for 89 years,&#39;&#39; said Cates. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s now time for it to be turned into an asset for our community.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Twelve companies currently run raft trips down the Pigeon River&#39;s gorge section, where the size and quality of the rapids are comparable to the Ocoee River.
<P>   According to an economic study released by Walters State Community College, a clean Pigeon River could support a $7.3-million-a-year rafting industry.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve been able to develop a tourism program centered around whitewater activity on the Pigeon River,&#39;&#39; said Cates. &#39;&#39;If the river was cleaned up, the potential for recreational development would be even greater.&#39;&#39;
<P>   On Dec. 23, the EPA approved a new permit issued by North Carolina officials allowing Champion to continue operating its Pigeon River paper mill at pollution levels above what is allowed by federal law.
<P>   Tennessee is now pressing EPA to overturn the variance and issue a permit that protects the state&#39;s water-quality standards.
<P>   According to Loretta M. Ucelli, EPA associate administrator for public affairs, Champion&#39;s appeal for a variance, based on the social and economic impact to the company and the surrounding community, was answered by North Carolina.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There is a variance that was economically based, but those decisions were left up to the state,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;North Carolina grants a variance to a particular facility, and it&#39;s EPA&#39;s job to make sure the variance meets the requirements of law and the water-quality standards of the states involved.&#39;&#39;
<P>   David McKinney, chief of environmental services for the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, said Friday the Pigeon could be an outstanding smallmouth bass stream, with good walleye fishing as far up the river as Newport, and a put-and-take brown trout fishery through the winter and spring.
<P>   The Tennessee side of the Pigeon River carries consumption advisories on fish due to dioxin.
<P>   &#39;&#39;As long as the river is posted for dioxin, we&#39;re not inclined to promote it for fishing,&#39;&#39; said McKinney.

<P>   Melvin &#39;&#39;Little Melvin&#39;&#39; Davis, also known as Melvin Tate, is charged in the May 18, 1996, slaying of Brittany Shenice Daniels, who was killed during a drive-by shooting in the Lonsdale Homes housing project.
<P>   Authorities allege Davis, 16, drove one of the cars used during the shooting.
<P>   After his arrest, Davis was released from the Knox County Jail on $50,000 bond with court-imposed restrictions, including a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew.
<P>   The murder charge remains in the hands of the Knox County district attorney general&#39;s office pending a grand jury decision.
<P>   Since the shooting, Davis has been charged with aggravated assault and on Christmas Eve he was shot by a teenager he allegedly robbed, which sparked another arrest charging Davis with aggravated robbery.
<P>   On Friday in Knox County Criminal Court, a Knoxville Police Department officer testified that at 9 p.m. on Oct. 1, she saw Davis at a concert at Thompson-Boling Arena and questioned him.
<P>   Because his presence at the show after 6 p.m. was a violation of his curfew, and because he was shot by an alleged robbery victim at 7:10 p.m., prosecutors asked Judge Richard Baumgartner to revoke the $50,000 bond that Davis posted when he was released on the aggravated assault charge.
<P>   Baumgartner complied and set a $300,000 bond -- sending Davis back to jail until he could post a new bond, routinely 10 percent of the amount set by the court.
<P>   Prosecutors said Davis has claimed he does not have enough money to hire a lawyer to defend him against the aggravated assault charge. His alleged lack of money has not stopped him from getting out of jail on the murder, aggravated assault and aggravated robbery charges, which have a combined bond of $170,000, prosecutors said.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>hrista Gail Pike, on death row for the slaying of a Job Corps student, was in Knox County Criminal Court on Friday and declined to testify in next week&#39;s murder trial of co-defendant and former lover Tadaryl D. Shipp.
<P>   Appearing in shackles before Judge Mary Beth Leibowitz, Pike invoked her Fifth Amendment right to silence because her conviction is on appeal.
<P>   In March, Pike was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to die in the electric chair for her role in killing Colleen A. Slemmer, 19, on Jan. 12, 1995. Pike, 20, was to be executed five days ago, but on Nov. 18 her execution was stayed pending the completion of her appeal.
<P>   Pike, Shipp and co-defendant Shadolla R. Peterson were charged with killing Slemmer in a remote area of the University of Tennessee campus.
<P>   Authorities said Pike led the attack because she thought Slemmer was trying to steal Shipp from her.
<P>   Peterson, 20, pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact. Shipp, 19, wants a jury trial so his attorney, Chris Coffey, subpoeaned Pike to testify. Jury selection begins next week.
<P>   On Friday, Coffey told Leibowitz that he wants Pike to testify about &#39;&#39;facts related to the case&#39;&#39; -- but he was not specific.
<P>   After her conviction, Pike wrote Shipp a note telling him how to plan his own defense.
<P>   She also told him she would testify on his behalf.
<P>   Shipp has admitted he helped Pike carve a pentagram into Slemmer&#39;s chest, authorities said. Prosectors cannot seek the death penalty against him, because at the time of the murder he was a juvenile.
<P>   Slemmer of Orange Park, Fla., was a student at the Knoxville Job Corps Center, along with Pike, Peterson and Shipp.
<P>   The murder -- as well as other acts of violence committed by students -- forced a public outcry that led the U.S. Department of Labor to close the center, which was located on Dale Avenue.
<P>   Pike has appealed her conviction, claiming pre-trail publicity tainted the jury, introducing Slemmer&#39;s skull during the trial was inflammatory evidence that tainted the jury, and death by electrocution is barbarous.
<P>   Defense attorney William C. Talman said Friday if the state Court of Criminal Appeals does not overturn the conviction, he will appeal to the state Supreme Court. Talman said he will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court if the state does not overturn the conviction.
<P>   Because the case is on appeal, Pike cannot testify for Shipp, because she might incriminate herself before the jury, Talman said.
<P>   Appearing before Leibowitz on Friday, Pike said if she was called to testify she would invoke the Fifth Amendment. Leibowitz announced Pike would not be forced to testify and ordered her returned to the Tennessee Prison for Women in Nashville.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- State revenue collections increased enough in December to reduce this year&#39;s shortfall by about $25 million, but not enough to stall layoffs.
<P>    Finance Commissioner John Ferguson said Friday the shortfall for the current budget now is $176 million, and the estimated deficit for the 1997-98 year starting July 1 also is down to about $260 million to $270 million.
<P> 
<P>   &#39;&#39;January will be the big banner month if it holds like this,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>    Tax revenues collected in January reflect December activity and will show how well Christmas sales went.
<P>    &#39;&#39;There&#39;s a big expectation of sales tax collections because of Christmas,&#39;&#39; Ferguson said.
<P>    Still, Ferguson said layoffs proposed by Gov. Don Sundquist &#39;&#39;likely&#39;&#39; are still on track.
<P>    Despite the possibility of looming layoffs, state employees may get a pay raise this year.
<P>    The issue of raises is a sore subject with employees after Sundquist granted pay increases this week for some of his key staffers, ranging from 4 percent to 29 percent. The administration said those staffers had taken on additional responsibilities and the governor&#39;s office reduced costs this year by 15 percent.
<P>    Raises for rank-and-file employees are a &#39;&#39;high priority,&#39;&#39; Ferguson said.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We&#39;re trying to figure out a way to do that,&#39;&#39; he said, though he declined to target a percentage of increase. The Tennessee State Employees Association is asking for an 8 percent pay raise. 
<P>    Ferguson also responded to criticism by some legislators that the estimated shortfalls are inflated.
<P>    They are based, Ferguson said, on recommendations of the Funding Board made up of himself, the governor and the consitutional officers, who also receive advice from University of Tennessee economists.
<P>    The estimated shortfall for the current year was about $100 million and for the next budget year it was $300 million.
<P>    December revenue collections show:
<P>    * Overall collections for the five months of this fiscal year were $473 million, an increase of $30 over the previous fiscal year.
<P>    * Sales tax collections in December were more than $311 million, $7.1 million less than estimated.
<P>    * Franchise and excise taxes in December were almost $45 million, $11.5 million more than estimated.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">K</FONT>noxville&#39;s historic Tennessee Theater has been deeded over to its foundation board, whose members plan a fund-raising drive to renovate the nearly 80-year-old structure.
<P>   The Historical Tennessee Theater Foundation now has control of the 1,500-seat building, which has capital improvement needs from a front curtain, costing around $40,000, to enlarged restrooms, and numerous cosmetic upgrades.
<P>   &#39;&#39;An awful lot needs to be done at this point, probably well over $1 million,&#39;&#39; said foundation president Bruce Hartmann, general manager of The News-Sentinel. &#39;&#39;We hope to hire a firm specializing in theater renovation that will come in and give us an estimate, so we can know what to do.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;re positioning it for success.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Last April, Jim Dick, whose Dick Broadcasting Co. owned the theater for about 12 years, offered it to the city of Knoxville.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I felt that theater should belong to the people of Knoxville instead of an individual or company who could sell it at their will,&#39;&#39; Dick said. &#39;&#39;The theater has operated at a very close to a break-even cash flow.&#39;&#39;
<P>   At the time, Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe said he hoped the theater could be preserved and kept open as an important part of downtown. But he added the theater could be managed and financed better if it were operated by a public-private partnership.
<P>   &#39;&#39;So we set about to seeing the interest, and there was tremendous interest,&#39;&#39; Dick said.
<P>   Just this week, the theater was turned over to the 23-member, nonprofit foundation board, which will be expanded to 30 individuals.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The average person hasn&#39;t any idea how many people use that theater,&#39;&#39; said Dick, adding high schools have held graduations and proms there, and everything else from weddings to Christmas pageants have been performed there. It remains home to Knoxville&#39;s symphony and opera company.
<P>   Twenty-five of 31 dates in January are booked; 14 of 28 are already reserved for February, according to Ashley Capps, president of AC Entertainment, which books the theater&#39;s shows.
<P>   Hartmann added that in order to maintain the theater, the board will look into the possibility of adding a small surcharge per ticket for ticketed events and also may seek city, county and state funding.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We work in historic theaters throughout the Southeastern U.S.,&#39;&#39; Capps said. &#39;&#39;The Tennessee Theater is in pretty good shape. It needs constant maintenance; there are improvements that definitely need to be made. It&#39;s a very functional building, a very comfortable building.&#39;&#39;

<P>    He is one of about 260 mayors attending the winter meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
<P>   The conference&#39;s leadership chose Ashe and another mayor to appear on a panel today to discuss the air-pollution regulation and other federalism problems.
<P>   &#39;&#39;How many thousands of dollars do Knoxville taxpayers have to spend to reach a (new clean air) goal, and if we reach a goal, what are the benefits?&#39;&#39; Ashe asked.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I wasn&#39;t aware that where we are now is unclean.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Between mayors&#39; meetings Friday, Ashe and other mayors talked to President Clinton at the White House, where Clinton generally listened to their concerns, and they met with the Republican leaders of the House and Senate to discuss ways that mayors could work more closely with congressional leaders on issues of mutual interest.
<P>   Clinton generally has been good about seeking input from local government officials on federal issues affecting them, Ashe said.
<P>    But there continue to be too many new, expensive regulations being passed by Washington at the expense of local governments, he said.
<P>   The federal Land and Water Conservation Fund currently helps fund federal public lands. But Ashe said most people visit their city parks often and the nearest national park rarely, so cities also should be getting regular funding to acquire adequate park land before too much land is developed.
<P>   On another matter, Ashe said he hoped his Republican Party begins working more with local coalitions, including minorities and women, to improve its chances of winning the next presidential election.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They have to,&#39;&#39; Ashe said. &#39;&#39;Or they can just keep losing national elections. They can be what the Democrats were for 30 years, which was a congressional party.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT size="2"><I>By David Keim, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n an unusual development for a juvenile case, a jury trial was set Friday for Jason Gaddy, the Karns High School student expelled last year for taking a butterfly knife to a track meet.
<P>   Chancellor Fred McDonald set the case for Jan. 27 after rejecting a motion to dismiss the case because it&#39;s taken longer than 45 days to be heard.
<P>   Jury trials are uncommon for juvenile cases unless a minor is tried as an adult; juvenile judges alone decide juvenile cases.
<P>   &#39;&#39;To my knowledge there has not been one case in Knox County where a juvenile -- who had not been transferred to Criminal Court to be tried as an adult -- had a jury trial,&#39;&#39; attorney Bill Davidson said.
<P>   McDonald and Criminal Court Clerk Martha Phillips concurred.
<P>   The trial will let a jury consider a case that has spurred criticism of Knox County&#39;s &#39;&#39;zero tolerance&#39;&#39; policy toward weapons on school grounds.
<P>   Gaddy, who was 17 when the incident occurred last March but turned 18 last November, said he had the knife because a track team member asked that a bothersome tag be cut out of his shirt. As in other incidents in which students claimed innocent motives, however, he was expelled.
<P>   Although he&#39;s due to be reinstated in March, Gaddy would remain on probation unless his juvenile conviction is overturned.
<P>   Davidson requested a jury trial but argued Friday the case should be thrown out because his appeal, received by Knox County Circuit Court on Oct. 1, wasn&#39;t heard within 45 days. McDonald ruled the time limit didn&#39;t apply if the child wasn&#39;t in custody, but agreed the case should be heard soon. Because a different trial set for Jan. 27 has been settled out of court, lawyers agreed to hear Gaddy&#39;s case then.
<P>   In turning down Davidson&#39;s motion for dismissal, McDonald said, &#39;&#39;Mr. Davidson, if you&#39;re successful doing this, all we&#39;ll see is appeals and requests for jury trials.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Davidson pointed out Gaddy&#39;s freedom has been restricted even if he&#39;s not in custody.
<P>   Gaddy must perform 80 hours of public service, has an 11 p.m. curfew, is forbidden from having &#39;&#39;anything to do with any weapons of any kind&#39;&#39; and is subject to random drug screens, according to the conditions of his probation.
<P>   The appeal of Gaddy&#39;s Aug. 28 juvenile conviction was delayed in part because 4th Knox County Circuit Judge Bill Swann recused himself from the case because he did not believe he could &#39;&#39;view the issues impartially,&#39;&#39; according to court records.
<P>   Asked to elaborate, Swann said, &#39;&#39;I&#39;m forbidden to do so because it&#39;s a pending case, under the canons of judicial ethics.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Asked if he would hear future &#39;&#39;zero tolerance&#39;&#39; appeals, Swann said, &#39;&#39;I can&#39;t imagine the circumstances under which I would be able to maintain an open mind. . . . I&#39;ll be recusing myself for the presiding judge to make such reference as appropriate.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Presiding Judge Dale Workman referred the Gaddy case to McDonald in mid-December. Davidson said the delays -- including delays with the original juvenile court case -- violate Gaddy&#39;s right to a speedy trial.
<P>   Said Gaddy&#39;s mother, Cathy: &#39;&#39;I just want all of this over. It&#39;s been a nightmare for a year. If Jason was a bad kid, I think I could understand it, but he has never in his life given us a bit of problems.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT>rugs, alcohol, money, violence. It was supposed to be fun.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We thought it was party, party, party,&#39;&#39; said 22-year-old Mechanicsville native Lawuni Roper of his younger days. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s the deception of the streets. You think it&#39;s just fun, that it&#39;s the way life has got to be. You don&#39;t know it&#39;s destroying you.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Dozens of young men are learning they have a choice. They&#39;re walking from the deadly streets and playgrounds and into Tribe One, an urban ministry that fights to rebuild spirits and lives.
<P>   &#39;&#39;This is leadership development at its core,&#39;&#39; Tribe One co-founder Danny Mayfield explained. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s not midnight basketball or even just changing people. This is getting people to devote their lives to changing lives.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Roper is one of the success stories. He&#39;s finished the program and plans to start his own ministry using the model he learned from Tribe One founders Mayfield and Chris Woodhull. They hope more youths will do the same.
<P>   Week after week, Woodhull and Mayfield offer their charges -- mostly young black men -- the chance to identify the destructive forces in their lives, let go of their emotional baggage and practice new rules for living.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We tell the guys, &#39;Hey, if you want the jail or the grave, then stay with that path. But if you want to be alive and free, then stick with us,&#39; &#39;&#39; Woodhull said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s a treatment process. It&#39;s not easy -- like Jesus said, it&#39;s a narrow gate -- but it will keep them alive and free.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Eventually, Woodhull said, he and Mayfield would like to see the young men take the Tribe One message and commit to spreading it to save even more young lives.
<P>   It&#39;s a commitment these men share. Mayfield, 27, grew up in Camden, N.J., where he learned firsthand the troubles of the black youths he helps now. He graduated from Knoxville College in 1994, a year after he and Woodhull gave birth to Tribe One.
<P>   Woodhull, 37, is an Air Force child raised in the white middle class. Leaving behind troubles with drugs and alcohol, he gave his life to Christ and to ministry in the inner city.
<P>   In their three years together, Mayfield and Woodhull have tested a variety of approaches. They&#39;ve tried scaring their charges into sobriety and offering mentors who testify to a different way of life. They&#39;ve told them about Christian love and hoped the rest would fall into place. No approach was as complex as the problems they faced.
<P>   The Tribe One model features fun stuff like gymnastics, soccer and trips to McDonald&#39;s. Then there are the weekly meetings at the house on University Avenue or the Episcopal Church of the Ascension on Northshore Drive.  Most gatherings run like this recent one:
<P>   Start with prayer, a simple plea for God&#39;s presence, for safety and patience and love and a measure of joy.
<P>   Mayfield and Woodhull coach the boys through a recitation of the mission. After a few tries, they come up with the right words: &#39;&#39;Preparing people to be neighbors for God&#39;s neighborhood.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s simple,&#39;&#39; Woodhull said. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re preparing ordinary, regular people. They&#39;ll be neighbors, and it&#39;s all for God&#39;s neighborhood, which is an all-inclusive community where everyone receives the care they need.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Then they define the disease these young men face: HIV, &#39;&#39;Hood Infectious Virus.&#39;&#39; It&#39;s a term Woodhull and Mayfield picked up at an urban ministry conference this fall.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Violence is a disease, and they&#39;re infecting each other,&#39;&#39; Woodhull said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s all about money and power and my posse. Christian brothers call it sin. Whatever it is, it&#39;s leading to death and incarceration.&#39;&#39;
<P>   From this painful discussion they move to hope: the &#39;&#39;treatment model.&#39;&#39; The first stage, Mayfield says,  is eliminating destructive forces like drugs, guns, alcohol, misogyny and violent language.   The boys remind Mayfield and Woodhull that guns and drugs are often just part of their lives. Mayfield doesn&#39;t accept that.
<P>   &#39;&#39;You can&#39;t be clearheaded if you&#39;ve still got a gun in your hand,&#39;&#39; Mayfield said.
<P>   From there, Mayfield and Woodhull help the youths understand the pain, fear and anger that drive them to violence. They may write about it, discuss it or just share strategies for resolving it.
<P>   Finally, youths learn a new set of values and habits for new lives. This is the part Grant, 13, likes best. &#39;&#39;They tell you about respect and how to stay out of trouble,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;You don&#39;t have to get into bad stuff on the street.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Tribe One encourages youths to respect human life and respect themselves, to make friends who won&#39;t lead them into danger, and to make change by changing themselves first.
<P>   If they want to remain alive and free, they can adopt new habits like responding instead of reacting, thinking win/win, staying prepared and seeking to understand others.
<P>   All these lessons are posted on a flip chart and reviewed at every meeting. Woodhull said he hopes the simple format will encourage young people to spread the message.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There&#39;s nothing we&#39;re doing that they couldn&#39;t do,&#39;&#39; Woodhull agreed. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s all about setting the captives free, and that&#39;s just Jesus&#39; mission. I don&#39;t think it has to be more complicated than that.&#39;&#39;

		</basefont><h3>Nashville lawyer tapped for Tennessee AG post</h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>   NASHVILLE -- John Knox Walkup, who has previously served as second-in-command of the state attorney general&#39;s office, was chosen by the state Supreme Court on Friday night to succeed his former boss as Tennessee&#39;s top lawyer.
<P>    Walkup, who left his post as deputy attorney general two years ago to join a Nashville law firm, was picked by the five Supreme Court justices from 11 lawyers who applied to succeed Attorney General Charles Burson.
<P>   Burson is resigning effective Feb. 14.
<P>   Walkup will fill the remainder of Burson&#39;s term, which expires after the Supreme Court election in 1998.
<P>    Walkup, whose law practice has included some lobbying since he left the attorney general&#39;s office, had presented himself in the public hearings as well qualified because of his experience in state government legal matters.
<P>    The Supreme Court has traditionally picked attorneys general in secret. In the current selection process, the open public presentations on Thursday were followed by private interviews with each of the 11 candidates on Friday. The justices then met in secret session to make their final decision.
<P>    The selection also comes with proposals pending in the state Legislature to allow the attorney general to be chosen by popular election. Tennessee is now the only state in the nation with an attorney general picked by its state Supreme Court.

<P><h3>Knoxville teen accused of molesting children</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   A 15-year-old boy accused of molesting children has been released to his parents on $3,000 bond.
<P>   Derek Baron of North Knoxville was released Thursday on bond on condition he remain under house arrest and stay under a protective plan that assures he will not be alone, Knox County Assistant District Attorney Steve Sword said Friday. A Feb. 27 hearing date has been set.
<P>   Baron was arrested Jan. 13 on two charges of rape of a child and one count of indecent exposure. The rape charges are felonies that involve victims under the age of 13, Sword said. Court records allege Baron raped children between June 1995 and December 1996. The indecent exposure allegedly occurred in November 1996.

<P><h3>Jefferson family loses home, belongings in fire</h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>   TALBOTT -- An early morning fire on Friday destroyed the newly purchased, uninsured home of a Jefferson County couple and their four children, officials said.
<P>   Tommy Rogers was at work at the time of the 4:50 a.m. fire. His wife, Mary Lou Rogers, and their daughters, Meredith, 12, and Mattie, 5, and sons McKinley, 8, and 6-month-old Micah, all escaped without injury.
<P>   Single-digit temperatures hampered the efforts of the Kansas Talbott Volunteer and White Pine fire departments. Water runoff created as firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze left a sheet of ice over a portion of nearby state Highway 66, requiring road crews to salt the roadway.
<P>   Jefferson County Sheriff&#39;s Department Deputy Tony Cody broke an ankle when he slipped on a patch of ice as he hurried to determine if anyone was trapped inside.
<P>   The fire destroyed the three-bedroom, two-story house, and its cause hadn&#39;t been determined Friday.
<P>   Family members said the Rogers would accept any donations of food, clothing, baby items, furniture, household supplies or other items.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Sevier Boys and Girls club official under probe</h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>   SEVIERVILLE -- The executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of the Smoky Mountains has been fired for inappropriate behavior and is being investigated by police.
<P>    Jim Arwood, president of the Boys and Girls Club board of directors, said the group met Thursday and decided to fire Dale Bynum, who has been director of the club since January 1990.
<P>    Arwood declined to comment on what Bynum did that was inappropriate.
<P>    Sevierville Police Chief Robbie Fox confirmed Thursday his department is investigating the allegations.

		<h3>Krystal settles wage suits</h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>   CHATTANOOGA -- The Krystal Co., the Chattanooga-based fast-food hamburger chain, announced Friday it has settled the wage claim lawsuits brought against it by current and former employees.
<P>   The settlement, subject to federal court approval, was approximately $13 million.
<P>   Krystal filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 1995 in order to resolve the wage claim litigation brought against it.
<P>   Krystal said it expects its reorganization plan to be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court by the end of the first quarter of 1997 and that shortly thereafter it would emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings.
<P>   Almost 7,000 current and former employees filed lawsuits against the company, claiming they were never paid for overtime they worked, a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
<P>
<P><h3>First American income up</h3>
<P>
<P>   First American Corp. reported fourth quarter 1996 net income of $33.5 million, or $1.13 per share, a 31 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 1995.
<P>    First American earned $121.6 million, or $4.11 per share in 1996, compared to $103.1 million, or $3.64 per share in 1995. The 1996 earnings include the 17 cents per share impact of a one-time assessment many depository institutions were required to pay to increase the Savings Association Insurance Fund. Similarly, the 1995 earnings include a 26 cents per share impact of one-time charges related to its fourth quarter acquisition of Heritage Federal Bancshares.
<P>    First American is a $10.4 billion financial services holding company headquartered in Nashville.
<P>
<P><h3>Mergers affect Union Planters&#39; results</h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>   Union Planters Corp. reported 1996 net earnings of $133.7 million, or $1.92 per fully diluted common share, compared to net earnings of $172.8 million, or $2.64 per share in 1995.  For the fourth quarter of 1996, net earnings were $11.4 million, or 15 cents a share compared to $35.3 million, or 53 cents for the same quarter a year earlier.
<P>    The Memphis-based banking company said results for 1996 were reduced by merger-related and other charges of approximately $66 million after taxes.
<P>   The results reflect the acquisitions of five financial institutions in the fourth quarter, including Memphis-based Leader Financial Corp. Union Planters bought eleven banks in all in 1997, becoming the largest banking company based in Tennessee with $15.2 billion in assets.
<P>
<P><h3>NCBC net income up 17.3%</h3>
<P>
<P>   National Commerce Bancorporation reported net income of $57.5 million for 1996, an increase of 17.3 percent over 1995. Earnings per share were $2.30 in 1996, compared with $1.94 in 1995, an 18.6 percent increase.  Fourth quarter net income was $15.7 million, a 19.4 percent increase over the  same period a year earlier.  Earnings per share for the quarter rose to 63 cents from 52 cents. Consolidated assets totaled $4.2 billion at the end of 1996, up 13.7 percent from the same time a year earlier.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Paul McAfee, Special to The News-Sentinel</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>hris Lindsay would love to add a little size to his roster, but he wasn&#39;t complaining about his mighty mites Friday night.
<P>    The West High basketball coach&#39;s undersized team, known as the Rebel Runts (no starter stands taller than 5-11), used superior quickness to overcome a huge size disadvantage in an 81-69 victory over South-Doyle at West.
<P>    Undaunted by the Cherokees&#39; 6-8 post Tehran Gary, the Rebels (9-6, 6-4) used a full-court pressure game to win the District 4-AAA matchup. South-Doyle (8-8, 6-3) rallied in the fourth quarter to make things interesting, but numerous turnovers against a brutal press ruined the comeback bid.
<P>    &#39;&#39;When you don&#39;t have a guy 6-foot out there, you&#39;ve got to find a way to compensate,&#39;&#39; said Lindsay. &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know any other way to do it. If you play half-court with them we&#39;re beat by 20.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s (full-court pressure) been good to us. The last couple of year&#39;s we weren&#39;t mentally committed to it. These guys realize the logic behind it.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The Rebels harrassed the Cherokees into 11 second-quarter turnovers to take a 38-27 halftime lead. They built the lead to 21 in the the third period and held off the Cherokees in the fourth.
<P>    &#39;&#39;That (turnovers) was the difference in the game,&#39;&#39; said South-Doyle coach Eddie Hodge. &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve got to handle pressure better. We didn&#39;t do it tonight.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Marlon Bussell, who converted many of the South-Doyle turnovers into easy layups, led West with 22 points. He also had five steals and eight assists. Post player Scott Oderson, whose defense against Gary helped earn the win, scored 17. Rickey Davis added 13.
<P>    Gary finished with 21 points. Chris Tate hit four 3-pointers and scored 12 points.
<P>    West was able to stretch its halftime lead with quickness on defense. A 12-6 run to open the quarter gave the Rebels a 50-34 lead at 3:48. A 3-point play by Davis and a tip-in by Bussell pushed the lead to 55-34 at 3:20.
<P>    South-Doyle began its comeback late in the third period. Treys by Blair Dillinger and Tate helped the Cherokees claw back to within 59-46 entering the fourth quarter.
<P>    Two free throws by Johnny Finch midway through the quarter got South-Doyle within seven, but West outscored the Cherokees 13-10 down the stretch.
<P>    &#39;&#39;You can come back against a quick team when they make mistakes,&#39;&#39; said Hodge. &#39;&#39;But you&#39;ve got to score on every possession and we missed some easy ones.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The Rebels fell behind 16-12 after one quarter. Gary scored the first six points for the Cherokees, who jumped to an 8-4 lead.
<P>    But West&#39;s swarming full-court pressure became a problem for South-Doyle in the second period. The Rebels scored the first seven points and took a 19-16 advantage.
<P>     Tate nailed a 3-pointer for South-Doyle, but Adams answered with a trey for West and the Rebels used a 9-3 run totake a 28-23 lead at 3:57.
<P>    Six turnovers in the final 3-1/2 minutes of the half cost South-Doyle dearly.

		<h3>Final Four format set for TSSAA basketball </h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>    The 1998 basketball champions from Tennessee high schools will be crowned after a Final Four playoff in Murfreesboro, the governing body for prep sports decided Friday.
<P>    The Tennessee State Secondary Athletic Association&#39;s Board of Control made changes in playoffs for basketball and football and picked six sports to have separate champions for Division 1 and Division 2.
<P>    Division 1 includes all public schools and 22 private schools which choose not to provide students with needs-based financial aid.
<P>    Division 2 is made up of 33 private schools which do offer student financial aid.
<P>    The &#39;&#39;most tremendous change&#39;&#39; will be in the basketball playoffs, said TSSAA executive director <B>Ronnie Carter</B>.
<P>    Following the district and regional basketball playoffs, the regional winners and runners-up will meet in sectional playoffs, with the winners advancing to a Final Four tournament for the title.
<P>    Both boys and girls will play the same weekend. Previously, eight teams in each classification came to the state tournament. Boys played one weekend after the girls&#39; title was decided.
<P>    In football, new brackets were adopted to pair regions during the first two rounds of the playoffs. Teams from Regions 1 and 2 will compete, as will Regions 3 and 4, 5 and 6, and 7 and 8.
<P>    In March, the TSSAA will decide whether to alternate games in the first two rounds between Thursday and Friday nights.
<P>
<P><h3>College basketball</h3>
<P>
<P>* Tusculum College star <B>Susan Starnes </B>hit a career-high 47 points, a school record, in an 84-76 victory against Piedmont in Demorest, Ga., on Thursday night. Starnes made 16-of-28 shots from the floor and 14-of-14 free throws, and also had 20 rebounds. She has made 24 of her last 25 free throws. Tusculum (10-6) plays host to Maryville College today.
<P>* Knoxville College (5-11) will play host to Virginia Intermont (10-7) in a makeup game tonight at 7 at the KC gym.
<P><h3>
<P>Boxing</h3>
<P>
<P>* Welterweight <B>Thomas &#39;&#39;June Bug&#39;&#39; Davis,</B> who hasn&#39;t fought since the 1996 U.S. Olympic Trials, will face <B>Brad Austin </B>of Johnson City in the main event on tonight&#39;s 15-bout amateur card at Golden Gloves Arena. Bell time is 7:30 and admission is $5 (children 16 and under are free).
<P>
<P><h3>Baseball</h3>

        <p><font size="2"><i>By Gina Stafford, News-Sentinel
        staff writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">C</font>aution is a daily watchword for
        workers at Knoxville's two abortion clinics, where
        officials said Thursday's clinic bombing in Atlanta
        didn't cause any local changes. </p>
        <p>''We certainly are on heightened awareness, but
        unfortunately we have learned we have to be and keep
        fully at that level because one never knows,'' said
        Corinne Rovetti, family nurse practitioner at Knoxville
        Center for Reproductive Health, 1547 Clinch Ave. </p>
        <p>''We're very disturbed by this, of course, because we
        condemn domestic terrorism designed to intimidate women
        from seeking legal services they have access to, but we
        have no plans to change our operating schedule.'' </p>
        <p>Both Rovetti and Lisa Thomas, director of Volunteer
        Medical Clinic, 313 Concord St., said their facilities
        have been infrequent targets of bomb threats that never
        resulted in discovery of any explosive devices. For
        years, workers at both facilities haven't accepted or
        opened suspicious-looking packages or those from
        unfamiliar sources. </p>
        <p>While it was a rare occurrence and hasn't happened in
        years, officials said, patients at the clinics have been
        verbally harassed by protesters. Picketers and protests
        continue to be a regular feature at both facilities. </p>
        <p>Thomas said weekends are the choice of Volunteer
        Medical Clinic's picketers. Protesters regularly gather
        outside the Center for Reproductive Health on days that
        clinic sets aside each week for conducting abortions,
        Rovetti said. </p>
        <p>''They're familiar faces by now, and we even dialogue
        at times,'' Rovetti said. ''It's fairly civil most of the
        time, because at this point, we've finally created a
        distant level of respect. </p>
        <p>''We advise patients to expect them and to walk on by.
        As long as they don't breach legal requirements, we can
        put up with them.'' </p>
        <p>A condemnation of antiabortion violence was issued in
        a statement Thursday by C. Fletcher Armstrong, president
        of the Knoxville chapter of Tennessee Right to Life. </p>
        <p>''Our organization exists to promote the most basic
        right in our society -- life itself,'' Armstrong stated.
        ''We oppose violence against our fellow man -- outside
        these clinics as well as the violence that takes place
        inside. </p>
        <p>''We ask people who want to save unborn children to
        join us in using peaceful, legal means to bring an end to
        abortion.'' </p>
        <p>A prayer service and march to the Rachael abortion
        memorial in Lynnhurst Cemetery takes place at 2 p.m. on
        Sunday, Jan. 19, Armstrong said. </p>
        <p>Wednesday, Jan. 22, marks the 24th anniversary of the
        U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion. </p>

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Tom Humphrey, News-Sentinel Nashville bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- In the 200th year that Tennessee&#39;s Legislature has existed, a woman was named Thursday to chair a state House committee for the first time.
<P>   Other legislative committee assignments, while less of a landmark than the title bestowed upon Rep. Brenda Turner, include changes that could impact everything from Knoxville&#39;s voice in state money matters to the status of striped bass in Norris Lake.
<P>   Turner, D-Chattanooga, was named by House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh to head the newly created Children and Family Affairs Committee.
<P>   &#39;&#39;To all the women who came before me and all the women who come behind me, it is truly an honor,&#39;&#39; said Turner, a House member since 1982.
<P>   Turner and Naifeh said no woman has ever chaired a standing state House committee since Tennessee became a state in 1796. The General Assembly is now in its 100th two-year session.
<P>   Turner holds more seniority than any other Democratic woman House member except Rep. Lois DeBerry of Memphis, who serves as House speaker pro tempore.
<P>   There were several other notable changes in the House committee lineup, though the status quo generally prevailed in the Senate. Most of the House changes were due to retirement of veteran legislators who held key posts in the past.
<P>   The House Finance Committee, widely viewed as the most powerful of panels since it oversees taxes and spending, will be chaired by Rep. Matt Kisber, D-Jackson, who succeeds the retired former Rep. John Bragg, D-Murfreesboro.
<P>   From the Knoxville perspective, however, it may be more significant that four representatives from the city got seats on the Finance Committee. They are Democratic Reps. Joe Armstrong, Harry Tindell and Wayne Ritchie along with Republican Rep. H.E. Bittle.
<P>   Armstrong, who last session chaired the Consumer and Employee Affairs Committee, was shifted by Naifeh to chairmanship of the Health and Human Resources Committee for this session. Rep. Ben West, D-Nashville, got the consumer committee chair.
<P>   Armstrong&#39;s new post makes him the point man on legislation involving TennCare and Gov. Don Sundquist&#39;s new Department of Public Health. Armstrong said he now opposes Sundquist&#39;s plan to abolish the Department of Mental Health and put its functions under the new department.
<P>   Another East Tennessean given new power by Naifeh is Rep. Jerry Cross, D-Caryville, named to head the Conservation and Environment Committee. He succeeds the retired former Rep. J.B. Napier, D-Columbia. Cross has gained fame as a leading legislative critic of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, once engineering an effort that threatened TWRA&#39;s existence.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I&#39;m going to be fair, but I&#39;m going to be sure that they (TWRA officials) do their job and do it right,&#39;&#39; Cross said.
<P>   The focal point of Cross&#39; criticism has been TWRA&#39;s stocking of striped bass, or striper, into Norris Lake. Many fishermen believe the striped bass eat too many smaller game fish. A compromise reached last year calls for a moratorium on striper stocking while a study is conducted.
<P>   Naifeh also has overhauled the House Calender Committee, which must approve all bills before they are scheduled for floor votes. Under the new plan, membership on the Calendar Committee is reduced from 44 to 25.
<P>   Republicans had just three of 44 members under the old setup. They will have four of 25 under the new arrangement, which Naifeh said is intended to &#39;&#39;streamline&#39;&#39; the panel.
<P>   Naifeh stuck by his past tradition of naming only Democrats to committee officer positions, prompting House Minority Leader Steve McDaniel to deliver a speech accusing Naifeh of &#39;&#39;disenfranchising those who dare elect a representative from other than the majority party.&#39;&#39; He said that amounts to about 2 million of 5 million Tennesseans.
<P>   In the Senate, Lt. Gov. John Wilder -- who had Republican help in winning a crucial re-election bid in 1985 -- gives committee officer positions to both Republicans and Democrats.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Michelle Williams, Associated Press</I></FONT><P>

		<FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>ANCHESTER, Tenn. -- A California teen pleaded innocent to attempting to bilk her grandparents of their life savings and funneling nearly $23,000 to boyfriends she met on the Internet.
<P>    But in a letter sent to her grandparents after her arrest, Jenivive Sterling said: &#39;&#39;I am so frightened and am so sorry that I ever did this. I hope god (sic) and Jesus can forgive me.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Sterling, 19, was arraigned Tuesday in Coffee County Criminal Court on 17 counts of fraud, forgery and theft charges. Her pretrial motion hearing was set for Feb. 11.
<P>    Sterling was arrested Dec. 30 after a Pennsylvania minister contacted authorities, saying his son had received about $4,000 in checks from Sterling and he feared her grandparents didn&#39;t know about the drafts.
<P>    Dawson and Stella Bearden of Tullahoma never suspected anything.
<P>    &#39;&#39;She was acting like a little sweet thing. We even let her have our bedroom,&#39;&#39; said Stella Bearden, 75. &#39;&#39;Now we know it was all lies.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The drama began in late November when the Beardens received a call from Sterling, their only granddaughter. They had not seen her since her father died of cancer eight years ago, Bearden said.
<P>    Sterling said her mother, Tara Sterling, ordered her out of their home in Culver City, Ca. Bearden, who was estranged from her daughter, said she later learned Jenivive Sterling had also stolen money and credit cards from her mother.
<P>    Although apprehensive about a reunion, the Beardens met their granddaughter at the Nashville airport on Dec. 1 and took her to Tullahoma, about 70 miles southwest.
<P>    Soon after, Charles McBride, an 18-year-old office supply store worker in Chambersburg, Pa., started receiving checks from Sterling, which she said were a combination of gifts from her grandparents and her own money.
<P>    McBride stayed in contact with Sterling while she was in St. Claire Shores, Mich., with another Internet boyfriend. McBride said he and the man were friends through GemStone, a medieval, role-playing fantasy game on the Internet.
<P>    McBride&#39;s father, Donald, a United Church of Christ minister and former journalist, became suspicious. He questioned not only the check amounts but why they were written out of sequence and in inconsistent handwriting on an account that wasn&#39;t hers.
<P>    He contacted authorities. The Beardens&#39; credit union then stopped payment on the checks.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">K</FONT>nox County Election Commission member Thomas &#39;&#39;Tank&#39;&#39; Strickland Jr. is expected to be hired by Mayor Victor Ashe, creating another opening on the commission.
<P>   Strickland said he likely will resign from the commission Jan. 25 and start his new job as director of Community Relations on Jan. 27.
<P>   He will replace Kelsey Finch, who recently stepped down from that position.
<P>   Strickland, 43, a Knoxville native and graduate of Austin-East High School and of the University of Tennessee, has been a boxing promoter, consultant and trainer in Knoxville.
<P>   His departure from the commission creates the third opening in a month.
<P>   Last month, Hazel Showalter died and last week, Courtney Pearre announced he was taking the position of legal counsel to Gov. Don Sundquist.
<P>   This is the first opening for Democrats, though. They control the five-member commission because their party is the majority in the state House.
<P>   Since Strickland is a Democrat, the Knox County Democratic legislative delegation will have the say in his replacement, just as the Republicans recently did in the replacements for Pearre and Showalter.
<P>   On Tuesday, the state Election Commission appointed as new GOP members for the Knox County Election Commission lawyers Mike McClamroch and Steve Roth.
<P>   This was after the seven-member GOP delegation in secret ballots nominated the two from a list of 16 candidates.
<P>   Strickland said he&#39;s not heard any names surface as a possible replacement but anticipates a number of people being interested.
<P>   The foul-up in last year&#39;s early voting on unification sparked more interest in the GOP positions, and Strickland said he anticipates the same interest from Democrats.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> $34 million, 220,000-square-foot museum for vintage automobiles and school of restoration is being proposed for Pigeon Forge.
<P>   Called the Heritage Automotive Museum and Center for Learning, the entire structure would be under glass. Developers say it would be a strong family attraction.
<P>   A partner in the development, Jeff Kluss, a graduate of Bearden High School and the University of Tennessee who now lives in Nashville, estimated annual revenues would reach $35 million, with an economic impact of $140 million.
<P>   A 39,000-square-foot center for learning will offer an apprenticeship program and hopes to train 160 students a year in restoration and customization. Museum displays will be devoted to racing, and domestic and foreign-made antique and collectible cars.
<P>   The display area will showcase about 170 cars at a time. Many of them will be set in vignettes, or period exhibits with other items and memorabilia from that particular era.
<P>   The 59,000-square-foot restoration area will have a public viewing area.
<P>   &#39;&#39;This will draw people from all over,&#39;&#39; said Kluss. &#39;&#39;What we&#39;re looking to bring into Pigeon Forge is diversity. This is not a retail outlet, not a theater, not a restaurant; it&#39;s something that will enhance everybody&#39;s business.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The development group has an option on a 48.8-acre tract on Sugar Hollow Road, which would be visible from the Parkway.
<P>   The complex would hire the equivalent of 120 to 130 full-time employees, Kluss said.
<P>   Kluss&#39; partners in the project are Ted Douthitt, who has a restoration shop in Duluth, Ga., and Rod Wortham, who owns AMC Marketing in St. Louis.
<P>   A preliminary plan was presented to the Pigeon Forge City Commission earlier this week. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think the city is definitely interested in working with them,&#39;&#39; said John Jagger, director of the Pigeon Forge Tourism Development Agency. 
<P>   The group asked the city to consider several financing options, including the authorization of industrial revenue bonds, or the setting up of an educational trust, through which corporations could pay for students&#39; tuition.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>hey say there&#39;s a sucker born every minute. 
<P>   Fortunately, David Galbraith wasn&#39;t born yesterday, and he wasn&#39;t taken in by a telephone sweepstakes scam being worked in the Knoxville area.
<P>   Last week, Galbraith received a call from a man who informed him that he was one of the lucky &#39;&#39;bonus sweepstakes&#39;&#39; winners from Publisher&#39;s Clearing House. 
<P>   His prize: $75,000.
<P>   The catch: he had to pay a 3 percent gift tax or $2,200 before his check would be delivered.
<P>   &#39;&#39;(The bogus representative) said my name was a sure winner and that the delivery men had to deliver the certified check that day,&#39;&#39; Galbraith said, recalling the conversation that lasted more than 30 minutes. &#39;&#39;He said the gift tax money had to be paid up front.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Galbraith said the man instructed him to go to the nearest Kroger store and send the money via Western Union to his area &#39;&#39;CPA representative&#39;&#39; who would handle tax payment.
<P>    When Galbraith told the man he didn&#39;t have the &#39;&#39;foggiest notion&#39;&#39; who his &#39;&#39;CPA representative&#39;&#39; was, the man paused and then informed him it was a woman located at International Boulevard in Atlanta.
<P>   For authenticity purposes, Galbraith said the man also gave him a code number that was to be shown to the deliverers of his check for $75,000.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I wasn&#39;t believing a word of it,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   Skeptical, Galbraith asked a series of probing questions.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Just what did I do to win this money?&#39;&#39;
<P>   The man&#39;s reply: &#39;&#39;It was a random computer drawing.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;Who did you say you&#39;re with?&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;Publisher&#39;s Clearing House,&#39;&#39; the caller said. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;Why can&#39;t you just take the tax money off the top and cut a new check?&#39;&#39;
<P>   Pause.
<P>   &#39;&#39;For someone who won all this money, you don&#39;t sound too enthusiastic.&#39;&#39; 
<P>   Galbraith said he decided to play along and told the man he would send the money. At that time, Galbraith said the man abruptly ended the conversation, telling him he had to go to a meeting.
<P>   Galbraith immediately alerted the Knox County Sheriff&#39;s Department, which referred him to the FBI. Galbraith said a local FBI agent took down a report of the incident but informed him the scam was out of his jurisdiction. The agent told Galbraith the information would be forwarded to Atlanta.
<P>   The bogus representative called Galbraith a short time later asking why he hadn&#39;t sent the money.
<P>   Galbraith told the man he couldn&#39;t accept the money under the current circumstances. With that, the man hung up, he said.
<P>   Richard Voiles, fraud and forgery investigator for the Knoxville Police Department, said he&#39;s received a half dozen calls about the sweepstakes scam last week.
<P>   &#39;&#39;That&#39;s just the one&#39;s that we&#39;re aware of,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;All we have to go by is what people report to us.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Voiles said none of the people he has talked to so far have sent money.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve been a firm believer in the rule that says there&#39;s no such thing as a free lunch,&#39;&#39; said Jeff Blevins, Knox County&#39;s assistant district attorney general in charge of the White Collar Crime Unit. &#39;&#39;If it sounds to good to be true, it probably is.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Richard Powelson, News-Sentinel Washington bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>ASHINGTON -- U.S. Sen. <B>Bill Frist,</B> R-Tenn., in his second overseas trip since taking office in 1995, is visiting officials in Israel this week on progress toward peace talks with the Palestinians.
<P>   A new member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Frist began meetings with Israeli officials Monday, including <B>Dore Gold,</B> senior policy adviser to the prime minister. He also plans to meet with former Prime Minister <B>Shimon Peres</B>. Frist plans to return to the United States this weekend, his staff said.
<P>   Frist&#39;s last overseas trip was to Southeast Asia in November to work on economic development issues.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   Rep. <B>John J. Duncan Jr.</B> of Knoxville has returned from his first foreign business trip after eight years in Congress, flying to four republics of the former Yugoslavia -- Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia and Montenegro -- to check on conditions before a vote on whether to send perhaps $2 billion more there in U.S. aid.
<P>   Duncan&#39;s trip with three other House members did not involve U.S. taxpayers&#39; funds. It was paid for by a private group, the National Security Caucus Foundation.
<P>   The seven-day trip ended Wednesday. Duncan&#39;s office did not announce the trip until after he left because it was not clear if his schedule would allow it, aide <B>Judy Whitbred </B>said.
<P>   Duncan generally opposes foreign aid, maintaining the United States cannot afford it. He has opposed sending U.S. troops to the former Yugoslavia because he does not believe there is a vital U.S. interest at stake or a threat to U.S. national security. He said in a statement that with U.S. troops in this part of the world for an indefinite period, he should learn as much as possible about the situation there.
<P>   The private group invited all 535 House and Senate members to make the trip at the foundation&#39;s expense, according to a foundation employee, <B>Jim Dickey</B>. Four agreed to make the current trip, he said, including Reps. <B>Bruce Vento,</B> D-Minn., <B>Rick Boucher,</B> D-Va., and <B>Mark Sanford,</B> R-S.C.
<P>   Dickey, asked why the foundation was paying for members to visit the former Yugoslavia, said: &#39;&#39;It&#39;s our opinion that the better informed members of Congress are about foreign policy issues, the better off the country is.&#39;&#39;
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   Duncan has hired a former advance man from the Bob Dole presidential campaign as his news media liaison.
<P>   <B>David Balloff,</B> who also was part owner of the former Balloff clothing stores in Knoxville, joined Duncan&#39;s Washington staff a couple days ago. Before joining the Dole campaign last summer, he worked for a year as a broker for Morgan Keegan in Knoxville, he said.
<P>   Balloff said he earlier did advance work also for Vice President <B>George Bush </B>and later for President Bush&#39;s re-election campaign.
<P>   Whitbred said Balloff was hired because of his experience in dealing with the news media during his advance work.
<P>   He replaces Dub Maines, who is leaving Duncan&#39;s staff for another job, Whitbred said.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   Sen. <B>Fred Thompson</B>, R-Tenn.,<B> </B>has chosen <B>J. Mark Tipps,</B> the chief of staff to Frist, to be one of three senior counsels looking into alleged improprieties by the Democratic National Committee in fund-raising last year.
<P>   Thompson, new chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, named another Tennessee attorney, <B>Harry &#39;&#39;Sandy&#39;&#39; Mattice</B> of Chattanooga, as another senior counsel.
<P>   Both Tipps and Mattice are graduates of the University of Tennessee College of Law.
<P>   Tipps earlier worked nine years at Bass Berry and Sims law firm in Nashville in the trial section, focusing on commercial and corporate litigation. Thompson is expected to start holding committee hearings into the Democrats&#39; fund-raising activities soon.

<P>   Three years after the state and the National Park Service reintroduced river otters into East Tennessee, the playful carnivores appear to be thriving.
<P>    That&#39;s according to Ed Warr of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, who spoke Thursday at the Wilderness Wildlife Week in Pigeon Forge.
<P>    Some 400 otters -- purchased from a professional river otter supplier in Louisiana -- were released into major river and stream systems in Middle and East Tennessee, said Warr.
<P>    The elusive otters are hard to count, but sightings of their droppings and tracks indicate they&#39;re still around in substantial numbers.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve had a few road kills, but other than that, they seem to be doing quite well,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>    A few fishing docks have complained the otters get into their minnow stores for a fast-food feast. The state also has some complaints from fishermen who think the quick otters compete for trout. Actually, Warr said the animals feed mainly on other slower fish, rodents and smaller mammals, such as weasels.
<P>    River otters are slow to multiply because pregnancy can be delayed as much as a year before the fertilized ovum is implanted in the uterine wall.  
<P>    Bear and other mammals also delay pregnancy after mating but none for as long as 12 months, said Warr.
<P>    River otters were declared a threatened species in Middle and East Tennessee during the 1950s.
<P>    Efforts to restore them to rivers and streams began during the 1980s but were mostly unsuccessful.
<P>   The state and park finally chose to purchase the otters at a cost of $400 each from the Louisiana dealer.
<P>    About 400 otters were released in Tennessee outside the park. The national park has released 137 more since 1989, said park spokesman Bob Miller.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Stan DeLozier, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>ADISONVILLE -- You might say the newest member of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals was born for the job.
<P>    James Curwood Witt Jr., 48, the fourth generation of the Monroe County family to wear a judicial robe, was given the oath of office Thursday by his father, retired Circuit Court Judge James C. Witt Sr. 
<P>    &#39;&#39;I&#39;m glad to get around to it (administering the oath),&#39;&#39; the elder Witt said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s been on my docket for 48 years.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Gov. Don Sundquist selected Witt over Paula Voss, an assistant public defender in Knoxville, and Thomas Wright, a federal public defender in Greeneville.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I chose him because I thought he was the right person,&#39;&#39; Sundquist said before Thursday&#39;s ceremony. &#39;&#39;The most serious thing I do as governor is to appoint members of the judiciary. Curwood Witt will be an exemplary jurist.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The new judge&#39;s great-grandfather, Bascom Witt, was the county judge in the 1920s. His grandfather, Beecher Witt, was district attorney general from 1926 to 1958, and his father was a Circuit Court judge from 1958 to 1982.
<P>    Witt said another notable lawyer from Monroe County, the late Ray Jenkins, influenced him to enter the profession.
<P>    &#39;&#39;As district attorney general, my grandfather was one of the best-known courtroom attractions around,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;He was very colorful and theatrical in some ways. When he and Ray Jenkins opposed each other, they say it was something to see.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Witt says he has no specific recollection of the two adversaries, since he was a small child at the time, yet it was some years later that he was influenced by Jenkins during a trial in Loudon.
<P>    &#39;&#39;He defended a woman who was charged with killing her husband&#39;s paramour,&#39;&#39; he recalled. &#39;&#39;She was charged with first-degree murder, but she was convicted of manslaughter.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I was only 13 or 14 at the time, but Ray Jenkins was spellbinding. That was the thing that helped galvanize me into going to law school.&#39;&#39;
<P>    In presiding over Thursday&#39;s ceremony, James Witt&#39;s pithy remarks nearly stole the show.
<P>    &#39;&#39;In this town, I doubt that 95 percent of the people have ever seen an appellant judge,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;In fact I&#39;ve always been a little scared of the appellant court. I&#39;ll have to admit that I plowed my own furrow sometimes with my own mule. Nowadays, they&#39;ll make you plow it over and use their mule.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Curwood Witt is one of three criminal appellant judges whose seats were authorized last year by the Legislature.
<P>    In 1998, Witt will be up for re-election in a yes-no vote. If rejected, a new judge would be appointed by the governor.
<P>    Witt said the concern is &#39;&#39;accountability. I don&#39;t have a problem with accountability. However, I do not feel a partisan election would go very far in enhancing the integrity and quality of the judiciary.&#39;&#39;
<P>    As for the death penalty, Witt simply said, &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t see any choice about it. We have a death penalty. It&#39;s the law in Tennessee.&#39;&#39;

        50-year-old Chilhowee Pharmacy, but will continue to
        deliver prescriptions -- in addition to groceries, videos
        and flowers -- from its new East Knoxville store. </p>
        <p>Currently Kroger delivers prescription drugs from its
        Marketplace and Farragut stores. If things bode well at
        the East Knoxville store, the delivery concept may be
        expanded to other Knoxville stores as well, said Hunter
        MacWilliams, area manager for Krogers. </p>
        <p>Kroger has such programs in place in the Cincinnati
        area and in the Western United States, MacWilliams said.
        ''This is a test, and I am confident that in 1997 we can
        expand it into some other areas where we operate,'' he
        added. </p>
        <p>The Chilhowee Pharmacy, owned for the last 15 years by
        Hogan and Sally Harrison, will close its Asheville
        Highway store at 7 p.m. today and reopen at the new
        Kroger store at 7 a.m. Sunday. The new Kroger is located
        across the street from its existing 21-year-old store,
        which will close at 8 p.m. Saturday. The Harrisons and
        three of their employees will join the Kroger pharmacy
        staff, said Sally Harrison. Three of their employees
        recently retired. </p>
        <p>The delivery service begins Monday, and will be
        available Monday through Friday. Deliveries will be
        offered within a 3-mile radius of the store. No minimums
        exist for pharmacy deliveries, but other items must total
        at least $35. Orders delivered by 1 p.m. will be
        delivered the same day, and orders will only be delivered
        until dark. </p>
        <p>The 60,000-square-foot store is twice the size of the
        existing store, and the staff will be doubled to about
        210 full- and part-time employees, said Ken Slagle, store
        manager. </p>
        <p>In addition to the pharmacy and delivery service,
        other new amenities include an NBC Bank; video shop;
        16-foot self-service salad bar; a full-scale baby center,
        including clothes; and a full-scale pet center. </p>
        <p>Grand opening activities on Sunday include a visit
        from residents of the Knoxville Zoo from 2:30 p.m. to 4
        p.m. and an autograph session with University of
        Tennessee cheerleaders from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. </p>

        in a 72-member delegation's recent business mission to
        Israel, according to delegation member Annette E.
        Winston. </p>
        <p>Winston is vice president for commercial lending and
        private banking with Knoxville's First Vantage
        Bank-Tennessee. </p>
        <p>The state, she said, spent less than $10,000 in
        financing the six-day trip last week by Gov. Don
        Sundquist, state Commissioner Bill Dunavant and others.
        Hosting the visit were the Israel-America Chamber of
        Commerce and the Israel Export Institute. </p>
        <p>''This was the largest, most diverse group ever there
        on a trade mission from the U.S.,'' Winston said. ''Nine
        Tennessee companies attended meetings with 26 Israeli
        companies.'' The Israeli government, she said, paid half
        Sundquist's expenses and many other costs of the visit.
        Individuals on the trip paid about $4,000 each to
        participate. </p>
        <p>Winston who, like half the participants, is Jewish,
        said her own involvement resulted from her 1996
        appointment to the Tennessee-Israel Cooperation Committee
        and a recommendation by the Knoxville Jewish Federation. </p>
        <p>Others from the area in the delegation were Dr. Gilya
        Schmidt, a UT religious studies professor; Dr. Miriam L.
        Weinstein, a physician and associate pediatrics professor
        at the UT Medical Center; Maribel Koella of Maryville, a
        partner in Collins, Sharp &amp; Koella Inc.; Dr. Linda
        Maxson, UT associate vice chancellor for academic
        affairs, and Dr. Marcia Katz, a UT physics professor. </p>
        <p>Also, Sidney A. Blalock of Charles Blalock &amp; Sons
        Inc., Sevierville; Carol Kiener of Johnson City Schools:
        Shannon W. Greene, vice president of ABG Caulking &amp;
        Waterproofing, Morristown; Dr. Harry J. Reynolds,
        Chattanooga Public Schools superintendent, and Claire E.
        Binder, co-chairman of the Arts Culture and Education
        Committee in Chattanooga. </p>
        <p>The delegation was divided into groups concerned with
        arts and culture, education, Israel: Past and Present,
        and business-economic development, which included
        Winston. She said most of the session consisted of tours
        of manufacturing firms and business meetings. </p>
        <p>Winston's ''business'' group met with such Israeli
        industrial leaders as Stef Wertheimer, board chairman of
        the ISCAR Group of Cos., world leaders in metal cutting
        technology. The firm is based in the Tefen Industrial
        Area of Galilee where a lucrative business incubator for
        entrepreneurial businesses is making major inroads in
        Israeli economic development. Tefen has spawned 52 new
        companies in the last decade. </p>
        <p>The Tennesseans also visited Electric Fuel Ltd. in
        Jerusalem, a 6-year-old corporation marketing a zinc-air
        battery technology that powers vehicles with rechargeable
        electric motors. </p>
        <p>Also visited were Perio Products, a dental and
        pharmaceutical producer that markets a polymer chip
        worldwide to help deter periodontal disease, and Elscint
        Corp., which produces equipment for magnetic resonance
        imaging already used by Vanderbilt University's Medical
        Center. </p>
        <p>Tennessee exports to Israel totaled $15.2 million for
        the first six months of 1996, up 9 percent from the
        comparable 1995 period. Nearly half the 1995 exports to
        Israel were paper products. </p>

		<h3>Columbia/HCA to purchase Value Health for $1.3 billion</h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>    Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. said it will buy managed care company Value Health Inc. for $1.3 billion, canceling Value Health&#39;s plans to spin off its lucrative pharmacy benefit management business to shareholders.
<P>    The business, ValueRx, manages prescription benefit plans for big companies and also distributes prescriptions by mail. It accounted for about $1.5 billion of Value Health&#39;s $1.9 billion in revenue last year.
<P>    Columbia/HCA plans to pay about 35 million of its shares to buy all the shares of Value Health, valuing those shares at about $23.35, a 15 percent premium.
<P>    The Nashville-based hospital chain has been gobbling up hospitals during its rapid expansion over the past three years. Last year alone, Columbia/HCA has acquired or formed joint ventures to operate 28 hospitals with annual revenue of about $1.3 billion. It now operates 344 hospitals and 368 other facilities in 37 states.
<P>
<P><h3>Sevier plant to stay open</h3>
<P>
<P>   Dan River Inc. said Thursday that it has contractually agreed to keep New Cherokee Corp.&#39;s manufacturing facilities, including the Sevierville plant, open for at least one year.
<P>  The Danville, Va.-based company announced Monday it intended to buy New Cherokee, which employs about 600 in Sevierville and another 600 in Rutherford County, N.C., where it&#39;s headquartered.
<P>   At the time of the announcement, Dan River officials declined to say whether the plants would remain open, saying an evaluation would take place &#39;&#39;to identify ways to maximize production efficiencies and improve our ability to serve our customers.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The sale of employee-owned New Cherokee is contingent on shareholders&#39; approval. A special meeting has tentatively been scheduled for Feb. 3.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Bill Luther, News-Sentinel sportswriter</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>OORESVILLE, N.C. -- When Butch Mock and Rick Mast agreed on a contract to go Winston Cup racing they had one thing in common -- long winless streaks.
<P>    Mock has fielded teams since 1978. The late Neil Bonnett gave Mock his last victory in 1988. Mast made his Cup debut the same year and hopes to end a 216-race drought.
<P>    Mock is excited to have Mast at the wheel.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This is not a new team and Rick is not a rookie and we didn&#39;t lose any team members during the offseason,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We can go out and win some races. This team&#39;s spirit is like the (Charlotte) Panthers. If we keep it together we&#39;ll be in the top 10 in points. If we finish there we&#39;ll be up on that stage (at the New York banquet in December).&#39;&#39;
<P>    Mast knows Cup success doesn&#39;t come easily. Earning a berth in the race-day lineup is the initial move to success.
<P>    &#39;&#39;That&#39;s the bottom line. You have 40 or more drivers out there every week wanting to get into the race,&#39;&#39; Mast said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s neat (if you make it). You get a fuzzy feeling for about 30 seconds, then it&#39;s back to where you started.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Mast hasn&#39;t come up short on race day in the last six years.
<P>    &#39;&#39;You have to keep things even keel. There have been races I could have won or should have won,&#39;&#39; he said in regard to the string of 181 starts with owner Richard Jackson.
<P>    When asked if he was interested in driving Mock&#39;s Ford, Mast knew the cars ran well, but he knew little about the owner.
<P>    &#39;&#39;When we passed from time to time I&#39;d say, &#39;Hi,&#39; &#39;&#39; Mast said. &#39;&#39;When we did get together we didn&#39;t talk finances . . . about paying me more than other guys (owners). That&#39;s one example of how important it was to be with this team. There are a lot of things to look at as a driver, but I felt I had a better chance with the Remington (Mock) team.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Mock&#39;s corporate sponsorship doesn&#39;t match many of the Cup teams.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We&#39;re trying to share things,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s important to find a way to share the wind tunnel tests because they costs so much. It makes for good business in this sport if you&#39;re going to keep up. It&#39;s a concept which would cut costs in half. If you&#39;re not careful you can wind up bankrupt.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Mast&#39;s theory on Cup racing is to get there first, then learn to win.
<P>    &#39;&#39;If you haven&#39;t won, you didn&#39;t get the job done on the track,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;There have been times when I&#39;d think back and ask why we didn&#39;t win last week. Winning can become a habit,&#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;and the same basics have been around for 20 years. Every little thing means so much . . . everything is so close.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Mock agreed.
<P>    &#39;&#39;There&#39;s not a bad team out there.&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;You have to run well to finish 34th, just to be here. It&#39;s gotten to the time that if you finish 30th in points it is a big deal.
<P> 
<P>   &#39;&#39;When I looked for Rick I knew I was getting a good qualifier. Those little things make the difference.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT size="2"><I></I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<B>CHEROKEE:</B> This note applies everywhere: If you&#39;re fishing this weekend you need another hobby and/or a good psychiatrist. Cherokee is muddy and water levels are fluctuating day-to-day. With that in mind, pick a fish and chances are it&#39;s hitting &#39;&#39;fair.&#39;&#39; Bass are fair near the bank and in creek beds 3-12  feet deep. Crankbaits and Carolina rigs are producing a few fish. Some are  being caught in deeper water over humps, but they are not as consistent. Smallmouth are fair around bluffs and gravel banks. Crappie are fair in creek beds 10-20 feet deep. Plain minnows are the best bait, but fish are scattered. Trollers are catching a few crappie on tube jigs and jigs tipped with minnows off points. Striper fishing is fair in the main river channel from the dam to the steam plant. Live shad are working best fished shallow early, deep late.
<P><B>
<P>DOUGLAS:</B> Crappie continue to be good, but the weather and good sense has chased most fishermen indoors. Good catches are being reported from Nina Creek to Muddy Creek, with trollers doing about as well as still fishermen. Best action is coming in 15-20 feet on jigs, jigs tipped with minnows and, for still fishermen, just plain minnows. Depth/fish finders can make up for a lot of guesswork for deep fish. Bass are improving, but that was before the most recent front moved in. Muddy Creek has been providing some good fishing, but action is about the same over most of the lake. Sauger fishing is good in the Leadvale area and above Swann&#39;s Bridge. Minnows, jigs and crankbaits are  catching sauger. Most fish are small, but keepers are not rare.
<P><B>
<P>FORT LOUDOUN/TELLICO:</B> Bass on Fort Loudoun are still the best game in town.  Murky water is making things good for jig fishermen just about anywhere on the lake. Like last week, most fish are coming off the main channel structure on Fort Loudoun. High, muddy water is making the going tough in creeks. Sauger fishing has been excellent below the dam, but may have tailed off some in the past week. Keeper-sized sauger have been caught from the dam to just below the A-frame hole on plain minnows and large hair jigs tipped with minnows. Striper fishing below the dam is inconsistent. Crappie are fair to good on either lake, but that was before more rain and snow. Bat Creek on Tellico was especially good in 6-12 feet. Some crappie have been caught by trollers off points. Sauger and walleye have been good below Chilhowee Dam on large jigs, minnows and crankbaits.
<P>
<P><B>MELTON HILL:</B> Duck hunters have been common on the lake; fishermen have been scarce. Best action is in the warm water discharge at Bullrun Steam Plant. Most fishermen are going after stripers with live shad, but some white bass, crappie and even a few bass are showing up on crankbaits, jigs and smaller live baits. Best fishing has been early morning, but action has been consistent through the day. Most creeks are muddy, high and running fast. Some bass are being caught on the lower end of the lake, but not too many fishermen are going after them. Sauger and stripers are fair to good in  tailwaters, best when at least one generator is running. Live shad or large jigs are working best on the stripers, minnows and small yellow or blue jigs on sauger.
<P><B>
<P>NORRIS:</B> The lake is clear to lightly stained, with creeks muddy. Surface temperatures are 44-48 degrees. Smallmouth continue to be very good with just plain minnows and a split shot. The best fishing is 20-25 feet deep off steep, boulder banks on the main channel. Stump beds are also good. This past week 3- and 4-pound fish continue to be common. Stripers are also good from Point 12 to Point 10 on the Powell side, near Lost Creek, the Loyston Sea near Woodduck Island and from Big Ridge to Andersonville Boat Dock. Alewifes and large shad are best baits drifted at forage school depth. Best fishing is 35-50 feet deep. Walleye are slow, but few fishermen are going after them. Some bass fishermen are lucky and catching 2- or 3-pounders, but that&#39;s about it. However, those fishing for walleye say they are holding off clay/gravel points at night, especially near Loyston and Cove Creek.
<P><B>
<P>WATTS BAR:</B> Surface temperatures are averaging 45 degrees and water is stained to muddy. Bass are fair to good on points and secondary points on jigs and crankbaits. A few fish are being caught in shallow water, but most action is coming at about 15 feet. For the most part fishing has been steady through  the day. Crappie are good in 20 feet over brush or blow downs. Plain minnows are best. A few are being caught by trollers in creek channels using small jigs or twisters. Trollers are getting their fish off bottom. Sauger fishing is good below Watts Bar Dam and in the lake, but fish are small. Below the dam minnows and jigs are working well; in the lake minnows, jigs or crankbaits are producing fish. Stripers are off and on at the Kingston Steam Plant. Shad tightlined or drifted under balloons are working best. Action is  good in the discharge at night.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Richard Powelson, News-Sentinel Washington bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>ASHINGTON -- Oak Ridge has four of the country&#39;s 10 &#39;&#39;most vulnerable&#39;&#39; facilities storing highly radioactive uranium, needing major building repairs and thousands of new containers for the bomb-grade material, according to a federal report released Wednesday.
<P>   The Department of Energy reported Wednesday that four of the Oak Ridge buildings are on its Top 10 list for environmental and safety work but had no estimate of the additional cost. DOE already is spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year on cleaning up environmental problems from World War II and post-war defense projects.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s too soon to tell&#39;&#39; the cost, said Tara O&#39;Toole, a DOE assistant secretary.
<P>   The worst of the Oak Ridge buildings, the report states, is Building 9212, which could pose dangers to plant workers, the public and the environment. The risks to the public were limited to an unusual event, such as a tornado, fire or earthquake, which could rip open the building and scatter some radioactive material into communities beyond the federal reservation, analysts reported.
<P>   Ralph Hutchison, coordinator of the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance, a frequent critic of Oak Ridge&#39;s defense work, said in a statement that the report echoed many of his group&#39;s concerns in recent years.
<P>   &#39;&#39;DOE&#39;s top priority,&#39;&#39; Hutchison said, &#39;&#39;should be the construction of a new, safe, secure facility for the dismantlement, processing and storage of highly enriched uranium.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Patricia Greeson, of Lockheed Martin, the contractor operating DOE&#39;s Y-12 weapons production plant, said DOE owns the buildings on the reservation and would have to pay for any needed repairs and upgrades.
<P>   She emphasized that the report did not raise any problems the contractor was not aware of, adding, &#39;&#39;Safety is a primary concern for our workers at Y-12.&#39;&#39; She said the contractor agreed with the DOE report&#39;s conclusion that there was a &#39;&#39;low or very low possibility&#39;&#39; of Oak Ridge buildings posing any threat to the public.
<P>   DOE workers at Oak Ridge always dress properly in protective suits to handle radioactive materials, she said, so workers also face low risks of health hazards.
<P>   DOE focused on the vulnerable buildings and storage containers in inspections earlier this year. Oak Ridge already has ended some of the threats, such as keeping large amounts of combustible materials near storage containers of highly radioactive uranium, DOE officials said.
<P>   Building 9212 at Oak Ridge was mentioned repeatedly in the report.
<P>   The building has &#39;&#39;many internal and external contaminated areas . . . with no permanent barriers between the worker and the contamination,&#39;&#39; the study said.
<P>   Also, &#39;&#39;known structural weaknesses&#39;&#39; in Building 9212 &#39;&#39;make them susceptible to earthquake and wind damage.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Open containers in the building &#39;&#39;pose the threat of significant spills during earthquakes,&#39;&#39; the report said.
<P>   To show the large quantity of materials at the Y-12 Plant, the report said there are 26,000 containers there containing highly radioactive uranium in a solid or liquid state.
<P>   An unspecified number of the containers &#39;&#39;are degrading, tape seals are falling off, and labels are becoming unreadable.&#39;&#39; Corroding cans could release uranium dust into the air in the building, endangering workers, the report said.
<P>   Energy Secretary Hazel O&#39;Leary said she ordered the study of all DOE facilities with radioactive materials to make sure the department&#39;s field offices were giving problems enough attention. The cost of the problems next will have to be determined and put into funding requests given to Congress.
<P>   The other three Oak Ridge buildings on the Top 10 list are: Building K-1420, part of the K-25 plant, a former processing facility for uranium; Building 9206, part of Y-12; and Building 3019, part of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory research complex.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Tom Humphrey, News-Sentinel Nashville bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- Gov. Don Sundquist&#39;s approval of new pay raises for some of his key staff members generated criticism from state employee leaders and Democratic legislators on Wednesday.
<P>    The Sundquist staff pay raises, effective Jan. 1, come with the state facing a budget shortfall that has raised the possibility of no pay raise for other state workers -- and perhaps layoffs of some.
<P>    Sundquist said the higher pay is coupled with an overall reduction in the governor&#39;s office budget of 15 percent. Beth Fortune, the governor&#39;s press secretary, said four vacant staff jobs have been abolished.
<P>    Combined, the raises total about $70,000 in annual increases and are spread over 18 positions.
<P>    The top pay raise in dollars went to David Locke, the administration&#39;s chief lobbyist. His salary was upped by $10,260 per year -- from $64,380 to $75,000 for a 16 percent increase.
<P>    The highest percentage pay raise went to Brooke Pinkerton, who carries the title of assistant for correspondence. Pinkerton&#39;s pay was raised from $22,356 to $28,848 -- a 29 percent increase.
<P>    The smallest percentage increase went to Wendell Moore, installed last fall as the governor&#39;s chief administrative officer. His salary was boosted from $80,000 to $83,000, or 3.7 percent.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s unconscionable,&#39;&#39; said Linda McCarty, executive director of the Tennessee State Employees Association.
<P>    McCarty noted that Sundquist adjusted pay upward for several key positions shortly after taking office in 1995 and raised salaries of some key staffers again in January 1996.
<P>    TSEA has called for an 8 percent pay raise in the 1996-97 fiscal year. McCarty noted that Sundquist called that proposal &#39;&#39;outrageous&#39;&#39; in a time of revenue shortfalls -- projected at $100 million this year and $300 million in 1996-97. 
<P>    Sundquist, however, has said the raises reflect a management philosophy of getting by with fewer people who work harder and deserve better salaries.
<P>    House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh, D-Covington, said the governor has the right to determine his staff salaries but said &#39;&#39;the timing of it is not appropriate at all.&#39;&#39;
<P>    About 90 persons are being laid off in the state Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. Sundquist has not said how many may be laid off as a result of budget cuts, which are to be formally proposed in a Feb. 10 budget presentation.
<P>    Both Naifeh and Lt. Gov. John Wilder, speaker of the Senate, said they have not increased salaries for any legislative staff this year, though a new pay scale system implemented last year resulted in some pay increases.
<P>   Fortune said that, in most cases, the pay raises reflect increased responsibilities -- as with Hardy Mays, who has become deputy governor and chief of staff instead of legal counsel. Mays made $77,160 as legal counsel and now gets $85,000. That is still $3,600 less than the salary of his predecessor as deputy governor, Peaches Simpkins.
<P>    The legal counsel post, now held by Courtney Pearre of Knoxville, was boosted to $80,000. Assistant Legal Counsel Natasha Metcalf, also a former Knoxville lawyer, got an increase from $43,260 to $45,000.
<P>    At least six of those with pay raises, including Locke, have the same duties as last year. In Locke&#39;s case, the increase puts him on a level with other cabinet-level officials, Fortune said.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he two top state House Democrats have fallen -- literally.
<P>    House Speaker <B>Jimmy Naifeh</B> slipped on ice outside a hotel Tuesday night, striking his head and leaving him unconscious. He was taken to St. Thomas Hospital for an examination, which revealed what aides described as &#39;&#39;a mild concussion.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Naifeh, wearing a large white bandage on his forehead, returned to preside over Wednesday&#39;s House session. As a show of sympathy, several other legislators -- including Reps. <B>Bob McKee</B>, R-Athens; Doug Gunnels, R-Lenoir City; and <B>Ronnie Cole</B>, D-Dyersburg -- donned similar bandages and posed for pictures with the speaker.
<P>    A day earlier, House Majority Leader <B>Jere Hargrove</B>, D-Cookeville, slipped on icy steps and badly skinned his arm.
<P>    While ice encounters seem to have been a Democratic problem to date, a group of starlings that somehow got into the House chamber on Monday acted on a bipartisan basis. Before they were chased out of chamber windows, the birds distributed their &#39;&#39;mess&#39;&#39; fairly evenly on Republican and Democratic desks.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>    State Rep. <B>Jerry Cross</B>, D-Caryville, says he was surprised as anyone to see a crowd walking through state Capitol corridors wearing baseball caps emblazoned with &#39;&#39;Jerry Cross for Governor, 1998&#39;&#39; across the front.
<P>    Cross says a busload of friends and supporters from Anderson and Campbell counties decided upon the gimmick when they traveled to Nashville to attend formal swearing-in ceremonies for legislators.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I told them, &#39;Just keep the word out there, boys. It&#39;s a start,&#39; &#39;&#39; Cross said Wednesday.
<P>    Cross, who has faced tough re-election campaigns in recent years, said he is not ready to formally announce his candidacy for governor. But he said supporters already have a slogan just in case: &#39;&#39;He&#39;s going to keep the jam on the lower shelf so the little man can reach it.&#39;&#39;
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>    Knoxville Rep. <B>Bill Dunn</B> angered Speaker Pro Tempore <B>Lois DeBerry </B>when he refused to vote for her re-election to the powerful House position.
<P>    &#39;&#39;He asked me &#39;Have you been reborn again?&#39; &#39;&#39; said DeBerry, obviously angered. &#39;&#39;What gives him the right to ask me if I&#39;ve been reborn again?&#39;&#39;
<P>    DeBerry, a Memphis Democrat, was elected by 98 votes out of the 99 House members with only Dunn abstaining.
<P>    Dunn, a Knoxville Republican, sees the encounter differently.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I didn&#39;t ask her that,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;I asked her if she&#39;d had a pro-life conversion. I said it in a way to break the ice. She said she&#39;d been too busy this summer to think about it.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Dunn said he didn&#39;t vote for DeBerry at the start of his first term two years ago either.
<P>    &#39;&#39;She&#39;s a liberal, and I&#39;m a conservative,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;She&#39;s been instrumental in defeating almost all pro-life legislation so in good conscience, I couldn&#39;t vote for her.&#39;&#39;
<P>    DeBerry has sat on a important House subcommittee that has sidetracked bills to limit abortion rights in Tennessee.
<P>   Dunn may need to watch out for more than his abortion bills being killed.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- It&#39;s almost like two extra shopping days for legislators and lobbyists.
<P>   Under a loophole in state ethics laws, members of the 100th General Assembly get two additional days to receive contributions from lobbyists.
<P>   The unexpected bonus came when Peggy Catalano, director of the Registry of Election Finance, ruled the ban on in-session fund-raising does not apply until today -- when the Legislature begins formally meeting.
<P>   Lawmakers met Tuesday and Wednesday in organizational sessions to elect the speakers of the Senate and House and constitutional officers.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Until the time the regular session starts, legislators may continue to accept contributions,&#39;&#39; Catalano said. &#39;&#39;It may provide a couple more days for lobbyists or PACs (political action committees) to provide fund-raising activities.&#39;&#39;
<P>   In 1995, the Legislature banned special interest contributions, both individually and by PACs, while all 132 members are in session to stop efforts to influence legislation.
<P>   &#39;&#39;This loophole -- allowing the old money-raising, lobbying, wining and dining so close to the beginning of the term -- strikes me as being very much out of the spirit of the law,&#39;&#39; said Phil Schoggen, state chairman of Common Cause, an ethics watchdog group.
<P>   State Sen. Bud Gilbert, R-Knoxville, who helped impose the ban, said: &#39;&#39;Certainly, the intent was to cease all fund-raising once we get to Nashville in a legislative mode. The spirit of the law was to stop the fund-raising.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Also Wednesday, the Senate and House in joint session unanimously re-elected the constitutional officers: Comptroller William Snodgrass, Treasurer Steve Adams and Secretary of State Riley Darnell.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By J.B. Owen, News-Sentinel columnist</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><P>
<P>
<P>   Birds are beautiful, and artists have long strived to preserve their splendor on printed pages.
<P>   At first, printing could only be done in black and white, and color had to be added tediously by hand, one brush stroke and one page at a time. Yet the results often were masterpieces.
<P>   Starting Saturday and continuing through March 23, 250 years of such hand-colored prints of birds will be commemorated by the Frank H. McClung Museum at the University of Tennessee when 100 of these rare and historic pictures will be on display.
<P>   The exhibition is possible because of two extensive collections that have been given to the museum.
<P>   In 1967 the late Mr. and Mrs. John L. Greer of Knoxville gave the museum 2300 prints of the work of England&#39;s John Gould that were published between 1830 and 1881.
<P>   These featured birds of Europe, Asia, Australia, Great Britain, and hummingbirds from South America. This collection is now valued at over $3 million.
<P>   Last year Mr. and Mrs. Joel E. Rynning of Atlanta enhanced the museum&#39;s collection by contributing 287 lithographs and engravings, ranging from works of Eleazar Albin and Mark Catesby of the 1730s to Rex Brasher who hand-colored a book as recently as 1932.
<P>   Included were 200 prints by John James Audubon, from his first royal octavo edition of Birds of America published in Philadelphia from 1840 to 1844.
<P>   Mark Catesby was the first painter of American birds, publishing &#39;&#39;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands&#39;&#39; in 1731. It was more than a hundred years before he was overshadowed by Audubon.
<P>   Eleazer Albin&#39;s work in 1731-1738 featured British birds. 
<P>   Rex Brasher did his painting after color printing had been invented, but the cost for his 875 oversize pages was more than he could manage in those great depression years, so he hand-painted 100 copies in 1929-1932. Thirty years later his work was reprinted on modern color presses.
<P>   The Gould prints are larger, and many are of especially colorful species, so his work may stand out from the others. He didn&#39;t find all of the birds himself but received collections of mounted specimen and dried skins from naturalist explorers.
<P>   He was able to study the birds collected by Charles Darwin on his five year, round-the-world voyage on the Beagle and illustrated one of the books Darwin published.
<P>   Gould&#39;s association with Darwin contributed to one of the most significant events in scientific history -- the theory of evolution. The theory did not suddenly burst upon Darwin while collecting the Galapagos Island birds that later became known as &#39;&#39;Darwin finches.&#39;&#39; It developed gradually after Gould pointed out the birds&#39; similarity in his paintings.
<P>   The Frank H. McClung Museum is located in the Circle Park portion of the University of Tennessee. The museum has no admission charge and is open from 9 to 5, Monday through Friday; 10 to 3 on Saturdays; and 1 to 5 on Sundays.
<P>   Parking is free by permit which can be obtained at the information booth on Circle Park Drive.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Carson Brewer, News-Sentinel columnist</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><P>
<P>   One of the saddest pictures I&#39;ve seen lately is of the G. W. Winstead family in Hawkins County in 1870. It shows G. W., gaunt and bearded, standing between a horse and a work steer, with his eight children, in front of the small house that had been their home.
<P>   The caption says: &#39;&#39;He lost his wife to TB, his farm to the bank . . .and he&#39;s leaving for Texas to start a new life.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The picture is one of many interesting ones in &#39;&#39;Hawkins Couny Tennessee,&#39;&#39; a county history by Henry R. Price, a Rogersville lawyer.
<P>   Talk about hard times, that picture tells the story. G. W. Winstead could have been the fellow who wrote the recipe for meat skin soup. But he wasn&#39;t. The folks who know how to make meat skin soup are a couple of Cherokees, William Crowe and Goingback Chiltoskey. The Cherokees also have known hard times.
<P>   The meat skin soup recipe is one of many in a new cookbook called &#39;&#39;Food & Recipes of the Smokies.&#39;&#39; Rose Houk did a great job of collecting the recipes from Great Smokies oldtimers and making a book  out of them. Great Smoky Mountains Natural History Association is the publisher. 
<P>   The covers of both books are outstanding. The cover of the Hawkins Couny book is a picture of the old Courthouse, one of the oldest and most beautiful in the state.  The cookbook cover, front and back, is a color photograph of home-canned vegetables and fruits.
<P>    Though Hawkins County is one of the oldest counties in Tennessee, Henry Price is the first person to collect its history and put it in a book. I did some of my growing up in Hawkins County, but I didn&#39;t know until I read Henry&#39;s book what a hectic early governmental history it had. Listen to this:
<P>   &#39;&#39;. . .First, it was part of North Carolina&#39;s western lands; then it became part of Washington District; then part of Washington County; then part of Sullivan County; then Spencer County in the State of Franklin; then Hawkins County, North Carolina; then Hawkins County in the Territory South of the River Ohio; and finally, in 1796, when Tennessee gained statehood, Hawkins County, Tennessee.&#39;&#39; Early Hawkins Countians surely could be forgiven if they forgot what return address to put on a letter.
<P>   The Hawkins County book is more than 200 very large pages long. Besides containing Henry&#39;s historical account, it has more than 275 pictures. It costs $34.95, plus $5 for shipping and handling. Order it from (and make checks to) The Rogersville Heritage Association, 415 South Depot Street, Rogersville, Tennessee 37857. Proceeds from the book go to the Heritage Association, to finance its preservation-restoration work in the city.
<P>   Among the stories in the book that I liked is the one about John T. Walker who came to Rogersville with only a file in his pocket and soon owned a sawmill. His mill whistle blew promptly at 6 every morning and at 4 in the afternoon. People in town depended on the whistle to keep time for them. Walker set his watch every day from jeweler E. S. Clifton&#39;s large clock on Main Street, and Clifton set his clock by Walker&#39;s whistle. &#39;&#39;Together they kept remarkably good time.&#39;&#39;
<P>   You can learn lots and lots more from Rose Houk&#39;s Smoky cookbook than how to make meat skin soup. It takes you through hog killing, the making of souse meat, red-eye gravy, backbones and ribs and hog jowls and peas. You can try Beuna Winchester&#39;s recipe for cooking groundhog and Duane Oliver&#39;s for cooking bear steak stew, plus many, many others. The cookbook costs $11.95 plus tax. You can buy it at Great Smokies visitor centers and, I suppose, at various book stores. It&#39;s a goodie.

<P>   Susan Arp has a lot on her mind these days. 
<P>   She moved from community fundraiser -- concentrating on United Way -- to becoming director of development and administration of an arts organization -- the Knoxville Opera Company.
<P>   In her eight-year tenure as executive director and chief professional officer of the United Way of Greater Kingsport, the organization raised over $18 million for charitable services. 
<P>   Now she is involved with the most expensive of the art forms to produce. Ticket sales account for only 43 percent of the funding.  Corporate sponsors, patrons, Opera Guild benefits and fund raising must provide the additional monies, she says.
<P>   The transition is proving an easy one for Arp, and happily the new role promises some welcome challenges, she says.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It is really exciting to arrive on the scene at a time when long-range planning is being undertaken. It offers one a chance to quickly learn the many facets of operating an opera and the opportunity to help make a difference in its move into the new century.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The fund raising and managerial skills needed for my work with United Way are necessary for this job as well,&#39;&#39; she adds.  
<P>   Admittedly she has no long-time romance with opera, but having studied piano for most of her formative years, and always having been a music appreciator, she feels quite comfortable in music circles.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Opera is such a complex, yet complete art form that it is exciting to see how it all goes together, to be involved in it.&#39;&#39; 
<P>   Arp is a community-minded person as well. 
<P>   She and husband Bennie, whom she met and married while both were students at Middle Tennessee State University, moved to Knoxville from Kingsport, for him to assume the State Farm office in the Fountain City.
<P>   The couple, now married 29 years, are parents of two sons. Ken is a sales rep with Eastman Chemical, and lives in Chicago with his wife Camille. Brett Arp, who received an MBA from The Thunderbird, an international management group in Phoenix, is just back from Madrid, where he worked on fluency in Spanish. 
<P>   The Arps also brought up two nephews, Jashon Hall of Oak Ridge, who is just out of the Marines and is entering college, and Wesley Hall of Nashville, who is working at Mercury Records.
<P>   At home now are the couple&#39;s two dogs, Tessa, a border collie, and Shadow, a springer spaniel.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>OPPERHILL, Tenn. -- A tanker truck spilled up to 250 gallons of sulfuric acid on state Highway 68 on Wednesday after failing to secure the container&#39;s top lid, authorities said.
<P>    The truck, owned by K&S Tank Line of Copperhill, was hauling the sulfuric acid from the local B.I.T. Manufacturing plant to J.M. Huber Co., a chemical plant about 50 miles northwest in Etowah, said Gray Gibson, dispatcher for the Tennessee Highway Patrol&#39;s Chattanooga district.
<P>    After loading the acid into the truck about 9:30 a.m. EST, a lid on the top of the tanker wasn&#39;t secured.
<P>    When the truck pulled out of the plant, 50 to 250 gallons of the chemical spilled onto the roadway, Gibson said.
<P>    A portion of the highway was closed about an hour so emergency crews could neutralize the chemical with dry lime.
<P>    Gibson said the chemical spill was contained to the highway&#39;s asphalt and did not reach soil or water.
<P>    No one was injured and no one was evacuated, he added.
<P>    Sulfuric acid is a strong, corrosive and hazardous chemical widely used by industries for numerous purposes, including the making of fertilizers.
<P>    The odorless, clear chemical can cause breathing problems if inhaled and severe burns if it touches skin tissue.
<P>    Vapors are irritating to the eyes and throat and can cause nausea.
<P>    Gibson said the driver, whose name wasn&#39;t immediately available, was issued a ticket for driving a commercial vehicle with a container leak.
<P>    Boliden Intertrade Inc., known as B.I.T., is owned by the Sweden-based Trelleborg. The company took over the old copper smelting works in this tiny town on the southeast border of Tennessee in 1990.
<P>    The U.S. offices are based in Atlanta.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">K</FONT>noxville is back in the annexation business.
<P>   In its first such action in more than a year, City Council on Tuesday gave unanimous first reading approval to the annexation of 13 parcels of county property whose owners requested to be taken into the city.
<P>   Council also approved the annexation of a 14th tract -- the Maxey&#39;s Boat Dock property on Maloney and Ginn roads in South Knox County -- whose owners have since withdrawn their annexation request.
<P>    Mayor Victor Ashe said Wednesday the parcel remains targeted and will be on the Jan. 28 council agenda for second reading.
<P>    The parcel &#39;&#39;is at the end of an existing street that is in the city, and it is off Alcoa Highway, (all of which) is within the city,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   Bill Maxey, who owns one-third of the six-acre tract, said the annexation was requested when a sale of the land to a developer was pending. The sale fell through. Maxey said he and his two sisters are reconsidering the annexation.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve been talking it over,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We feel like maybe it&#39;s not the right thing to do, but we have not made a final decision yet.&#39;&#39;
<P>  Maxey&#39;s Boat Dock was once a popular docking and concessions area. There are no longer gasoline or concession sales, but boats are still docked there.
<P>    At a hearing Wednesday, some county residents who live near the site expressed concern or opposition.
<P>    There were no annexations during 1996 because of a moratorium established by Ashe, at the request of County Executive Tommy Schumpert, to minimize the impact of annexation issues on the proposal to merge city and county governments.
<P>   Now that unification failed, the city &#39;&#39;will be pursuing growth through annexation,&#39;&#39; Ashe said. &#39;&#39;The annexations will be at the owner&#39;s request by and large, but that is not an iron-clad rule.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Schumpert said his office will try to learn from people who are requesting annexation &#39;&#39;the exact reasons they want to be in the city, what services we&#39;re not offering that they would prefer.&#39;&#39;

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has awarded at $310,000 grant to Overlook Center to build a six-unit apartment complex for individuals with mental illness.
<P>   Overlook is a community mental health center that serves people with persistent and serious mental illnesses, as well as providing substance abuse services in Knox, Blount, Loudon, Monroe and Sevier counties.
<P>   &#39;&#39;This grant allows us to continue the expansion of housing options to the people we serve,&#39;&#39; said Shirley Hill, Overlook&#39;s director of HUD projects. &#39;&#39;We are looking forward to serving our communities and our consumers through this project.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Overlook will oversee the construction and management of the apartments, which will be located in Maryville. The apartments will house six residents who have a serious and persistent mental illness.
<P>   Two other HUD projects to build housing for the mentally ill are pending -- a $432,000 grant request for an eight-unit complex in Knoxville and a $324,000 grant for a six-unit complex in Monroe County.
<P>   With the most recent grant, Overlook has received more than $1 million to construct and manage 20 apartments for the mentally ill.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We are in the housing business to help persons with mental illness and other disabilities to find decent, safe, affordable and permanent housing,&#39;&#39; said Overlook Grant Development Director Penny Driver. &#39;&#39;These HUD projects and properties help us meet the needs of persons with mental illness and give them the opportunities and choices for housing.&#39;&#39;
<P>   According to Driver, the housing options for mentally ill within communities will allow those individuals to receive services within their home communities, near their families and other supportive people. Each resident will have their own apartment, which includes a bedroom, bathroom, living room and kitchen/dining area.
<P>    There will be a common laundry room and office where residents may meet with staff memebers who direct and coordinate their support services.
<P>   Overlook, a member of Covenant Behavioral Health, has five other HUD properties, three apartment complexes for the elderly in Knoxville, Sweetwater and Lenoir City, and two eight-bed group homes for adults for mental illness in Knoxville and Maryville.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- Safety Commissioner Mike Greene had second thoughts about spending $33,000 on a new Ford Expedition that would be his second state car.
<P>    High-performance radios and blue lights had been added to the 4-by-4 sport-utility vehicle when Greene sent it back to Town and Country Ford in Madison, a Nashville suburub.
<P>     The purchase ultimately cost the state $1,400, but the timing drew a rebuke from the Legislature.
<P>    Gov. Don Sundquist has ordered some departments to cut their expenses more than 20 percent to help make up an expected $100 million shortfall in the current budget.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s a terrible example,&#39;&#39; said Rep. Gary Odom, D-Nashville and a member of the Legislature&#39;s watchdog Fiscal Review Committee.
<P>    In his belt-tightening campaign, Sundquist has pointed to small successes like the $8,000 saved by discontinuing phone lines that are no longer used.
<P>    In Greene&#39;s case, the state paid $28,168 for the truck, which had a manufacturer&#39;s suggested retail price of $32,975. Ford Motor Co. bought the truck back for $26,768, said Ed Jones, deputy general services commissioner.
<P>    Greene realized the time was not right to take on the new truck as state employees fear for their jobs in the wake of reorganization and budget shortfalls, Sundquist said.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s not wrongdoing. It&#39;s the appearance of it. I mean, it just didn&#39;t look right in a year when we were crunching dollars and saving money,&#39;&#39; Sundquist said. &#39;&#39;He called me and said, &#39;I feel bad about this. I ordered it before the budget crunch&#39; . . . He said he&#39;d recommend we sell it, and I said, &#39;I agree with that.&#39; &#39;&#39; Sundquist said.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Jerry Dean, News-Sentinel business writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>HATTANOOGA -- When Glenda Kay Miller, an ex-TVA employee and soft-spoken mother of three, returned to college in 1982, she hoped to parlay training into a career in computer analysis.
<P>   And when she landed a systems analyst&#39;s job with TVA in 1987, Miller felt success was imminent.
<P>   But her testimony Wednesday in a Department of Labor administrative hearing revealed how her eight-year TVA work experience soured, allegedly because of a supervisor&#39;s perception that Miller once mentioned a handgun and thus jeopardized her coworkers&#39; safety.
<P>   Miller, despite an exemplary work record, suddenly found herself psychologically tested, her TVA security access revoked. And she was told no other jobs within TVA were available to her.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I lost my name,&#39;&#39; a tearful Miller told Administrative Law Judge Robert L. Hillyard. &#39;&#39;It was the most traumatic experience of my life. I grew up in a proud, middle-class family where your name means everything. When they take that away, you lose everything.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Miller said she has sought other jobs since her August 1995 dismissal from her $50,000 a year job. But when employers ask if she has been fired or denied security clearance, she answers honestly. Then doors close, she added.
<P>   Miller, 50, said she did not know at first why TVA fired her, since the federal agency only said medical tests showed her ineligible for security clearance she needed to enter work areas. But she said Wednesday TVA targeted her for dismissal once she voiced concerns about installation of an unproven &#39;&#39;hand-geometry&#39;&#39; identification system at Sequoyah, Browns Ferry and Watts Bar nuclear plants.
<P>   Federal laws prohibit nuclear licensees from retaliation against workers who question nuclear plant safety. In such a case, TVA recently was fined $100,000 for forcing the resignation of William Jocher, a Sequoyah Nuclear plant official and once TVA&#39;s chief of chemistry.
<P>   Miller said TVA in 1995 was pressed to meet a spring startup date of long-delayed Watts Bar. After she refused to approve hand-geometry, her work was closely scrutinized, Miller said.
<P>   Questioned by TVA attorney Thomas F. Fine, Miller said she first thought she was fired for efforts to upgrade her job. Later, she learned she was psychologically tested because of January 1995 remarks made to her supervisor Barbara McKenna.
<P>   When McKenna asked about her recent illness, Miller described how she, home alone and ill, retrieved her husband&#39;s gun after hearing a possible intruder. Miller later told a TVA intern she better understood how workplace stress made some postal workers resort to violence.
<P>   The utterances, Miller said, were used as pretext for finding her &#39;&#39;unfit for duty&#39;&#39; after she noted &#39;&#39;incompatibility&#39;&#39; between plant security and the unproven hand-geometry system.
<P>   Fine noted none of Miller&#39;s first complaints to TVA had attributed her firing to her having voiced safety concerns. But Miller said she was &#39;&#39;confused&#39;&#39; then by events of her firing.
<P>   Dr. Thomas M. Pendergrass, who examined Miller, said she showed&#39;&#39;depression and nervousness&#39;&#39; but &#39;&#39;no suggestion of psychotic disorder.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The hearing continues at 9 a.m. today in Chattanooga&#39;s federal courthouse.

<P>    &#39;&#39;There could be some Fraser fir forest in the future,&#39;&#39; Johnson said.
<P>    Because the insects mainly attack only mature trees, Johnson said the seedlings will have a chance to develop. Park wildlife managers hope that among them will be some of the few Fraser firs that have a natural genetic resistance to the pests.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We just have to wait and see,&#39;&#39; she said, adding the park is keeping a close eye on the developing trees.
<P>    The balsam woolly adelgid, a tiny, fuzzy, sucking insect, kills the fir by enlarging and hardening cells, eventually blocking the ability of each tree to transfer fluids from one part to another.
<P>    The species is entirely female, and each female can lay 400 or more eggs per year. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;They can completely coat a tree,&#39;&#39; Johnson said.
<P>    The insect infestation has killed a great majority of the mature fir trees in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The adelgid is a European insect imported to the United States around 1908 and possibly brought into this region on Christmas trees from other regions.
<P>    While not a problem yet, the national park plant specialists are concerned that another, similar adelgid insect will begin attacking hemlock trees. The adelgid haven&#39;t yet appeared in the park. They are in other parts of the country and could arrive any time on wind currents or migrating birds.
<P>    The hemlock adelgid doesn&#39;t attack the bark but goes for the base of the needles.
<P>    Some of the park&#39;s largest and oldest trees are eastern hemlock. The park has at least one that is over 400 years old, Johnson said.
<P>    Because hemlock often grows along the edges of streams, plant specialists in other parts of the country are concerned their demise could lead to a rise in stream temperature, a result that could have an adverse impact on aquatic life forms in the park.

		<P>        The Knoxville Cherokees are as defenseless as a chicken in a henhouse filled with foxes.
<P>        The East Coast Hockey League team took it on the chin again Wednesday night at the Civic Coliseum. The Richmond Renegades won 7-4 to saddle the Cherokees with their third consecutive loss.
<P>        Mike Rucinski scored two goals, including a backbreaker 8:40 into the third period that put the Renegades (25-10-1) in front 6-3.
<P>        Rucinski wasn&#39;t the only Richmond defenseman to beat Knoxville goalie Trent Cavicchi. Dallas Ferguson got his first in 13 games with the Renegades in the second period to put Richmond ahead to stay.
<P>        Mike Harding, Scott Burfoot, David Dartsch and Tom Holmes also had goals for the Renegades.
<P>        The Cherokees (13-22-2) bunched goals by Dave Neilson, Vaclav Nedomansky and Stephane Soulliere in the first period. But only Jim Brown could beat goalie Tripp Tracy the rest of the way.
<P>        Brown, Knoxville&#39;s leading scorer, got his 23rd in the third period.
<P>        Knoxville is crippled on defense. The prospects of an immediate reversal aren&#39;t good, but the Cherokees displayed the possibility of long-range improvement with the addition of defenseman Greg Bailey.
<P>        Bailey, 6-foot-5 and 228 pounds, started the season with San Antonio of the Central League. He has ECHL experience (two years) with Huntington and Birmingham. He didn&#39;t mind throwing his weight around.
<P>        Bailey&#39;s arrival couldn&#39;t come at a more opportune time for the league&#39;s most-porous defense. The defensive corps is beat up.
<P>        Mike Vandenberghe (wrist) missed his third straight game and Sean Halifax sat out the Richmond game, while Jamie Bird played at less than 100 percent. Dan Chaput, who started, didn&#39;t return to the ice after the first period.
<P>        Captain Wayne Anchikoski, normally a forward, skated on defense. So did Dean Moore. Moore wasn&#39;t around for the third period. He was accidentally struck in the face by a puck at Richmond&#39;s blue line.
<P>        Richmond scored three goals in span of 3:13 in the first period to build a 3-1 lead. Rucinski cruised down the slot unchecked and got his 11th.
<P>        Harding added his 16th. Burfoot collected his 16th at 10:56 only 29 seconds after Bird went to the penalty box for slashing.
<P>        But Knoxville caught up twice before the first intermission.
<P>        Neilson&#39;s got his 12th on a low shot inside the post 43 seconds after Rucinski put The Renegaades ahead. Soulliere chipped the puck over Tracy for his ninth and 45 seconds later, Nedomansky, using Richmond&#39;s Andrew Shier as a shield, slapped home his 13th.
<P>        Ferguson put Richmond ahead 4-3 with 2:38 gone in the second period, and the defenseman proved anyone can score when left unattended in the circle.
<P>        The Renegades had outscored the Cherokees 13-2 in winning the two earlier meetings.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>     <B>Paul Hamilton,</B> who coached receivers and quarterbacks at East Tennessee State University 1983-87, is back as head coach.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I know a lot of great football coaches around the country were interested in this job and I know how blessed I am to have this opportunity,&#39;&#39; said Hamilton, who has been offensive coordinator at Air Force Academy.
<P>    <B>Keener Fry,</B> ETSU&#39;s athletic director, told the Johnson City Press there were many candidates to replace <B>Mike Cavan,</B> who left last month for SMU, &#39;&#39;but I don&#39;t think any had this much passion and love for this university.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Fry and an advisory search committee spent about three weeks narrowing the field to four candidates, then picked Hamilton after less than a day of deliberating.
<P>    Hamilton, 38, from Charleston, S.C., graduated from Appalachian State in 1981. He coached at Wofford for two seasons before moving to Air Force for the past seven years. Air Force made it to four bowl games during his tenure and was one of the top rushing teams in the nation, using a wishbone attack.
<P>    Hamilton will make $76,000 a season for four years in base salary. TV and radio shows would put the package at over $100,000.
<P>    ETSU, which made the NCAA Division I-AA playoffs this year for the first time in 72 years, finished the season at 10-3.

		<basefont size="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>TVA fined $100,000 for job bias</B></font><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> NRC levies penalty in Jocher case</FONT></BASEFONT><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By Jerry Dean, News-Sentinel business writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>VA has received a maximum fine for its discrimination against a nuclear whistleblower, while a vice president who received steady performance bonuses has been barred from nuclear operations.
<P>   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposed Tuesday that TVA be fined $100,000 in the aftermath of job discrimination that forced the 1993 resignation of TVA&#39;s former nuclear chemistry chief, William F. Jocher, who voiced nuclear safety concerns.
<P>   Jocher won an unspecified legal settlement in the case after the U.S. Department of Labor and the NRC concluded last July that TVA officials -- including Joseph R. Bynum, formerly TVA vice president of nuclear operations -- discriminated against Jocher, once TVA&#39;s director of corporate chemistry and manager of TVA&#39;s Sequoyah Nuclear plant near Soddy-Daisy, Tenn. The NRC inquiry found Jocher was forced to resign because he had raised safety issues in the course of discharging his duties. Jocher, threatened with firing, resigned instead on July 29, 1993.
<P>   The NRC&#39;s order Tuesday also bars Bynum, now TVA&#39;s vice president for fossil operations, from NRC-licensed activities through April 1998 -- a five-year period dating from May 1, 1993, the date of TVA&#39;s corporate discrimination against Jocher.
<P>   Jocher was generally pleased with the size of the fine.
<P>   &#39;&#39;That&#39;s one of the biggest NRC fines ever levied in an individual&#39;s case,&#39;&#39; Jocher said Tuesday. NRC spokesman Roger Hannah confirmed it was the maximum civil penalty NRC could assess for a one-time violation.
<P>   The NRC fined TVA $80,000 last February in a Watts Bar nuclear inspector&#39;s case, and it fined TVA a total of $150,000 late in 1996 for lapses in Sequoyah Nuclear Plant operations.
<P>   Jocher commended NRC Chairman Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson &#39;&#39;for sending a clear message to the nuclear industry.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;The NRC clearly is taking steps to inform the industry that honesty and integrity count for something -- that the NRC won&#39;t tolerate (nuclear officials) impeding employees from doing their jobs.&#39;&#39;
<P>   According to TVA, Bynum&#39;s move to fossil operations in 1993 was unrelated to Jocher&#39;s case. Bynum this year is earning $115,000, plus was awarded a $25,000 bonus; a TVA spokesman said he received bonuses during his tenure in nuclear operations.
<P>   NRC and Labor Department investigators found Jocher had resigned from TVA under threat of dismissal after he voiced concern over nuclear safety, an activity federal law protects. Jocher had questioned Sequoyah&#39;s operational safety, especially its post-accident sampling, on-line chemistry instrumentation and adequacy of its chemistry training effort. NRC Southeast Regional Administrator Luis Reyes, in a letter Tuesday to TVA, said the NRC considers TVA&#39;s violation of Jocher&#39;s rights at &#39;&#39;the highest level of severity&#39;&#39; since it entailed &#39;&#39;employee discrimination by a senior corporate manager.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;Discrimination at this level (can) affect the environment throughout the company. The NRC places a high value on nuclear industry employees&#39; freedom to raise potential safety concerns to licensee management or to the NRC.&#39;&#39;
<P>   TVA has 30 days to pay the $100,000 fine or protest it..
<P>   TVA, in a prepared response issued Tuesday, said the fine was &#39;&#39;to address a situation that took place four years ago.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;TVA has the violation under review,&#39;&#39; according to Kay Whittenburg, TVA nuclear communications manager in Chattanooga. TVA Nuclear, she said, &#39;&#39;has a comprehensive program to ensure that employees feel free to raise potential safety issues without fear of reprisal. TVA has re-emphasized the need for open communication.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Rebecca Ferrar, News-Sentinel Nashville bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- EPA officials assured Tennessee environmentalists Tuesday they would work to clean up the polluted Pigeon River, but they may not  overturn a variance approved for Champion International paper mill.
<P>    Environmental Protection Agency administrators from Atlanta, in a meeting with the Tennessee Environmental Council, also said they are waiting to hear Tennessee&#39;s proposal for tougher state water quality standards to improve the Pigeon River 37 miles downstream from the North Carolina paper plant at the Tennessee state line.
<P>    Tennessee filed a petition Monday with North Carolina asking that the variance to its water quality standards be reversed and that the state comply instead with Tennessee&#39;s standards for color in the river.
<P>    The EPA already has agreed to review its approval of the North Carolina variance, despite the slim likelihood of a reversal.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Our lawyers are looking at that,&#39;&#39; said Mike McGhee, director of the water division for the EPA&#39;s Region IV in Atlanta. &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know of that ever happening before. We&#39;re looking at the possibility of reconsidering the variance.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Should that happen, the variance would &#39;&#39;still be valid&#39;&#39; under North Carolina law, but the EPA would move to establish a tougher federal, water quality standard for that state, McGhee said.
<P>    Meanwhile, John Hankinson Jr., EPA&#39;s regional administrator, who has been corresponding with Attorney General Charles Burson, said it&#39;s now up to Tennessee to propose new state water quality standards to apply to the Pigeon River and to &#39;&#39;make the best call on that.&#39;&#39;
<P>    &#39;&#39;If EPA wants us to define the standard for the purposes of the 1996 permit, we will do it,&#39;&#39; said Justin Wilson, deputy to the governor for policy and former Environment and Conservation commissioner. &#39;&#39;We want to clean up the river.&#39;&#39;
<P>    When he receives a proposal, Hankinson said, contacting Burson would be &#39;&#39;the first phone call I make.&#39;&#39;
<P>    &#39;&#39;When we get that standard I will ask to convene a meeting between Tennessee and North Carolina, and we will try to find a way to see that Tennessee water quality standards are met,&#39;&#39; Hankinson said.
<P>    Tennessee has an &#39;&#39;observable standard&#39;&#39; based on 50 color units, and Tennessee Environmental Council wants that lowered to 10 color units (a measure of the darkness of the water).
<P>    TEC Director Allan Jones said that improved standard is &#39;&#39;the typical color for an unpolluted stream in the Smoky Mountains.&#39;&#39;
<P>    &#39;&#39;EPA ultimately has the hammer,&#39;&#39; Jones said. &#39;&#39;EPA could step in and take over the permit.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Wilson said Tennessee will not propose a standard but will &#39;&#39;interpret that standard for the EPA in connection with the particulars of the North Carolina permit and variance.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The variance was granted last month, and EPA Director Carol Browner wrote Burson noting Tennessee&#39;s concerns came to EPA&#39;s attention late in the permitting process. Also, Vice President Al Gore has written Browner expressing concern that the state&#39;s waters be kept clean.
<P>    Jones said he learned from EPA officials that Champion&#39;s stated reason for getting a variance was because of the &#39;&#39;substantial economic and social impact,&#39;&#39; he said. That means &#39;&#39;profitability,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We don&#39;t see where when it comes to clean water, an economic variance is allowed,&#39;&#39; Jones said.
<P>    Members of the Dead Pigeon River Council also attended the meeting, which the EPA asked be closed to the media.

<P>   Volunteers will be introduced to the program in a two-hour seminar to be conducted at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 21, in the Small Assembly Room of the City County Building. Cookies and beverages will be provided by AAA East Tennessee.
<P>   At the seminar, a Knox County judge, prosecutor and defense attorney will provide insights and perspectives on the legal process that reviews drunken driving cases. Terri Lynn Corder, who oversees the court monitoring program, will provide information about duties of volunteers.
<P>   While most volunteers are needed to watch cases being heard in court during normal business hours Monday through Friday, some volunteer work also is available at other times.
<P>   The court monitoring program started in the fall of 1995 through the Metropolitan Drug Commission and the DUI Task Force. Its goal is to record how drunken driving cases are handled in the Knox County court system.
<P>   For more information about the court monitoring program and how to volunteer, contact Ron Hanaver at the MDC at 588-5550.
<P>   About a dozen court monitoring volunteers were honored Saturday at a ceremony in Alcoa. Corder presented them with certificates of appreciation for their efforts to record the disposition of each drunken driving case in Knox County.

		<FONT SIZE="6"><B>Naifeh expects tough sells for governor</B></font><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By Tom Humphrey and Rebecca Ferrar, News-Sentinel Nashville bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- As the 100th General Assembly convened on Tuesday, House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh signaled that Gov. Don Sundquist may have a tough time selling some of his initiatives in the state House.
<P>    In the Senate, meanwhile, Lt. Gov. John Wilder cautioned senators against swapping votes and being &#39;&#39;bought&#39;&#39; by friends with a special interest agenda.
<P>    An Oak Ridge minister added a prayer asking God&#39;s help for lawmakers to avoid unneeded infighting or influence by lobbyists.
<P>    The 1997 session began officially at noon with legislators being duly sworn into office and then proceeding to unanimously re-elect Naifeh as head of the House and Wilder as speaker of the Senate.
<P>    Naifeh, presiding over a chamber where Democrats have a 61-38 majority, declared in his opening speech that Sundquist maneuvers in higher education, budget-cutting and government restructuring will be closely scrutinized by House committees.
<P>    Naifeh said his confidence in the Tennessee Higher Education Commission had been shaken by &#39;&#39;recent developments&#39;&#39; -- a reference to the THEC board firing Exeuctive Director Bryant Millsaps at Sundquist&#39;s behest. He said he asked the House Education Committee to &#39;&#39;determine whether the current governance structure addresses the needs of our state.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Rep. Les Winningham, D-Huntsville, who is vice chairman of the Education Committee, said later in an interview that one option to be considered is stripping the governor of power to appoint THEC members and giving it to Wilder and Naifeh instead. The speakers could choose from nominees submitted by the House and Senate education committees, he said.
<P>    As an alternative, Winningham said THEC board appointments by the governor could be made subject to &#39;&#39;meaningful&#39;&#39; confirmation by the House and Senate, with members not allowed to vote on THEC business until after confirmation. Before Millsaps ouster, Sundquist made four appointments to the board -- which then voted to fire Millsaps by one vote.
<P>    Sundquist noted later that he has already vowed to name a special committee to recommend changes in higher education structure, which now has THEC overseeing both the University of Tennessee system and the Board of Regents system. He said the legislative scrutiny could dovetail with that work.
<P>    Naifeh, in his speech, expressed willingness to work with the governor -- though never mentioning Sundquist by name and referring on occasion to accomplishments of former Democratic Gov. Ned McWherter.
<P>    Other Naifeh points:
<P>    * The House Finance Committee will get extra &#39;&#39;resources and assistance&#39;&#39; to check Sundquist&#39;s budget figures and provide &#39;&#39;assurances the state budget is responsible and without waste&#39;&#39; at a time when &#39;&#39;the latest administration&#39;s estimates&#39;&#39; indicate a $100 million revenue shortfall this year and $300 million in the next year.
<P>    * Because &#39;&#39;we should not make wholesale moves in departments just for the sake of making moves,&#39;&#39; the House Government Operations Committee will scrutinize Sundquist plans to abolish the state Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation and to consolidate state department lawyers into a central office.
<P>    Wilder, meanwhile, declared in his opening speech that many people think legislators can be bought with money.
<P>    &#39;&#39;But that&#39;s not what will buy you. What will buy you is two things. One is friendship. That will get you before anything that I know. You have a friend ask you to do something, a friend . . . who helps you get elected. You got to be careful.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The other, and it&#39;s wrong, is when someone says, &#39;I got a good old bill here. I can help you. Swap it out.&#39; Those two are totally wrong.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Pastor Michael Wood of St. Mary&#39;s Catholic Church in Oak Ridge, who offered the opening prayer at the Senate chamber, suggested in the prayer that the Legislature may need God&#39;s blessing even as he asked it.
<P>    Wood asked that God help lawmakers when their &#39;&#39;ideologies and egos clash&#39;&#39; and when &#39;&#39;programs and politics part company, as they surely will.&#39;&#39;

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT>reezing rain and sleet have been dropped from today&#39;s forecast, which calls for this afternoon&#39;s rain to be met by temperatures too warm to cause icy driving conditions.
<P>   After a forecast low near 20 for today, the National Weather Service expects temperatures to peak in the 40s and puts today&#39;s chance of rain at 60 percent and ups the odds to 70 percent for tonight.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;ll be becoming warmer through the day, and temperatures when the rain falls will be the critical factor,&#39;&#39; NWS meteorologist Susan Faust said.
<P>   Temperatures are forecast to fall into the mid-30s tonight, go no higher than the upper 30s on Thursday and then continue to drop under partly cloudy skies.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;re expecting some more cold, arctic air to start moving into the region starting Thursday,&#39;&#39; Faust said. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;Through the weekend, the extended forecast calls for lows in the teens on Friday and Saturday morning. Highs are likely to be only in the 20s on Friday and maybe in the 20s or 30s on Saturday.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Currently, Friday and Saturday also are expected to bring only partly cloudy -- and not sleeting or snowing -- skies.
<P>   More than half the state&#39;s 95 counties kept schools closed or operated on delayed schedules Tuesday because of lingering ice on secondary roads following last week&#39;s wintry blast.
<P>   In the Middle Tennessee town of Hohenwald, officials with the Elephant Sanctuary were busy caring for three residents unaccustomed to wintry temperatures.
<P>   Barbara, Jenny and Tara -- three Asian elephants -- were outfitted with vinyl pillow cases to serve as elephant-sized ear muffs. Carol Buckley, executive director of the center, said the elephants are used to temperatures between 32 degrees and 120 degrees and are being confined to a barn when necessary. For trips outside, the animals don blankets.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They were not created to live in subfreezing climates,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;Their ears are so thin, and their trunk is an extension of their nose, so you want to keep it moist inside. They have a thick layer of body fat, but it&#39;s not for protecting them.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> Townsend man pleaded guilty Tuesday to federal witness tampering in connection with the 1996 beating of the brother of a government informant in Sevier County.
<P>   Ronald Edward Buchanan, 45, also pleaded guilty to using a firearm during a crime of violence in connection with the June 10 incident and to a count of distributing cocaine in 1994.
<P>   Three other charges were dropped as part of a plea agreement between Buchanan and federal authorities.
<P>   U.S. District Judge James Jarvis asked Buchanan, also known as Eddie Buck, if he understood and agreed with the plea agreement and the factual basis describing the offenses.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Yeah, I understand it, your honor,&#39;&#39; Buchanan told Jarvis before adding, &#39;&#39;My lawyer&#39;s gone over it with me, too.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Buchanan and Randy Alan McClure, 27, of Sevierville allegedly broke into the Sevier County home of Joel and Agnes McCarter at gunpoint on June 10 because McCarter&#39;s brother, Johnny, was testifying against at least McClure.
<P>   Johnny McCarter cooperated with authorities in a 1994 drug investigation involving McClure and had testified against him in Sevier County and was going to testify before a federal grand jury.
<P>   According to testimony by Joel McCarter, he was beaten by McClure while Buchanan held a shotgun on him and his wife. He said he was subsequently  dragged from the house to McClure&#39;s truck.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The defendant (and his co-defendant, Randy McClure) forced Joel McCarter into a vehicle and threatened to kill him since they could not find his brother, Johnny McCarter,&#39;&#39; states a factual basis prepared by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Aubry and signed by Buchanan.
<P>   According to the document, Buchanan repeatedly struck Joel McCarter with the butt of a 12-gauge shotgun while the three men drove about a mile from the McCarter residence.
<P>   At that point McCarter was pushed from the truck and struck several more times by Buchanan before being left on the road, according to court documents and the testimony of McCarter.
<P>   In addition to pleading guilty to conspiring to use intimidation and physical force to delay or prevent Johnny McCarter&#39;s testimony, Buchanan also pleaded guilty to selling Johnny McCarter about a gram of cocaine on Aug. 22, 1994.
<P>   According to court statements, he faces a sentencing range of 71/2 to 81/3 years in prison.
<P>   McClure&#39;s case is still pending.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Gina Stafford, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> former deliveryman who pleaded guilty to stealing $67,000 worth of copper tubing from his employer was given a nine-year prison sentence Monday by Knox County Criminal Court Judge Mary Beth Leibowitz.
<P>   James Roland Cupp, 37, of Corryton was a driver/deliveryman for Engert Plumbing and Heating Inc. from 1990 until he was fired on June 8, 1995, according to Knox County Assistant District Attorney Lew Walton.
<P>   Cupp&#39;s termination followed an internal company investigation by Engert officials, who had noticed materials shortages and conducted an audit, Walton said.
<P>   The theft with which Cupp was charged occurred between November 1994 and June 8, 1995, Walton said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It is a white-collar crime in the sense it was committed by an employee against an employer,&#39;&#39; Walton said, &#39;&#39;and it was investigated and handled by the white-collar crime unit of the district attorney&#39;s office.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Cupp was charged with Class D felony theft -- stealing property worth $1,000 to $10,000 -- in a warrant on June 9, 1995. Further investigation resulted in an indictment by a grand jury in November 1995 on the highest level of felony theft, Class B, for stealing property valued in excess of $60,000, Walton said.
<P>   Cupp, a husband and father of two children, previously had been charged with misdemeanor offenses, including writing worthless checks, secreting goods and public intoxication, Walton said.
<P>   On Oct. 29, 1996, Cupp pleaded guilty to stealing $67,208.24 worth of materials from his employer. He sold the stolen tubing to a Knoxville scrap metal dealer, Walton said.
<P>   Cupp faced an eight- to 12-year sentence at Monday&#39;s hearing, which lasted more than an hour. Leibowitz denied Cupp&#39;s request for probation and ordered his sentence to be served in a state penitentiary. Restitution to his former employer was not ordered.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>AK RIDGE -- Dr. Ronald D. Townsend will be the new president of Oak Ridge Associated Universities, the ORAU board announced Tuesday following a six-month search.
<P>    His appointment is effective April 7.
<P>    Townsend is commandant of the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology, which is located at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. The military institute includes two graduate schools for advanced degrees in aerospace technology and management, as well as an engineering research laboratory and continuing education programs.
<P>    He will become the fifth person to take the helm of ORAU, which is celebrating its 50th year as a not-for-profit consortium of universities and contractor for the federal government. Along with providing services to its 88 member colleges and universities, ORAU manages the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education for the U.S. Department of Energy.
<P>    Townsend succeeds Dr. Jon Veigel, who resigned last year as ORAU president, citing health reasons. Since then, Dr. Jim Drewry has been acting ORAU president, as well as holding his position of director of ORISE.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The future of ORAU is filled with opportunity, and I am delighted to be part of it,&#39;&#39; Townsend said in his acceptance letter.
<P>    A search committee reviewed the backgrounds of more than 125 potential candidates, making recommendations to the board.
<P>    ORAU has an annual budget of more than $75 million, with a staff of about 700, most of whom work in Oak Ridge. The consortium also maintains offices in Washington, D.C., Aiken, S.C., and Albuquerque, N.M.
<P>    Townsend, a native of Kansas, spent 24 years in the Air Force and previously served as director of weather operations for the Headquarters Air Combat Command. He holds degrees in mathematics from Kansas State University and a Ph.D. in meteorology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>LINTON -- An Anderson County man alleged to be a member of a gang that has committed burglaries in at least 10 East Tennessee counties was arrested early Tuesday after eluding officers since Saturday.
<P>   Johnnie Mack Wilson, 30, of Briceville was arrested at a mobile home near Oliver Springs about 3 a.m., according to Mark Whaley, information officer for the Anderson County Sheriff&#39;s Department. 
<P>   Wilson, Charles R. &#39;&#39;Chucky&#39;&#39; Daugherty, 24; Chris &#39;&#39;Skeeter Bill&#39;&#39; Moser, 19, and Deena Leinart, 22, are charged with breaking into two houses in Meigs County and two in Roane County on Saturday. 
<P>   All four are suspects in at least two and possibly more burglaries in Claiborne County, including a Jan. 2 break-in at the home of a Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper in the Lone Mountain community, officials said.
<P>   Claiborne County Chief Deputy Kelly Anders said police initially suspected the trooper&#39;s home, which was &#39;&#39;severely trashed&#39;&#39; in the burglary, had been targeted because it is an officer&#39;s. 
<P>   Interviews with the suspects revealed however, that the break-in was random, Anders said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It was after they got inside and saw pictures and other things to indicate they were in a trooper&#39;s house that they apparently decided to trash it because it was a cop&#39;s,&#39;&#39; Anders said.
<P>   The three men are all from Briceville. Leinart is from Halls.
<P>   A Meigs County man saw the three running from his home Saturday afternoon. They fled into some woods, but Leinart was arrested when she came to the residence to pick up the three men.
<P>   Officers said the three stole a church van and drove it to Briceville where it was found and a search started. Daughtery and Moser were arrested Monday afternoon. Wilson fled from officers on an all-terrain vehicle and fled along mining roads in the mountains.
<P>   Whaley said officers got an anonymous telephone call that Wilson was at the mobile home. He said officers surrounded the home, and Wilson surrendered without incident.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">K</FONT>noxville City Council voted Tuesday to authorize the issuance of up to $12 million in bonds to allow KUB to meet its expanding demand for gas service.
<P>   &#39;&#39;All money (from the bonds) wil be used to extend gas services to the customers who are asking for it,&#39;&#39; said Jim Carmon, head of KUB&#39;s gas division.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The revenues will pay for the bonds.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Carmon said increased demand for gas service is for the most part evenly distributed throughout KUB&#39;s service area.
<P>   In another matter, council voted 8-1 to overrule the Board of Zoning Appeals and allow Chrysler automobile dealer Harry Lane to erect a second sign on his lot at 240 N. Peters Road.
<P>   Lane said the second sign, which will be about 35 feet high, will promote the KIA line of imported cars from Korea.
<P>   There was some opposition to the measure, but Lane said he was not going to erect a &#39;&#39;junky-looking&#39;&#39; sign.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I see nothing wrong with putting up a nice looking sign. In fact, it is a pretty sign,&#39;&#39; Lane told council.
<P>   Councilwoman Jean Teague&#39;s motion to deny Lane&#39;s request failed, as only Councilwoman Carlene Malone supported it. However, when a motion to approve Lane&#39;s request was made, Teague voted for it, and Malone was the sole dissenting vote.
<P>   In other business, council unanimously approved the appointment of Robert &#39;&#39;Bob&#39;&#39; Booker to fill an unexpired term on the Historic Zoning Commission.
<P>   Council also unanimously re-appointed Donnie Lee and David Draper to their posts on the Better Building Board.
<P>   Ashe reported to council that the city has recovered its costs in eliminating a ramshackle motel that many South Knoxvillians regarded as a danger and an eyesore.
<P>   Ashe said the elimination of the structure at 4916 Chapman Highway began in 1991 with citizen complaints to Councilman Gary Underwood, who pressed the issue.
<P>   When the building was declared &#39;&#39;unsafe for human habitation,&#39;&#39; the owner refused to rehabilitate it or demolish it.
<P>   The city then hired a private firm to demolish it for $28,100.
<P>   The city then sued in Chancery Court to recover its costs, won a judgment, and shortly after a lien was attached on some of the owner&#39;s other properties, the city was paid the $28,100, Ashe said.
<P>   Underwood said that after the building was demolished, several citizens indicated to him that the crime rate in the vicinity was noticeably reduced.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> Greenville, S.C., man was sentenced Tuesday in federal court to a year in prison for committing bank fraud in which he stole $28,500 from First Tennessee Bank.
<P>   Thomas William Bledsoe, who resided in Knoxville when the offenses occurred in 1994, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge James Jarvis.
<P>   Bledsoe, 51, got the money by opening accounts for fictitious businesses at both Home Federal Bank and First Tennessee and sending checks between the accounts. 
<P>   He blamed his troubles on drug and alcohol abuse and said he had intended to pay back the money with the proceeds of an investment in a Mexican venture.
<P>   Asked if he had anything to say before the sentence, Bledsoe told Jarvis, &#39;&#39;Uh, no sir. I swear that nothing like this will ever happen again. I&#39;m sorry.&#39;&#39;
<P>   According to court documents, Bledsoe opened the accounts in September 1994 and committed the offense the next November.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Bledsoe stated that during the latter part of November 1994 he needed funds for another business venture in Mexico,&#39;&#39; states a factual basis prepared by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jimmie Baxter and signed by Bledsoe.
<P>   Bledsoe, using the alias Landon Bryant, had opened a Home Federal account in the name of Smokie Mountain Advertising and an account at First Tennessee in the name of Direct Mail Associates using small deposits.
<P>   On Nov. 22, 1994, he deposited three checks supposedly written by Smokie Mountain payable to Direct Mail Associates totaling $28,500.
<P>   First Tennessee credited the amounts and the following day Bledsoe, using the Landon Bryant alias, obtained checks totaling $27,050 from three different First Tennessee branch banks in Knoxville.
<P>   Jarvis also ordered Bledsoe to make $28,500 restitution to First Tennessee.

		<FONT SIZE="6"><B>Ex-TVA engineer gets hearing on firing</B></font><basefont size=6><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Psychological testing challenged</FONT></basefont></FONT><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By Jerry Dean, News-Sentinel business writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> former TVA security systems engineer<B> </B>says she will testify in a Department of Labor hearing today that she was psychologically tested and then fired by TVA after she balked at approving an advanced security system for nuclear plants.
<P>   Glenda Kay Miller, former security engineer at TVA&#39;s Browns Ferry Nuclear plant, alleges TVA made her undergo hostile interviews that led to her dismissal.
<P>   Miller, 50, of Chattanooga, said she questioned reliability of a proposed &#39;&#39;hand geometry&#39;&#39; employee identification system which TVA since has installed in its nuclear plants near Athens, Ala., and at Watts Bar and Sequoyah plants in East Tennessee.
<P>   Miller said Dr. Tom Saiwaj, TVA lead psychologist, and Dr. Lynn Boatwright, contracted to TVA, asked her about such personal matters as church attendance, whether she missed her husband when he traveled, and whether she had unpaid parking tickets exceeding $100.
<P>   Miller told The News-Sentinel the psychologists sought to provoke a response TVA could use as a basis for revoking the security clearance she had to have to work at TVA.
<P>   By the time of her dismissal, Miller, a 1987 UT-Chattanooga honors graduate, had eight years&#39; experience in development, implementation and support of real-time computer systems. She said her performance evaluations reflected no adverse reports until a Feb. 6, 1995 &#39;&#39;service review&#39;&#39; suddenly noted work problems TVA considered &#39;&#39;aberrant behavior.&#39;&#39;
<P>   TVA spokesman John Moulton said the Department of Labor&#39;s Wage and Hour Division initially ruled against Miller and for TVA in October 1996. Miller appealed and was granted an administrative hearing.
<P>   TVA fired Miller Sept. 11, 1995. Branded &#39;&#39;unreliable and untrustworthy,&#39;&#39; Miller said she has since been unable to find any work. Income loss, she said, made her sell a 34-acre farm she owned at LaFayette, Ga. 
<P>   She filed a January 1996 complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor&#39;s Wage and Hour Division, alleging TVA harassed her for questioning management officials&#39; assertions. The Wall Street Journal, in a March 20, 1996, article, said complaints of being pressured to undergo psychological testing, like Miller&#39;s, are increasingly common among whistleblowers at U.S. nuclear plants.
<P>   Miller, in a January 1996 letter to Carol Merchant of DOL&#39;s Wage and Hour Division, said TVA hired her in July 1987 at a $27,320 salary. By 1990, her salary exceeded $50,000 after she received excellent work evaluations.
<P>   Miller, as corporate project leader in TVA&#39;s Nuclear Group, was to upgrade integrated security computer systems at Browns Ferry, Sequoyah and Watts Bar nuclear plants. Her duties included evaluating computer system design and supervising regulatory compliance.
<P>   But beginning in January 1995, Miller said, she refused to approve untested systems for the physical security upgrade project manager at Browns Ferry. 
<P>   Miller said she told superiors she had insufficient time to examine a &#39;&#39;hand geometry&#39;&#39; infrared identification system.
<P>   She was &#39;&#39;systematically removed&#39;&#39; from her job, she said, &#39;&#39;under pretext of my so-called inability to maintain a security clearance as required.&#39;&#39;
<P>   A Browns Ferry manager, Miller alleged, in January 1995 called her at Sequoyah Nuclear to seek her verbal approval of the hand geometry ID system. Miller told The News-Sentinel:
<P>   &#39;&#39;I told him I was tired of these hot-shot, nontechnical TVA managers flying around the country buying high-tech toys to brag about at their cocktail parties -- then telling us to &#39;make them work&#39; after the fact.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Miller said her persecution was part of a &#39;&#39;pattern&#39;&#39; of abuses in which psychologists purge from TVA Nuclear ranks any workers who &#39;&#39;refuse to participate in unlawful acts.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT size="2"><I>By The Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT>OS ANGELES -- A lawsuit filed against America Online claims the Internet service provider offered a new price plan boosting the number of users even though it was unable to handle the increased load.
<P>    The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court on Monday, said AOL subscribers have encountered &#39;&#39;busy and unavailable phone lines and/or inaccessible computer equipment&#39;&#39; since the company began offering unlimited access for a $19.95 fee at the beginning of the year.
<P>    The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, was brought by Richard Basch, Robert Friedland, Jeffrey Rayden and James Kranz of Los Angeles County and Jason Cartwright of San Diego County, said their attorney, Louis Marlin.
<P>    Marlin said Tuesday his clients were unhappy with AOL because it has become increasingly difficult to obtain dial-in access.
<P>    &#39;&#39;They try over and over and over again to try and get in and they get a constant busy signal. One client tried 26 times the other night,&#39;&#39; Marlin said.
<P>    The plaintiffs, claiming negligence and consumer fraud, are seeking at least $20 million in compensatory damages as well as punitive damages and legal fees.
<P>    The suit also asks for a court order stopping AOL from selling any more flat-fee, unlimited-access service until there is &#39;&#39;sufficient equipment&#39;&#39; to handle the increased amount of users.
<P>    In a statement, the company said,  &#39;&#39;Although we understand the frustration some members are experiencing at not being able to obtain immediate local access during peak periods, the average AOL member gets more value under unlimited pricing than ever before.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The statement said that AOL plans to expand the system&#39;s capacity through a $250 million addition in equipment and services over the next two months.

		<h3>Proffitt&#39;s names group execs in Alabama</h3>

<P>   Mike Molitor, who has held the post of senior vice president of merchandise planning and analysis since February, has been named to the same position in the merchandising group. Molitor served as vice president of merchandising strategies at Younkers from March 1994 to January 1996.

<P>
<P><h3>Bank sees profits increase</h3>
<P>
<P>   First Central Bank reported ending 1996 with a 51 percent rise in net income over the previous year.
<P>   Net earnings were $765,142, up from $505,262. Total loans outstanding increased 27.3 percent to $57.5 million, and year-end deposits were $67.8 million, up 12.1 percent.
<P>   First Central, based in Loudon County, was established in 1991 and includes branches in Lenoir City, Farragut, Loudon and Tellico Village.
<P>
<P><h3>Asarco taps new managers</h3>
<P>
<P>   Asarco Inc. has named Donald H. Walters, general manager of Asarco&#39;s Tennessee Mines Division, to a special management process team, and Taie Li has been named to succeed him at the Tennessee Mines Division.
<P>   The division includes three operating zinc mines and one mine currently on standby near Knoxville.  Li, 38, has been manager of Asarco&#39;s Globe plant in Denver.
<P>    Walter, one of three senior Asarco executives named to the Management Process Team, will design, develop and guide the implementation of a state-of-the-art environmental management system. Walter, 51, has been general manager of the Tennessee Mines Division since 1994.
<P>
<P><h3>State&#39;s outlook good</h3>
<P>
<P>   Although the rapid economic growth Tennessee enjoyed from 1990 through 1995 has ended, the state&#39;s economy remains strong, a University of Tennessee economist said Tuesday.
<P>    Bill Fox of the UT Center for Business and Economic Research offered the assessment as he explained the state&#39;s projected shortfall in revenue collections at a meeting of a UT-Knoxville advisory group.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Revenue growth in Tennessee does not really keep pace with the economy,&#39;&#39; Fox said. &#39;&#39;It is our particular choice of tax structures that has led to this result.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Fox said Tennessee&#39;s economy now has entered a mature phase when state revenues will grow less quickly than in the previous period of rapid expansion. 
<P>    &#39;&#39;Because we have a tax base that relies heavily on taxation of sales and consumption, revenues are going to grow at only about 85 to 90 percent of the economy at this point in the business cycle,&#39;&#39; Fox told the Chancellor&#39;s Associates.
<P>    Estimates of the state&#39;s revenue shortfalls range from $80 million during the current budget year, which ends June 30, to $300 million next fiscal year.
<P>
<P><h3>Names in the news</h3>

		<h3>English League goalies cash in on &#39;mistakes&#39;?</h3>
<P>
<P>     Premier League goalkeepers <B>Bruce Grobbelaar </B>and <B>Hans Segers </B>were handed huge sums of cash by a Far Eastern betting syndicate to make sure their teams lost games, a jury was told Tuesday at Winchester, England.
<P>    &#39;&#39;In front of 30,000 or 40,000 or 50,000 fans and a TV audience of millions a goalkeeper can&#39;t simply let the ball roll in between his legs,&#39;&#39; prosecutor <B>David Calvert Smith </B>said. &#39;&#39;However, goalkeepers do make mistakes sometimes and therefore it may be that the odd deliberate mistake may escape attention.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The prosecutor said Grobbelaar, goalkeeper on Zimbabwe&#39;s national team, was able to buy two Mercedes with the money he received.
<P>    &#39;&#39;He was embittered by the fact that Liverpool was not paying him enough, especially compared with other newer players, and he wanted to make as much as he could over the next couple of years,&#39;&#39; the prosecutor said.
<P>    Grobbelaar was earning $270,000 a year at Liverpool, he said.
<P>    Segers deposited two large sums of cash into a Swiss branch of an American bank during the 1993 and 1994 seasons, the prosecutor said.
<P>    Grobbelaar and Segers went on trial Tuesday along with Segers&#39; former Wimbledon teammate <B>John Fashanu </B>and Malaysian businessman <B>Heng Suan Lim.</B>
<P>    The four were accused of conspiracy to give or accept cash to rig the results of certain Premier League games between 1991 and 1994, in the biggest match-fixing scandal in English soccer in 32 years. The four have denied the charges.
<P>
<P><h3>Football</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>Todd Kirk</B>, an offensive lineman on Tennessee&#39;s 1985 SEC championship team, has accepted a job as offensive line coach at Presbyterian College in Clinton, S.C. New Presbyterian coach <B>Daryl Dickey</B>, also a former Vol, hired Kirk, who recently was offensive line coach at Tennessee-Martin.
<P>
<P><h3>Figure skating</h3>
<P>
<P>* Olympic champion <B>Oksana Baiul </B>was arrested in Bloomfield, Conn., on charges of drunken and reckless driving stemming from a car crash early Sunday. The 19-year-old Ukranian surrendered to police and was released without bond. No date was immediately set for her appearance in court. She apologized in a statement released after her arrest.
<P>
<P><h3>Golf</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>Arnold Palmer </B>will undergo surgery today for prostate cancer, the Mayo Clinic  in Rochester, Minn., has announced. Palmer, 67, who has been at the clinic for two days of tests, will remain in the hospital for several days and continue recovering as an outpatient.
<P>
<P><h3>Tennis</h3>
<P>
<P>* Prosecutors in Mannheim, Germany, sought a jail term of six years and nine months for <B>Peter Graf,</B> the father of <B>Steffi Graf,</B> charged with evading taxes on more than $26.5 million of his daughter&#39;s tennis earnings. Final defense arguments in his trial will start Friday. The verdict is expected Jan. 24.
<P>* <B>Ignacio Truyol </B>of Spain became the first tennis player to be suspended for drug use, testing positive for an anabolic steroid and a stimulant. Truyol, 23, who violated ATP Tour rules established in 1990, will be banned from all tournaments for one year. He will forfeit $39,985 in prize money and ranking points earned since July 1996.
<P>
<P><h3>Baseball</h3>
<P>
<P>* The Chicago White Sox, looking to shore up their starting rotation, signed Cy Young Award winning pitcher <B>Doug Drabek </B>to a one-year contract. The 34-year-old, 137-112 lifetime with a 3.41 ERA, spent the last four seasons with Houston.
<P>* <B>Ozzie Smith,</B> after a 19-year career at shortstop, is turning broadcaster. He will be host of &#39;&#39;This Week In Baseball,&#39;&#39; a weekly TV show of highlights produced by Major League Baseball.
<P>* Kansas City signed left-handed reliever <B>Mitch Williams </B>to a minor league contract and have invited him to spring training camp. Williams, 32, last year aborted a comeback attempt with Philadelphia.
<P>
<P><h3>Basketball</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>LeRon Williams,</B> who played for Florida the past two seasons, has registered for classes at South Carolina and will play for the Gamecocks next December. The 6-7 junior forward started 24 of 28 games last season and averaged 10 points and 4.8 rebounds.
<P>
<P><h3>Boxing</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>Sugar Ray Leonard,</B> whose charisma and virtuoso style endeared him to boxing fans, and flamboyant promoter <B>Don King,</B> often regarded as a ring rogue, will be enshrined into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Former light heavyweight champion <B>Jose Torres </B>was the other living honoree in the 1997 induction class of 13.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Tom Humphrey, News-Sentinel Nashville bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- All Tennessee children without medical insurance will be eligible for enrollment in TennCare on April 1 under a plan announced on Monday by Gov. Don Sundquist.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We could be the first state, and rightfully so, to have universal health care for children,&#39;&#39; said Sundquist.
<P>    The proposal requires approval by the state Legislature. Initial reaction from lawmakers Monday was highly favorable for the proposal, with criticism limited to concerns that TennCare is not made available to enough adults.
<P>    The Sundquist administration estimated that about 68,000 children will become eligible for enrollment in TennCare because of the policy change. They projected that about 75 percent of those eligible -- or 51,000 -- will be signed up and push total TennCare enrollment past 1.2 million again.
<P>    When that happens, the governor said about 95 percent of all Tennesseans will then be covered by insurance. The state had hit that level previously, but the coverage rate slipped to 94.2 percent last year.
<P>    The remaining 5 percent without coverage would amount to about 260,000 persons -- almost all adults.
<P>    Opening the door to persons under age 18 will cost the state about $20 million, Sundquist said. When federal matching money is added, the total new spending will be about $55 million, he said.
<P>    The governor said that state funding will be a priority in the budget for the coming year but that allowing adults to enroll as well &#39;&#39;would be beyond the money we have.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The administration is already looking at ways to cut about $300 million in state spending for the 1997-98 fiscal year because of a projected revenue shortfall.
<P>    TennCare replaced Medicaid as a system of providing health care to the poor on Jan. 1, 1994. Initially, the state&#39;s &#39;&#39;working poor&#39;&#39; -- who did not qualify for Medicaid but had no insurance otherwise -- were allowed to enroll as well, with premium payments based on income. Those with income below the federal poverty level pay no premiums.
<P>    Enrollment to such persons was closed on Jan. 1, 1995, and there has been considerable discussion over when to reopen it. Monday&#39;s move amounts to something of a compromise and was widely hailed.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Nobody is going to be against covering kids,&#39;&#39; said Tony Garr, executive director of the Tennessee Health Care Campaign. &#39;&#39;It is a wonderful movement to have universal access for kids. . . Hopefully, (uninsured) adults will someday have access, too.&#39;&#39;
<P>    There was also praise for the initiative among legislators attending a meeting of the TennCare Oversight Committee on Monday, even from lawmakers critical of remaining shortcomings in TennCare coverage. The committee meeting was called to discuss TennCare Partners, the problem-plagued program that last year expanded TennCare&#39;s umbrella to cover those suffering mental as well as physical illness. 
<P>    Sen. Robert Rochelle, D-Lebanon, said that opening access to children was &#39;&#39;appreciated and noteworthy.&#39;&#39; But he said the mental health program is now open only to persons on TennCare while a growing number of persons -- some of them in dire need of preventative mental health treatment -- are ineligible for TennCare.
<P>    &#39;&#39;They&#39;re the ones who are going to be shooting their spouse tomorrow. They&#39;re the ones who are going to be beating up on their kids tonight,&#39;&#39; he told the committee.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This golden goose is going to be killed unless we go a lot further in opening up enrollment,&#39;&#39; Rochelle said.
<P>    State Finance Commissioner John Ferguson said the opening of TennCare to all youngsters, with its accompanying infusion of funds, should help relieve financial problems of the behavioral health organizations, or BHOs, that have complained of inadequate state funding.
<P>    Sundquist said the new policy of allowing children to enroll is seen as a permanent change with no time limit.
<P>    The proposal was made with the support of federal Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) officials, who oversee such programs. 
<P>    &#39;&#39;This is great news for families who haven&#39;t been able to afford health insurance for their children,&#39;&#39; said HCFA Administrator Bruce C. Vladeck.

		<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> final autopsy report shows 12-year-old Donald Edward &#39;&#39;Dewayne&#39;&#39; Kesterson was shot in the head at close-range and another time -- fatally -- behind his left ear.
<P>   The autopsy report, made public Monday, also shows Kesterson was shot two more times from behind -- once in his left shoulder and again in his left arm.
<P>   And a final autopsy released earlier on his mother, 29-year-old Anita Gregg, shows she was shot three times. The fatal shot in the right side of her head caused multiple skull fractures, hemorrhaging and brain injury. Gregg also was shot in the left back of her neck and the back of her left wrist and hand.
<P>   Gregg and her son were shot and killed the evening of Nov. 7, 1996, the day they were moving back into the Nubbin Ridge Road home of her estranged husband, Gregory Gene Gregg, in an effort to save the marriage.
<P>   The shootings came a week after Anita Gregg obtained an order of protection against her husband of 16 months.
<P>   In her petition for the order, Anita Gregg alleged her husband previously had shot at her, shoved her and tried to strangle her.
<P>   Gregory Gregg, the son of Buddy Gregg who owns Buddy Gregg Motor Homes, has been charged with shooting his wife and stepson with a 9mm pistol.
<P>   The autopsy on Kesterson showed stippling, or powder tattooing, around the shot to the left top of his head, which indicates the gun was fired at close range, according to Knox County Medical Examiner Dr. Sandra Elkins.
<P>   The presence of stippling generally indicates a gun has been fired within 12 to 18 inches, Elkins said, although in some, but very few handguns, stippling will occur out to 24 inches.
<P>   The autopsy reported no stippling around the other gunshot wounds, but that doesn&#39;t mean they couldn&#39;t have been fired at close range because some of those had gone through clothing that could have filtered stippling, Elkins said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The stippling is always a significant finding because it indicates a wound is no longer considered to be caused from a distance,&#39;&#39; said Elkins. &#39;&#39;Someone has to be pretty much on top of them so you see that type of wound.&#39;&#39;
<P>   First-degree murder charges against Gregg are pending before a grand jury, according to John Gill, special counsel to Knox County District Attorney General Randy Nichols.
<P>   Gregg claimed he fired on the victims after they armed themselves, but in murder warrants the Knox County Sheriff&#39;s Department says physical evidence inside the house does not support Gregg&#39;s story.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The autopsy reports are by their nature graphic and speak for themselves as to the physical evidence,&#39;&#39; said Tom Dillard, Gregg&#39;s attorney. &#39;&#39;We are certainly reviewing the reports. It&#39;s early in the investigation.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Gregg remains in the Knox County Jail on a $1 million bond.

        <font size="5">A</font>nderson County officers caught two
        burglary suspects Monday, but a third eluded them on an
        all-terrain vehicle in rugged coal-mining country near
        Briceville. </p>
        <p>Charles R. ''Chuck'' Daugherty, 24, and Chris
        ''Skeeter Bill'' Moser, 19, were arrested after Anderson
        County Sheriff's Department Investigators Dale Brown and
        Jeff Peterson saw them in a vehicle on Slatestone Road,
        said sheriff's spokesman Mark Whaley. Officers from
        several agencies late Monday were looking for Johnnie
        Mack Wilson. Whaley said Wilson was on an ATV and hiding
        in north Anderson County mountains. </p>
        <p>''We've used a helicopter to try and spot him from the
        air,'' Whaley said. ''But there are miles and miles and
        miles of old mining roads he can get on.'' </p>
        <p>A fourth suspect, Deena Leinart, 22, of Halls, was
        arrested Saturday in Roane County. Officers say the four
        are believed to have committed burglaries in Roane,
        Meigs, Anderson, Morgan and Loudon counties. </p>
        <p>Officers from several agencies began searching for the
        three men after they were flushed from a Meigs County
        home when the owners returned. They are believed to have
        committed three earlier burglaries Saturday afternoon,
        two of them in Roane County. </p>
        <p>Meigs County Sheriff Walter Hickman said Steve Woodby
        and his wife returned to their home on state Highway 58
        late Saturday afternoon and saw three men run from the
        back of the building. Woodby gave chase across a field.
        His wife drove along the road to try to see what was
        going on and eventually returned home. </p>
        <p>''The girl (Leinart) had pulled into the driveway,''
        Hickman said. ''Mrs. Woodby blocked her in, and we caught
        her right there.'' </p>
        <p>He said Moser, Daugherty and Wilson fled into woods
        and officers could not find them by nightfall. Sunday
        morning a van owned by Shiloh Baptist Church was
        discovered stolen. It later was found parked along a road
        in Briceville. </p>
        <p>Hickman said the four are suspected of burglarizing
        another home. prior to the Woodby home burglary. </p>
        <p>In Roane County, Sheriff's Department Detective Linda
        Booth said the group is believed to have broken into
        residences on River Road and Grigsby Hollow Road. Loot
        taken from the four homes included video equipment,
        cameras, guns and jewelry, Booth said. She said most of
        it was recovered in Roane County. </p>
        <p>''They ditched it -- literally threw it into a ditch
        along Keylon Hollow Road,'' Booth said. ''They planned to
        pick it up later.'' </p>
        <p>Whaley said Brown and Peterson were patroling in the
        area when they saw a car they believed two of the
        suspects were in and began to follow it. </p>
        <p>''They (Moser and Daugherty) got suspicious and bailed
        out,'' Whaley said. ''They caught Daugherty first right
        along the road, but Moser got away on the steep
        terrain.'' </p>
        <p>In the melee, Peterson suffered a broken ankle that
        will require surgery, Whaley said. Brown injured his
        knee. Whaley said Moser surrendered to officers about
        three hours later along Slatestone Road. ''He had gotten
        a car,'' he said. ''He just drove up to the officers and
        said, 'I'm the one you're looking for.' '' </p>

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Richard Powelson, News-Sentinel Washington bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>ASHINGTON -- Sen. Bill Frist said he will spend much of his time this year working with fellow Budget Committee members on ways to balance the budget by 2002, and also to help pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget annually.
<P>   &#39;&#39;By just getting the deficit down to zero,&#39;&#39; he said, Americans could look forward to more jobs and lower interest rates on mortgages and loans.
<P>   The Tennessee Republican said he hopes President Clinton&#39;s 1998 budget proposal for Congress, which will become public next month, will contain suggestions and goals in all federal programs and not just appear to cut spending through &#39;&#39;smoke and mirrors.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Balanced budget planning is his top priority, Frist said.
<P>   As part of that goal, he said Congress must pass major Medicare reforms that will lower exploding cost increases. The reforms will take a couple of years to produce major savings, so they should be passed soon to avoid excessive change later, he said.
<P>   A former heart and lung transplant surgeon, Frist said he will push again this year for his bill to improve managed care. Currently, he said, physicians often are kept from the decision-making process on ways to lower costs, leading to ill-advised insurance policies such as the one that pushed many maternity patients out of hospital rooms after only one night&#39;s stay.
<P>   His bill would allow physicians to set up managed-care plans to compete with those administered by insurance companies. Insurance company plans sometimes are based primarily on lowest cost options and not on best-health options, he said.
<P>   Frist said the government should not &#39;&#39;micromanage&#39;&#39; health insurance plans, and his backing last year to allow 48 hours of hospital coverage for maternity patients -- rather than just one day -- was a one-time regulation for him. Future complaints about quality of care should be addressed in comprehensive health-care reforms, he said.
<P>   The Senate this year may consider legislation to bar insurance companies from insisting that mastectomies for breast cancer patients be done on an outpatient basis with no overnight hospital stay. Frist has not supported the bill so far, he said, and would prefer the Senate work on broad, long-term solutions.
<P>   Another problem has been insurance companies that bar physicians from telling patients about certain expensive procedures that would remedy their problems.
<P>   Many of these quality care concerns could be eliminated if physicians were more involved in setting policies, Frist said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I want to give physicians a seat at the table&#39;&#39; where health-care plans are designed and administered, he said.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- As legislators set the stage for today&#39;s opening of the 100th Tennessee General Assembly, activities ranged from a final fling at political fund-raising to formation of a new committee to concentrate on children.
<P>    House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh and Lt. Gov. John Wilder, speaker of the Senate, are scheduled to pound the session-opening gavels at noon. Their formal election to new terms in their posts will follow shortly afterwards.
<P>    Lawmakers plan to devote this week to organizational activities and filing of bills, then recess until Feb. 3. Gov. Don Sundquist&#39;s state budget will be presented then, complete with his plans for coping with revenue shortfalls of $100 million in the current year and $300 million in the 1997-98 fiscal year that begins July 1.
<P>    Since a 1995 state law forbids legislators from accepting political contributions during a legislative session, both Democratic and Republican legislative caucuses held fund-raisers Monday night.
<P>    Republicans centered their fund-raising festivities at the governor&#39;s residence while Democrats gathered at a hotel near the Legislative Plaza.
<P>    Naifeh announced Monday that a 12th House committee is being created for the session. It will be known as the Children and Family Affairs Committee.
<P>    Juvenile crime will be one focus of the panel, Naifeh said, noting commitments of youngsters to state custody for crimes has risen by 73 percent in Tennessee since 1990. Sundquist has announced he will introduce a package of legislation dealing with juvenile crime this year.
<P>    Naifeh said his move will &#39;&#39;work hand in glove with what the governor is proposing.&#39;&#39; Neither the governor nor legislators have unveiled specifics of legislation to combat juvenile crime.
<P>    &#39;&#39;What has caused our young people to lose respect for our laws?&#39;&#39; Naifeh asked. &#39;&#39;This is an area that needs specific attention and the Children and Family Affairs Committee will do just that.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The House already had 11 standing or permanent committees, which Naifeh said is a small number compared to many other states. He said, for example, that Mississippi has 34, Missouri 43.
<P>    The new committee will not require additional staff, he said. Much of the legislation it will handle -- domestic violence, adoption, divorce and child custody matters -- is now handled by the Judiciary Committee.
<P>    The Judiciary Committee typically handles about 800 bills per year and often needs longer to wrap up its work than other committees.
<P>    Naifeh and Wilder both have indicated they will assign legislators as members on their various committees Thursday. Naifeh declined to say who will chair the new panel until then.
<P>    In the Senate, little change in committee chairmanships is expected this year since most top-ranking senators were re-elected. Some top posts in House committees, however, are vacant and there has been considerable private jockeying for the prestigious positions.
<P>    Traditionally, only Democrats have been named to leadership positions in the House. House Republican Leader Steve McDaniel said he had asked Naifeh to change that policy this year, but acknowledged he is not optimistic the Democratic speaker will do so.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Don Jacobs, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> Knoxville police sergeant had no other choice when he fatally shot a man charging with a butcher knife, according to the dead man&#39;s sister.
<P>   Another Knoxville Police Department officer who witnessed the shooting said he thought the Oct. 10, 1996, slaying of Michael Christopher Painter, 29, was an example of &#39;&#39;suicide by police officer.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Statements from witnesses and family members included in the Internal Affairs report compiled by KPD showed Sgt. Randy Carman acted properly when he killed Painter.
<P>   &#39;&#39;He pointed at the relatives and friends with the knife in a threatening gesture and asked the officers if he was going to have to hurt one of the group in order to get the officers to shoot him,&#39;&#39; the internal probe states.
<P>   The 12:03 p.m. death of Painter ended a 30-minute standoff at his Reagan Avenue residence. During the standoff the 6-foot, 1-inch tall, 415-pound Painter had wielded a butcher knife with a 12-inch blade.
<P>   Before officers arrived Painter had flattened tires on his car, used cinderblocks to smash windows on his brother&#39;s car and used his bare hands to bend over double a car steering wheel.
<P>   Painter, who had undergone mental counseling in the past but refused to take prescribed medication, had begun terrorizing friends and relatives the night before, records show. He had tried three times in 1996 to commit suicide, family members told police.
<P>   When officers arrived at the West Knoxville residence, they found Painter sitting on a concrete picnic table in the front yard holding the knife. Officers&#39; questions about how they could help Painter were answered by, &#39;&#39;You&#39;re going to have to kill me,&#39;&#39; the officers stated.
<P>   Painter told the officers several times, &#39;&#39;I want to die,&#39;&#39; the probe states.
<P>   Officer John Shelton armed himself with a 12-gauge shotgun because he feared a handgun would not stop Painter because of the man&#39;s bulk. &#39;&#39;I was remembering the training film I saw while in the academy on how fast a subject with a knife could charge you and kill you before the officer can react and fire his weapon,&#39;&#39; Shelton told officials.
<P>   Brandi Corbin, 21, of Sutherland Avenue, who was a longtime friend of Painter&#39;s, tried to talk the man into putting down the knife.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve seen him mad, but not this mad,&#39;&#39; Corbin told officers. &#39;&#39;He would have killed us if he&#39;d got us. I just know the cop had to do it or somebody else was gonna get hurt.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Painter&#39;s sister, Kathyn Sue Lamons, 42, of Yarnell Road called police about her brother&#39;s actions that day. She had tried to wrest the knife from Painter but couldn&#39;t because of his size.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The policemen were being very kind,&#39;&#39; Lamons said of her brother&#39;s death. &#39;&#39;They was trying to talk to him. He was just bent on not living anymore.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Painter was within four feet of Carman when the officer fired into the man&#39;s head, witnesses said. Carman was the only thing between Painter and a group of his friends and relatives as he advanced with the knife raised.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We had backed up about as far as we could go,&#39;&#39; Carman said of the fatal shot.

		</basefont><h3>Lockheed Martin reveals second layoff phase plan</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   OAK RIDGE -- Lockheed Martin, the Department of Energy&#39;s chief contractor in Oak Ridge, outlined Monday the second phase of layoffs to deal with federal budget reductions in 1997.
<P>    Another 250 to 300 Lockheed Martin workers will get their pink slips beginning Jan. 29 and must leave the payroll two months later.
<P>    In November, DOE said that about 1,680 Oak Ridge employees would lose their jobs over the next year as a result of the downsizing program.
<P>    Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, which manages DOE&#39;s Y-12 and K-25 plants, earlier handed out 439 layoff notices to workers, and most of those will leave the payroll at the end of January.
<P>   Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corp., which manages Oak Ridge National Laboratory, announced plans to lay off about 170.
<P>    Marty Goolsby, a company spokeswoman, said most layoffs in the latest phase at Energy Systems will come from the environmental management programs.
<P>

<P><h3>Man escapes from bank with cash in pillowcase</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   OAK RIDGE -- A man armed with a small pistol robbed the Oak Ridge office of Home Federal Bank on Monday morning, according to the FBI.
<P>   After stuffing an undetermined amount of cash into a pillowcase he brought with him, the man fled in a maroon Chrysler LeBaron with a half-vinyl top, said Virgil Young, special agent in charge of the FBI&#39;s Knoxville office.
<P>   The robbery of the Oak Ridge Turnpike bank occurred about 9:50 a.m.
<P>   The man was described as 5-feet-6 to 5-feet-9-inches tall, weighing 150 to 175 pounds, with brown eyes and medium length brown hair and wearing jeans and a long-sleeved, brown checkered shirt. He also had several days growth of beard and a moustache. Young said the man was dirty and spoke with a country accent.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Campbell County man ID&#39;d as fatal fire victim</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   CARYVILLE -- Authorities have ruled out foul play in the death of a 43-year-old Campbell County man killed in a house fire on Sunday.
<P>   The victim was identified as Ronnie A. Lawson by Campbell County Sheriff&#39;s Department Detective Scott Smith. An autopsy on Monday determined Lawson died from smoke inhalation, Smith said.
<P>   The victim&#39;s body was found Sunday in the charred remains of his house on Lawson Lane, officials said.
<P>   A Sheriff&#39;s Department report indicated the fire was reported at 12:25 p.m.
<P>   Smith said a witness reported seeing flames coming from the house, which had no electricity, as early as 6 a.m.
<P>   An investigation to determine the fire&#39;s cause is continuing.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Mayor appoints Adcock to administrative post</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   Ellen Adcock has been appointed director of administration for the city of Knoxville.
<P>   Mayor Victor Ashe announced the appointment Monday.
<P>   Adcock&#39;s duties will include coordinating special projects &#39;&#39;that cross traditional city department lines&#39;&#39; and helping assure city services &#39;&#39;are delivered in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible,&#39;&#39; Ashe said.
<P>   Adcock currently serves on the Civil Service Merit Board, from which she will resign effective Jan. 26. Ashe likely will nominate someone to City Council to replace her on the board within a couple of weeks, city spokesman Charlie Barker said.
<P>    Adcock has worked for the state for 18 years. Currently, she is director of special projects for Lakeshore Mental Health Institute. She has been active in several community organizations and activities for several years and is a past president of the West View Community Action Group.
<P>   She replaces Susan Edwards, who left the city to take a position with KUB.

<P><h3>Knife-wielding suspect attacks Knoxville clerk 
<P>
<P>
<P>   A convenience store clerk told police he was accosted early Sunday by a man who came into the South Knoxville market, inquired about the weather and then brandished a butcher knife.
<P>   The 33-year-old clerk told Knoxville Police Department Patrol Officer Darrell Johnson he fended off the knife-wielding suspect with an ax handle during the 12:20 a.m. incident at the Kenjo Market, 3600 Sevier Ave., according to a police report.
<P>   The clerk claimed the suspect walked into the store and &#39;&#39;stated, &#39;Why did you let it get so cold?&#39; &#39;&#39; At that moment, the suspect pulled a butcher knife and reached for the clerk, the report stated.
<P>   According to the report, the clerk &#39;&#39;pulled away, grabbed an ax handle and chased the suspect from the store.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The suspect was described as a white male between 28 and 30 years old with brown hair and brown eyes. He was 6-feet, 1-inch-tall, weighing 150 pounds and wearing an old blue-and-gray South Young High School jacket and a dark blue hat.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Lois Reagan Thomas, N-S executive business editor</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT>or years, the focus on tourism in Knox County has been that we need to attract more conventions, and to do that we need better convention facilities.
<P>   The operative mentality seems to be that there&#39;s little to draw tourists to Knoxville as a destination -- except on Saturdays during football season, or perhaps in April during the Dogwood Arts Festival.
<P>   Think about it. If you were a tourist, what would draw you to Knoxville to stay? If you were here, you might visit the historical sites around, such as Blount Mansion and James White Fort, but would you come here just for that? Or to look at the Sunsphere? Or shop and eat in the Old City? Or visit the Knoxville Zoo?
<P>   The city lost its bragging rights years ago as the gateway to the Great Smokies, when tourists were able to bypass it on the interstate. Probably the last time a major move was made to market the city as a destination site was during the 1982 World&#39;s Fair.
<P>   Now, under new leadership, the Knoxville Convention and Visitors Bureau is embarking on a campaign to entice tourists to come to Knoxville for a vacation. Not that it&#39;s giving up on the conventions, stresses Mike Wilds, new executive director of the bureau. It&#39;s just that he sees a &#39;&#39;virtual smorgasbord&#39;&#39; of attractions that can lure tourists to stay in Knoxville&#39;s hotels and motels and eat and shop here.
<P>   The bureau recently commissioned The Tombras Group to develop a marketing plan for the city -- the first ad agency so commissioned in 15 years, according to Wilds. Focus groups of civic and business leaders have provided input. The state has promised participation in as much as $100,000 in cooperative advertising.
<P>   The strategy this time is not insularity, but rather to draw upon the resources of the whole region. Wilds says the idea is not to compete with the surrounding markets but to complement and capitalize on them.
<P>   If you look at what Knoxville can offer visitors within an hour&#39;s drive, you come up with that &#39;&#39;virtual smorgasbord,&#39;&#39; says Wilds. You get not only the Smokies and all its attrations, but also the Big South Fork National Recreation Area, Cumberland Gap National Park, whitewater rafting in a variety of locations, lots of lakes, a bunch of historial sites, and museums such as Knoxville Museum of Art, Sequoyah Museum, Museum of Appalachia and the Museum of Atomic Energy -- not to mention that ineffable friendliness and quality of life that Knoxville is so well-known for.
<P>   Also being proposed is partnering with Knoxville&#39;s Resource Valley, the Greater Knoxville Chamber of Commerce and Knoxville Airport Authority in efforts, such as &#39;&#39;strategic conferencing&#39;&#39; to draw people to Knoxville. In &#39;&#39;strategic conferencing,&#39;&#39; you, for example, go after meetings related to industries identified as driving economic development efforts.
<P>   Wilds also sees cooperating with other regional tourism groups such as Smoky Mountain Visitors Bureau in Blount County, and eventually perhaps with Chattanooga, Tri-Cities, and those in Sevier County in marketing the region.
<P>   Does this mean that the bureau is giving up on getting a new convention center?
<P>   &#39;&#39;Our job is to sell what we&#39;ve got, and if the citizens and leaders come to realize we need a new convention center, then we&#39;ll fill that too,&#39;&#39; said Wilds.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   A few weeks ago, it seemed that everybody was agreeing that it would be a good idea to study how to better coordinate the various economic development groups in Knox County. Now it seems that not everybody agrees how to go about it.
<P>   Knox County Commission in December unanimously voted to ask County Executive Tommy Schumpert to name a five-member task force to evaluate the agencies&#39; effectiveness, and encouraged City Council to do the same.
<P>    Well, City Council members didn&#39;t go along with the idea. Seems their view is that an outside task force would take too long to get up to speed, and that the evaluation could be better handled from the city&#39;s end by the mayor, appropriate city directors and representatives of the agencies involved.
<P>   At Monday&#39;s County Commission agenda meeting, it was generally agreed that the county will proceed with its task force, appointing 10 people instead of five in order to have more diversity. So stay tuned.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Jerry Dean, News-Sentinel business writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<P>
<P>   Foreclosures on conventional mortgages in Tennessee during 1995 reached their lowest levels in a decade, according to data in a December report compiled by PMI, a Fairfax, Va. mortgage insurance firm.
<P>   PMI also said Knoxville&#39;s metropolitan area competed well with comparably sized cities in other regions for housing affordability, based on the ratio of regional median income to home prices. 
<P>   Statistics compiled by 25-year-old PMI and based on the latest complete data available, showed that Tennessee single-family mortgage activity had subsided from a decade-high 1993 level of $21.78 billion to $12.1 billion in 1995. That was still more than the $3.94 billion to $7.76 billion levels common in the state during the late 1980s. Declines from the 1993 peak were common in most states in 1994 and 1995, PMI reported.
<P>   Foreclosures in 1995 occurred on 0.2 percent of Tennessee conventional mortgages. The level nationwide was 0.65 percent. VA mortgage foreclosures flirted with the one percent mark, where it has been in Tennessee since 1990. That was below the national level of 1.27 percent. 
<P>   In New Jersey, VA loan foreclosures reached 3.45 percent -- highest among the states and third highest annual level in the decade.
<P>   Among FHA foreclosures, Tennessee&#39;s 1995 level of 0.95 percent was well below the 1.4 percent national average. New Jersey and Maine led all states in that foreclosure category with rates of 3.75 and 3.6 percent respectively.
<P>    Average FHA foreclosure rate among 17 Southern states was 1.18 percent, lower than rates for the Northeast, Midwest or Western states.
<P>   PMI, the National Associations of Realtors and Home Builders reported 1995 sales of 667,000 new homes and 3.8 million existing homes. The new homes mark was second highest in seven years. Sales of existing homes exceeded any year of the decade except 1995.
<P>    NAHB projected 3,802,000 sales of existing homes in 1995, about the 1993 level and below the 3.95 million in 1995.
<P>   Austin, Texas, led the nation&#39;s most active housing markets.
<P>    Atlanta, Ga., was 16th; Louisville, Ky., 22nd; Nashville, 35th; Memphis, 57th; and Knoxville, 69th in affordability rates.
<P>   Barney Thompson, executive vice president of the Knoxville Association of Realtors, said late-year residential sale closings should send Knox County&#39;s single-family home sales beyond the 7,000 mark, making 1996 a banner year, even after a seasonal autumn lag.
<P>   Single-family home sales here remain healthy, Thompson said, because Knoxville, since 1983, has had steady growth that averts a devastating &#39;&#39;boom or bust&#39;&#39; economy.
<P>    Thompson said Richard Scarbrough, 1997 KAR president succeeding James R. Lee, will report more specific home sales totals at a Friday KAR installation banquet.
<P>   PMI and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation reported that the 7.03 percent average mortgage finance rate in January 1996 was the lowest for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages since the early 1970s.
<P>    Rates climbed from 8.87 percent in 1976 and 11.2 percent in 1979 to peak at 16.63 percent in 1981.
<P>     The 30-year rate nationwide average declined to 10.13 percent in 1990, 8.38 in 1994 and 7.93 in 1995. Meanwhile, one-year adjustable rate mortgages, which averaged 11.5 percent in 1984, reached an all-time low of 5.3 percent in February 1996.
<P>   Jim Ewing, Tennessee Valley Home Builders Association executive vice president, said final 1996 totals will show numbers of Knox County building permits for single-family homes will exceed 1995&#39;s 2,794 by 20 to 25 percent.
<P>   Thus, 1996 will become the 13th consecutive year in which the number of residential permits issued countywide has increased.

		<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he board of directors of The New Cherokee Corp., a textile manufacturer with a 600-employee mill in Sevierville, has agreed to sell the company to competitor Dan River Inc.
<P>   Privately held Dan River will pay $65 million for New Cherokee, and the sale is expected to close in early February, said John Lambert, a spokesman for Dan River Inc.
<P>   New Cherokee, Sevier County&#39;s largest manufacturing employer, is an employee-owned company, and the sale is contingent on a shareholders&#39; approval. A special meeting has tentatively been scheduled for Feb. 3. The ESOP was developed about seven years ago, and shares are distributed to employees based on a formula in which years of service play a large role, said a New Cherokee spokesman. The company is still working to ascertain the purchase price on a per share basis, he said.
<P>   New Cherokee, which merged in 1989 with Spindale Mills Inc. of North Carolina, is a manufacturer of woven products for shirts and sportswear. It has about 600 employees in Rutherford County, N.C., where it&#39;s headquartered, in addition to those in Sevierville. Annual sales total about $50 million. The company traces its roots to the Cherokee Textile Mills, which were founded in 1916 in Knoxville.
<P>   Dan River is a major producer of woven fancy yarn-dyed fabrics and piece-dyed frabrics of cotton, man-made fibers and blends. Most of its 4,700 workers are employed in Danville, Va., where the company is based.
<P>   Lambert was noncommittal about whether New Cherokee plants would remain open after the sale. &#39;&#39;Anytime any two companies come together management must evaluate operations,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Dan River will be conducting an evaluation to identify ways to maximize production efficiencies and improve our ability to serve customers.&#39;&#39;
<P>
<P>   Joseph Lanier Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Dan River, said the combined operations would make Dan River the leading producer of lightweight yarn-dyed woven fabrics in the western hemisphere.
<P>   Lanier, formerly chairman of WestPoint Pepperell, led a group that purchased in Dan River in 1990.

<P>   NationsBank Corp. said fourth-quarter earnings rose 24 percent to $632 million, or $2.19 a share, from the same period last year, but Chief Financial Officer James Hance told analysts that 1997 earnings will be lower than previously predicted as a result of its $9.78 billion acquisition of Boatmen&#39;s Bancshares Inc.
<P>   The bank is merging the two units faster than anticipated, resulting in higher-than-expected costs and savings.
<P>   Still, NationsBank expects to meet or exceed net income goals it set last August when it announced the acquisition, bank spokeswoman Susan Carr said. At that time, the bank estimated 1997 cash earnings would exceed $3.3 billion while net income would reach $2.94 billion.

He previously was a consultant, research assistant and teaching assistant at the Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado, from 1981 to 1986. He is a native of Mineola, New York.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Bill Luther, News-Sentinel sportswriter</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<P>    Winners only!
<P>    It&#39;s the new format for The Winston Select all-star race scheduled May 17 at Charlotte Motor Speedway.
<P>    The top five finishers in the Winston Open preliminary event have qualified in the past. Now only the winner advances to the $1 million race sponsored by R.J. Reynolds.
<P>    As in the past The Winston will consist of a minimum 20-car field and is open to several groups of winners.
<P>    Effective with the Daytona 500 on Feb. 16, the 1997 season the following will be eligible:
<P>
<P>   * Drivers and car owners who have won races in the preceding and current years.
<P>    * Any active driver who has won the Winston Cup championship.
<P>    * Any active driver who has won The Winston within the preceding five years.
<P>    * The winner of the Winston Open.
<P>    * If 20 drivers are not eligible winners from previous seasons still active on the Cup circuit become eligible. All active drivers during the season become eligible, even if the field exceeds 20 competitors.
<P>    The elgibility requirements are the only changes for The Winston, which consists of two 30-lap segments and a closing 10-lap shootout.
<P>    Going into the season 14 drivers were guaranteed starting berths for posting Winston Cup wins: Terry Labonte, Jeff Gordon, Dale Jarrett, Dale Earnhardt, Ricky Rudd, Rusty Wallace, Sterling Marlin, Bobby Hamilton, Ernie Irvan, Bobby Labonte and Geoff Bodine.
<P>    Darrell Waltrip, Bill Elliott and Michael Waltrip are eligible for having won the Winston Select.
<P>    Mark Martin, Kyle Petty and Ward Burton (1995), Jimmy Spencer (1994) and Morgan Shepherd (1993) are winners from previous seasons and could get a berth based on those victories.
<P>    Michael Waltrip won the 1996 Winston Select.
<P>    If the Select winner captures the pole position and each of the three segments the purse will be $325,000 for 105 miles of racing. Earnhardt and the late Davey Allison are the only drivers to have made a sweep.
<P>
<P>    <B>IROC FOURSOME:</B> Defending champion Mark Martin, Terry Labonte, Jeff Gordon and Dale Jarrett have accepted invitations to participate in the four-race International Race of Champions series.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Being invited is a big deal for me,&#39;&#39; said Martin, who will be making his sixth appearance. &#39;&#39;Winning the IROC title in 1994 was a real highlight of my career. To win again last year was important to me to prove it wasn&#39;t a fluke.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Labonte and Gordon gave team owner Rick Hendrick back-to-back Winston Cup championships. Labonte won the title by 37 points. Four victories were a huge part of Jarrett taking third place in points.
<P>    Labonte was the 1989 IROC champion and will be remembered for substituting for Dave Allison in the final race ofthe 1993 series to clinch the title for Allison.
<P>    Another group of four drivers will be announced next week.
<P>    The series opens at Daytona on Feb. 14. Later events are scheduled May 16 at Charlotte, June 21 at the new California Speedway in Fontana, and July 23 at Michigan Speedway.
<P>
<P>    <B>RECORD?:</B> Cup driver Brett Bodine is among six comprising a $60 million Close Call program sponsored by Catalyst and Frontier Communications. Others are NHRA top fuel champ Jim Head, John Myers and Angelle Seeling of the NHRA pro stock motorcycle division, Mark Tate in Unlimited Hydroplane and Toby Robertson in late model stock car racing.
<P>    Close Call, a prepaid telephone card that features a scratch and win section, will be offered at retail outlets across the country. It also involves a sweepstakes. A cardholder can tell immediately if the card is a winner. There are 16 grand prizes, each including $250,000 and a new car.

		<h3>Ex-Braves announcer Mann dies of cancer</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>    <B>Marshall Mann</B> found out he had lung and kidney cancer just a month after retiring as the Atlanta Braves&#39; public-address announcer last fall.
<P>    Mann died Sunday night in Griffin, Ga. He was 63.
<P>    &#39;&#39;All of us at the Braves will miss Marshall greatly,&#39;&#39; team president <B>Stan Kasten</B> said Monday. &#39;&#39;We all enjoyed and appreciated every game he ever worked over his 30 years with the team. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Mann had decided some time ago that he would retire before the Braves changed homes, moving from Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium to a new stadium across the street for the 1997 season.
<P>    He had wanted to remember baseball the way it was for the 30 seasons his booming voice introduced starting lineups at all Braves home games.
<P>    In October, following Atlanta&#39;s Game 5 loss to the New York Yankees in the World Series, he stepped down.
<P>   In other sports-related deaths:
<P>
<P>* <B>Carol Habben</B>, a former player in the women&#39;s professional baseball league in the early 1950s, has died in Ridgewood, N.J., following a lengthy illness. She was 63.
<P>* <B>Jackie McCoy</B>, a longtime boxing manager and trainer who helped develope five world champions, including lightweight <B>Mando Ramos</B>, died Monday in California after a long battle with cancer. McCoy was 73.
<P>
<P><h3>Outdoors</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>Sen. Larry Craig</B> wants the chief of the Forest Service to explain why auto racing legend <B>Bobby Unser</B> is being prosecuted for snowmobiling in a protected wilderness area. Unser, lost for two days in a blizzard last month, said he&#39;s unsure, but he might have strayed a quarter-mile or half-mile into Colorado&#39;s South San Juan Wilderness while snowmobiling with a friend. The two nearly died after their snowmobile broke down in the national forest.
<P>
<P><h3>College football</h3>
<P>
<P>* Virginia Military Institute selected North Carolina State offensive coordinator <B>Ted Cain</B> to replace <B>Bill Stewart</B>, who resigned as head football coach on Dec. 12 after being accused of directing a racial slur at a player.
<P>
<P><h3>Colleges</h3>
<P>
<P>* An Ohio Valley Conference committee will study the league&#39;s uncertain football future as league members Austin Peay and Morehead State have dropped football scholarships and Middle Tennessee State prepares to move up to Division I in 1999.
<P>
<P><h3>Baseball</h3>
<P>
<P>* General Motors Corp. will drop its complaint against Cincinnati Reds owner <B>Marge Schott</B> if she goes through with a planned sale of her Chevrolet-Geo dealership, a GM lawyer told a state hearing examiner.
<P>* The San Diego Padres have acquired negotiating rights to <B>Hideki Irabu</B>, who is described as the <B>Nolan Ryan</B> of Japan. The 27-year-old power pitcher went 12-6 with a league-low 2.40 earned run average last season with the Chiba Lotte Marines. The New York Daily News reported that an agent is seeking $6 million a year for Irabu.
<P>* Baltimore signed former UT shortstop <B>Augie Ojeda</B> to a minor-league contract.
<P>
<P><h3>Figure skating</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>Oksana Baiul</B> was driving under the influence when she ran her Mercedes off a road while returning home from a night out in Hartford, Conn., a hospital report shows. Baiul, who at 19 is two years under the legal drinking age in Connecticut, had a blood-alcohol level of .168 percent after the accident early Sunday morning. Baiul had a cut to her scalp that required 12 stitches, while passenger Ararat Zakarian, 30, a fellow Ukrainian skater living in New York City, had a broken finger.
<P>
<P><h3>Tennis</h3>
<P>
<P>* City tennis director <B>Patsy Stair</B> has been selected to the nine-state Southern Tennis Association public relations committee. Stair is vice president and on the boards of the Tennessee Tennis Assocation and the Greater Knoxville Tennis Association.
<P>
<P><h3>Boxing</h3>
<P>
<P>* The bout between <B>Sugar Ray Leonard </B>and <B>Hector Camacho </B>has been rescheduled from Feb. 28 to March 1, but it will remain in Atlantic City, N.J. One other change: wrestling promoter <B>Vince McMahon </B>will supervise the pay-per-view.
<P>
<P><h3>Golf</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>Arnold Palmer </B>remained hopeful about his chances of beating prostate cancer after receiving encouraging test results at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. It was unclear how long Palmer, 67, would remain at the medical center for more tests.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Richard Powelson, News-Sentinel Washington bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>ASHINGTON -- Three of Tennessee&#39;s winners in last November&#39;s U.S. House elections greatly expanded their use of taxpayer-paid mass mailings, new postal records show.
<P>    Two of the incumbents more than doubled their 1995 level of mailings.
<P>    Reps. John J. Duncan Jr. of Knoxville, Van Hilleary of Grandview and Bart Gordon of Murfreesboro said there was nothing political about their decision to boost their taxpayer-paid mass mailings last election year. Republican Duncan and Democrat Gordon more than doubled their mailings to roughly 600,000 each, costing taxpayers $70,000 for Duncan&#39;s and $94,000 for Gordon&#39;s.
<P>    Duncan&#39;s and Gordon&#39;s 1996 challengers and the National Taxpayers Union, a national group promoting budget cuts, were critical of the mail-subsidy perk.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It seems to be a relatively routine practice for many members to increase the number and the expenditures on mass mailings in election years,&#39;&#39; said NTU spokesman Pete Sepp. &#39;&#39;A well-written mass mailing can give a tremendous boost to an incumbent.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Both of Tennessee&#39;s reform-minded senators, Republicans Fred Thompson and Bill Frist, began their terms two years ago by deciding against the expense of blanketing the state with unsolicited mail.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It works pretty well&#39;&#39; without the mass mailings, Frist aide Keith Still said. Still said Frist gets out his views on issues by writing to those inquiring, weekly columns and press releases faxed to state media and by making himself available to news outlets wherever he goes.
<P>    Thompson aide Alex Pratt said they use similar methods.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve been successful without it,&#39;&#39; Pratt said of the mass mailings of newsletters and meeting notices that other members use.
<P>    Last year Duncan increased his use of mass mailings throughout his district to 586,000, compared to 290,000 in 1995, according to U.S. Postal Service records.
<P>    The mass mailings cost taxpayers $70,000, not counting expenses for paper, printing and staff time preparing the publications. That cost is in addition to the $24,000 postage expense for answering constituents&#39; mail.
<P>    Gordon, the House delegation&#39;s most frequent mailer who was expecting a tough re-election battle last year, boosted his mass mailings to 621,000 last year compared to 310,000 in 1995. His postage bill last year: $94,000 for mass mailings, $23,000 for other mailings.
<P>    Hilleary had a big increase, too. His mailings shot up to 583,000 from 334,000 in 1995, costing $78,000 for the blanket mailings and $9,000 for other postage.
<P>    Postage rates for such mailings vary, usually from 11 to 15 cents each, depending on whether expedited delivery is requested and if presorting is done, postal official Thomas Dale Jr. said.
<P>    Republican Steve Gill, a Brentwood lawyer who challenged Gordon the last two elections, said the taxpayer-paid mailings are an unfair perk.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The problem for the public is that the guys who have the chance to vote on whether to ban mass mailings in an election year are the guys who benefit from sending mass mailings in an election year. Think of what it would save&#39;&#39; if the practice were banned for all members of Congress, Gill said.
<P>    Democrat Stephen Smith, a veterinarian who opposed Duncan last year, agreed.
<P>   &#39;&#39;This is one of many advantages of incumbency. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a wise use of taxpayers&#39; money.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The $70,000 that taxpayers paid for Duncan&#39;s mass mailings last year through Oct. 31 was about $20,000 more than Smith&#39;s entire campaign budget. Overall, Duncan&#39;s campaign raised and spent about five times what Smith did.
<P>    Rep. Zach Wamp, a Chattanooga Republican, blanketed his district&#39;s households in 1995 with newsletters, but not last year.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The 1995 mass mailing was not as effective as we&#39;d hoped&#39;&#39; in making recipients aware of what Wamp and Congress were doing, Wamp aide Dick Kopper said. So, Wamp has been trying other communications methods: radio interviews, computer hook-ups, speeches and various public events.
<P>    Duncan said people have told him they like his mailings.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I do think that they are legitimate if they are done in the way that I do them,&#39;&#39; Duncan said. It comes out to just a few pennies per constituent for each one of those mailings that I do.
<P>    &#39;&#39;My newsletters have not just been puff pieces. I have tried to inform my constituents about what is going on in the House . . . votes that I have cast . . . where I stand on particular issues.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The National Taxpayers Union annually praises Duncan and a few other members as the top budget-cutters. Duncan said he appreciates NTU&#39;s work, but disagrees with its leaders over mass mailings.
<P>    Hilleary said he has the largest land area of any House member and believes that newsletters are a necessity to get out his views.
<P>    Like Duncan, he said he gets positive feedback from readers of his newsletters. &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a whole lot of political advantage&#39;&#39; from the taxpayer-subsidized mailings, Hilleary said, because House rules ban them within 90 days of an election, and he does not believe that most voters focus on their candidate choices until three weeks before election day.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Marti Davis, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT>IGEON FORGE -- Mayor Ralph Chance opened the sixth annual Wilderness Wildlife Week of Nature this past weekend by presenting the Friends of the Smokies with a $16,000 check from the city.
<P>    The donation brings to $30,000 the total cash donation the city has given to benefit the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the last two years.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s time for us to start paying back and helping the park,&#39;&#39; Chance said.
<P>    Karen Wade, superintendent of the park, said the park will benefit from about $1 million in donations this year -- half from the Friends and the other half from the Great Smoky Mountains Natural History Association, which donates proceeds from book sales inside park visitor centers.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Last year was the survival course -- we survived,&#39;&#39; Wade told a large audience during Saturday night&#39;s opening ceremony for Wildlife Week at the Heartlander Country Resort.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This year we can get to do some of the things we&#39;ve been hoping to do,&#39;&#39; she added. The most major item on that list is a new science research laboratory at the Twin Creeks Natural Resource Center in Gatlinburg.
<P>    Park rangers and retired park personnel are among the many volunteers who are helping this week to put on what has become one of the area&#39;s most major park-related events. The week includes 88 expert speakers on a wide variety of topics, ranging from bird calls to Appalachian homesteading. All events are free and take place at or originate from the Heartlander.
<P>    While the snowy and cold weather has forced some hikes to be rerouted, it hasn&#39;t seemed to discourage any of the event&#39;s early participants.
<P>    Richard Haiman, a Florida man who paid to repair the Alum Cave Bluff Trail in the Smokies last year, traveled from Orlando for Wilderness Wildlife Week.
<P>    Sylvester Kiger and Cathy Lowe drove from Lexington, Ky., through blizzard conditions Friday to get to the event.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We wondered if we were the last car on the road from Lexington,&#39;&#39; said Lowe, who said the beauty of the snow-frosted park was more than worth the harrowing road trip.

        <p><font size="2"><i>By Gina Stafford, News-Sentinel
        staff writer</i></font></p>
        <p><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>he order was unusual: Turn a
        mountain range into a license plate, and one that would
        sell. </p>
        <p>But -- with the Great Smoky Mountains National Park
        serving as both inspiration and beneficiary of the
        project -- graphic designer Chuck Morris happily tackled
        the task for free. </p>
        <p>Morris, along with fellow designer Steve Simpson and
        their colleagues at Knoxville's Renaissance
        Communications Group, provided artwork for the new
        Tennessee tag expected to make its public debut in April.
        </p>
        <p>''It's not a real easy medium to work in, but I think
        I was more excited about it than any other project I've
        done because it was so unique,'' Morris said. </p>
        <p>''It was also a little hard reconciling the two big
        considerations -- that it's an attractive plate and that
        police officers can read it. A lot of people may not
        realize that, but all the state cares about is
        function.'' </p>
        <p>The design order came after the Legislature, led by
        Rep. Bill Clabough, R-Maryville, and Sen. Bud Gilbert,
        R-Knoxville, approved the new plate last spring. It will
        cost $25 more than a standard plate, and officials
        estimate that all but $3 of the extra fee will benefit
        the national park. </p>
        <p>Morris said he expects motorists who love the
        mountains as he does will feel buying the tag ''is the
        right thing to do.'' </p>
        <p>''I know the mountains, for me, are simply at top of
        my list of the best things about living here, and we all
        have some responsibility to make sure the park stays with
        us and in good condition,'' he said. ''Translating that
        feeling onto a license plate was a little complicated,
        though.'' </p>
        <p>Morris got help from Charles Maynard, executive
        director of Friends of the Smokies, which works with park
        staffers to determine areas of need and coordinates park
        fund-raising. </p>
        <p>''Charles helped to make sure the design embodied all
        the wonderful things we feel about the mountains -- how
        they feel like home and even when you're away from them,
        there's something about them that brings you back,''
        Morris said. </p>
        <p>Morris said designers started with a ''generic photo''
        of a mountain range and decided on inclusion of a rising
        sun and color gradations reflective of the Smokies'
        characteristically misty horizon. </p>
        <p>A handful of designs were submitted to officials. The
        winner also will bear the line, ''Preserve &amp; Protect
        Our National Park.'' </p>
        <p>John McAdams, assistant director of the Title and
        Registration Division of the Tennessee Department of
        Safety, predicts the new tag will be a hit. </p>
        <p>''That's based as much on the way it looks as its
        affiliation with the park,'' McAdams said. </p>
        <p>Commonly known as ''the Iris plate'' for the
        purple-hued image it bears of the official state flower,
        the tag that benefits Tennessee's state parks is
        currently the hottest-selling non-standard plate, McAdams
        said. </p>
        <p>That tag, with 25,000 units issued to date, is
        unpopular with many state officials, however. </p>
        <p>''The design was voted one of the very worst in the
        country at a recent convention of the American
        Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators because of
        the inability to read it well,'' McAdams said. </p>
        <p>Friends of the Smokies secured the initial minimum
        order of 100 tags required to begin production of the new
        tag, and McAdams said once samples have been approved,
        manufacturing will begin at Cold Creek Correctional
        Facility in Henning, Tenn. </p>
        <p>''Yeah, a bunch of those death-row inmates will be
        stamping out these new Smokies plates, like they do all
        the state's others,'' McAdams said. ''Some have probably
        never even seen the Smokies, but it'll be a prestigious
        job to them.'' </p>
        <p>Charles Maynard said he hopes the work is plentiful. </p>
        <p>''We're just going to have to wait and see how it goes
        this first year, but whatever is generated will be used
        for something on the park's needs list,'' he said. ''The
        things on that list this year add up to about $1
        million.'' </p>

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT>lacing his hand over his heart, the 22-year-old murder suspect declared his innocence.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I wasn&#39;t planning on shooting,&#39;&#39; he insisted. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s not me. I ain&#39;t got that in my heart.&#39;&#39;
<P>   His eyes misted with tears, Anthony Foster Ligon was selling sincerity, but Knoxville Police Department Investigator Edd Stair wasn&#39;t buying.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Back up now,&#39;&#39; Stair replied. &#39;&#39;There were two guns laying right beside you.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Ligon was nonplussed.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I do not know what happened to them guns,&#39;&#39; he responded, shrugging his shoulders. &#39;&#39;For real.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Some might find this seemingly fruitless line of questioning frustrating. But for Stair, a 25-year veteran of KPD&#39;s Crimes Against Persons unit, it&#39;s what makes the job fun.
<P>   &#39;&#39;To me, it&#39;s a cat-and-mouse game,&#39;&#39; Stair said later. &#39;&#39;You&#39;ve got to outsmart these people. I like the excitement.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Stair&#39;s partner, Investigator Cindy Gass, agreed.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There&#39;s a lot of self-gratification in that,&#39;&#39; she said.
<P>   The Crimes Against Persons unit probes the &#39;&#39;worst of the worst&#39;&#39; crimes committed in Knoxville. Sgt. Dan Brock, who heads the unit, said investigators handled 1,674 cases in 1996, including 24 homicides and hundreds of robberies, shootings, stabbings and rapes.
<P>   &#39;&#39;(Per investigator) it averages about 118 (cases) a year -- probably about 10 a month,&#39;&#39; Brock said.
<P>   It is the most experienced group within the KPD ranks, a key in the unit&#39;s estimated 80 percent success rate in solving homicides, according to Brock. Most investigators in the unit have an average of 25 years of experience, he said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think we&#39;ve got good teamwork,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;I think they know one another. A lot of them ran a (patrol) beat together before coming (to the unit).&#39;&#39;
<P>   They work 10-hour shifts, and Brock said his investigators spend &#39;&#39;about every day off in court.&#39;&#39; The stress level is high, and the amount of gratitude low, the veteran sergeant said.
<P>   As Capt. Charles Coleman pointed out in a recent pep talk to some of the investigators: &#39;&#39;This unit takes the brunt of everything that happens. When the shooting and the killing starts, this is the unit everybody starts yakking about.&#39;&#39;
<P>   In many cases, particularly those involving gang-related crime, eyewitnesses &#39;&#39;go blind,&#39;&#39; refusing to admit what they know for fear of retaliation from gang members, Brock noted. Even crime victims aren&#39;t always cooperative, he said.
<P>   For example, Gass and Stair spent hours interviewing witnesses, gathering evidence and writing reports to file charges against an East Side gang member who shot one of his buddies.
<P>   The shooting victim tearfully described the shooting from his hospital bed but refused to answer when Gass repeatedly asked him if he planned to go to court.
<P>   The investigators also must wear a variety of hats. They are advisors to the less experienced patrol officers, psychologists to the victims and their families and verbal punching bags to angry suspects and their relatives, Brock said.
<P>   Brock said the investigators also must battle a justice system that often is a revolving door for criminals.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We see a lot of repeat offenders up here,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   The investigators also must fill out mounds of paperwork. Investigator Ken Slagle recently joked that the &#39;&#39;real work begins when we put the bad guys in jail,&#39;&#39; referring to the notebooks full of reports and forms a case can generate.
<P>   So why do these folks stick with it?
<P>   &#39;&#39;We like to put the bad guys in jail,&#39;&#39; Brock said simply. &#39;&#39;You have to be dedicated to that job.&#39;&#39;
<P>   On a recent Friday night, Gass and Stair battled wits with Ligon, who had admitted driving a car used in a drive-by shooting that killed a man in the Lonsdale Homes housing project. Gass and Stair suspected Ligon knew more about that crime -- and others -- than he was willing to say. But Ligon, an East Side gang member, denied it and, instead, plied the two investigators with tales of remorse.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I pray, I wish there was a way I could go back to that day,&#39;&#39; Ligon insisted. &#39;&#39;I wish I&#39;d never been in that car. . . . I have to hold my momma and apologize to my momma because I know it&#39;s my fault.&#39;&#39;
<P>   After nearly an hour of questioning, Ligon was taken back to jail. Gass and Stair had learned little but were hopeful Ligon eventually would be more forthcoming.
<P>   As Investigator Terry Clowers pointed out, the job requires patience, but the payoff is high.
<P>   &#39;&#39;When you finally get these guys and you put them away, it gives you a great sense of pride,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   Investigator Larry Vineyard added: &#39;&#39;It&#39;s like doing a 3-D puzzle. You have to put all the pieces of the puzzle together. Even if it&#39;s a little piece, it&#39;s important.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Investigators contend they spend most of their time sifting stories -- from suspects and victims -- for grains of truth.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Sometimes, the victims lie as much or more than the bad guys,&#39;&#39; Investigator Dwight Loop said.
<P>   A case in point: A man told Stair and Gass a group of men forced him into a car and took him to a store, where one of the assailants took him inside to cash the man&#39;s government-benefits check. After the check was cashed, the man claimed, the group of men forced him back into the car, drove him to a wooded area, robbed him of his money, ripped his clothes and rolled him down a hill.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The fact of it was, I was trying to stay alive,&#39;&#39; the man said.
<P>   One of the alleged robbers, whom Stair and Gass tracked to a Magnolia Avenue motel, insisted the man wanted drugs and willingly got in the car. After changing his story several times, the alleged robber admitted taking the man to the store to get his check cashed.
<P>   His only bounty, the alleged robber contended, was the $5 the man gave him for helping him get his check cashed.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I just did that man a favor,&#39;&#39; the man accused of robbery insisted.
<P>   Gass and Stair returned to their victim and confronted him with the robber&#39;s tale. The victim then said he had forgotten to tell the investigators one of the robbers asked him for $5 in gas money.
<P>   &#39;&#39;If they were going to take all your money, why would he ask you for gas money?&#39;&#39; Gass queried.
<P>   Shrugging, the victim said, &#39;&#39;I&#39;m just proud they didn&#39;t kill me.&#39;&#39;
<P>   After the accused and accusor were sent home with a promise of a district attorney&#39;s review of their claims, Stair offered a frustrated shrug of his own when asked which of the two men&#39;s tales were closer to the truth.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Who knows?&#39;&#39; he said.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> 16-year-old Knoxville youth accused of taking part in the murder last year of a 5-year-old girl is in danger of losing his bond privileges.
<P>   Knox County prosecutors are seeking to revoke bond for Melvin E. &#39;&#39;Little Melvin&#39;&#39; Davis because he picked up an aggravated robbery charge last month while awaiting a grand jury review in the murder case and a trial in Knox County Criminal Court on a charge of aggravated assault.
<P>   Davis, who was shot the day after the alleged robbery, is scheduled to appear today before Knox County Criminal Court Judge Richard Baumgartner, records show. Last fall, a judge raised his bond after he was charged with aggravated assault.
<P>   An alleged member of Knoxville&#39;s East Side gang, Davis is accused of being an accessory to the May 18 slaying of Brittany S. Daniels, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in the Lonsdale Homes neighorhood. Police say he drove a car involved in the shooting.
<P>   The charge was transferred last year from Juvenile Court so Davis could stand trial as an adult. The case is pending before the grand jury, court records show.
<P>   In October, while he was out on bond, Davis and a 20-year-old man were charged with assaulting a woman in the Walter P. Taylor Homes housing project. As a consequence, Criminal Court Judge Ray L. Jenkins raised Davis&#39; bond from $35,000 to $50,000.
<P>   On Dec. 23, police allege Davis robbed William &#39;&#39;Junebug&#39;&#39; Martin of $200 in Taylor Homes. The next day someone shot him.
<P>   Davis was released from Baptist Hospital of East Tennessee last week, booked into the Knox County Jail and allowed to post another bond. 
<P>   Knox County Assistant District Attorney General Jo Helm is seeking to revoke Davis&#39; bond on the grounds he picked up the robbery charge while out for the other alleged crimes.
<P>   Helm, in court papers filed in Criminal Court, alleges Davis also was in violation of his curfew when he was shot. He was supposed to be in by 6 p.m. and was shot at 7:10 p.m., Helm alleges.

<P>
<P>
<P>   Three Anderson County men wanted in connection with a rash of burglaries may have stolen a church van Sunday as they continued to elude capture, Roane County officials said.
<P>   According to authorities, the suspects, all of Briceville, are Johnnie Mack Wilson, 30, described as a white male, 6-feet 1-inch tall, 180 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes; Charles R. &#39;&#39;Chucky&#39;&#39; Daugherty, 24, a white male, 5-feet 10-inches, 190 pounds, brown hair and blue eyes; and Chris &#39;&#39;Skeeter Bill&#39;&#39; Moser, 19.
<P>   Roane County authorities believe the men may be in Anderson County, though a multicounty search continues.
<P>   Following a burglary at a Roane County residence Saturday, the three suspects fled into the woods near the Meigs and Roane county line, according to a report from Roane County Sheriff David Haggard. Their alleged accomplice, Deena Leinart, was arrested Saturday after she attempted to flee in a car. She is being held in the Anderson County Jail.
<P>   RCSD dispatcher Doug Cook said the men stole a van from Shiloh Baptist Church early Sunday morning. Authorities discovered the van later that morning near Briceville.
<P>   Haggard said officials from Roane, Meigs, Anderson and Morgan counties have joined the search.
<P>    RCSD Det. Linda Booth said the men may also be responsible for several recent home burglaries in Anderson, Claiborne, Grainger, Morgan and Roane counties.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Unidentified body found in Campbell house fire ruins</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   CARYVILLE -- Campbell County Sheriff&#39;s Department detectives struggled Sunday to determine the identity and cause of death for a body discovered in the charred remains of a Caryville house.
<P>   Authorities were alerted about a house on Lawson Lane at 12:25 p.m. Sunday, according to a sheriff&#39;s department report.
<P>   Det. Scott Smith said a witness saw flames coming from the home around 6 a.m., but the witness failed to call because he thought the home was abandoned, the report stated. The home had no electricity.
<P>   Authorities said an autopsy will be performed today to establish the cause of death and make a positive identification.
<P>   Ken Russell, an investigator with the state fire marshal&#39;s office, is working with the sheriff&#39;s department to determine the cause of the fire.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>E. Knoxville teen faces felony drug, gun charges </h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>   A 17-year-old boy faces felony charges after police found 19 &#39;&#39;rocks&#39;&#39; of crack cocaine, $320 in cash and a loaded gun in his pocket, records show.
<P>   Nathaniel Bomdiley Adebayo, who gave police a Barker Avenue address, was arrested Saturday after he allegedly ran from officers in East Knoxville. He was charged with aggravated robbery, carrying a weapon with the intent to go armed, possession of cocaine and possession of a firearm with an altered serial number, according to a Knoxville Police Department report.
<P>   Adebayo, an Austin-East High School student, allegedly had crack cocaine, cash and a loaded gun in his pocket when he was captured by Officers Mike Bates and Steve Still on S. Olive Street around 3:30 p.m.
<P>   The officers began chasing Adebayo because he matched the description of a man accused of robbing a 30-year-old East Knoxvillian minutes before, the report stated. The alleged victim told police he and a friend gave Adebayo a ride.
<P>   The alleged victim claimed Adebayo robbed him of $25 after he declined to buy &#39;&#39;some dope&#39;&#39; from Adebayo, the report stated. A rock of crack cocaine generally costs $25.

		<h3>Philippoussis latest big name to ask out of Australian Open </h3>
<P>
<P>    If the Australian Open doesn&#39;t hurry up and start, nobody may be left to play.
<P>    The year&#39;s first Grand Slam event lost its biggest name, or at least the one with the most letters in it and the most appeal to hometown fans, when <B>Mark Philippoussis</B> withdrew with an arm injury on the eve of today&#39;s first-round matches at Melbounre.
<P>    A year ago, Philippoussis put on a dazzling show of power tennis to knock out top-seed <B>Pete Sampras</B> in the third round. On Sunday, Philippoussis pulled out of what looked like the best opening-round match, a center court duel against Britain&#39;s rising star, <B>Tim Henman</B>.
<P>    The injured-and-out camp is getting pretty full: defending women&#39;s champion <B>Monica Seles</B>, French Open champion <B>Yevgeny Kafelnikov</B>, Wimbledon champion <B>Richard Krajicek, Todd Martin, Cedric Pioline, Jason Stoltenberg</B>.
<P>    The don&#39;t-feel-like-playing camp already claimed 1995 champion <B>Andre Agassi</B> and <B>Jana Novotna</B>.
<P> Among those scheduled to play today are defending champion <B>Boris Becker</B> and women&#39;s No. 1 <B>Steffi Graf</B>. The men&#39;s top seed, Sampras, has the first day off.
<P>
<P><h3>Baseball</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>Jerry Neudecker </B>-- the last major league umpire to wear a balloon chest protector -- has died of cancer at age 66. Neudecker, who died Saturday at Columbia-Fort Walton Beach (Fla.) Medical Center, was an American League umpire from 1965 to 1986.
<P>* Multimillion-dollar salaries weren&#39;t enough for some Dominican major leaguers who have been selling U.S. visas on the black market to would-be illegal immigrants, a Santo Domingo newspaper reported Sunday. According to El Nacional, the baseball players and scouts would request visas for family members to attend games in the United States, and then sell them for as much as $6,000 on the street. The paper did not release any names.
<P>
<P><h3>Running</h3>
<P>
<P>* Sweden&#39;s <B>Ake Eriksson </B>and late entry <B>Claudia Dreher </B>of Germany overcame freezing rain and icy streets to win the men&#39;s and women&#39;s divisions of the 25th Houston Marathon. Eriksson  finished in 2 hours, 19 minutes, 21 seconds.
<P><B></B>
<P><h3>Skiing</h3>
<P>
<P>* Six years after her first World Cup victory, an extremely fit <B>Pernilla Wiberg </B>won a Super G race at Bad Kleinkiirchheim, Austria.
<P>* Even a healthy <B>Alberto Tomba </B>would have had trouble beating Austria&#39;s <B>Thomas Sykora,</B> whose victory at Chamonix, France, was the most convincing in the last two years of World Cup slalom skiing.
<P><B></B>
<P><h3>College basketball</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B></B>Former Bearden High School standout <B>Turner Emery</B> scored 19 points to lead Sewanee (8-2, 2-0) to a 70-59 victory over Oglethorpe University in a Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference game.

		<basefont size="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Inner city arson</B></font><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Church can get $800,000 government loan to rebuild</FONT></BASEFONT><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By Wesley Loy, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Inner City Church, burned by arsonists a year ago, can count on Uncle Sam to guarantee a bank loan of up to $800,000 to help rebuild.
<P>   The loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development bolsters an already lucrative pot of rebuilding money reaped by the church. Inner City has accepted big checks from an insurance company, a national church organization and admirers of Reggie White, the pro football star who served as an associate pastor for Inner City.
<P>   All totaled, Inner City already has received at least $800,000. If it uses the federal guarantee to get an $800,000 bank loan, Inner City ostensibly would have $1.6 million to rebuild its church, which was destroyed in a bizarre arson fire on Jan. 8, 1996.
<P>   Since the day of the blaze, church leaders have vowed to do just that -- rebuild. But today, one year after the blaze on a cold and snowy night, the lot occupied by the doomed church at 3536 Skyline Drive remains vacant, aside from a stack of cement blocks that arrived with visiting civil-rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson in July.
<P>   And the fire remains a vexing mystery, one that has spawned intense speculation in Knoxville as to who burned the multiracial church and why.
<P>   The FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms say they still have substantial forces devoted to investigating this fire, which by dint of its famous member, White of the Green Bay Packers, was prominent in last year&#39;s national string of church burnings.
<P>   Federal agents remain underwhelmed by public response to a hefty reward for information in the Inner City case. If somebody has key information, $105,000 apparently is not enough to talk.
<P>   But it&#39;s never too late to step forward, said ATF Special Agent Michael Durham. &#39;&#39;Any lead that comes up, we are definitely going to pursue it,&#39;&#39; Durham said.
<P>   Neither the FBI nor ATF are willing to say whether they have suspects in the blaze. Nor are they ready to say whether the fire is linked to a fake bomb planted at the back door of the church&#39;s business offices in August.
<P>   But federal agents did take the unusual step months ago of publicly displaying materials used to torch the Inner City Church. The arsonists shotgunned gasoline, gunpowder and Molotov cocktails all through the building, which housed not only the sanctuary but a planned day-care center and radio station.
<P>   Racist graffiti was sprayed on walls, too, leading to speculation that the church fell to bigots intent on terrorism.
<P>   Federal agents say they&#39;ve not ruled that out. But church leaders have complained that they, too, have been targeted in the investigation.
<P>   Inner City is far more than a church. The Inner City organization operates a novel community bank, staked by $1 million in seed from White, plus a housing rehabilitation program and an &#39;&#39;entrepreneur school.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Since the fire, these business activities have continued apparently unabated, while church services have relocated to Austin-East High School.
<P>   If church members are suspects in the blaze, it hasn&#39;t affected Inner City&#39;s relationship with the city&#39;s Department of Community Development. In July, the city reconfirmed Inner City Community Development Inc. as one of its two designated &#39;&#39;community housing development organizations,&#39;&#39; good for a $47,700 grant.
<P>   Inner City Community Development Inc. is an umbrella organization headed by Jerry Upton, whose brother, the Rev. David Upton, is chief pastor for the Inner City Church.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We feel they&#39;re doing great work in the community,&#39;&#39; said Laurens Tullock, director of the city&#39;s Community Development office. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s an incredible need for folks committed to rebuilding the inner city, doing affordable housing and job creation in the inner city.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The Rev. R.N. McGhee, a cousin of the Uptons and president of the Knoxville Baptist Ministerial Alliance, an organization of black ministers, said he&#39;s troubled by speculation that someone connected to the church might have set the blaze.
<P>   If that is so, asked McGhee, where are the indictments?
<P>   &#39;&#39;I feel like had it been an inside job, they would have uncovered evidence of it long ago,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   Last week, Inner City leaders hinted that an announcement was imminent about the church&#39;s rebuilding plans. A local architectural firm, McCarty Holsaple McCarty, has designed a new multipurpose church building, which Inner City leaders have said might cost up to $1.4 million.
<P>   But Inner City&#39;s exact rebuilding plans are unclear. The Uptons have been reticent about discussing their plans, routinely declining to return phone calls.
<P>   Inner City has made moves to prepare the old church site for a new building, but staffers with the Metropolitan Planning Commission have rejected the church&#39;s request to close an adjacent side street.
<P>   David Upton, reached Friday on the request line at his church&#39;s recently reactivated radio station, said an offer was made on an existing building and a deal was near. He said more information would be forthcoming.
<P>   Loranne Ellis, a HUD official in Washington, D.C., who oversees the federal loan guarantee program, said Inner City, if it secures a bank loan, is free to use the money to buy rather than build a new home.
<P>   The loan guarantee program was part of the Church Arson Prevention Act, passed by Congress last year to combat a perceived rash of church arsons.
<P>   Inner City is one of about 80 churches to qualify for a federal loan guarantee. The idea is that, with the muscle of the government&#39;s good word, burned churches can go to private banks for low-interest rebuilding loans.
<P>   The loan guarantees complement grants to arson-plagued churches from the New York-based National Council of Churches. The Inner City Church has tapped that source of funding, too, for $50,000 so far.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT>or the third time in four months, TVA has awarded a multimillion dollar computer services contract to BTG Inc., a computer hardware and services contractor based in Vienna, Va.
<P>   BTG Senior Program Manager Sue Miller said the most recent TVA-BTG contract, for $10 million worth of goods and services to be delivered to TVA during the coming year, also has an option for an extension to four additional years. Thus, the potential total contract value could be up to $50 million.
<P>   John Moulton, TVA&#39;s media relations manager, said Thursday that the new BTG contract, approved by the Board in late December, was for BTG to perform maintenance on computer hardware known as servers.
<P>   A previous computer services contract expired, Moulton said, and after an interim contract was approved, BTG submitted the best technical offer and low bid among 10 computer services firms responding to TVA&#39;s invitation for proposals. 
<P>   TVA also has concluded extensive, multimillion dollar computer contracts with Oracle Systems Corp. of Redwood City, Calif., for its Oracle Office systems and database management services; and with Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash., which provides TVA with e-mail, Windows and other computer software used throughout TVA&#39;s seven-state service area.
<P>   Last August, the TVA Board approved a $4.4 million Oracle computer contract, in addition to a previous $27.1 million Oracle computer services and software contract already in force. 
<P>   That mid-year contract approval came despite a TVA Inspector General&#39;s inquiry that had resulted in Oracle&#39;s refunding more than $8 million on alleged overbillings from its earlier TVA contract.
<P>   The BTG contract was the third major contract BTG had received from TVA since September. Prior TVA contract awards to BTG were to provide TVA information technology services and microcomputers. BTG in 1995 acquired a previous TVA supplier, Chattanooga-based Concept Automation Inc.
<P> 
<P>   TVA also in 1995 had contracts of $8.1 million and $1.37 million with SCB Computer Technology of Germantown to help the federal power-producing agency upgrade and cut costs of its information services systems. SCB, in 1996, was under federal investigation for having overbilled TVA on a $10 million information systems contract, yet TVA&#39;s Board routinely approved SCB&#39;s second contract at an April 1996 meeting in Asheville, N.C.

        In Dixie, they don't need a lot of snow to ski</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><i><br>
        John Gaylon Doty, special to the News-Sentinel</i></font></p>
        <p>Grab almost any copy of a ski magazine off the local
        magazine rack and you might think the South has seceded
        again. Or, at least, that there is no downhill skiing to
        be had south of the Mason-Dixon Line. </p>
        <p>Think again. </p>
        <p>While there may not be a Vail, Aspen, Jackson Hole or
        Killington equivalent for diehard skiers in the Sunbelt,
        there are 22 ski areas in seven Southern states that
        provide close-to-home skiing opportunities, the chance to
        enjoy the sport without mortgaging the house, and a
        varying range of skiing terrain and apres' ski
        activities. </p>
        <p>Together, these areas register well over a million
        visits a year and chances are one or more of them will
        suit your tastes. </p>
        <p>A gravity sport, downhill skiing's success in the
        South necessarily depends on the slopes of the
        Appalachian mountains and foothills and the region's
        fickle weather. Southern areas set records for skiers and
        skiing conditions during last season's cold winter and
        there is optimism for this season. </p>
        <p>''If you believe in woolly worms and fogs then we
        should have another good year,'' said one ski area
        operator. </p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, North Carolina, with its 4,000- to
        5,000-foot-plus summits, offers the most numerous
        opportunities, with seven ski areas. West Virginia runs a
        close second with six, Virginia boasts four and Kentucky,
        Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama each have one. </p>
        <p>These areas run the gamut from West Virginia's
        Snowshoe/Silver Creek, only a seven-hour drive from
        Knoxville and recognized by skiing enthusiasts as the
        crown jewel of Southern skiing, to the tiny, southernmost
        ski area, the 26-year-old Cloudmont Ski and Golf Resort
        in Mentone, Ala. </p>
        <p>The adage among Southern skiers is ''if you learn to
        ski well in the South, you can ski well anywhere in the
        world.'' This is a veiled, but somewhat valid, reference
        to the region's fickle winters. Warm days can melt snow
        and cold nights freeze it into a sheet of solid ice that
        requires excellent skiing technique and sharp ski edges
        to maintain control. </p>
        <p>But Southern ski resorts are doing more than ever to
        battle icy conditions with more attention to the
        ''grooming'' of slopes -- breaking up and smoothing the
        surface with specialized machinery, sometimes twice a day
        -- and expansion of snowmaking capacity to keep fresh
        snow cover on the slopes. </p>
        <p>For the most part, snowmaking and grooming are what
        keep Southern ski areas viable and increasingly
        competitive in the face of uncertain weather. ''One thing
        that has happened is that all the Southern areas have
        made huge investments in snowmaking capacity and have
        dramatically improved the sophistication of their
        snowmaking equipment,'' said Tony Waddell, president of
        the Southeastern Ski Association. ''Everyone always tells
        me they bet I'm wishing for a lot of snow this winter. I
        tell them the best snow is an inch in Atlanta or
        Nashville or some other metropolitan area in the South.
        That gets the interest cranked up. Natural snow has
        almost become window dressing in terms of skiing.'' </p>
        <p>''The South is head and shoulders above everyone in
        the Northeast and West in the ability to make and
        maximize the use of man-made snow,'' says Joe Stevens, of
        Snowshoe/Silver Creek, which adds to or improves its
        snowmaking capabilities nearly every year. ''Southern
        areas have been at it a long time because we've had to.
        It can be 40 or 50 degrees or raining in the backyards of
        most Southerners and ski areas in the mountains can have
        great skiing.'' </p>
        <p>One of the newest trends this year is the introduction
        of the new ''shaped'' ski to the rental equipment of some
        Southern ski areas, such as Wintergreen in Virginia,
        Cataloochee in North Carolina and others. These skis have
        an hour-glass shape, a new design which makes carving
        turns easier. They are to downhill skiing what oversized
        rackets were to tennis. </p>
        <p>Also look for more opportunities to snowboard. A
        growing number of Southern ski areas are capitalizing on
        the biggest growth in the Southern market, especially
        among young people, by offering snowboarding lessons and
        rentals in addition to the traditional ski lessons.
        Snowboards are, in some respects, similar to surfboards,
        which allow participants to ''surf'' their way down snowy
        slopes. While many Southern ski areas have opened all or
        portions of their slopes to snowboarding, others, like
        Wintergreen, have made major capital investments in the
        development of specialized ''snowboard parks.'' </p>
        <p>Wintergreen's Mark Glickman said their snowboard park,
        which opened last year, was so popular they have expanded
        it for this season and added more terrain challenges. </p>
        <p>Waddell says snowboards and shaped skis ''putting fun
        back in skiing again. Naturally, teenagers started the
        snowboard trend, but now we're seeing adults and families
        participating. I see a lot of father-son and
        mother-daughter pairings snowboarding together now.'' </p>
        <p>Lift tickets in the region range from $10 for
        afternoon sessions and night skiing under lights during
        the week, to $40 for daytime skiing on weekends and/or
        holidays. </p>
        <p>Best values are late in the season and mid-week.
        Martin Luther King's birthday, as well as the Christmas
        holiday season, normally commands premium rates for both
        lift tickets and accommodations. Many areas offer an
        array of special packages that can trim costs up to 50
        percent, especially near season's end. </p>
        <p>Generally, most areas open in mid-November and many
        remain open into April. In fact, some areas close in late
        March not because of the lack of snow, but because of
        lack of interest. </p>
        <p>In addition, many Southern ski areas are full-service,
        year-round resorts, which offer not only skiing, but also
        accommodations and other amenities and activities, such
        as restaurants, indoor pools, saunas and whirlpools,
        exercise rooms, child care, shopping and a variety of
        special winter activities and events. They make enjoyable
        winter getaways even if skiing isn't your main winter
        pursuit. </p>
        <p>Full-service resorts with good instruction programs
        are not the only way to sample skiing for the first time.
        Another cost-effective approach is membership in a local
        ski club, many of which not only provide instruction but
        also single and multi-day ski trips. The Knoxville Ski
        Club, for instance, organizes trips to ski destinations
        all over the world, including slopes in the South. </p>
        <p>Here's a representative sampling of the range of
        Southern ski destinations: </p>
        <p><img src="../../images/blkbul.gif" alt="*" hspace="5"
        width="14" height="14">Snowshoe/Silver Creek -- Located
        in Snowshoe, W.Va., these are two separate but adjacent
        areas under a single ownership. They represent the
        ultimate in the Southern skiing experience, as indicated
        by the 410,000 skier visits last year. The area averages
        180 inches of natural snow each year (292 inches last
        year) on its 53 slopes and trails, has a 4,848-foot
        summit, a 1,500-foot vertical drop and a long run of 1.5
        miles. There are 100 ski instructors, six full-service
        restaurants, nine nightclubs and 1,500 rooms and condos. </p>
        <p><img src="../../images/blkbul.gif" alt="*" hspace="5"
        width="14" height="14"> Ober Gatlinburg -- This is really
        close-to-home skiing for Knoxvillians and is a favorite
        among Floridians as well. Located above and connected to
        the resort community of Gatlinburg via both paved road
        and aerial tram, Ober Gatlinburg has an average annual
        snowfall of 50 inches on eight slopes that reach a summit
        elevation of 3,300 feet with a vertical drop of 600 feet.
        The longest run is 5,000 feet. At the base of the
        mountain in the town is more than 150 motels and numerous
        chalets and a range of shopping and dining opportunities
        now that the community has become a truly year-round
        resort destination. Smoky Mountain Lights, a
        multi-million light display in Gatlinburg and Pigeon
        Forge, runs through February. </p>
        <p><img src="../../images/blkbul.gif" alt="*" hspace="5"
        width="14" height="14"> Wintergreen -- Off the Blue Ridge
        Parkway southwest of Charlottesville, Va., Wintergreen is
        one of that state's premier skiing destinations. The
        shopping and village complex is at the top of the
        3,515-foot summit and skiers ski down 10 slopes to catch
        lifts back up. Make your last run and get to the lift
        before it closes because it's a long walk up. The area
        features a 1,000-foot drop, a long run of 4,450 feet,
        four restaurants and 350 slopeside condos. The
        Wintergreen Spa has an indoor pool, Jacuzzi, hot tubs,
        saunas, exercise room and restaurant. </p>
        <p><img src="../../images/blkbul.gif" alt="*" hspace="5"
        width="14" height="14"> Sugar Mountain -- Located near
        Banner Elk, N.C., Sugar is the state's largest ski area
        with 18 slopes and 115 skiable acres, a summit elevation
        of 5,300 feet, a 1,200-foot vertical drop, a single run
        of 1.5 miles and a lift capacity of over 8,800 skiers per
        hour. There are two cafeterias, a lounge/restaurant and
        an outdoor grill. Just three miles away is Banner Elk,
        which offers a variety of cuisine and shopping
        opportunities. Accommodations vary from the 32-room
        Slopeside Inn to a variety of condos and homes located
        within the confines of the Sugar Mountain Resort complex.
        </p>
        <p><img src="../../images/blkbul.gif" alt="*" hspace="5"
        width="14" height="14"> Appalachian Ski Mountain --
        Located between Blowing Rock and Boone, N.C., Appalachian
        is one example of an area that does not feature on-site
        accommodations or non-skiing activities. The area does
        provide a restaurant and ski/gift shop. Visitors come
        here strictly for skiing -- day or night -- on nine
        slopes that have 100 percent snowmaking coverage to
        augment the 60 inches of natural snow each year. The
        longest run is one-half mile with a 356-foot drop from
        the 4,000-foot summit. </p>
        <p><img src="../../images/blkbul.gif" alt="*" hspace="5"
        width="14" height="14"> Cloudmont Ski and Golf Resort --
        Located on the Little River below Desoto Falls in
        northeast Alabama, Cloudmont is part of the Shady Grove
        Dude Ranch and the South's southernmost ski area. It
        features two 1,000-foot slopes with a 150-foot drop from
        the 1,900-foot summit, chalet and lodge accommodations
        and a snack bar. If skiing conditions are marginal, which
        they often are in this part of the country even with the
        area's nine snowmakers, you can saddle up a horse and
        ride through some beautiful countryside. </p>

        slope-ready. And a word of caution: Some of the slim
        shapes and sexy silhouettes require a steady diet of that
        other ski-inspired novelty -- the Nordic Track. </p>
        <p>Even if you can't make it to Vail this winter, you can
        borrow some of the style. Here's how: </p>
        <p>Layering is the key to winter dressing. Big, quilted
        parkas stuffed with Polyfil keep you dry during wet
        weather in water-resistant nylon. There are brightly
        colored jackets in shades of caution-light yellow, red,
        metallic silver, and electric blue, with zip fronts that
        hit at the waist or longer stadium coats secured with
        drawstring waist. </p>
        <p>Parkas and pullover anoraks are lined with Polar Tech
        fleece or Thermolite insulation to keep you warm during
        sub-zero temperatures. Some parkas feature a removable
        vest of fleece lining. Look for styles with fur trim. </p>
        <p>Body-hugging ski pants in fleece are hot paired with
        faux furry snow boots. The form-fitting pants are also
        cool with platform street boots or shoes. </p>
        <p>Down-filled vests over stretchy cotton/Spandex pants
        are slope-ready with a color block turtleneck. Horizontal
        stripes adorn ski-chic gear. </p>
        <p>GirlStar, a division of GOTCHA Sportswear calls their
        winter line, inspired by snowboarding, the ''Snow Bunny''
        collection. The teen-targeted fashions feature ''the
        requisite baggy pants, loose tops, and thick-soled
        shoes,'' for street-slope chic. </p>
        <p>Keep the little ones dry and warm with quilted bib
        overall snow pants and water-resistant nylon mittens. </p>
        <p>Vibrant colors like lemon, lime, burnt orange and
        fuchsia move against black backdrops. Toboggans in fur,
        wool and Polar Tech keep those noggins warm when exposed
        to the elements. </p>

		<FONT SIZE="6"><B>TVA audit questions $2.6 million in costs, eyes contract savings</B></font><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By Jerry Dean, News-Sentinel business writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he TVA inspector general has questioned nearly $2.6 million spent by TVA and found that another $28.2 million could have been used more effectively in its audit of TVA for the first six months of fiscal 1996.
<P>   The audit charges that Onyx International Inc. of Knoxville, a TVA coal supplier, has incurred costs and damages to TVA exceeding $1.9 million as a result of contract noncompliance.
<P>   The audit also identified $2.9 million in potential savings on a proposed $28 million contract with TVA&#39;s Fossil and Hydro Power.
<P>   TVA IG George T. Prosser, in a semiannual report to Congress and the TVA board, reported that 105 IG investigations during mid-1996 led to recovery of $2.3 million for TVA, as well as 12 convictions. As of Sept. 30, the office still had 158 cases under active investigation.
<P>   Much of the report focused on IG investigations of TVA coal purchases. Among the audit findings:
<P>   * TVA concessions to Onyx International listed $706,489 in &#39;&#39;unrecoverable&#39;&#39; costs after TVA tried to help the minority-owned vendor, whose president and chief executive officer is John A. Sibley, become a coal producer. 
<P>   TVA spokesmen said negotiations are ongoing.<B> </B>But the IG&#39;s report urged that TVA seek to recover $161,057 from the vendor for overbillings and delinquencies -- then assess chances of collecting $970,234 more from Onyx.
<P>   * One coal contractor, Pyramid Mining Inc. of Owensboro, Ky., regularly had turned off a mechanical coal sampler designed to evaluate coal quality, while crews loaded less desirable high-sulfur coal onto barges.
<P>   That practice invalidated a coal sampling quality analysis the contractor sent to TVA, whose contract required coal meet specific lab analysis standards. So TVA received $1.8 million in a civil suit settlement. The U.S. attorney&#39;s office in Louisville, Ky., is also investigating the matter.
<P>   Ted R. Ping, assistant TVA IG for Audit Operations, said TVA still has nine coal contract investigations pending. 
<P>   * In an audit of Fossil and Hydropower Group contractor cost proposals -- for providing fire protection systems under a 3-year, $28 million contract -- the IG found that F.E. Moran Inc. had overstated costs of eight such projects, totaling $8.35 million, by $251,075.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Contractors&#39; actual profits on the firm-price projects,&#39;&#39; the IG found, &#39;&#39;have significantly exceeded the profits disclosed in its project proposals.
<P>   The IG concluded TVA could save $2.1 million &#39;&#39;by negotiating cost reimbursement payment terms rather than paying fixed prices for remaining contract projects.&#39;&#39; 
<P>    * In an inquiry into TVA providers of information technology, the IG did &#39;&#39;pre-award audits&#39;&#39; of six top offers which, the IG said, led to a $611,000 savings on three contractor awards totaling $44 million. Audited were National Systems and Research Co., CDI Information Services, Distributed Information Systems Inc., Millennium Computer Technology Inc., Roberts & Schaefer Co. and BTG Inc.
<P>   * An audit also reported that TVA as of March 1995, had overpaid Gilbert/Commonwealth Inc., an engineering services contractor, $349,389 beyond costs that a subcontractor, United Energy Services Corp., incurred on work done for TVA&#39;s Fossil and Hydropower Group. TVA now seeks recovery of the overpayment. 
<P>   * The IG also investigated fraudulent expense vouchers filed by TVA contractors&#39; employees at Watts Bar and Browns Ferry nuclear plants. 
<P>   In a Watts Bar case, TVA Nuclear agreed to recover $236,500 from five contractors. During the six months, TVA Nuclear withheld more than $600,000 from two contractors and had another company reimburse TVA more than $28,600.
<P>   Three former WBN contract employees were prosecuted for $12,000 in false claims. TVA&#39;s IG said seven other former Watts Bar contract employees will be prosecuted for various types of fraud totaling more than $271,800.
<P>   At Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant in Alabama, two TVA contractors&#39; ex-employees pled guilty to federal fraud charges. Three were ordered to repay TVA more than $108,200. Five other contract employees will be prosecuted for fraud totaling $220,000.
<P>   * IG investigations of workers&#39; compensation cases led to convictions of four former TVA employees and termination of benefits for others, resulting in a $3.1 million savings to TVA.
<P>     * The IG also studied use of TVA&#39;s $12 million, 1,300-vehicle passenger car fleet. Operating that fleet, the IG said, costs TVA $5.7 million a year or 20.8 cents a mile -- compared with the 15 cents a mile TVA reported. The IG said TVA understated fleet costs by omitting depreciation and capital costs.
<P>   Maintaining a TVA fleet, the IG found, remains more cost-effective than leasing vehicles commercially or from the General Services Administration, or reimbursing employees&#39; for their business mileage.

		<FONT SIZE="6"><B>Many problems await 100th General Assembly</B></font><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Budget shortfall heads list</FONT><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By Tom Humphrey, News-Sentinel Nashville bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- As Tennessee enters its third century of statehood, its Legislature meets for a landmark 100th session this week to grapple with a lot of old issues given new twists.
<P>    For example, the budget and partisanship have been historic staples in the creation of lawmaking controversy. But the 100th General Assembly, which officially convenes at noon Tuesday, finds state money running unusually low and partisanship running unusually high.
<P>    That potentially volatile mix may spill over into other arenas, causing some unease in the 500-member lobbyist corps that seeks to sway the thinking of 132 legislators on matters of clients&#39; interest.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s going to be a year to keep your head low and be ready to play defense,&#39;&#39; surmised one veteran lobbyist in assessing the 1997 legislative landscape.
<P>    The most prominent feature of that landscape is a mountainous projected budget shortfall of around $400 million -- $100 million in the current fiscal year and $300 million in the 1997-98 fiscal year that begins July 1.
<P>    The shortage appears against a backdrop of some bitter partisan rivalry during the 1996 legislative campaigns. Democrats emerged victorious overall, reclaiming control of the state Senate with an 18-15 majority and building their advantage in the House to 61-38.
<P>    Republican Gov. Don Sundquist actively campaigned against some of the Democratic winners, though he avoided personal involvement in campaigns against sitting Democrat lawmakers.
<P>    Sundquist has hinted strongly that his budget proposal -- which remains officially under wraps for three more weeks -- will include no pay raise for teachers and state employees and may call for some state workers to be laid off.
<P>    Most of the $14 billion state budget is immune from cuts -- either because it comes from federal sources or is used to fund programs deemed &#39;&#39;essential services&#39;&#39; by the governor. Those include health care, prisons and education -- all expected to have spending increases.
<P>    The biggest increase is for education, where $200 million in new monies is slated to complete the last stage of school improvements provided in an education reform law enacted five years ago. All told, Sundquist&#39;s figures project $240 million in new revenue for 1997-98, but that is more than offset by some $540 million in new spending requirements.
<P>    The Tennessee State Employees Association&#39;s leadership has voiced skepticism about Sundquist&#39;s financial figures despite the governor&#39;s assurance that &#39;&#39;we&#39;re not playing games with anyone.&#39;&#39;
<P>    House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh says lawmakers are not taking the governor&#39;s word on the financial crisis either. They plan, he said, to bring in &#39;&#39;new expertise of our own . . . so we don&#39;t have to rely on the administration&#39;s expertise&#39;&#39; in calculating the state of financial affairs. 
<P>    As for layoffs, Naifeh said: &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t think the General Assembly will respond very favorably to that.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Sundquist, Naifeh and Lt. Gov. John Wilder, who presides over the Senate, all profess willingness to work together in bipartisan fashion. But there is clearly the potential for strife on several fronts.
<P>    Naifeh, for example, said he expects legislators to put the possibility of abolishing the Tennessee Higher Education Commission &#39;&#39;on the front burner.&#39;&#39; Sundquist in November orchestrated the firing of THEC&#39;s executive director, Bryant Millsaps, who contends he aroused gubernatorial wrath by not tailoring THEC action to Sundquist&#39;s political agenda.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know where you&#39;d get an executive director -- who&#39;s qualified to serve -- with the political climate they have now,&#39;&#39; Naifeh said of THEC.
<P>    The idea of reforming or abolishing THEC has been around for years but was never seriously considered until recent twists of political fate.
<P>    Some other old issues that may get new attention this session include:
<P>    * Getting tougher on crimals, ranging from drunken-driving offenders to murderers. Proposals in Republican and Democratic anti-crime packages range from chemical castration of child molesters to trying to speed up death penalty appeals.
<P>    * Giving local governments more power to raise their taxes without approval of the Legislature. Sundquist recently indicated to the Tennessee Municipal League that legislation &#39;&#39;dealing strictly with a local tax matter&#39;&#39; would not violate his pledge to enact no new taxes because that is different from state taxes.
<P>    The governor and Democratic legislators have quarrelled over local tax bills in the past, and Sundquist has refused to sign them. Votes on such bills have been hot issues in some campaigns.
<P>    * Trying again to authorize a statewide referendum on repealing a state constitutional provision that forbids lotteries. The proposal must pass both the House and Senate by two-thirds majorities either this year or next to get on the 1998 ballot. As usual, the measure is expected to pass the House but has virtually no chance in the Senate.
<P>    * Reforming campaign finance laws and ethics rules for officeholders or lobbyists. Naifeh, irritated by recent Republican campaign tactics, says he wants a close look at &#39;&#39;where does the libel start and just plain campaigning stop.&#39;&#39; The idea is to forbid outright lies in campaign literature without infringing on free political speech -- a difficult proposition to legally define, according to many lawyers.
<P>    * Overhauling the structure of the state government bureaucracy.
<P>    Sundquist has proposed to abolish the state Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, putting its functions within an expanded Department of Public Health, along with TennCare and some other programs. He needs legislative approval for the move, and Democrats have questioned the idea. Naifeh says he believes the U.S. Department of Justice, which has battled the state in court over conditions at some mental-health institutions, &#39;&#39;is not going to allow that to happen.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Naifeh also was dubious about a Sundquist plan to consolidate state lawyers into a central office while Sen. Robert Rochelle, D-Lebanon, has openly attacked the plan. Attorney General Charles Burson has said that legislators must approve that move, too, though Sundquist aides say the governor can act without legislative approval.
<P>    * Changing the method of selecting state Supreme Court justices and the state attorney general.
<P>    After the defeat of Supreme Court Justice Penny White last August in a yes-no retention vote, state Democratic Chairman Will Cheek called for a return to the pre-1995 system of chosing justices by partisan nomination and popular election.
<P>    While that has been a Democratic idea, Republicans have taken the lead in pushing for popular election of the attorney general, who is now selected by the Supreme Court.

<P> the nation&#39;s principal federal student loan programs.
<P>    Tennessee School of Beauty programs in Knoxville and Oak Ridge and 327 other schools nationwide have had default rates of 25 percent or more for three consecutive years -- fiscal 1992, 1993 and 1994. This means that in each of these three years, 25 percent or more of the loan recipients at the school defaulted in the first or second year of repayment.
<P>    The schools can appeal this action.
<P>    Adam Brown, president of the Knoxville and Oak Ridge schools, said the  appeal process has already begun and that he feels certain neither school will be eliminated from the program.
<P>    &#39;&#39;If you asked me, I&#39;d bet any amount of money we will not be eliminated from this program,&#39;&#39; he said. 
<P>    Brown said figures for the Knoxville school were miscalculated and do not reflect five students who have repaid their loans. At the Oak Ridge school, he said they were penalized because they only had 25 borrowers instead of 30.
<P>    Brown stressed that the schools&#39; default rates have no reflection on their educational curriculum. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;We still have a 100 percent passing rate on the state board exam and a 100 percent placement rate,&#39;&#39; he said.   
<P>    Current student loans will not be jeopardized by or during the appeal process, Brown said.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT>ITTSBURG LANDING, Tenn. -- Nearly 135 years after hosting a historic Civil War battle, the nation&#39;s second-oldest major Civil War battlefield is waging a war of its own against Mother Nature.
<P>    The Shiloh Battlefield in West Tennessee is struggling to preserve its shoreline from the encroaching erosion of the Tennessee River. 
<P>    A popular access road has already been closed, and a 30-foot-high earthen causeway is near collapse.
<P>    And now the site of a 1,500-year-old Indian village is in jeopardy as the river has already sliced into the largest of seven prehistoric mounds.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s a terrible situation,&#39;&#39; superintendent Woody Harrell says. &#39;&#39;The full force of the river is hitting right at the Indian mounds. It&#39;s just not safe to send visitors down there anymore.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Nearly 24,000 soldiers from both the North and the South were either wounded, killed or missing in action after the Battle of Shiloh on April 7, 1862. The Union army was victorious.
<P>    The two-day battle turned out to be a hint that the Civil War would last longer than initially thought.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It was a highly dramatic chapter in American history,&#39;&#39; says author and historian Shelby Foote of Memphis, known for his Civil War commentaries. &#39;&#39;There were more American casualties in two days at Shiloh than in all of America&#39;s previous wars put together -- the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812 and the Mexican War.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Among major Civil War sites, only Chickamauga near Chattanooga has held federal designation long than the 3,960-acre Shiloh site. Chickamauga was created in 1890 and Shiloh in 1894.
<P>    Local preservationists say the Tennessee Valley Authority&#39;s Kentucky Dam project in the 1930s raised the level of the Tennessee River, which may have started the erosion process.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We&#39;re not against the dams or want to stop traffic on the river,&#39;&#39; says Jerry Lessenberry of Humboldt, whose Sons of Confederate Veterans group raises money to help maintain the park.
<P>    &#39;&#39;But this park brings 750,000 people in a year into this area. The tourist value, the historic value outweighs all the other.
<P>    &#39;&#39;God made the land, soldiers fought on it, the federal government accepted it, and now it looks like Kentucky is going to get it.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Park officials lobbied various federal agencies for the funds to fix the problem, and two years ago Shiloh was placed on the priority list for $4.5 million in funds to cure the park&#39;s ills.
<P>    But federal budget cutbacks pushed the funding date back from 1998 to 1999. Now there is only a glimmer of hope that any money will come by the turn of the century.  Unless something unexpected happens, Harrell says they can only allow the causeway to wash away.
<P>    TVA officials aren&#39;t sure if any money will be available to help Shiloh. They&#39;re hoping other federal agencies will step in.
<P>    Harrell&#39;s not counting on it.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve had folks who are good about coming down and talking, but we haven&#39;t seen a pot of money,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;The later we wait, the more difficult it will be to fix the problem.&#39;&#39;

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>hile Edward Hollaway tapped a spoon against his kitchen faucet and his wife, Ella, stared at the water in her washing machine, a con artist was busy stealing the couple&#39;s valuables, authorities contend.
<P>   The Hollaways, both of whom are in their 60s, are believed to be the first reported victims of a couple of professional con artists whom police fear are running their scam in the Knoxville area.
<P>   Knoxville Police Department Patrol Officer Eli Landro said the two con artists, who posed as workers with the Knoxville Utilities Board, are targeting people who are in their mid-50s or older because they consider them most vulnerable to the scam.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They&#39;re professionals,&#39;&#39; Landro said.
<P>   The Hollaways were at their Chicamauga Avenue home Thursday afternoon when a Hispanic man and woman knocked on the door and identified themselves as KUB workers, Landro wrote in a police report.
<P>   The pair told the Hollaways &#39;&#39;there was gas in the water and they had to check it,&#39;&#39; the report stated. The man took Edward Hollaway to the kitchen and asked him to turn on the faucet.
<P>   According to Landro&#39;s report, the man told Edward Hollaway to &#39;&#39;stand by it and hit the faucet with a spoon to tell if there was gas in the water, that it would make an unusual sound,&#39;&#39; according to the report.
<P>   The woman then took Ella Hollaway downstairs and asked her to turn on the couple&#39;s washing machine. Ella Hollaway was told to watch the water as it filled the machine to see if it showed signs of discoloration, Landro wrote.
<P>   The woman stayed with Ella Hollaway while the man ransacked the couple&#39;s house, selectively searching for loot to steal, according to Landro. Landro said the con artists stole food stamps, cash and jewelry.
<P>   When the man was finished choosing items to steal, he called out to the woman to join him and told the Hollaways to &#39;&#39;leave the water running for an additional five minutes while they go test the neighbor&#39;s house,&#39;&#39; Landro wrote in his report.
<P>   The con artists made their getaway in a white car believed to be a mid-80s model, the report stated. Several minutes passed before the Hollaways realized they had been duped by the couple, according to the report.
<P>   The Hollaways gave Landro a partial description of the Hispanic couple. The man had black hair, was about 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighed between 150 and 155 pounds. He was believed to be between 28 and 30 years old. The woman also had black hair, weighed 115 pounds and was between 5 feet, 2 inches and 5 feet, 3 inches tall. She was thought to be in her mid 20s.

<P>
<P><h3>Beer truck stolen outside store, later found in complex parking lot</h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>   A beer truck stolen from a downtown convenience store early Saturday was found minutes later crashed in the parking lot of an apartment complex known for its high crime rate, according to a police report.
<P>   A truck and trailer full of Eagle Distributing Company beer products was stolen at 7:15 a.m. from the parking lot at the Weigel&#39;s, 411 E. Summitt Hill Dr., after the driver left the vehicle unlocked with the keys in the ignition, a Knoxville Police Department report stated.
<P>   Officers found the truck and trailer 15 minutes later in the parking lot of Townview Terrace Apartments, 300 Mulvaney St., which is across the street from the Weigel&#39;s store.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The vehicle was ran partially over the curb and down a hill,&#39;&#39; the report stated. The roads and parking lot were covered with snow and ice at the time.

<P><h3>Meigs, Roane authorities search for suspects in string of burglaries</h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>   Police were searching the woods near the Meigs and Roane county line Saturday night for a pair of armed men believed to be responsible for a rash of burglaries in five counties, authorities said.
<P>   Doug Cook with the Roane County Sheriff&#39;s Department said the men allegedly made off with a load of guns from a Roane County residence shortly before 3 p.m. The pair fled into the woods after a woman, believed to be driving their getaway car, was stopped by authorities as she drove up and down the road in front of the house. The car the woman was driving matched the description of one used in previous burglaries, Cook said.
<P>   Cook said the suspects may be responsible for a string of burglaries in Anderson, Claiborne, Grainger, Roane and Morgan counties.
<P>   A Tennessee Highway Patrol helicopter was aiding authorities in Roane and Meigs counties with the search, Cook said. 
<P>   
<P>
<P><h3>Suspect in armed robbery sought by Oak Ridge police</h3>

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Robert Danieland Jessica Steinberg<BR>Bloomberg Business News</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>EL AVIV, Israel -- Tennessee will try to bring together officials from TVA, Jordan and Israel to discuss possible water and power projects in the Jordan Valley, a top state economic official said.
<P>    The official, William A. Dunavant Jr., commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, spoke with Bloomberg during a fact-finding visit to Israel by a delegation led by Gov. Don Sundquist.
<P>    Officials and executives from the state, hosted by the Israel-America Chamber of Commerce and the Israel Export Institute, are looking for opportunities to export products and to encourage Israeli businesses to invest in Tennessee.
<P>    The U.S. Embassy has suggested that TVA might find opportunities to bring its expertise to bear on the Jordan Valley area, Dunavant said.
<P>   (TVA, since the 1940s, has been interested in assisting the governments of Jordan and Israel in completing a project to link Jordan&#39;s Dead Sea with the Red Sea at Aqaba. TVA has contracted with a Maryland firm, Edgar C. Harrell Associates, to consider Rift Valley project feasibility and to work with the Builders for Peace program in developing an industrial park on the West Bank or in Gaza.)
<P>    One of the Middle East&#39;s thorniest problems is scarce water resources and the need for technological solutions to water distribution.
<P>    Last October, Dunavant said, TVA officials conducted a weeklong series of meetings with Chinese officials, touching on water-resource management.
<P>    Israel is attracting attention from a number of U.S. states that want to explore investment in Israel and the Middle East.
<P>    Eight U.S. states -- California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina and Ohio have established representative offices here. The offices offer advice to companies in their home states and make connections to Israel agencies and companies.
<P>    Tennessee has no current plans to open a permanent office, said Andrew J. Pelych, director of the Export Office within the state economic development agency.
<P>    The state does have a committee dedicated to fostering economic and cultural ties between Tennessee and Israel. The panel was formed last February by the governor and Israel&#39;s consul general for the Southeast, Aryeh Mekel.
<P>    The state&#39;s exports to Israel totaled $15.2 million for the first six months of 1996, up 9 percent from the year-earlier period, U.S. Commerce Department figures show. Of the nearly $30 million of exports from the state to Israel in 1995, $13 million were paper products.
<P>    Two major Tennessee companies represented on the tour are Federal Express Corp. of Memphis, the giant express package delivery company, and Service Merchandise Co., a catalog retailer in Brentwood. FedEx works in Israel through a local partner, Flying Cargo of B&#39;nei Brak.
<P>    Smaller businesses also sent officials. One of the executives on the tour was Sidney Blalock, president of road developer Charles Blalock & Sons Inc. of Sevierville. During this visit, he&#39;s looking at Israel&#39;s developing road infrastructure, particularly Road 6, the Cross-Israel Highway connecting the Galilee in the north with the Negev desert in the south.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We have some of the same problems that Israel faces with this highway,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;There are the environmental issues, and then there are those archeological artifacts. You keep on finding pottery shards, and in Tennessee we dig up Indian arrowheads.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Shannon Greene, vice president of ABG Caulking & Waterproofing of Nashville, is interested in the tunnel infrastructure Tel Aviv will need if it goes through with plans to build a subway.
<P>    The 28-year-old company, with annual sales around $15 million and 225 employees, says that his company has done business in the Caribbean, but with plenty of building in the southern states, ABG hasn&#39;t had to look far outside.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We want to find out if it&#39;s the right time&#39;&#39; for an Israel investment, he said. At the same time, &#39;&#39;maybe you have something in technology and sealants, a better way of doing it,&#39;&#39; that ABG could take back home.
<P>    Hanan Achsaf, president of the Israel-America Chamber of Commerce and president of Motorola Israel, said the U.S. is Israel&#39;s largest export market, even with the shekel strong against the U.S. dollar. A strong shekel makes Israeli exporters&#39; products more expensive for overseas buyers.
<P>    Israel exports to the U.S. in 1996 were about $6 billion, against $5.7 billion in 1995.

		<FONT SIZE="6"><B>Infomercials: Success story for strong sales</B></font><basefont size=6><!--SUBHEAD--></basefont></FONT><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By Linda Castrone, Scripps Howard News Service</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>f you work a normal day shift, keep yourself busy on the weekends and sleep soundly, you may not be familiar with infomercials.
<P>    They&#39;re the &#39;&#39;paid programs&#39;&#39; that pepper the airwaves in the off-hours, purporting to teach viewers while -- coincidentally -- selling them everything from facial creams to miracle ab flatteners.
<P>    Last year they generated an estimated $1.8 billion in sales and did especially well with home fitness products. 
<P>    Between 1990 and 1993, NordicTrack sold $225 million worth of Pro Ski machines with infomercials, and Soloflex sold $150 million worth of home gyms. Last year&#39;s hits were riders/gliders; this year&#39;s are ab machines.
<P>    Why do the ads disguised as TV shows work so well? Marc Rabinoff, professor of Human Performance, Sport and Leisure Studies at Metropolitan State College of Denver gives his best guess: &#39;&#39;People are looking for a magic bullet, and these products offer to deliver it.&#39;&#39;
<P>    He and the seniors in his Comparative Fitness Programs class spent the fall studying fitness infomercials. They found misinformation disguised as fact to be the mainstay of infomercials. For example:
<P>    &#39;&#39;Create rock-hard abdominals in just three minutes a day, three days a week with Denise Austin&#39;s Ab Coach.&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;After one session on the Pilates Performer you can feel 10 pounds lighter and an inch taller.&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Perfect for every age and every lifestyle.&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;The last piece of fitness equipment you&#39;ll ever need.&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;You&#39;ll get maximum results with minimal effort.&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;It&#39;s a total body workout.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Those claims are gross distortions, if not downright lies, Rabinoff and his students assert. 
<P>    In addition to raising people&#39;s hopes, the ads raid their pocketbooks. The &#39;&#39;Jane Fonda &#39;Walk to the Music&#39; Treadmill&#39;&#39; that sold for $409.40 on TV, for example, was available in national discount stores for only $299. Most items hawked on infomercials can be found at discounted prices in local discount and sporting goods stores.
<P>    High TV prices are made more palatable with easy payment plans, usually $50 a month for up to 10 months. And virtually all infomercials offer a money-back guarantee, although following the details can be tricky.
<P>    Only a few dissatisfied consumers take the sponsors up on their money-back guarantees, writes Consumer Reports, while many more blame themselves -- not the product -- if they don&#39;t get the promised results.
<P>    Why do manufacturers use infomercials?
<P>    &#39;&#39;It gives us a half hour to educate people instead of a quick 60 seconds,&#39;&#39; said Mike Smith, public relations manager of Nordic Track in Chaska, Minn. In its infomercials, Nordic Track is careful to stress that diet and aerobics are key ingredients in achieving fitness, Smith added.
<P>    Recently, the Federal Trade Commission filed a fraudulent-advertising complaint against Nordic Track. The company settled, but it &#39;&#39;took no blame,&#39;&#39; Smith said. &#39;&#39;We run everything by the legal department first.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Others argue that governmental restrictions on infomercials is censorship; America is a free country, they point out, and consumers who buy products advertised in infomercials do it of their own free will.
<P>    Overall fitness sales are down and sales of home fitness equipment are flat, but infomercial sales continue to grow. They now account for about 6 percent of all sales, up from 5 percent in 1994, according to the Fitness Products Council.
<P>    They also are relatively cheap to produce, late night and early morning airtime is cheap and return is lucrative. 
<P>    Nine out of 10 TV stations now air infomercials because the money is too good to pass up, reports Broadcasting and Cable magazine. It&#39;s a $400 million business for broadcasters and cable networks, and can mean the difference between profit and loss.
<P>    And although two federal agencies are assigned to police infomercials -- the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission -- they don&#39;t monitor the programs and only enforce the rules when consumers complain.
<P>    Rabinoff and his students&#39; findings about infomercials:
<P>     Although many promise to deliver &#39;&#39;total fitness,&#39;&#39; none can. &#39;&#39;We define &#39;total fitness&#39; as proper nutrition, exercise, flexibility, strength and coordination, and you can&#39;t get that from any one machine,&#39;&#39; says Rabinoff.
<P> 
<P>    Most contain bizarre statements &#39;&#39;that knock professionals out of their seats.&#39;&#39; In her Ab Coach infomercial, for example, Denise Austin comments that &#39;&#39;it takes four years to sculpt a statue, but it&#39;s easier to sculpt your abs.&#39;&#39; Tell that to bodybuilders who have spent years creating the perfect set of washboard abs.
<P>     The inherent risks aren&#39;t mentioned. People with bad backs shouldn&#39;t use rider/gliders, for example, and people with bad hearts should be cautious about anything that raises their heart rates.
<P> 
<P>    The products are expensive. At the time, it may sound like a steal to pay $400 for a home gym or $100 for an ab machine. But a stroll through local stores can drive home the point that much more can be had for much less.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Amy Geisel, News-Sentinel business editor</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> majority of East Tennessee&#39;s publicly owned companies saw their stock increase in value over 1996, and a drop in the stock price of one historically good performer was blamed on the vagaries of Wall Street.
<P>   Goody&#39;s Family Clothing Inc. placed first on the scorecard, with its stock more than doubling in value over the year. Regal Cinemas Inc., the movie theater chain, continued to please investors with a 57 percent increase, while Proffitt&#39;s Inc.&#39;s stock rose 42 percent as the department store chain completed two major acquisitions and announced a third.
<P>   A marked anomaly was Clayton Homes Inc., which posted a nearly 70 percent increase in value in 1995. The company&#39;s stock price fell 22 percent over 1996.
<P>   Clayton Homes&#39; third-quarter earnings fell a penny below expectations, giving rise to fears among some traders that the cyclical manufacturing industry may begin experiencing a downturn.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We have seen a lot of these (manufactured housing) companies drop between 25 to 40 percent in value over the last quarter since Wall Street has become concerned over the late stage of the manufactured housing cycle,&#39;&#39; said Tom Underwood, an analyst with Morgan Keegan & Co.
<P>   But Underwood just recently upgraded Clayton from a hold to a buy. And Barron&#39;s magazine featured Clayton Homes in a favorable light in both a story and The Trader column in last Monday&#39;s issue. One money manager was quoted as describing the company as a &#39;&#39;compelling buy.&#39;&#39;
<P>   East Tennessee&#39;s two publicly owned apparel chains, meanwhile, shine among their industry group.
<P>   Goody&#39;s Family Clothing, expecting 1996 sales to top $800 million, completed a turnaround that began with Chairman Robert Goodfriend lured President Harry Call and other top executives back to the chain in 1995 after a year of legal battles and internal turmoil.
<P>   The management team refocused the merchandising strategy to include a broad selection of women&#39;s and junior clothing, and also vamped up the private label program.
<P>   Goody&#39;s sales for all-important Christmas season, November and December, were up 16 percent on a comparable store basis.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We still have a strong buy on it,&#39;&#39; said Eliot Laurence, an analyst with J.C. Bradford & Co, of Goody&#39;s stock. &#39;&#39;Our feeling is this: The operating margins are still way below peak levels and they have a lot of wind in their sails because of a strong December. We think the company could continue to surprise people in the sales and earnings and if they do that the valuation will continue to expand.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Proffitt&#39;s, meanwhile, went on a 
<P>buying spree, completing its purchase of Younkers, now a division with 48 stores, and Parisian, with its 38 upscale stores, and announcing the acquisition of G.R. Herberger&#39;s with 40 stores in the Midwest. After making some adjustments -- including selling seven underperforming stores in Virginia to Dillard&#39;s -- Proffitt&#39;s Inc. in 1997 will operate 174 stores with revenues of more than $2.2 billion.
<P>   Its Christmas sales weren&#39;t spectacular, but they were solid -- up 3 percent in November and December on a comparable store basis.
<P>   Many are impressed by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brad Martin&#39;s aggressive approach in the consolidating industry.
<P>   &#39;&#39;He&#39;s executing his game plan of growth with careful attention to the strategic implications of market share dominance and he&#39;s done an admirable job,&#39;&#39; said Craig Weichmann of Morgan Keegan.
<P>   Other results for the year include:
<P>    Regal Cinemas, headquartered modestly in Halls, is now the sixth largest North American movie theater chain. Since its initial public offering in 1993, Regal Cinemas has grown at least 30 percent annually.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They&#39;ve been a spectacular performer and continue to outpace everyone in the industry,&#39;&#39; said Gary Dennis, who follows the company for J.C. Bradford.
<P>   Grumblings began in 1995 that the stock may be overpriced, and such growth could not be sustained. The naysayers were proved wrong, Dennis said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s our contention that they are so much better managers, have so much better growth and are so much more profitable, that the premium has held in place and we don&#39;t see any reason for that not to continue,&#39;&#39; he added.
<P>    Computational Systems Inc. completed its first full year as a public company, and saw its stock increase by nearly 29 percent. The company earned $2.6 million, or 52 cents per share, on revenues of $33.1 million for the first nine months of 1996. CSI designs and builds maintenance instruments to detect problems that could lead to a breakdown in industrial machinery.
<P>   The brokerage house Wheat First Butcher Singer initiated coverage of CSI with a buy recommendation last week.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We think they have a leading position in a growing market,&#39;&#39; said Walt Glazer of Wheat First. &#39;&#39;They are a beneficiary of downsizing and outsourcing and they have a strong management team, the vision to see where the industry is headed and the discipline and focus to succeed.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Glazer is predicting that earnings will be up 30 percent in 1997, earnings should grow 20 to 25 percent for the next several years.
<P>    Plasti-Line Inc. posted improved sales and earnings for the first nine months of this year, and as a result its stock climbed more than 37 percent.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We are optimistic when we look at some of the new customers we&#39;ve added and the opportunities in the market we see out there for 1997,&#39;&#39; said Mark Deuschle, chief financial officer.
<P>    Shop At Home Inc., the Knoxville-based home shopping network, saw its stock rise about 10 percent in value on improved sales and earnings. The network, broadcast to 30 million homes, has outgrown its current facilities and is shopping for a new headquarters.
<P>   Last week, the company reported second-quarter revenues rose 70 percent to $16.1 million over the previous quarter. Net income is expected to improve over last year&#39;s loss, officials said.
<P>   Morgan Keegan&#39;s Weichmann said the company is at an &#39;&#39;an early stage of development and they are trying to put together the critical mass they need. . . . It&#39;s an interesting opportunity to monitor, but obviously it&#39;s at the very early stages.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Kingsport-based Eastman Chemical&#39;s stock price dropped as the prices for PET plastic -- the material used for soft drink bottles and the like -- became very competitive during the year. The price drop occurred just as the company was coming online with additional capacity, said James Wilbur, of Smith Barney&#39;s New York office.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We would expect that collapse in prices is pretty much behind them although they will have to rebuild that business,&#39;&#39; Wilbur said.
<P>    Landair Services Inc., headquartered in Greeneville, Tenn. although the bulk of its operations are in Columbus, Ohio, decreased in value as as profits and sales fell below 1995 levels.
<P>   The trucking company, which specializes in air cargo, has said it&#39;s been impacted by higher fuel costs and insurance and claim expenses.
<P>    United Petroleum was the big loser on the scorecard, as some shareholders unloaded the stock causing the price to plunge in early November. The company said investors began abruptly converting debentures -- general debt obligations -- into common stock and began selling short. In December, the company named four new directors and announced that several measures would be studied in an effort to increase the stock&#39;s value.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Lois Reagan Thomas, News-Sentinel executive business editor</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ational Commerce Bancorporation (NCBC), the Memphis-based banking company that pioneered supermarket banking, led publicly traded Tennessee-based banks in stock performance in 1996, returning a 45.4 percent gain to its shareholders.
<P>   The return was well above that of the three other Tennessee-based banking companies and also above the average for the industry group. Dow Jones overall financial group returns averaged 32.37 percent, while regional banks averaged 33.33 percent and Southern banks in particular 35.27 percent.
<P>   While the returns were less for the three other Tennessee-based banking companies, Tennessee banks in general did very well in 1996, averaging returns around 30 percent, as did bank stocks in general, noted John B. Moore Jr., first vice president of Morgan Keegan & Co. in Memphis.
<P>    &#39;&#39;If anybody&#39;s wealth is up 30 percent in a year, they&#39;re doing very well,&#39;&#39; said Moore. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s been a very good year for banks, especially when you consider they were also up a lot in 1995, a little in 1994, a lot in 1993 and a lot in 1992.&#39;&#39;
<P>   NCBC in 1996 launched First Market Bank, a new concept for locating in-store banks in small to medium-sized towns without other in-store banks. The first branches are to open in six north Georgia communities. The concept comes under NCBC&#39;s Knoxville bank, NBC Bank FSB.
<P>   NCBC, with $3.9 billion in assets, has consistently performed well, capitalizing on its low-cost way of expanding banking services, Moore noted.
<P>   Union Planters Corp. became the largest Tennessee-based bank in 1996 with $15 billion in assets after the acquisition of the $3.1 billion-asset Leader Financial in Memphis. The merger is expected to further boost the Memphis-based commmunity banking company&#39;s earnings, according to Morgan Keegan&#39;s analysis.
<P>   First Tennessee National Corp., with $12.8 billion in assets, saw its earnings slow a bit in 1996, but they should pick back up in 1997, said Moore. The Memphis-based company is labeled a &#39;&#39;special products&#39;&#39; company, with more than half its business in something other than traditional banking. Morgan Keegan recently raised its rating of the bank&#39;s stock from &#39;&#39;hold&#39;&#39; to &#39;&#39;accumulate.&#39;&#39;
<P>   First American Corp., with $10 billion in assets, has made a big turnaround over the past several years, and the fundamentals continue to be solid, according to analysts. 
<P>   As for 1997?
<P>   &#39;&#39;The issue in 1997 for a lot of these banks is credit quality,&#39;&#39; said Moore. &#39;&#39;We haven&#39;t had credit problems in many years, but consumer loan past-dues are going up and delinquencies are going up. This is one of the things most banks are concerned about.&#39;&#39;

<P>   Fortune magazine, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and CNNfn all highlighted the fund and its use of economic value-added analysis when choosing stocks to purchase. EVA is an economic model gaining in popularity that purports to determine whether a company is earning more than its cost of capital.
<P>   The fund is typically among the top five funds nationwide when the high-tech sector -- where about 40 percent of its assets are located -- is performing well, Loest said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Usually only aggressive growth funds have a similar technology exposure, but we balance that with a significant investment in higher dividend sectors, which helps stabilize the fund without sacrificing exposure to the greatest growth engine of our lifetimes,&#39;&#39; Loest said.
<P>   Good performers for the fund last year were Intel, Sisco Systems, National Commerce Bancorporation and Rural/Metro, said Loest. Real estate investment trusts also moved up in the last quarter.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Pam Park, News-Sentinel business writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT>AS VEGAS -- Consumer electronics makers&#39; most compelling need is to make the print on their machines big enough to read and the buttons big enough to push, Michael Bloomberg of Bloomberg Financial Services said in a keynote address to the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, which ends today.
<P>Bloomberg, who was the first keynote speaker from outside the industry to address CES in its 30-year history, wasn&#39;t making a joke. He was making a point.
<P>&#39;&#39;The customer doesn&#39;t care what we have to sell,&#39;&#39; Bloomberg said. &#39;&#39;They only care that we have what they want.&#39;&#39;
<P>There&#39;s danger in being overconfident, he said.
<P>&#39;&#39;You can get carried away with your own brilliance,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>Customer preferences are also unpredictable, he said.
<P>For example, who would expect that 1.5 million citizen-band radios were sold last year in the United States? Who would guess that bottled water would be the hottest fad on the ski slopes?
<P>&#39;&#39;We live in a world where 250 million people watch &#39;&#39;Bay Watch,&#39; &#39;&#39; he said.
<P>What they are looking for now is the ability to watch &#39;&#39;Bay Watch&#39;&#39; any time they want .
<P>Video-on-demand is where the industry is headed, Bloomberg said. With video-on-demand, the consumer has the ability to chose a program or movie from an extensive list of titles and watch it on their own schedule.
<P>Bloomberg also predicted newspapers have a future, even if it&#39;s in a different format.
<P>Newspaper readers probably couldn&#39;t tell you what they like about the newspaper, Bloomberg said, but he contends it&#39;s the fact that newspapers are random access devices that makes them appealing to readers.
<P>If consumers want to read the sports page, they don&#39;t have to tune in at a certain hour and wait through the news, features and weather to get it. They can fold up the newspaper and carry it around. They can read it when they want to.
<P>They get news &#39;&#39;peripherally&#39;&#39; from a newspaper as well. As they are thumbing through to the sports page, they may notice headlines in other sections that are important to them .
<P>Electronic services that are being designed to give consumers only the news they want, by categories, will not be satisfactory, Bloomberg said.
<P>How can you know in advance what news will be important to you, he asked?
<P>Maybe the consumer said he or she did not want war stories because they&#39;re depressing.
<P>&#39;&#39;If World War III breaks out, I&#39;m in big trouble because I&#39;m not going to know about it,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>On the flip side, if consumers choose to follow the Susan Smith story, they&#39;ll get lots of stories about parents killing children.
<P>Newspapers have a future, but they may look different a few years from now, Bloomberg said.
<P>He foresees they may be made of some sort of cloth or a flexible screen that can be loaded with content from different media organizations and updated constantly.
<P>&#39;&#39;What you are going to as (electronics) manufacturers is increase the internal complexity of your products . . . so that we (who) look at the exterior will see something simpler,&#39;&#39; he said.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Katie Fairbank, Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT>ALLAS -- Bounties are offered, wanted advertisements are posted on billboards and headhunters lurk on the Internet. Qualified computer workers are hunted down wherever they might be.
<P>   With the fast pace of growth in high-tech fields, many companies are struggling to find technical talent to fill their needs.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Software and computers are a significant part of everyone&#39;s business. The demand has increased because of that,&#39;&#39; said Gary Slagel, mayor of Richardson, Texas, a Dallas suburb with over 500 technology companies located in an area nicknamed the Telecom Corridor.
<P>   The quest for top technical performers means companies find themselves in bidding wars for workers. Salaries are edging up to reflect the competition.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s just the talent pool has been sucked up by high-tech businesses,&#39;&#39; says Howard Miller, senior vice president of engineering and technical services for Intecom, which designs and manufactures network switches.
<P>   Miller&#39;s efforts to get qualified computer specialists runs the gambit: He hires headhunters, offers a $2,500 bounty offer to any employee who makes a successful referral and advertises in the newspaper and on the Internet.
<P>   Miller also recently put up two billboards located near DSC Communications Corp., which does work similar to Intecom.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;re trying to get their software engineers&#39; attention,&#39;&#39; said Miller, who offers prospective employees signing bonuses and other perks.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Terms of employment are negotiable; vacations are negotiable. We also have other things to offer,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We use every avenue that we can think of.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The Dallas area isn&#39;t the only part of the United States with the problem.
<P>   &#39;&#39;When you look at the rest of the country, you&#39;ll find there are regions with a similar shortage: Silicon Valley, Boston, Research Triangle Park in North Carolina,&#39;&#39; Slagel said.
<P>   The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that from 1994 to 2005, computer-related employment will jump by an estimated 60 percent nationally.
<P>   That increase will mean a shortage of skilled personnel for fast-growing high-tech industries, according to Michelle Bragg, a research associate with the Center for Economic Development and Research at the University of North Texas.
<P>   Companies are working on various solutions to solve the shortage.
<P>   Northern Telecom in Raleigh, N.C., recently held a bring-a-friend-to-work-day, with a $1,500 bonus offered to workers if the friend ended up accepting a position with the company.
<P>   Texas Instruments, Dallas Semiconductor, Cyrix Corp. and TwinStar Semiconductor Inc., joined to create a program to teach students on-the-job skills at community college campuses in the Dallas area.
<P>   Virtual Solutions regularly searches overseas to recruit employees, according to chief executive Mike Baldwin, who says he spends over 30 percent of his time looking for talented techies.
<P>   And many are turning to the Internet.
<P>   Some Richardson companies are forming a coalition to help them recruit candidates from other regions rather than pilfer employees from each other.
<P>   &#39;&#39;One of the things we&#39;re looking at doing is advertising in other parts of the country, so the companies in this region aren&#39;t just looking at the candidates that work across the street,&#39;&#39; Slagel said.
<P>   Recruiters also are a popular way to fill an empty job, the companies say.
<P>   Allen Kriesman, a programmer analyst, said he was consistently called by recruiters hoping he would jump ship from American Airlines.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Basically the headhunters got so desperate that they&#39;d call once or twice a week. I don&#39;t know how they got my name,&#39;&#39; Kriesman said. A lucrative salary offer encouraged him to move to Chicago Title, a mortgage company.
<P>   Kriesman said he still gets an occasional call from a searching recruiter.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I keep thinking it&#39;s going to get saturated. I&#39;m surprised there is as much of a demand for programmers as there is,&#39;&#39; he said.

		<FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>HARLOTTE, N.C. -- Winston Cup champion Terry Labonte and four teammates are first-team members of the 1996 Copenhagen/Skoal All Pro team.
<P>    The awards were announced late Friday night at the annual banquet.
<P>    Dale Earnhardt, who finished fourth in the Cup points race, was selected for the runner-up position and Dale Jarrett, who was third in points, placed third.
<P>    Crew chief Gary DeHart, jack man Walt Smith, tire specialist Mike Bumgarner and gear/transmission specialist and general mechanic Dan Ford were other first-team honorees on the championship Kellogg team.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This is a night for the mechanics,&#39;&#39; said Labonte, who won two races, posted an average finish of eighth and rallied down the stretch en route to overtaking teammate Jeff Gordon. &#39;&#39;The mechanics make my job easy, and I&#39;m fortunate to be a part of this team.&#39;&#39;
<P>    No-shows were plentiful and that irritated Jarrett, who drives for Robert Yates.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I challenge the teams that don&#39;t have their members show up,&#39;&#39; Jarrett said after accepting his award. &#39;&#39;They should be here.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Each of the three finalists on the Yates team accepted his awards, including 74-year-old mechanist James Lewter. It was the 10th consecutive year Lewter been honored.
<P>
<P>   <B>POSTHUMOUS HONOREES:</B> Crew chief Harry Hyde, driver/chassis builder Banjo Matthews and driver/team owner Elmo Langley, who dedicated their lives to NASCAR, were honored with the Mike Rich Award of Excellence.
<P>   The trio died during the 1996 season. Rich, a member of Harry Melling team, was killed in a pit road accident at Atlanta  Motor Speedway in 1990.
<P>
<P>    <B>STILL SLEDDING:</B> Cup driver Geoff Bodine, who became involved with the U.S. Bobsled team in the 1992 Olympics, is back in the business. His sled returns to World Cup competition in Konigssee, Germany, on Tuesday.
<P>
<P>    <B>TRUCKER:</B> Youngster Kelly Denton, who resides in Bristol, Va., has been selected the replacement for Jimmy Hensley on the SuperTruck series. Richard Petty hired Hensley as his driver for 1997. The truck series opens Jan. 19 at Orlando, Fla.
<P>
<P>    <B>SHAPING UP:</B> Team owner Darrell Waltrip has filled the key positions for the SuperTruck series.
<P>    Dave McCarty is the crew chief, Scott Grant the fabricator and Rick Elberts engine tuner. Driver Rick Bickle was<B> </B>selected two months ago.
<P>
<P>    <B>HIGH RISE:</B> Martinsville Speedway will celebrate its 50th anniversary by adding 5,000 seats between turns three and four. The new section is expected to be completed in time to sell tickets for the April race.
<P>    &#39;&#39;They will be great seats,&#39;&#39; speedway president Clay Campbell. &#39;&#39;Fans will be right on top of the action and they can watch the entire race without turning their heads.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT SIZE="6"><B>Fishermen can pick brain of experts during UT visit</B></FONT><!--SUBHEAD--></BASEFONT><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By Bob Hodge, News-Sentinel outdoors editor</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">B</FONT>ack in 1974, Gary White thought it would be a good idea to get together some professional bass fishermen, put them in a classroom setting, and let other fishermen pick their brains.
<P>     White was right. It was a good idea.
<P>     In 23 years, the Fishing Techniques Institute has visited more than 160 college campuses, and has been attended by more than 150,000 fishermen. Three years ago White was bought out by the Bass Anglers Sportsman&#39;s Society and he now serves as the program&#39;s director.
<P>     &#39;&#39;I was working as the financial aide director at Rose State College in Midwest City, Okla., when we got it started,&#39;&#39; White said. &#39;&#39;Jimmy Houston was an insurance salesmen then and Ken Cook was a biologist for the state of Oklahoma.
<P>     &#39;&#39;Now we&#39;ve been to schools from coast to coast in the United States and Canada. We&#39;ve been to the University of Texas 23 times.&#39;&#39;
<P>     For the third time, the B.A.S.S. Fishing Techniques comes to the University of Tennessee on Feb. 1-2 as part of UT&#39;s Division of Continuing Studies and Distance Education. The program will feature 12 one-hour sessions with six professional bass fishermen.
<P>     The two-day course costs $89.00. Spouses and children 16 and under can attend for half-price with a paying adult. Registration can be made by phone at (423) 974-0280 or by mail to: UT Conferences, P.O. Box 2648, Knoxville, TN 37901. 
<P>     Each session runs 8 a.m.-5 p.m. each day with breaks for lunch.
<P>     &#39;&#39;This is not just a seminar-type situation,&#39;&#39; White said. &#39;&#39;The way this thing is geared to get the participants in a classroom environment with the best bass fishermen in the world and let them learn what they know.&#39;&#39;
<P>     Each of the pros will teach his individual specialty:
<P>     * Larry Nixon, two-time B.A.S.S. Angler of the Year and B.A.S.S. Masters Classic Champion, will teach plastic worm techniques.
<P>     * Jay Yelas, 195 Superstars Champion and six-time B.A.S.S. Masters Finalist, is a jerk bait expert.
<P>     * Randy Fite, seven-time B.A.S.S. Masters Finalist, is a deep water specialist.
<P>     * Tony Bean is host for the Smallmouth U.S.A. television series and is a smallmouth expert.
<P>     * Bernie Schultz, two-time Canadian champion and author of Techniques Illustrated, is a renowned spinnerbait fisherman.
<P>     * Mike Terry, two-time B.A.S.S. Masters finalist, is considered one of the best at locating bass in deep open water.
<P>     &#39;&#39;The idea is to cover every technique in existence and some you don&#39;t know about,&#39;&#39; White said. &#39;&#39;Fishermen are notorious for coming up with new techniques and terminology that applies to other techniques that are spun off in to even more techniques . . .
<P>     &#39;&#39;There is something for everybody. If you&#39;ve been before, you&#39;ll probably still learn a thing or two. For the novice, this is a treasure trove of information.&#39;&#39;
<P>     But White cautions fishermen not to go looking for consensus answers from the pros.
<P>     All the classes are unscripted and open to the teachers&#39; ideas and opinions. If two of them have exactly opposite answers to the same question, that&#39;s what White is looking for.
<P>     &#39;&#39;You get a lot of contradictions, but these guys are telling anglers what they have learned through trial and error and what works for them,&#39;&#39; White said. &#39;&#39;These guys fish 300 days a year and they&#39;ve learned a lot&#39;&#39;

		<h3>East Shrine defense denies West&#39;s star QBs </h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>    <B>Matt Finkes </B>returned an interception 17 yards for a touchdown and led a defensive effort that stymied three of the best quarterbacks in the nation as the East beat the West 17-13 Saturday in the Shrine all-star game at Stanford, Calif.
<P>    The East&#39;s win in the 72nd annual edition of the Shrine game snapped a three-year winning streak by the West, which saw its rotation of Arizona State&#39;s <B>Jake Plummer,</B> BYU&#39;s <B>Steve Sarkisian </B>and California&#39;s <B>Pat Barnes </B>held without a touchdown pass. The three had thrown for a total of 86 touchdowns this season.
<P>    Sarkisian, the nation&#39;s top-rated passer, was intercepted by Finkes of Ohio State, and Plummer threw a fourth-quarter interception that wiped out the West&#39;s last chance.
<P>    Down 14-0, the West rallied to 14-13 when California&#39;s <B>Ryan Longwell,</B> who missed a 47-yard try earlier, came back to make a 48-yarder on the first play of the fourth quarter.
<P>    With East Carolina&#39;s <B>Marcus Crandell </B>at quarterback, the East answered with a 57-yard march that culminated in a 28-yard field goal by <B>Wayne Boyer </B>of Southwest Missouri State.
<P>    The West drove to the East 5, but failed to score with under six minutes remaining, then lost another chance from the East 12 when Jackson State&#39;s <B>Sean Woodson </B>made an end-zone interception of a Plummer pass.
<P>
<P><h3>Swimming</h3>
<P>
<P>* The 13th-ranked Tennessee Lady Vols took their fourth victory of the season, beating No. 14 Northwestern 192-160 at UT Student Aquatic Center. Auburn cancelled out of the meet. UT double winners were <B>Sarah Nichols </B>(500- and 1,650-yard freestyles), <B>Fabiola Molina </B>(100- and 200-yard backstrokes) and <B>Tracy Bonner </B>(1- and 3-meter diving). <B>Tori DeSilvia </B>was second in the 200 breaststroke and 200 butterfly, and <B>Kathy Pesek </B>and <B>Dawn Burton </B>finished 2-3 in both diving events.
<P>
<P><h3>Men&#39;s college basketball</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>King Rice,</B> an assistant coach at Illinois State who charged into the stands after a fan has been suspended with pay for one game. He will sit out today&#39;s game against Southern Illinois. He left the bench during a Thursday overtime loss to Northern Iowa after exchanging words with a fan.
<P>
<P><h3>Women&#39;s college basketball</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>Marion Jones </B>scored 26 points and had four of North Carolina&#39;s season-high 21 steals as the No. 16 Tar Heels (12-1, 3-0 ACC) beat Georgia Tech 80-53.
<P>* <B>Raegan Scott </B>and <B>LaShena Graham </B>each scored 12 points as Colorado (8-4, 3-0 Big 12) beat No. 7 Texas Tech 63-49. The Lady Red Raiders (9-4, 1-2) shot 35 percent from the field.
<P>* <B>Pietra Gay </B>scored 31 points -- including nine in a row in the second overtime -- to lead No. 22 LSU (13-0, 3-0 SEC) to an 88-80 victory over Mississippi (10-4, 1-2). LSU&#39;s Elaine Powell hit a running bank shot at the buzzer to tie it 64-64 at the end of regulation.
<P>
<P><h3>Pro basketball</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>Jackie Joyner-Kersee </B>has left the Richmond Rage of the American Basketball League to concentrate on her track and field career. She had been with the Rage for 17 of 29 games, scoring 16 points and grabbing 10 rebounds.
<P>* Former Tennessee star <B>Nikki McCray,</B> leading scorer in the ABL, hit 28 points for the Columbus Quest, which ran its record to 22-3 Thursday night with a 100-95 victory over the Seattle Reign.

<P>
<P>* Former welterweight champion<B> Carlos Palomino,</B> 47, back in the ring for the first time since 1979, stopped <B>Ismael Diaz </B>in eight rounds of their scheduled 10-round welterweight match Friday night in Los Angeles.
<P>* Also in L.A., heavyweight <B>Gerrie Coetzee,</B> 41, a former WBC champion from South Africa, stopped <B>Dan Kosmicki </B>at 2:02 of the third round. Coetzee retired with a 32-5-1 record and 20 knockouts.

<P>
<P><h3>Hockey</h3>

		<FONT size="2"><I></I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<P>   
<P>To paraphrase Jerry Glanville, a marginal coach and horrible football commentator, the capital letters in Knoxville Football League have been contorted into something else.
<P>   Like &#39;&#39;<B>K</B>eep <B>F</B>inding <B>L</B>ame&#39;&#39; players.
<P>   In terms of potential recruits as evaluated by Division I schools, the KFL is running neck-and-neck with the four powder puff teams at Karns High School.
<P>   It&#39;s a scoreless struggle:
<P>   Guys 0, Girls 0.
<P>   Sure, some KFL athletes have received letters with big-time logos. Others get the standard, &#39;&#39;Why don&#39;t you just walk on and we&#39;ll talk later&#39;&#39; sales pitch.
<P>   But this fact remains: Nary a KFL player is expected to sign a Division I scholarship this year.
<P>   To make matters worse, only a handful of kids have official visits to Division I-AA or Division II schools.
<P>   This really irks a growing number of local and area coaches. Just last month, they watched and cheered in Nashville as Webb School won a state championship while Halls and Jefferson County reached the title game.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve pretty much been ignored, but I do not know why it is,&#39;&#39; Karns coach David Bankston said. &#39;&#39;There are some good football players here, especially in terms of I-AA and Division II.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Bankston, a former quarterbacks coach at Carson-Newman, put the plight in perspective: &#39;&#39;I haven&#39;t even heard from anybody at Maryville College.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Times are tough when a nearby, non-scholarship Division III program with a losing record isn&#39;t sampling your coffee.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think it&#39;s Knoxville they don&#39;t like,&#39;&#39; Bankston said, speaking generally. &#39;&#39;We can blame it on the town of Knoxville. It&#39;s either that or they are scared John Adams is going to write something about it and it isn&#39;t going to be nice.&#39;&#39;
<P>   A sense of humor comes in handy. Good kids who&#39;ve stayed in the weight room -- and out of trouble -- aren&#39;t receiving even a glimmer of just rewards.
<P>   Go figure, if you can.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I have no theory . . . I really don&#39;t,&#39;&#39; said Bearden&#39;s Bill Young, one of the most-respected coaches in the state. &#39;&#39;I was kind of taking it personal. I&#39;m kind of glad to hear other people are having the same problem, but it&#39;s really been a shock to me.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The situation is so bad that a prep football &#39;&#39;scholarship fair&#39;&#39; probably will be proposed for next season. Numerous coaches would set up booths in the same building where college scouts could evaluate video tapes. Copies could be made on the spot.
<P>    This could be held at Golden Gloves Arena at Chilhowee Park in conjunction with the popular recruiting combine at Fulton.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It might be something we need to take a look at,&#39;&#39; Young said. &#39;&#39;I know some of our kids can play and I&#39;m sure other coaches around town feel the same way. But for whatever reasons, I am not getting as much flow (from college coaches) as we need to for the kids.&#39;&#39;
<P>   There are several plausible explanations:
<P>  <B></B><B>ßÜFacts of life:</B> Young says it best. &#39;&#39;I try and remind our kids that some people can be great high school football players -- and not be a college player,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;That does not mean they are not any good.&#39;&#39;
<P>   It does mean they need to do well academically.

        Stronger stance on color expected</font><p><font size="2"><i>By
        Morgan Simmons, News-Sentinel staff writer</i></font></p>
        <p><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>he Environmental Protection Agency
        said Friday it expects to receive a reworded
        interpretation of Tennessee's water quality standard for
        color on the Pigeon River within the next few days. </p>
        <p>''Tennessee is saying they will provide documentation
        to back up a stronger color interpretation,'' said
        Loretta M. Ucelli, EPA associate administrator for public
        affairs. ''That documentation will give EPA the ability
        to take action on the concerns of Tennessee.'' </p>
        <p>Confirmation of the state's position regarding
        revisions in its color standard came in a Jan. 9 letter
        from Attorney General Charles Burson to EPA Administrator
        Carol Browner. </p>
        <p>Burson wrote: ''Tennessee has the authority to make
        administrative interpretations of its narrative water
        quality standards. This administrative interpretation
        will be technically and legally supportable, and this
        office has the authority to render an opinion to that
        effect should you desire.'' </p>
        <p>Tennessee, like other states, expresses its color
        standard as a narrative, calling for ''no objectionable
        color.'' </p>
        <p>Eight years ago the EPA and Tennessee agreed on 50
        color units at the state line to be the correct
        interpretation of ''no objectional color.'' </p>
        <p>Tennessee argues that the river is still too dark, and
        it wants Champion's new permit to include stricter color
        limits at the state line. </p>
        <p>''Our purpose is to clean up the Pigeon River, and
        we'll do what's needed to get that result,'' said Justin
        Wilson, outgoing commissioner of the Tennessee Department
        of Environment and Conservation. ''Tennessee's narrative
        standard has always been protective of our waters. We
        don't believe we have to strengthen it, but we might want
        to articulate in a way that EPA can deal with.'' </p>
        <p>On Dec. 26, the EPA approved a new permit issued by
        North Carolina officials allowing Champion to continue
        operating its Canton, N.C., paper mill and polluting the
        Pigeon River at a level above what is allowed under
        federal law. </p>
        <p>Tennessee's main objection has been that the new
        permit, like the old one, calls for 50 color units at the
        state line, allowing the Pigeon River to look anything
        from green to almost black. </p>
        <p>EPA officials said Tennessee could switch to a
        numerical color unit standard but will most likely
        provide a different interpretation of its narrative
        standard, one in which EPA finds technical and legal
        justification for setting a stricter color standard than
        50 units at the state line. </p>
        <p>''This is something extremely important to Carol
        Browner (EPA administrator) and the vice president,''
        said Ucelli. ''Everyone agrees that the concerns of
        Tennessee need to be addressed, and this is an important
        vehicle for doing that.'' </p>

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Marti Davis, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>wo Maryville brothers have made the largest gift of land ever received by The Foothills Land Conservancy.
<P>   The 100 acres of forest land will expand the group&#39;s growing wilderness zone around the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
<P>    The land, bordering Montvale Road on Chilhowee Mountain, was donated by real estate developers Michael and Evelyn Ross and Pat and Dale Ross of Maryville.
<P>    &#39;&#39;With this gift, we would like to honor our father and mother, Frank and Lila Rose Ross, lifelong residents of Maryville,&#39;&#39; the brothers said in their letter accompanying the gift. &#39;&#39;Their love of this community and us has always been our greatest inspiration. The Foothills Land Conservancy and its goal of preservation of our heritage is a wonderful cause and we are proud to be a small part.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The land, which is near the YMCA&#39;s Camp Montvale, will help expand the buffer zone around the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We need this for the wildlife. They&#39;re not making bear habitat anymore,&#39;&#39; said Randy Brown, director of the land conservancy.
<P>    The Ross brothers actually own a 1,000-acre tract of land bordering the 100 acres of land just donated. &#39;&#39;We hope to eventually give all of it to the land conservancy,&#39;&#39; said Michael Ross.
<P>    Brown said he was flabbergasted when the Ross brothers called to tell him about their gift. &#39;&#39;When they said &#39;It&#39;s 100 acres, my jaw dropped. It&#39;s inside the buffer zone we have targeted on our map, therefore its a high priority to us,&#39;&#39; said Brown. &#39;&#39;This is by far the largest gift of land the Conservancy has ever received. And the fact that it lies on Chilhowee, so near the Foothills Parkway and Camp Montvale only makes it more important. It&#39;s wonderful.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The acreage will be turned over to the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency. It will be made available for public recreational use along with the rest of the Foothills Wildlife Management Area overseen by the TWRA.
<P>    The Foothills Conservancy is a local, nonprofit land trust with offices in Maryville. It has protected more than 6,200 acres in the Foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains. The Conservancy is undertaking a $500,000 fund-raising campaign to purchase 1,500 acres on the southern end of Chilhowee Mountain.
<P>    In 1995, the Conservancy purchased 4,700 acres and donated 400 to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and 4,300 acres to the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, which created the Foothills Wildlife Management Area.
<P>    The conservancy&#39;s long range goal is to establish a permanent &#39;&#39;buffer zone&#39;&#39; between the National Park and the Knoxville Metro Area. For more information, call 681-8326.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Rebecca Ferrar, News-Sentinel Nashville bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- Knox County District Attorney General Randy Nichols says it was &#39;&#39;stupidity&#39;&#39; that led him to improperly charge the state for mileage while driving a county car.
<P>    While the amount -- $649.92 -- was relatively small compared to the $17,743.43 wrongly charged in travel expenses by the Memphis District Attorney General&#39;s office, it still was a crucial finding in the recent audit by the Comptroller&#39;s office.
<P>    &#39;&#39;If I was going to steal, I would steal more than that,&#39;&#39; Nichols said. &#39;&#39;It was a lack of oversight on my part. I sign those travel expenses, and I didn&#39;t pay very close attention.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Travel was just one area the audit focused on in its critical review of the financial oversight by the Tennessee District Attorneys General Conference.
<P>    In Nichols&#39; case, the audit says he submitted travel claims while using a county-assigned car. He kept payment for those claims &#39;&#39;for mileage expenses he did not personally incur&#39;&#39; during five trips in 1994 and 1995.
<P>    Nichols says he signed for reimbursement of expenses that included hotel, meals and mileage and was &#39;&#39;negligent&#39;&#39; in not noticing that mileage should have been excluded when using a county car.
<P>    He repaid the money Friday following the release of the audit on Thursday.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I apologize for these mistakes and accept full responsibility,&#39;&#39; he commented in the audit.
<P>    The claims in question were among 16 submitted by Nichols for which he received payment from 1992 to 1996.
<P>    Nichols originally told auditors that he put gas in the car for one of the five trips and said he &#39;&#39;would expect&#39;&#39; that amount to be deducted from the total he owes. He said he changed his mind because he had no receipts.
<P>    In Memphis&#39; case, the audit accused former Shelby County District Attorney General John Pierotti and Phyllis Gardner, an assistant district attorney general, of charging the state for $17,743 in travel expenses they already had paid for with a county credit card.
<P>    Pierotti retired in November. Both repaid the money, according to the audit.
<P>    The District Attorneys General Conference is the umbrella organization for all district attorneys general in Tennessee, coordinating lobbying, the state budget and other activities.
<P>    Other audit findings about the conference:
<P>    It should &#39;&#39;more closely manage&#39;&#39; the financial operations of the office and better monitor the district attorneys general. &#39;&#39;Management of the conference did not ensure that the district attorneys general&#39;s offices were operated properly,&#39;&#39; the audit says. The report found &#39;&#39;serious weaknesses&#39;&#39; in the fiscal operations.
<P>    It did not provide &#39;&#39;adequate guidance&#39;&#39; of the proper use of state expense funds. The district attorneys general in Knox, Hamilton, Davidson and Shelby counties received money for office expenses as authorized under state law. But the conference monthly issued warrants for the expenses &#39;&#39;negotiated for cash by the district attorneys general or deposited into both personal and governmental bank accounts controlled by the district attorneys general.&#39;&#39;
<P>    It did not adequately control property, equipment and leased office space.
<P>    It did not maintain adequate leave records.

        likely started when a dryer vent overheated. </p>
        <p>Barbie Manis, 19, and her 11-month-old baby lost most
        of their clothing and furniture in the blaze. She said
        the overheated vent was inside the apartment she shared
        with her mother. </p>
        <p>''My mom was in there cleaning, doing some laundry,''
        she said. ''All of a sudden I heard her hollering for me
        that there was a fire.'' </p>
        <p>Manis said she gave her baby, Joshua, who already
        suffers from respiratory trouble and has to use a
        breathing machine, to her mother to take him outside
        while Manis frantically searched for a fire extinguisher.
        </p>
        <p>''It was black (from smoke) in the kitchen in 10
        seconds,'' Manis said. </p>
        <p>Manis said her sister and nephew also lived in the
        apartment. </p>
        <p>''We lost everything, and we didn't have that much to
        begin with,'' she said. </p>
        <p>As firefighters battled the blaze, snow fell and cold
        winds blew across the parking lot, where other residents
        gathered to comfort Manis and the others whose apartments
        were damaged. Two firefighters, Rick Harrell and Marcus
        Yarbrough, had to be taken to area hospitals to be
        checked for possible injuries after part of a ceiling
        fell on them. </p>
        <p>Hammitt said it appeared the firefighters would be OK.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>piders, snakes, hummingbirds and old logging camps of the Appalachians are among the topics to be covered in a weeklong program in Pigeon Forge.
<P>   Regardless of the weather, Wilderness Wildlife Week starts this afternoon. The free event will feature 80 of the area&#39;s top experts on the culture, plants and wildlife of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and beyond. Several speakers and presenters are also coming from outside the region.
<P>    Visitors from all over the nation began arriving Friday at the Heartlander Country Resort, host of the event featuring back-to-back speakers from 8 a.m. until about 10 p.m.
<P>    Several dozen hikes and field trips led by park rangers and other experts are planned. Trips are expected to fill up fast during registration today, said Bob Easton, Pigeon Forge director of special events.
<P>    Every year the event&#39;s organizers plan more hikes and field trips but never seem to have enough, regardless of the weather, said Easton. Registration begins at  3 p.m. today at the Heartlander County Resort on the Parkway in Pigeon Forge. The Heartlander will be the site of most talks, slide shows and other non-outdoor events. 
<P>    The week begins officially at 5:30 p.m. with a reception, and a talk on wild bear research in the Smokies by Dr. Mike Pelton of the University of Tennessee.
<P>    Well-known nature photographer Ken Jenkins will present a slide show on the Smokies and Wildlife Week.
<P>    The evening will be capped off by two presentations on birds of prey. Robert Hatcher of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency will present a show and lecture &#39;&#39;Rise up on the Wings of Eagles.&#39;&#39; Al Cecere of the Foundation to Protect America&#39;s Eagles will follow with a presentation involving live birds, an event that has come to be one of the favorites at wildlife week.
<P>    Among the new presenters this year are Walker Calhoun, who will present legends, songs and dances of his Cherokee ancestry at 2 p.m. Tuesday; and national hummingbird experts Bob and Martha Sargent, who will present their program at  2 p.m. next Saturday, Jan 18.
<P>    Jenkins helped start Wilderness Wildlife Week six years ago. &#39;&#39;It was a one-day event with about 65 people,&#39;&#39; the photographer said.
<P>    Last year, more than 8,000 people attended, more than half of them from at least 100 miles away.  A few came from as far away as California.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>AK RIDGE -- After binding 10 family members with duct tape and cord, three men ransacked an Emory Valley home and stole a large amount of jewelry and cash Friday morning, police said.
<P>    The robbery at gunpoint occurred at the Dansworth Lane home of Vietnam native Huu Duc Dinh, founder of Oak Ridge-based American Technologies Inc., said Oak Ridge Police Department Detective Steve Speelman.
<P>    A similar robbery of another Vietnamese family living in Emory Valley occurred Nov. 16, when more than $20,000 in jewelry and cash was taken.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The pattern is the same,&#39;&#39; ORPD Lt. Jack Mansfield said. &#39;&#39;To us it looks like the same folks are involved.&#39;&#39;
<P>    In Friday&#39;s robbery, family members ranging in age from a 2-year-old boy to a couple in their 70s were bound while the robbers looted Dinh&#39;s home. Two family members were struck in the head by one of the robbers but didn&#39;t sustain serious injuries, Speelman said.
<P>    Speelman said eight family members were at home when the ski-masked trio came in the unlocked front door shortly after 8 a.m. Two other family members who arrived during the robbery also were tied up, Speelman said.
<P>    Family members said all three robbers spoke Vietnamese. The suspects spent from 30 to 45 minutes inside the residence searching for jewelry and money, Speelman said.
<P>    Mansfield estimated jewelry valued in the &#39;&#39;six-figure&#39;&#39; range was taken. Several diamond rings and a six-carat diamond necklace were stolen.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;re talking about high-dollar jewelry,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>    Speelman said the robbers fled in a dark-colored, early 1980s model station wagon.
<P>    The Nov. 16 robbery occurred at an apartment in Emory Valley. A Vietnamese woman was bound and gagged while two men, described as Vietnamese, stole money and jewelry, police said.

		</basefont><h3>Pregnant wowan charged with endangering fetus</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   A pregnant prostitute accused of injecting herself with crack cocaine was charged Friday with reckless endangerment, records show.
<P>   Tammy Lynn Moody, 32, who listed a Walker Boulevard address but told police she has been living out of her car, was booked into the Knox County Jail after she was released Friday afternoon from the University of Tennessee Medical Center.
<P>   Knoxville Police Department Investigator Edd Stair charged Moody in connection with a Jan. 4 incident in which Moody, whom police said was a prostitute, was seen by another prostitute allegedly injecting herself with crack cocaine.
<P>   The charge stems from allegations her actions could harm the fetus.
<P>   Moody also was served Friday with three outstanding warrants, including one for violation of probation, so she will not be allowed to post bond.

<P><h3>Judge with Blount ties reassigns Koella lawsuit</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   A federal judge in Knoxville has recused himself from presiding over a wrongful death lawsuit brought against state Sen. Carl Koella by the widow of an Ohio man.
<P>   U.S. District Judge James Jarvis, the chief judge for the federal Eastern District of Tennessee, recused himself from the case Thursday and reassigned it to U.S. District Judge Curtis Collier in Chattanooga.
<P>   No reason was given for the decision.
<P>   Jarvis is a longtime Blount County resident and a former judge there.
<P>   The other Knoxville-based federal judge, U.S. District Judge Leon Jordan, is also a Blount County resident.
<P>   Koella of Townsend has long represented Blount County in the state Legislature.
<P>   Joyce Heinz Barnard, the widow of Terry R. Barnard, filed the $15 million wrongful death action earlier this week.
<P>   Barnard, 52, of Huron was killed when Koella turned his van into the path of Barnard&#39;s motorcycle in October on U.S. Highway 321 in Townsend. The lawsuit claims Koella was negligent in the operation of his vehicle, and that resulted in Barnard&#39;s death.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Knoxville man accused of firing gun inside house</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   A North Knoxville man whom police said was in a drunken rage has been charged after he allegedly threatened friends with a gun and fired the weapon inside his house early Thursday, authorities said.
<P>   Curtis Butrum, 50, was charged with reckless endangerment in connection with the incident, which began just before 4 a.m. and ended more than an hour later, reports showed.
<P>   Knoxville Police Department spokesman Foster Arnett Jr. said Butrum had been drinking &#39;&#39;pure grain alcohol&#39;&#39; most of the morning when he went into a rage, breaking things inside his Gratz Street house. Butrum allegedly brandished a .38-caliber handgun and threatened to kill the other occupants of the house, according to Arnett.
<P>   Two of those occupants fled the home and called police, he said.
<P>   Arnett said Butrum remained inside the house with two other people when three shots were heard. KPD&#39;s Special Operations Squad leader Lt. Jim Kennedy was called to the site and &#39;&#39;banged on the door very loudly for several minutes,&#39;&#39; Arnett said.
<P>   Butrum was arrested when one of the occupants opened the door, Arnett said.

		<h3>Comcast to control E!</h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>    NEW YORK -- Comcast Corp. announced Friday it has won the right to buy Time Warner Inc.&#39;s controlling stake in E! Entertainment Television, the celebrity news cable network, for $321 million.
<P>    Comcast, the nation&#39;s fourth-largest cable company, is one of five cable operators that are partners in the network. The partners late last year triggered a provision in their partnership agreement allowing for a change of control.
<P>    They still have about a month to resolve the issue.
<P>    Under the provision, each of the four minority partners can buy out Time Warner&#39;s 58.4 percent ownership stake, sell their combined stake to Time Warner or decide to leave the ownership structure unchanged.
<P>    Comcast emerged after talks with the partners with the right to buy out Time Warner. It will now decide whether to proceed with a purchase.
<P>    If Comcast chooses to buy out Time Warner, bringing its stake to 68.8 percent, it will also have the right to buy out the other partners after five years.
<P>    For Comcast, which is based in Philadelphia and has 4.3 million subscribers, the purchase would represent yet another expansion in cable programming.
<P>    The company recently took control of the Philadelphia Flyers and 76ers with an eye toward airing games on its own sports network, which is scheduled to debut in fall 1997. Comcast recently purchased Scripps Howard Cable in Knoxville.
<P>
<P><h3>Hyatt Regency gets new GM </h3>
<P>
<P>   Tom Mason has been named general manager at the Hyatt Regency Knoxville.
<P>   It is the first general manager assignment for the 37-year-old, who comes to Knoxville from Chicago, where he was corporate director of the rooms division for Hyatt Hotels.
<P>   He has been with Hyatt for 15 years.
<P>   He replaces Patrick Donnelly, who served as general manager for 21 months and recently relocated to Milwaukee, Wis., to take a general manager&#39;s position there.
<P>   Mason and his wife, Pam, have three children.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he latest episode of &#39;&#39;As the Cherokees Turn,&#39;&#39; the East Coast Hockey League soap opera starring suspended scoring machine Kyle Reeves, could take a new twist.
<P>   Knoxville coach Barry Smith tried to peddle the 29-goal scorer to the Jacksonville Lizard Kings in a four-player trade Monday. But Reeves, who got into a heated shouting match with Smith and left the team during the first intermission of a game against the Roanoke Express a week ago, chose not to report and scuttled the deal.
<P>   Smith said following the Cherokees&#39; 5-3 loss Thursday night to the Hampton Roads Admirals -- Knoxville&#39;s 13th defeat in the last 14 games -- he was attempting to send Reeves to a team he&#39;d agree to play for.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I hope in the next day or so to have something done for Reeves,&#39;&#39; Smith said. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve been working on it. We&#39;re trying to accommodate him and get the players I need.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Reeves and little-used defenseman Ron Paleczny were to go to the Lizard Kings, who are in last place in the South Division. The Cherokees would get rookie defenseman Tobias Ablad and forward Francois Leroux in return.
<P>   A possible alternative destination for Reeves might be the Louisiana IceGators. The IceGators (14-17-3) are in seventh place in the South, but nine of their losses are forfeits. The league penalized Louisiana for using one more veteran (players with 200 or more games of professional experience) than rules allow.
<P>   Doug Sheddon, coach and director of player personnel of the IceGators, is doing everything he can to overcome the stiff penalty imposed by the ECHL. Not only does he want to qualify for the playoffs, but he wants to overtake first-place Tallahassee.
<P>   Louisiana recently reacquired the rights to goalie Bryan Schoen which would make Sergei Tkachenko (5-2-1, 4.25 goals-against average) expendable.
<P>   The IceGators are at the veteran limit (four), so if Reeves were brought on board, another veteran would have to be let go. Defenseman Jack Williams (two goals, two assists and 11 penalty minutes in four games with the IceGators) is likely to be the odd man out.
<P>   But so much for speculation. The facts aren&#39;t so nebulous.
<P>   The Cherokees have disintegrated since defenseman Kent Fearns was loaned to the Las Vegas Thunder of the International League. Coupled with an injury to captain Wayne Anchikoski and the loss of Reeves, the team has started struggling on offense as well as defense.
<P>   However, the Cherokees showed signs of life against the Admirals. Consider:
<P>   *  Knoxville held Hampton Roads scoreless for the first 18 minutes and 11 seconds before a turnover and a coverage breakdown resulted in two backbreaking goals 69 seconds apart to wipe out a 1-0 lead.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They were mistakes on our part and the guys shouldn&#39;t be making those mistakes,&#39;&#39; Smith said. &#39;&#39;We had good coverage, broke down and they took advantage of it.&#39;&#39;
<P>   * Goaltender Trent Cavicchi came back from injury and played well.
<P>   * The power play was 1-for-4 and had several other good chances.
<P>   * Los Angeles Kings farmhand Stephane Soulliere contributed two goals.
<P>   * The penalty-killers looked as good as they have at any time this season in foiling a four-minute disadvantage. While Dan Chaput was in the box for high-sticking, Jim Brown had two short-handed scoring chances and forechecked the Admirals out of their skates along with Martin Tanguay and Matt Turek.
<P>   * The Cherokees, although frustrated, have shown no signs of quitting on the coach or themselves.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve got to continue to work,&#39;&#39; Smith said. &#39;&#39;Nobody said it was going to be easy getting out of this thing and Hampton Roads is a good hockey team.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The only mistake the Cherokees made was allowing Victor Gervais, one of the league&#39;s all-time leading scorers, from speeding through their defensive zone unchecked. He burned them three times.
<P>   Tonight&#39;s game against the Raleigh IceCaps -- the only team Knoxville has beaten during its freefall -- at Civic Coliseum is arguably the biggest game to date.
<P>   A victory and the Cherokees will terminate a six-game slide, including five on home ice. It also would move them two points closer to the sixth-place IceCaps.
<P>   But more importantly, it would give them a jolt of confidence. Another defeat and they would have to ask themselves this question: If you can&#39;t beat Raleigh (13-19-3) at home, who can you beat?
<P>   The answer is very disconcerting.

		<h3>Edwards picks returns to Georgia over NFL</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>    Georgia running back <B>Robert Edwards </B>said Friday he plans to return for his senior season. But Georgia Tech is losing its top rusher, <B>C.J. Williams.</B>
<P>    Williams, who ranks fourth on the Yellow Jackets&#39; career rushing list, surprisingly entered his name for the NFL draft despite an injury-plagued season in which he gained only 663 yards.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I think he&#39;s making a big mistake,&#39;&#39; Tech coach <B>George O&#39;Leary </B>said Thursday of Williams&#39; decision. &#39;&#39;I think C.J. needs to stay one more year to mature.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Edwards, a junior who rushed for 800 yards last season but briefly lost his starting job because of fumbling problems, decided he needed another year of college even though he is set to graduate this summer.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I feel that I have some unfinished business here and I want to help Georgia get back on the map,&#39;&#39; Edwards said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s not about the money, but playing for fun and having fun at Georgia.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Edwards, who should earn a degree in consumer economics in June, may pursue a second degree in the real estate or housing fields. For that reason, he&#39;s not concerned about getting hurt on the football field and ruining his NFL hopes.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Everything happens for a reason, but I will have my degree,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;I will be the first person in my family to earn a college degree. I can&#39;t do anything about getting hurt.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Also declaring for the NFL draft was defensive end <B>Derrick Rodgers,</B> who helped Arizona State go 11-0 during the regular season and reach its first Rose Bowl in a decade.
<P>
<P><h3>In other college football news:</h3>
<P>* <B>Earl Young,</B> a backup defensive back for Fresno State, died Thursday after he collapsed while walking to class. Young, 21, of Marrero, La., complained of breathing difficulties to a passerby and was rushed by ambulance to a hospital, where he died a short time later. Authorities did not issue a cause of death.
<P>* <B>Kent Green </B>has been named the new offensive coordinator at Tusculum College. He was offensive coordinator at Middle Georgia College, which went 10-2 this past season and was ranked seventh nationally.
<P>* West coach <B>Ted Tollner&#39;s </B>problem today in the East-West Shrine all-star game today in Stanford, Calif.: Find playing time for quarterbacks <B>Jake Plummer </B>of Arizona State, <B>Steve Sarkisian </B>of BYU and <B>Pat Barnes </B>of California. The East will be quarterbacked by <B>Marcus Crandell </B>of East Carolina and <B>Lance Funderburk </B>of Valdosta State.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Randy Kenner, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he family of an Ohio motorcyclist killed when state Sen. Carl Koella turned into his path last October has filed a $15 million wrongful death lawsuit against the Blount County legislator.
<P>   Joyce Heinz Barnard, the widow of Terry R. Barnard and the administratrix of his estate, filed the action in federal court here late Wednesday afternoon.
<P>   Barnard, 52, of Huron, Ohio, suffered fatal injuries when he struck the right rear side of Koella&#39;s van on U.S. Highway 321 in Townsend and careened into another vehicle on Oct. 22, 1996.
<P>   The lawsuit contends that Koella&#39;s actions directly led to the fatal accident.
<P>   &#39;&#39;At and immediately prior to the time of collision that caused the death of Terry R. Barnard, the minivan was being operated in a negligent manner by the defendant Koella,&#39;&#39; the lawsuit states. &#39;&#39;Such negligence was the proximate cause of the collision. . . .&#39;&#39;
<P>   Knoxville lawyer Sidney Gilreath represents Joyce Barnard.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s an unfortunate event for the family, and they just want to see that justice is done in the court system,&#39;&#39; he said
<P>   According to police reports, Koella stopped only briefly following the accident before proceeding on to his residence. He was later charged with leaving the scene of a fatal accident and faces a hearing on the misdemeanor charge later this month.
<P>   Koella said in a statement the following day that he heard a &#39;&#39;thunk&#39;&#39; and thought he had perhaps &#39;&#39;run over a rock or something on the side of the road.&#39;&#39;
<P>   He said he noticed what appeared to be an accident on the other side of the road after stopping to examine his van, but after finding no damage, he left.
<P>   Koella, did however, stop to tell Grady Lindsey at the Tuckaleechee Campground -- the wreck occurred at the entrance to the campground from 321 -- that an accident had occurred but he wasn&#39;t involved.
<P>   A closer examination of the van by Koella and Lindsey, a friend of Koella&#39;s who manages the campground, revealed tire marks on the right rear of the van, according to Lindsey. Koella subsequently called authorities.
<P>  Following the incident, Koella said he was innocent of leaving the scene of the accident, and his lawyer, Jerry Cunningham, said he was looking for a witness who indicated that Barnard was driving recklessly and speeding.
<P>   Cunningham indicated that Koella neither saw Barnard nor realized that Barnard had hit the van. Cunningham said Thursday he had not seen the lawsuit and couldn&#39;t comment on it.
<P>   But he added, &#39;&#39;I have a witness relative to the speed and to his (Barnard&#39;s) passing three vehicles at one time.&#39;&#39;
<P>   When asked how fast Barnard was going, Cunningham replied, &#39;&#39;I&#39;m talking 80 miles per hour, estimated.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Gilreath, however, noted that even if someone is speeding you still can&#39;t pull into their path if you see them.
<P>   &#39;&#39;But we have witnesses that said he wasn&#39;t going too fast,&#39;&#39; Gilreath said.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Rebecca Ferrar, News-Sentinel Nashville bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- If Tennesseans want death row inmates executed, it will cost more money, legislators were told Thursday.
<P>    Tennessee Supreme Court Justice Adolpho A. Birch Jr. said spending $2 million to &#39;&#39;opt in&#39;&#39; to a federal law would speed up federal appeals of death penalty cases.
<P>    Birch testified before the legislative committee looking into why the death penalty has not been carried out in Tennessee since the law was re-enacted in 1977.
<P>    And Post Conviction Defender Donald Dawson, who defends death row inmates, said pumping more money into better defense attorney work would avoid trial errors and the subsequent reversals of verdicts.
<P>    &#39;&#39;If Tennessee wants to have a death penalty, Tennessee has to decide it&#39;s time to pay,&#39;&#39; Dawson said.
<P>    House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh, D-Covington, said $2 million &#39;&#39;does not seem excessive.&#39;&#39; The Legislature convenes Tuesday and will take up the budget next month.
<P>    The $2 million would permit Tennessee to participate in the federal Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.
<P>    The law passed by Congress last spring establishes a six-month statute of limitation for filing federal appeals of the death penalty, permits federal district courts six months to dispose of the appeals and allows another four months for federal appellate courts to dispose of appeals.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The death penalty has been a dominant political issue in Tennessee,&#39;&#39; Birch said. &#39;&#39;The focus of this issue has been the judicial branch of state government. However, less than half of 1 percent of the state budget is dedicated to funding the courts, despite the amount of income we generate.&#39;&#39;
<P>    He also noted that in 1995, at Gov. Don Sundquist&#39;s urging, the Capital Case Resource Center was abolished. The center funded lawyers with state and federal money who defended death row inmates and was replaced by the Post Conviction Defender&#39;s Office. 
<P>    &#39;&#39;One certain way to ensure delay in death penalty cases is to eliminate or reduce the adequacy of legal representation for criminal defendants,&#39;&#39; Birch said.
<P>    To speed up appeals, Birch said the high court closely monitors death penalty cases, assigning new judges to cases where needed.
<P>    In addition to funding, Birch blamed some of the &#39;&#39;unjustifiable delay&#39;&#39; in carrying out the death penalty on the &#39;&#39;heightened review&#39;&#39; by the Court of Criminal Appeals.
<P>    He further blamed delays by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which many victims rights&#39; advocates have attacked for being opposed to the death penalty. Those advocates also have criticized the state Supreme Court as too liberal on the death penalty and helped defeat former Justice Penny White in last year&#39;s election.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Since 1984, no death penalty conviction in a Tennessee case has completed federal review through the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals,&#39;&#39; Birch said.
<P>    Dawson stressed the importance of assuring a sound defense at the trial level. He cited a case in which the death penalty was reversed because the defendant&#39;s attorney prepared only 17 hours for trial.
<P>    Tennessee&#39;s law also is &#39;&#39;constitutionally vague,&#39;&#39; he said. For example, persons may only be convicted of the death penalty if found guilty of felony murder. That means he or she must have committed the murder during the commission of a separate felony.
<P>    Dawson said prosecutors often use aspects of the murder to enhance the conviction and, thus, the verdict is reversed.
<P>    &#39;&#39;There&#39;s going to be a death penalty, but let&#39;s get it fair,&#39;&#39; he said.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>AK RIDGE -- The Y-12 nuclear weapons plant completed its first delivery of modified parts for the B-61 bomb ahead of schedule, a plant spokeswoman said Thursday.
<P>    Patricia Greeson said the bomb components were delivered in mid-December, a couple of weeks before the program&#39;s deadline.
<P>    Although Y-12 no longer produces warhead parts for new weapon systems, some replacements or modifications are manufactured at the Oak Ridge facility.
<P>    Units for the B-61, Mod-11, a modified version of an atomic bomb that&#39;s been in the U.S. arsenal for decades, were one of the first production jobs to be conducted at Y-12 since operations returned to normal.
<P>    A &#39;&#39;stand-down&#39;&#39; went into effect at Y-12 in late 1994 because of problems identified during an inspection by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, although some weapons activities continued with special approvals. Processing of enriched uranium is the only Y-12 operation still bound by the stand-down order.
<P>    Greeson said Y-12 has met or exceeded delivery timetables many times in years past, but the B-61 delivery was special because of the hard work and preparations involved. Since the 1994 stand-down, employees have undergone thousands of hours of training, and safety procedures were revised throughout the plant.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This is a morale boost for our employees to see how good they still are,&#39;&#39; the Y- 12 spokeswoman said. &#39;&#39;It feels really good.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Additional deliveries of B-61 parts will be made later this year, Greeson said. She declined to release dates or number of parts involved. 
<P>    The B-61 is sometimes known as the &#39;&#39;granddaddy&#39;&#39; of atomic bombs because it has been in the arsenal so long.
<P>    Y-12 is engaged in other weapons tasks, including production of &#39;&#39;limited-life&#39;&#39; components for Trident II warheads, as well as retrofit projects for the Peacekeeper system.

        <font size="5">E</font>ast Tennessee dodged Mother
        Nature's icy bullet, but she appears to be reloading. </p>
        <p>For Knoxville, upper East Tennessee and the Cumberland
        Plateau, the National Weather Service is forecasting a 30
        percent chance of snow today with steadily falling
        temperatures this afternoon. There is only a 20 percent
        chance of snow in the Chattanooga area. </p>
        <p>There is a slight possibility any snowfall today will
        come on top of some already on the ground. The NWS said
        there was a 30 percent chance of rain or snow overnight. </p>
        <p>The high temperature today is expected to be in the
        low to mid-30s. The predicted low Saturday morning is in
        the teens. </p>
        <p>Forecasters had thought there might be a layer of
        sleet and ice over the area by late Wednesday night or
        early Thursday morning. However, the temperature remained
        in the mid-30s. The low at Knoxville Thursday morning was
        34. </p>
        <p>There may be a brief respite from the gloomy weather
        Sunday when the sun may peep through the clouds. But it
        won't last long, the forecasters say. The outlook for
        Monday is mostly cloudy skies with a chance of snow or
        freezing rain. </p>
        <p>U.S. Highway 441 across the Great Smoky Mountains
        between Gatlinburg and Cherokee, N.C., is the only road
        that has been closed by the weather. </p>
        <p>Although East Tennessee escaped the bad weather
        Wednesday night and Thursday morning, Signal Mountain, 10
        miles northwest of Chattanooga, was hammered by heavy
        ice. Officials said ice-laden tree branches fell across
        power lines and left hundreds of electric customers
        without power. Service was restored by midmorning
        Thursday. </p>
        <p>The Tennessee Highway Patrol reported many roads in
        Middle and West Tennessee were slick and treacherous for
        travelers. A Kentucky woman was killed Wednesday when she
        lost control of her car on icy U.S. Highway 45 near Union
        City and it crashed into a tractor-trailer truck. </p>

<P>   A Knox County grand jury now will consider whether to indict Dana Louise Solomon, 21, and Thomas Edward Chambers, 19. Knox County General Sessions Court Judge Geoff Emery sent the charges on to the grand jury with the consent of defense lawyers and the prosecution.
<P>   Solomon and Chambers are accused of killing Clyde Milton Solomon III, 23, on Dec. 26 at the Black Oak Mobile Home Park, 3700 Rifle Range Road. Investigators allege the couple have admitted planning to lure Clyde Solomon to the trailer, which they shared, to commit murder.
<P>   Clyde Solomon went to the home to visit his toddler son. When he arrived, Solomon told him the boy was not present and that he should come back later in the afternoon, Knox County investigators allege.
<P>   When Clyde Solomon returned, his estranged wife stepped out and he went in the trailer. An argument broke out between Clyde Solomon and Chambers and Clyde Solomon was shot with a shotgun.
<P>   Solomon and Chambers each are being held in the Knox County Jail on $200,000 bond.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he public comment phase of the Cherokee National Forest plan revision process has come and gone, leaving the U.S. Forest Service with over 700 letters to read.
<P>   The 120-day comment period ended Dec. 2, giving citizens their first opportunity to provide input into a planning process that will determine how the 632,348-acre Cherokee National Forest will be managed over the next decade.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The comments and petitions we received reflect a broad cross section of views on how the forest should be managed,&#39;&#39; said Keith Sandifer, U.S. Forest Service planner.
<P>   On Monday, Jan. 13, Forest Service planners will begin analyzing each written comment. A summary of the issues will be out by the end of March, followed by a draft forest management plan and environmental impact statement in about a year.
<P>   Sandifer said a final land management plan for the Cherokee National Forest should be completed next year.
<P>   The U.S. Forest Service is required by law to update its land management plans for each of its national forests every 10 to 15 years.
<P>    The Cherokee National Forest is one of five national forests in the Southern Appalachian region currently revising its plan.
<P>   Sandifer said the written comments reviewed so far indicate a growing interest in recreation on the Cherokee National Forest.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve seen a significant number of letters from folks interested in greater access,&#39;&#39; said Sandifer. &#39;&#39;These include horseback riders, mountain bikers and people who ride all-terrain-vehicles.
<P>   &#39;&#39;And then there are folks who&#39;d like to see less access but more areas for primitive-type recreational experiences. This isn&#39;t a voting process; what it boils down to is the capability of the forest to support a particular activity, or mix of activities.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Pete Kirby, southeast regional director of the Wilderness Society, said the Forest Service is seeking greater participation from the public this time around than it did for the current plan developed 10 years ago.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The process is much improved,&#39;&#39; said Kirby. &#39;&#39;There has been a great deal of learning among the public about the planning process, and people have gotten involved.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Kirby said the upcoming plan will benefit from the Southern Appalachian Assessment, an inventory of conditions on private as well as public lands that allows national forest decisions to be made in context of the overall landscape.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The Forest Service has taken care of the basics,&#39;&#39; said Kirby. &#39;&#39;They&#39;ve inventoried potential old-growth and roadless areas not identified 10 years ago, and they&#39;ve switched to eco-system management to better sustain the eco-system of the Southern Appalachians.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Knoxville Zoo will announce today that Kroger is giving both money and promotional help to build the zoo&#39;s new African lion exhibit &#39;&#39;Pridelands.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The half-acre natural habitat exhibit is set to open Monday, April 10. The zoo&#39;s three-man design crew has renovated an old lion exhibit once circled by chainlink fence into an area surrounded by manmade but realistic rocks.
<P>   John Wade, Tennessee Department of Tourism Development commissioner, is scheduled to attend today&#39;s 10 a.m. press conference at the zoo.
<P>   Kroger&#39;s $30,000 donation will help fund the exhibit&#39;s first phase of $125,000. The zoo earlier received a $25,000 construction grant from the non-profit, Knoxville-based Aslan Foundation. But the park still needs to net another $70,000 to help pay for &#39;&#39;Pridelands&#39;&#39; first phase.
<P>   Zoo officials hope to raise that money by selling $100 to $1,000 tiles that can be decorated with animals and/or inscribed with donors&#39; names. Those tiles will be embedded in a wall at the exhibit.
<P>   Kroger also made a year-long commitment to several promotional ties with the zoo, said Nancy Young, the park&#39;s marketing and development director. Those tie-ins include placing the &#39;&#39;Pridelands&#39;&#39; logo on area Kroger grocery bags and decorating storefronts with &#39;&#39;Pridelands&#39;&#39; art, she said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Their partnership has been terrific,&#39;&#39; Young said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The Knoxville Zoo is an integral part of our community,&#39;&#39; said Hunter MacWilliams, area manager for the Kroger Company. &#39;&#39;All of our Kroger associates throughout East Tennessee are very proud and excited to be part of the new African lion exhibit.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The zoo hopes to acquire three young African lions for the exhibit next month. The Aslan Foundation has donated another $25,000 to help buy the animals. Zoo officials hope to acquire two young lions from South Africa and will likely find the third at another U.S. zoo.
<P>   In addition, the zoo will be working to fund the project&#39;s second phase that includes a new off-exhibit holding building. Young said the second phase raises the exhibit&#39;s total cost to $207,000.
<P>   The lion exhibit will be the latest in a series of renovated or new natural habitat areas constructed almost totally by the zoo design crew.
<P>   Lions have a historical importance for the zoo. A lion named Joshua was the impetus for changing the zoo from a roadside menagerie into an accredited facility.
<P>   The late Guy Smith III bought the lion cub Joshua in 1970. When Joshua grew too large for his home, Smith took the animal to the zoo. Zoo conditions were so poor at the time that Smith, then a television executive, decided to improve the failing attraction. His efforts led him to become zoo director, a post he held until his death in 1987.
<P>   Joshua lived at the zoo until his death in 1989 at the age of 19.

<P>   SEVIERVILLE -- Three Gatlinburg residents are among 11 investors from Tennessee, Ohio, Mississippi and the Carolinas suing a group of Tunica, Miss., developers for $70 million.
<P>   The lawsuit also is asking for commissions Gatlinburg real-estate agents received.
<P>   The lawsuit filed in Sevier County Circuit Court said 11 investors gave the developers $250,000 each to build motels in the gambling-casino boom town on the Tennessee-Mississippi border. The suit also says they paid $19,000 each for operating costs.
<P>    The lawsuit indicates some of the investors took money from their retirement accounts to invest in the two motels.
<P>    The motels were never constructed, the suit said.
<P>    According to a summary brief filed with the lawsuit, Gatlinburg residents Lloyd and Betty Link, doing business as Link and Associates, held a meeting in Gatlinburg during 1993 to solicit new customers for purchases of real estate owned by Tunica, Miss., developers.
<P>    The lawsuit estimates that 11 investors in the two proposed motels responded and that in addition to their actual initial investments, each plaintiff lost $50,000 per month in potential earnings. The three investors from Gatlinburg are Darlene Reiner and Arthur and Glenda Creek
<P>    H. Earl Allen III, one of the defendants who is described as a &#39;&#39;promoter&#39;&#39; by the lawsuit, is also from Tennessee.

		</basefont><h3>Two wanted on Maryland charges waive extradition</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   Two men wanted for sexually abusing boys in Maryland waived extradition from Tennessee on Thursday in Knox County General Sessions Court.
<P>   Samuel L. Glover, 49, and Marshall M. Kirkpatrick, 32, were arrested Tuesday in Knoxville. The fugitives were featured in November in an episode of TV&#39;s &#39;&#39;Unsolved Mysteries.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Knox County authorities said they expect Maryland officials to pick up the men soon.
<P>   Glover and Kirkpatrick, who allegedly posed as father and son, face more than two dozen sexual assault and child abuse charges in Carroll County, Md., in incidents involving three victims. The abuse is alleged to have occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
<P>

<P>
<P><h3>Knox school board votes to reinstate 2 students</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   The Knox County school board voted unanimously Wednesday to reinstate Whitney Davidson, the West High School student expelled a year ago for carrying a friend&#39;s trick cane into Powell Middle School.
<P>   The cane contained a sword, and possession of it on school grounds violated the school system&#39;s zero-tolerance policy toward weapons. The board expelled Davidson and her friend for one year.
<P>   Davidson&#39;s father, lawyer Bill Davidson, unsuccessfully sued the school system after the expulsion. He and the Powell High School student who owned the cane expressed regret for the incident Wednesday and with the one-year expulsion served, the board reinstated the students.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Good luck this year and welcome back,&#39;&#39; board Chairwoman Margaret Maddox told both students.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Robbery charges against men sent to grand jury</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   A grand jury will consider aggravated robbery charges against two young Knoxville men, a judge ruled Thursday.
<P>   Knox County General Sessions Court Judge Geoff Emery, after a preliminary hearing, said he thought there was probable cause to believe Zavian R. Hill, 19, and Donald E. McCoy, 19, robbed a woman at gunpoint early Nov. 27 at a Weigel&#39;s convenience store at 3900 Pleasant Ridge Road.
<P>   Police stopped Hill and McCoy near the store in a Mercury within minutes after the woman was robbed by two masked men, testimony showed. Inside the car they found a telephone and wallet organizer taken from the victim.
<P>   Last year, Hill, McCoy and McCoy&#39;s cousin, Bobby A. McCoy, were among several young men charged in the Feb. 19 drive-by slaying of Samuel Martin. In September, authorities dropped the charges against the trio in Sessions Court.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Body of woman found along I-75 in Campbell</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   JACKSBORO -- The Campbell County Sheriff&#39;s Department was investigating the apparent slaying of a woman whose body was found near Interstate 75 on Thursday afternoon.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>onsumers bought up clothes, jewelry and home furnishings this Christmas, but otherwise watched their spending, handing many of the nation&#39;s retailers a disappointing holiday season.
<P>   Goody&#39;s Family Clothing, with its new merchandising strategy now firmly in place, reported comparable store sales up 16 percent for November and December combined.
<P>   Proffitt&#39;s Inc.&#39;s same-store sales rose 3 percent for the period, about what the Alcoa-based retailer had planned. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brad Martin  described the sales as &#39;&#39;solid,&#39;&#39; and the company is comfortable with previous per share earnings estimates of $2.24 for the year.
<P>   Across the country, strong results were reported by many upscale retailers and discounters outpacing weak sales at some department stores and apparel chains.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Moderate growth in the economy translates into moderate retail sales,&#39;&#39; said Wayne Hood, a retail analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. in Atlanta. 
<P>    The Salomon Brothers retail index, the investment firm&#39;s barometer of sales performance, rose 6.1 percent last month after a 3.9 percent gain in November. In December 1995, the index rose 1.8 percent.
<P>    Because of the late Thanksgiving this year, retailers used different measures to report their holiday sales. Some merchants reported four-week results ending the last days of December. Others are comparing the five weeks ended Jan. 4 to the five weeks ended Jan. 6, 1996, while some are comparing the five weeks ended Jan. 4 with the month ended Dec. 30, 1996.
<P>   Goody&#39;s Family Clothing said sales in December totaled $145.9 million, up 18.9 percent over last year. For November, the moderately-priced apparel chain reported sales of $71 million, up 28.9 percent. Same store sales were up 18.9 percent in December, and up 7.6 percent in November.
<P>   Proffitt&#39;s Inc. said for the combined November and December period, company sales were $547.4 million, a 45 percent increase, including $170.6 million in sales from its newly acquired Parisian stores. For the two-month period, comparable stores sales increased 4 percent at the Proffitt&#39;s and Younkers divisions; were flat at McRae&#39;s; and decreased 1 percent at Parisian.
<P>    May Department Stores Co. said its same-store sales for the five-weeks ended Jan. 4 rose 2.7 percent and total sales gained 8.8 percent. Gap Inc. said its same-store sales for the five-week period ended Jan. 4 rose 2 percent, while total business was up 14 percent.
<P>    Apparel retailer Limited Inc. said same-store sales for the five-week period ended Jan. 4 fell 1 percent and total sales rose 7 percent.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Pam Park, News-Sentinel business writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT>AS VEGAS -- A Federal Communications Commission endorsement of standards for high definition television has opened the door for Philips Consumer Electronics Co. to launch an HDTV product by late 1997 or early 1998, company&#39;s president announced at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas Thursday.
<P>   More than 80,000 were expected for the annual show, which brings together retail buying and consumer electronics suppliers and manufacturers. The show started Thursday and continues through Sunday.
<P>Robert Minkhorst said Philips was among the founders of the Grand Alliance that began a struggle  to establish standards for this new technology nine years ago. With industry standards for the products in place, the door is open for creative business models in interactive television, he said.
<P>Minkhorst expects the 230 million televisions in American homes to be replaced with these digital movie-quality televisions in 7 to 10 years. 
<P>Another new product from Philips is the Digital Video Disc player headed for retail stores in spring.
<P>    It is expected to cost about $600. DVD&#39;s introduction has been delayed by lack of commitment from content providers who must provide a sufficient number of entertainment and movie options to make this new format viable. Manufacturers now feel they have  sufficient support from video, audio and software providers to begin marketing the machines.
<P>Content providers such as Polygram are expected to announce DVD titles in the second or third quarter.
<P>Doug Dunn, chairman and chief executive officer of the consumer electronics division of Dutch Electronics giant, Philips NV, the Knoxville company&#39;s parent, said he expected 250 million laser-based devices to be on the market by the turn of the century. He thinks as many as 10 percent of those will be DVD products.
<P>The Philips Magnavox Internet TV Terminal for WebTV hit sales floors in September and is selling in numbers beyond internal projections, Minkhorst said.
<P>The terminal allows consumers to access the Internet through their home televisions and costs about $400 including a cordless keyboard.
<P>Some 97 percent of  purchasers have expressed total satisfaction with the product, Minkhorst said.
<P>Minkhorst says of the people who bought WebTV, 60 percent had never been on the Internet before.
<P>Philips sees opportunities for the product, since its research shows that of the 65 percent of the  American public that does not own a personal computer, 40 percent are interested in getting on the Internet, Minkhorst said.
<P>Philips Consumer Communications, a player in the European cellular phone industry,  announced plans to aggressively compete in the United States market.
<P>     At the Consumer Electronics Show, PCC  announced several new communications products for the United States market. They include a hand-held personal computer and a screen phone with built-in computational power. PCC intends to take advantage of Philips&#39; technological experience and its brand strength to win a place in the United States market, said Mike McTighe, general manager.
<P>Philips has headquartered PCC&#39;s American operations in Dallas. The product development center is in Fremont, Calif. -- close to another Philips research and development facility in Sunnydale, Calif.

		<h3>SunTrust earnings up 9.4%</h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>   SunTrust Banks Inc. said its fourth-quarter earnings rose 9.4 percent on strong loan growth and increased fees from customer accounts and trust services.
<P>   The nation&#39;s 19th-largest bank company said fourth-quarter net income rose to $158.5 million, or 72 cents a share, from $144.9 million, or 64 cents, in the same period last year.
<P>   That beat the average estimate of 71 cents a share of 20 analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc. 
<P>   Net interest income rose $28.3 million to $472.2 million in the fourth quarter from a year earlier as loans and securities rose 11.1 percent to $45.2 billion.  Noninterest income, led by service fees on accounts and trusts, rose 15 percent to $207 million from $179.4 million. 
<P>   Net income for 1996 rose $51.1 million, or 9 percent, to $616.6 million, or $2.76 a share, a record for the company. SunTrust Banks of Tennessee contributed $100.1 million to the total, up from $88.5 million in 1995

<P><h3>Civic center studied</h3>
<P>
<P>   LEBANON -- Chamber of Commerce officials are studying the feasibility of building a civic center.
<P>    It would seat up to 9,000 for concerts and could also be used for trade shows and conventions.
<P>    Chamber of Commerce officials have begun making trips to study such centers in other cities.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We don&#39;t have a facility that will seat over 300 people,&#39;&#39; said Mark Lee, the chamber president. &#39;&#39;At the Agricultural Center, they are turning groups away.&#39;&#39;
<P>    He said he hopes both public and private funds could be used to finance the center.
<P>
<P><h3>Disney extends Eisner pact</h3>
<P>
<P>    LOS ANGELES -- Walt Disney Co. has extended Michael D. Eisner&#39;s contract as chairman and chief executive for 10 years and granted him 8 million stock options it valued at $195 million.
<P>    Eisner also has stock options he can exercise at any time that Disney valued at $303 million as of Sept. 30, 1996, when the new contract took effect. The company valued other options not yet exercisable by Eisner at an additional $61 million.
<P>    The disclosures, made Thursday in Disney&#39;s proxy for its annual meeting next month, seemed certain to stir up more questions about whether the company&#39;s executive compensation is excessive.
<P>    The company proxy also confirmed that, as previously reported by The Associated Press, the severance awarded Michael Ovitz for 14 months as Disney president was $38.8 million in cash and options to buy 3 million Disney shares at $57 a share.
<P>
<P><h3>Names in the news</h3>

<P>   <B>Kellie Jolly&#39;s </B>preseason knee injury was not season-ending after all. The sophomore guard has been released by <B>Dr. William Youmans,</B> UT&#39;s orthopedic specialist, and returned to full practice Thursday.
<P>   Jolly, who is back on the court about three months after her Oct. 14 surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee, could play in a game as early as Sunday against Kentucky.
<P>   &#39;&#39;If this had been a couple of weeks later, I&#39;d have been in a mental struggle,&#39;&#39; Jolly said, referring to choosing between a redshirt season and a comeback. &#39;&#39;I&#39;m still giving up a half year for this team. I want to come back.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Lady Vols trainer <B>Jenny Moshak </B>said no timetable is in place for Jolly&#39;s return to game action. That comeback will be determined by how Jolly&#39;s knee responds to more practice.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> group of junior varsity cheerleaders disciplined for alleged use of alcohol on a December school trip will remain suspended through the current academic year, Jefferson County officials decided Wednesday.
<P>   Parents of the seven girls accused of &#39;&#39;possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages&#39;&#39; had an opportunity at Tuesday night&#39;s Jefferson County School Board meeting to appeal the disciplinary action, an official said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We had the regular board meeting, then heard from all these parents and everyone who wished to have input,&#39;&#39; Dr. Steve Burcham said on behalf of Superintendent Ken Scott, who was unavailable on Wednesday. Burcham is the school system&#39;s supervisor of elementary instruction.
<P>   &#39;&#39;All of (the parents) appealed the decision made by the disciplinary hearing committee and the board heard all their cases, and it was past midnight by the time they&#39;d decided to uphold the disciplinary hearing committee&#39;s decision.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Affected parents initially could have appealed the matter to the school board at its regular December meeting, Burcham said. That meeting, however, had to be cancelled when a minimum number of board members were unable to attend.
<P>   Parents who had to leave before Tuesday&#39;s meeting concluded were able to call officials Wednesday morning to learn their daughters would remain suspended.
<P>   The students involved were in Nashville for a cheerleading competition Dec. 7-8, according to Burcham. He said the trip occurred about the time the varsity cheerleading squad also was in Nashville for Jefferson County High&#39;s participation in a state championship football game.
<P>   None of the varsity cheerleaders apparently was involved in the incident.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The trip the junior varsity cheerleaders were on had nothing to do with the football game,&#39;&#39; Burcham  said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Apparently, there was evidence that the young ladies involved had violated policy against possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages at any school function.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Burcham said he couldn&#39;t provide details of the offenses or what further recourse is available to affected students.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">K</FONT>nox County school officials are leaving it up to County Executive Tommy Schumpert and County Commission to decide how much money to spend on school construction for the next five years.
<P>   The school board voted 7-1 Wednesday to send three options to Schumpert -- a $110.9 million base request, $115.9 million that will get some projects done sooner and a top request of $181 million.
<P>   The building program -- a source of conflict between the school board and commission for several years -- aims to keep pace with growing enrollments, to upgrade deteriorating schools from the defunct city system and to provide facilities for magnet programs aimed at desegregating the schools.
<P>   Some commissioners already have indicated the school board&#39;s top request is unlikely to be granted, but school officials hope to get any new money they can.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The reason we need more money is to do the projects more quickly,&#39;&#39; Superintendent Allen Morgan said Wednesday.
<P>   &#39;&#39;These are three requests that I believe give people very accurate information on what we are able to do with the monies we have available today and what we would be able to do if we get additional funds.&#39;&#39;
<P>   If commissioners agree to fund one of the school board&#39;s two more expensive requests, Sequoyah Elementary, Holston Middle, Whittle Springs Middle, Karns Middle, Brickey Primary and a new Northwest Elementary school at Hardin Valley would be completed faster.
<P>   Schumpert will weigh school needs against other county projects in the five-year capital plan, like roads and a new downtown justice center.
<P>   &#39;&#39;In the next three to four weeks we will be looking to see what kind of (debt) capacity we do have available as we update our plan,&#39;&#39; Schumpert said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s hard to say at this point how much additional money we might be able to commit to schools. We do think there are some additional dollars, but there are some other requests also.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Asked whether the county might approve the top request of $181 million, Schumpert said, &#39;&#39;That&#39;d be a pretty extreme number I think, but until we really look at our numbers and our financial adviser gives us our capacity, what we could do, that&#39;s kind of premature to comment on.&#39;&#39;
<P>   School board member Steve Hunley was the only member to vote against the superintendent&#39;s proposal. Member Cecil Kelly was absent.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There are no specific dollars for specific schools,&#39;&#39; Hunley said. &#39;&#39;If I go to Home Federal and say, &#39;I want to borrow $70,000,&#39; what are they going to ask me? (They&#39;ll ask), &#39;What are you gonna do with the money?&#39; &#39;&#39;
<P>   In the same way, he wondered, &#39;&#39;How can I expect (commissioners) to allocate $70 million (extra) when I haven&#39;t told them what I&#39;m going to do with the money?&#39;&#39;
<P>   The $181 million request includes the $110.9 million base, plus $6.9 million for Karns Middle, Brickey and Hardin Valley; $36.5 million for &#39;&#39;future projects to be defined;&#39;&#39; $25.5 million for capital maintenance; and a $1.2 million contingency.
<P>   In past years, commissioners have criticized school officials for putting specific dollar figures on projects, then discovering they require more money.
<P>   Darlene Smolik, controller with the Public Building Authority, which is helping the schools with the building program, said it&#39;s hard to pin specific costs to specific schools because material costs vary from year to year. Also, it&#39;s hard to predict school needs three or four years in advance, and a systemwide master plan isn&#39;t yet completed.
<P>   The $181 million request will stabilize school construction spending at about $36 million a year. If commission doesn&#39;t approve more funding, money available for school construction will plummet from $32.9 million this year to $7.2 million in fiscal 2000.
<P>   County Commission Chairman John Griess, elected in 1994, expects commissioners to want plenty of information.
<P>   &#39;&#39;My limited experience with County Commission and school board matters is it needs to be justified and specific before they make a decision to vote for it, so somebody&#39;s going to have to be specific with County Commission. . . .&#39;&#39;

		<FONT SIZE="+2">E</FONT>ast Tennesseans went to bed Wednesday night not knowing if they would need an umbrella or ice skates when they awoke.
<P>   The National Weather Service was predicting sleet mixed with freezing rain with some accumulation likely. However, in Knox, Blount, Loudon, Roane, Sevier and Union Counties, the precipitation was expected to change to all rain during the night.
<P>   Sleet was reported in some parts of Knox County shortly after 4 p.m. Knoxville Public Service Director Bob Whetsel said the regular night road crews were prepared to monitor bridges and overpasses overnight and to deal with any icing that occurs.
<P>   Up to 65 day shift employees were placed on standby.
<P>   According to the National Weather Service, the outlook for counties north and east of Knox is not as optimistic. Sleet and freezing rain is expected to continue this morning before changing to all rain.
<P>   Counties southwest of Knoxville were expected to get mostly rain, although some sleet was falling in the Chattanooga area by mid-afternoon. At Crossville, Cumberland County officials dismissed school at 12:30 p.m. CST, and freezing rain and light snow began falling across the Cumberland Plateau a short time later.
<P>   Many other schools in Middle and West Tennessee also closed early as the rain, sleet and snow moved in from the west.
<P>   Look for low temperatures this morning in the low 30s. Occasional rain is anticipated today with the mercury creeping up to around 40.
<P>   Forecasters said the brunt of the storm would hit the northwest corner of Tennessee along the Missouri and Kentucky borders by late Wednesday. Three to five inches of snow was predicted for that region.
<P>   In Memphis, forecasters warned of an expected ice build-up of as much of a quarter of an inch on trees and power lines.
<P>   At least one weather-related death occurred in Tennessee Tuesday. A Middle Tennessee woman discovered dead beside a creek died of hypothermia, authorities said.
<P>   Sharon Gail Farris, 45, of Columbia was found by a motorist next to the Little Bigby Creek.
<P>   Investigators said she had been riding around and drinking with friends before she died. They said the group&#39;s pickup truck got stuck and Farris was left behind when the vehicle was able to drive away.
<P>   Cold temperatures are expected to dominate the weather picture for the weekend.

        <p><br>
        </p>
        <p>WHITE PINE, Tenn. -- Rick Clark could have used a
        promotional video tape to demonstrate the effectiveness
        of the Air-Taser stun gun, but then he would have missed
        out on the fun of shooting his friend. </p>
        <p>Clark owns R.R. Distributors, a security company in
        White Pine that sells devices such as pepper spray, alarm
        systems, and stun guns. To demonstrate the Air-Taser, a
        new type of stun gun, he called on his friend Monty
        Bowen, a deputy with the Jefferson County Sheriff's
        Department, who agreed to let Clark zap him in the back. </p>
        <p>''If this will help home defense and show people
        there's an alternative to having firearms in the house,
        it'll be worth it,'' said Bowen, moments before the
        Air-Taser buckled his knees. </p>
        <p>Unlike conventional stun guns, which must make direct
        contact with the assailant, the Air-Taser uses a gas
        propellent to fire two metal probes as far as 15 feet.
        The probes are attached to thin wires, and deliver a
        high-voltage, low-amperage shock with an 86-percent
        knockdown ratio. </p>
        <p>At 1 p.m., Wednesday, a small crowd gathered in front
        of the White Pine Police Headquarters to witness the live
        demonstration. </p>
        <p>''Though the shock is painful, the device does not
        rely on pain,'' said Clark. ''The electricity makes the
        body reverse what it's doing. All the muscles collapse,
        and you hit the ground.'' </p>
        <p>Clark said he would donate an Air-Taser to the White
        Pine Police Department. To satisfy his own curiosity, he
        asked his wife to shoot him with the Air-Taser before the
        demonstration. </p>
        <p>''I put on a heavy blue-jean jacket, and she shot me
        in the back,'' he said. ''In two seconds I hit the
        ground, flopping like a bluegill, screaming at her to
        shut it off. </p>
        <p>The Air-Taser is set to automatically shock for 30
        seconds, pausing every eight seconds to let the victim
        catch his breath. </p>
        <p>A few minutes after 1 p.m. Clark fired the Air-Taser
        at Bowen's back, and Bowen, who weighs 196 pounds,
        dropped like a sack of laundry. </p>
        <p>The ordeal ended after a few seconds when Bowen, lying
        prone on the ground, yelled at Clark to turn it off. </p>
        <p>''That felt like a lifetime,'' said Bowen, raising
        himself to one knee. ''I lost control. I thought I was
        going to pass out.'' </p>

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Tennessee Highway Patrol properly handled the investigation of a fatal traffic accident involving state Sen. Carl Koella, according to internal documents released by the Department of Safety.
<P>   The investigation did find, however, that a dispatcher provided &#39;&#39;misleading&#39;&#39; information to the media and withheld information.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We are taking appropriate action to correct that situation, including disciplinary action,&#39;&#39; Safety Commissioner Mike Greene wrote in a Dec. 30 letter to The News-Sentinel.
<P>   Additionally, as a result of the investigation, the Department of Safety internal affairs unit has been relocated under Greene&#39;s office.
<P>   The investigation stemmed from a complaint by The News-Sentinel about the withholding of information by the dispatcher after the Oct. 22 wreck in Blount County.
<P>   Koella&#39;s van turned in front of motorcyclist Terry R. Barnard, 52, on Highway 321 at the entrance of Tuckaleechee Campground, which also leads Koella&#39;s residence in Townsend.
<P>   The motorcycle struck the right rear of the van, and Barnard was thrown from his bike and died. Koella left the scene and was arrested nearly four hours later at his home.
<P>   When a News-Sentinel reporter called the THP office in Knoxville to inquire about the accident, she was told by dispatcher Vena K. Carter the THP was not working a fatal accident in Blount County.
<P>   The Department of Safety internal investigation found that Carter later gave varying answers to other media inquiries about the wreck, including she had not been given information, she did not have the accident report completed and the troopers were still working the wreck.
<P>   Carter was to have referred all media calls to a THP lieutenant, but she didn&#39;t.
<P>   &#39;&#39;She did not follow instructions,&#39;&#39; Greene said. Carter is now on medical leave.
<P>   After an initial internal investigation, Greene asked the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to join the probe.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We felt more questions needed to be asked, so we involved the TBI,&#39;&#39; Greene said.
<P>   As a result, the internal affairs unit now reports directly to Greene&#39;s office. 
<P>   It is being supervised by Brian Grisham, an attorney and assistant to Greene.
<P>   Formerly, the unit reported to assistant commissioner Col. Jerry Scott, who is in charge of the THP.
<P>   Hardy Mays, deputy to the governor, said the relocation was necessary &#39;&#39;because the appearance was wrong.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;If you&#39;re going to have an internal affairs division, it ought to be separate from the officers it investigates.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Koella faces a preliminary hearing Jan. 28 on a charge of leaving the scene of a fatal accident.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Randy Kenner, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>wo men who fled Maryland in 1994 after being charged with the long-running sexual abuse of three boys have been arrested in Knoxville.
<P>   Samuel L. Glover, 49, and Marshall Monquie Kirkpatrick, 32, allegedly have been posing as father and son and living under assumed names in a North Knoxville trailer park. 
<P>   They were arrested in separate locations on Tuesday by FBI agents.
<P>   The agents were acting on a tip the two were here after they were featured on a November episode of TV&#39;s &#39;&#39;Unsolved Mysteries&#39;&#39; program.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve been looking for them for the past two-and-a-half years,&#39;&#39; said Marcie Wogan, a deputy state&#39;s attorney in Carroll County, Md. &#39;&#39;We were desperate to find them.&#39;&#39;
<P>   She said authorities there heard the two men were everywhere from Canada and Mexico to nearby Pennsylvania.
<P>   The two spent at least the last year in Knoxville, according to FBI agent Scott Nowinski, spokesman for the Knoxville FBI office.
<P>
<P>      According to Wogan and Maryland court documents, the pair face more than two dozen sexual assault and child abuse charges in Carroll County. Three alleged victims are involved.
<P>    Wogan said at least a dozen male children had been assigned to Glover, acting as a foster parent, by the Maryland Department of Social Services.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;re certain there are other victims,&#39;&#39; Wogan said.
<P>    She added the alleged victims&#39; placement in a foster home &#39;&#39;was supposed to be improving their lives. It&#39;s not a pretty story.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Glover allegedly posed as a minister in Maryland to reach the arrangement to act as a foster parent. According to the times the alleged offenses occurred -- the late 1980s and early 1990s -- and the dates of birth of the three victims, all of them would have been in their teens.
<P>   Wogan said authorities believe Glover and Kirkpatrick to be homosexual lovers and &#39;&#39;pedophiles.&#39;&#39;
<P>   She said one of the foster children told authorities he felt like &#39;&#39;he was a slave, he was living in slavery. It was horrific, the conditions.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Wogan said the three alleged victims were sexually abused, beaten and forced to live in filth.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They forced the kids to do things . . . and to watch,&#39;&#39; she said.
<P>   Social services made periodic home visits to the Glover residence but informed him prior to visits, Wogan said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The kids told us when the DSS called, the place was cleaned up, the boyfriend would leave and they were allowed to take baths,&#39;&#39; she said.
<P>   She said the alleged victims were terrified of the pair, were threatened and were told not to tell anyone. 
<P>   The police investigation followed an anonymous tip.
<P>   Glover and Kirkpatrick were initially held on $75,000 bonds, according to court documents, but the bonds were later reduced to $10,000 and the two men left Maryland after being released on bond.
<P>   Wogan said the Maryland state&#39;s attorney&#39;s office approached &#39;&#39;Unsolved Mysteries&#39;&#39; about featuring the two men in the hopes it would produce some leads.
<P>   Nowinski said the Nov. 22 episode produced numerous leads throughout the country, including &#39;&#39;several leads in the Knoxville area.&#39;&#39;
<P>   One of them was that Kirkpatrick worked at a Knoxville convenience store.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We determined that he was no longer working at that store but at another store,&#39;&#39; Nowinski said.
<P>   David E. Parker, assistant special agent in charge of the Knoxville FBI office, said Kirkpatrick was arrested around 2 p.m. at work and denied being the wanted man. His identity was confirmed by his fingerprints, however, officers said.
<P>    Glover was arrested at the pair&#39;s trailer at about 6 p.m.
<P>   
<P>   Both men face possible life sentences, according to Wogan.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Jim Balloch, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">K</FONT>noxville City Council will review what the city&#39;s role is, and should be, in helping a private group develop the proposed Haley Heritage Square in Morningside Park.
<P>   Council will meet in a workshop at 5 p.m. today at the request of Evon Easley, project director for Citizens for Haley Heritage Square (CHHS).
<P>   &#39;&#39;We hope the city will recognize us as the developmental agency for this project and continue to work with us,&#39;&#39; said Easley. &#39;&#39;We feel the city needs to clarify what its role is going to be.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Haley, author of the highly acclaimed &#39;&#39;Roots&#39;&#39; and other works, died in 1992. Originally from West Tennessee, he later made his home in Norris and was an adjunct professor at the University of Tennessee.
<P>   In December, council unanimously approved payment of $168,700 to sculptor Tina Allen for completion of a 13-foot, 6,500-pound statue of Haley, and agreed to accept a $200,000 grant from the state Legislature for Haley Heritage Square.
<P>   Easley said the statue purchase was made outside the city&#39;s original agreement with CHHS, and before CHHS was able to renew its own contract with the sculptor. She also said that the city should turn the $200,000 over to CHHS, since it was CHHS that persuaded the Legislature to provide the money.
<P>   CHHS says its goal is for Haley Heritage Square to eventually include a 300-seat amphitheater and a genealogical research center. CHHS has recently received a federal grant to pay for a consultant to develop a marketing and tourism strategy for the project, Easley said.
<P>    City Council earlier authorized the expenditure of up to $375,000, mainly to buy land on the south side of Dandridge Avenue to enlarge Morningside Park to accommodate the Haley project. The sculptors&#39; fee will be paid out of that $375,000, city Finance Director Randy Vineyard said.
<P>   Vineyard said the $200,000 state grant may have to be used to pay for the statue&#39;s base.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s going to have to be mounted on something,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>    Sculpture of the Haley statue has been completed, but it has yet to be cast in bronze, Easley said. It is now expected that the statue will be delivered to Knoxville this summer.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT>awyers confirmed Wednesday they are ready to proceed with a Jan. 21 trial for the last of three defendants charged in the Job Corps murder case.
<P>   Unless he reaches an agreement with prosecutors in the interim, Tadaryl D. Shipp, 19, will face a sequestered jury in Knox County Criminal Court. The trial, which is expected to take one to two weeks, could feature an appearance by co-defendant and death row inmate Christa Gail Pike, 20.
<P>   Criminal Court Judge Mary Beth Leibowitz told lawyers Wednesday she wants to try to select a jury in Knox County before looking elsewhere for a panel, as defense attorney Chris Coffey has requested. Coffey argues the sensational 1995 murder case has generated so much publicity his client will have a hard time finding an unbiased jury.
<P>   Pike, Shipp&#39;s girlfriend, was convicted and sentenced to death in March for the bloody and violent murder of 19-year-old Colleen A. Slemmer of Orange Park, Fla. Shipp has confessed to helping Pike cut Slemmer and carve a pentagram in her chest Jan. 12, 1995, near a jogging path in a remote area of the University of Tennessee Agricultural campus.
<P>   Shipp, Pike, Slemmer and Shadolla R. Peterson, another co-defendant, were students at the Knoxville Job Corps Center. Federal officials closed the Dale Avenue facility in 1995 in part because of the slaying.
<P>   Prosecutors and Coffey have discussed a possible plea deal for Shipp, who could face life in prison without parole. By law, the prosecution cannot seek the death penalty against the Memphis man because he was a juvenile when Slemmer was killed.
<P>   Jury selection last year for Pike took about a week. Considering the publicity that arose from her trial, Coffey said he expects it will take at least that long to pick a Knox County panel.
<P>   Deputy District Attorney General Bill Crabtree agreed the case has generated publicity. The prosecutor said he prefers to try to seat a jury from here first.
<P>   At Coffey&#39;s request, Leibowitz agreed to prepare an order transporting Pike for the trial. Pike, who is at the Nashville Prison for Women, told Shipp in a letter last year she would testify for him.
<P>   Her case is on appeal, however, and defense attorney William C. Talman said he would advise her not to testify for Shipp. Her execution, once set for this month, has been stayed pending court appeals.
<P>   Shadolla R. Peterson, 20, who was with Shipp and Pike when Slemmer was killed, was allowed to enter a plea last year that saved her from going to prison. She is on probation and lives in southeast Tennessee.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>t appears Knox County is prepared to give a West Knoxville property owner a hefty profit for 11.5 acres adjacent to Bearden High School.
<P>   The Knox County School Board voted 8-0 Wednesday to spend $750,000 on land that will initially provide student parking and additional room for growth at the crowded school.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve had three people look at it, give us independent appraisals, and they say it&#39;s a very fair price,&#39;&#39; Superintendent Allen Morgan said. The contract needs to be finalized, and the purchase could go to County Commission for approval this month.
<P>   The acreage is part of a 22.4-acre tract along Gleason Road that was owned by East Tennessee Natural Gas Co. until Dec. 14, 1995.
<P>   That&#39;s when Harry and Mary Lane purchased the 22.4 acres for $400,000, according to a deed filed in the Register of Deeds office. The next day -- Dec. 15, 1995 -- Harry Lane transferred the acreage to Michael E. Schaad, trustee, for $475,000.
<P>  Schaad could not be reached Wednesday, but school officials said they&#39;re getting a fair deal by paying $750,000 for about half the tract, which is the last undeveloped property adjacent to Bearden High.
<P>   The school system isn&#39;t getting a retention pond that could present liability problems, and it&#39;s avoiding the risk that the land&#39;s value will rise if property nearer to Gleason Road is developed.
<P>   &#39;&#39;If Bearden is to remain a viable school for the next 25 to 30 years, we&#39;ll need additional auxiliary space,&#39;&#39; Morgan said.
<P>   School board member Sam Anderson said condemning the property isn&#39;t a real option since the county still would end up paying at least the appraised value.
<P>   A spokesman for East Tennessee Natural Gas Co., said the company sold the entire 22.4 acre tract in December 1995 for &#39;&#39;well under&#39;&#39; appraised value.
<P>   Joe O&#39;Steen, a right-of-way agent for El Paso Energy Corp. in Brentwood, which operates East Tennessee Natural Gas, declined to give a specific appraisal amount and didn&#39;t know why the firm sold below the appraisal.
<P>   He did say the firm no longer needed the property because of scaled back operations and the move of regional headquarters to Brentwood.

		</basefont><h3>Slain girl&#39;s family boost campaign against judge</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>    A northwestern Tennessee couple has received 180 letters in their 10-day-old campaign against U.S. District Court Judge John Nixon of Nashville.
<P>    Mickey and Charlotte Stout of Greenfield (about 15 miles south of Martin in Weakley County) are seeking to have Nixon investigated for overturning the 1981 conviction of Robert Glen Coe. 
<P>   Coe was sentenced to death in the 1979 rape and murder of 8-year-old Cary Ann Medlin, Charlotte Stout&#39;s daughter.
<P>    Meanwhile, a Jan. 19 rally is scheduled for Greenfield&#39;s high school gymnasium to begin a petition drive against the judge.
<P>    Nixon in November cited several mistakes by the trial judge in overturning the conviction and sentence of Coe.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Teenage murder suspect free on $70,000 bond</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>      A 16-year-old murder suspect -- jailed over the weekend after he was hospitalized for treatment of gunshot wounds -- is free after posting a $70,000 bond.
<P>   Melvin &#39;&#39;Little Melvin&#39;&#39; Davis was released Tuesday from the Knox County Jail after posting bond on charges of aggravated robbery and aggravated assault, jail records show.
<P>   Davis had been jailed Sunday after being released from Baptist Hospital of East Tennessee. 
<P>   Davis, also known as Melvin Tate, had been shot on Christmas Eve, allegedly by reputed fellow gang member William &#39;&#39;Junebug&#39;&#39; Martin.
<P>   Davis, who police contend is a member of the East Side gang, is charged in the May 18 shooting death of Brittany Shenice Daniels, 5. 
<P>   Brittany was shot as she played on a sidewalk in the Lonsdale Homes housing project.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Report: Daughter heard accused killer&#39;s threat</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>    BRISTOL -- A pharmacist accused of killing his wife told her she deserved to die, according to a report involving one of his daughters.
<P>    Harry David Johnson of Bristol is charged with fatally shooting Katherine Johnson, 46, in the face in 1995.
<P>    His trial is scheduled for Feb. 3.
<P>    Prosecutors are expected to use the psychological report to rebut Johnson&#39;s insanity claims.  
<P>   In the report by  Dr. James C. Ballenger of the Medical College of South Carolina at Charleston, one of the couple&#39;s daughters says she overheard her father say, &#39;&#39;This is what you deserve. I&#39;m going to shoot you in the face.&#39;&#39; 
<P>   The daughter told Ballenger she then heard shots.
<P>    The report said Johnson became violently angry when his wife drank and was concerned about the public image of her drinking.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Putnam man accused of taking tracker device</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   COOKEVILLE -- A Cookeville man is in jail after being accused of stealing a $500 electronic device he was wearing so his probation officer could monitor his whereabouts.
<P>   Robert D. Fulton was arrested at a residence New Year&#39;s Eve after authorities received a tip he was in town.
<P>   He reportedly had skipped out on his probation last April and allegedly took the bracelet with him.
<P>   Fulton, a construction worker, had been on probation since December 1995. Prior to that, he was jailed on a six-year sentence for various crimes, including theft, possession of marijuana, introducing contraband into the jail, burglary and passing a forged instrument.
<P>   He is jailed without bond in connection with violating probation and theft.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Chattanooga officer&#39;s vest deflects bullet</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>    CHATTANOOGA -- A police officer shot in the chest during a traffic stop Wednesday lived, thanks to his bulletproof vest.
<P>    Officer Reginald Finley stopped three youths about 5:30 a.m. after noticing their 1979 Oldsmobile Cutlass had no license plate, police spokesman Eyo Efiom said.
<P>    As the officer sat in his car, one of the youths shouted at him and asked why they were being stopped.    One of them pulled a handgun and fired three times at Finley, Efiom said. One bullet hit the front of Finley&#39;s bulletproof vest.
<P>    The shooter and one youth ran from the car while the driver sped away.    Finley called his dispatcher to report he&#39;d been shot but said the vest deflected the bullet and he was not wounded.     Police were still searching for the three youths.

		<h3>Food City relocates in North Gate</h3>
<P>
<P>   The Food City supermarket in North Gate Plaza will relocate and expand to the Winn-Dixie location in the same shopping center, K-VA-T Food Stores Inc., the parent company, announced Wednesday.
<P>   Winn-Dixie closed in the location Wednesday.
<P>   The location will be remodeled into a &#39;&#39;state-of-the-art superstore&#39;&#39;, said Steve Trout, executive vice president for the Knoxville division of K-VA-T Food Stores Inc., parent of Food City.
<P>   The present Food City store will remain open until the new location opens. No date was given for the opening.
<P>
<P><h3>Fayetteville plant closing to idle 109</h3>
<P>
<P>    FAYETTEVILLE, Tenn. -- A plant that makes specialty yarn will close in March, putting 109 people out of work.
<P>    Elk Spinners Inc., a division of Uniblend Spinners, has made yarn in the same location since the turn of the century.
<P>    Randy Jenkins, Uniblend&#39;s vice president of manufacturing, blamed &#39;&#39;slow business conditions&#39;&#39; in the textile industry for the plant closing.
<P>    Elk Spinners made yarn that goes into home furnishings, apparel and other specialty product markets. The mill will close March 10, said Jim Gray, Lincoln County&#39;s industrial recruiter.
<P>    Gray said the company approached city and county officials in early December requesting financial aid to keep the plant afloat.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We developed a package of low-interest loans for them because the understanding was, if they could modernize the plant, they could dig themselves out of this hole,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;But their creditors were unwilling to extend that kind of capital.&#39;&#39;
<P>    In addition to the Fayetteville, Tenn., plant, Uniblend announced it would close its Fayetteville, N.C., plant. About 160 people work at that plant. Uniblend is based in Union, S.C.

<P><h3>Philips rethinks control of Grundig</h3>
<P>
<P>    EINDHOVEN, Netherlands -- Philips Electronics NV announced Wednesday it would back away from control of Germany&#39;s Grundig AG to be a passive minority shareholder in the money-losing consumer electronics maker.
<P>    Grundig&#39;s years of losses have been a drag on profit at Philips, which has run Grundig despite owning merely 30 percent of the company.
<P>    Analysts said the move fits with the tough cost-cutting stance of Philips&#39; new chief executive, Cor Boonstra. When Boonstra took office in October, he vowed to slash expenses and said Philips&#39; massive restructuring of the early 1990s, which cut 60,000 jobs, hadn&#39;t gone far enough.
<P>    Philips shares rose more than 3 percent after the Grundig news was announced. The company had said in February it would no longer cover Grundig&#39;s losses, which analysts estimate at about 300 million German marks ($191.4 million) in 1996.
<P>
<P><h3>Names in the news</h3>
<P>
<P>   <B>Brenda Roan </B>has been named director of information systems at Clayton Homes Inc. Roan previously worked as an independent consultant and also served as director of information systems for Coca Cola Enterprises in Knoxville. . . . <B><B>Mitch Burnett</B>, a 13-year real estate sales veteran employed since 1992 at Knoxville&#39;s Volunteer Realty, has been named managing broker of that firm&#39;s Farragut office. Burnett, a Farragut resident and University of Tennessee graduate, previously was broker-owner of Gallery of Homes in Farragut. . . .<B> Andrew &#39;&#39;Drew&#39;&#39; Seery</B> is the new owner of the local franchise of BW-3 Grill & Pub in the Old City. He relocated from Cincinnati. Previously, he was in pharmaceutical sales.

		<h3>NFL may help CFL with money, players</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>    
<P>    The NFL is discussing plans to bankroll the struggling Canadian Football League as a player-development league, The Toronto Star has reported.
<P>    The newspaper, citing unidentified sources, said the NFL would provide a limited number of players per team for the entire season. The NFL would pay the salaries of those players as well as provide marketing money.
<P>    &#39;&#39;There have been preliminary discussions along marketing lines with some player development discussed,&#39;&#39; Toronto Argonauts president <B>Bob Nicholson </B>said. &#39;&#39;But to suggest we are selling the league to the NFL, well, that certainly is not our intention.&#39;&#39;
<P>    <B>Jeff Giles,</B> the CFL&#39;s chief operating officer, also confirmed &#39;&#39;discussions are taking place,&#39;&#39; but offered no details. The newspaper, which said a deal could be announced late this month, added that the NFL has no interest in changing the CFL&#39;s rules or Canadian-content regulations.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By The Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>ASHINGTON -- A closely watched Supreme Court dispute over a rogue West Tennessee judge and the Constitution&#39;s protection against sexual assaults by public officials took a curious turn Tuesday.
<P>    The justices were expected to focus on whether freedom from sexual attack ever has been recognized as a constitutional right. But most of their questions during an hourlong argument session instead sought guidance on whether a former West Tennessee judge&#39;s misconduct amounted to abuse of judicial power.
<P>    David Lanier, once a state judge in Dyersburg and a member of a politically powerful family, was convicted in federal court of sexually assaulting five women in his courtroom chambers from 1989 to 1991. Prosecutors said he forced one woman to perform oral sex.
<P>    Nine women testified at his trial that Lanier, now 61, repeatedly pressured them for sex, grabbed their breasts or buttocks, or exposed himself to them.
<P>    The local prosecutor, Lanier&#39;s brother, had not filed state criminal charges against him.
<P>    Because there was no federal rape law, federal prosecutors charged Lanier under an 1874 law that makes it a crime for government officials to use their official authority to willfully deprive someone of rights &#39;&#39;protected by the Constitution.&#39;&#39;
<P>    That law was used in the federal prosecutions of two former Los Angeles police officers convicted in the videotaped beating of motorist Rodney King.
<P>    Lanier&#39;s conviction and 25-year prison sentence were overturned when a federal appeals court ruled that freedom from sexual assault never had been recognized as a federally protected right.
<P>    Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia appeared to agree Tuesday as they voiced grave doubts about the Constitution&#39;s protection in such cases.
<P>    But they and other justices confined most questions to the issue of whether Lanier was acting in his capacity as a judge in his dealings with the women who either worked for him or had cases in his court.
<P>    Scalia acknowledged that the 1874 law can be used against police officers whose duty is to keep the public peace and take people into custody, but he questioned whether it could be invoked, for example, against a motor vehicles clerk who punched a citizen in the nose.
<P>    Kennedy asked whether a courthouse janitor who rapes someone has violated any constitutional right. &#39;&#39;Is there a specific right of bodily integrity outside of people in custody?&#39;&#39; Kennedy at one point asked in incredulous tones.
<P>    Justice Department lawyer Seth Waxman, seeking to have Lanier&#39;s conviction and prison sentence reinstated, replied that it was easy to draw distinctions between the offered examples and Lanier&#39;s case.
<P>    Lanier &#39;&#39;was properly and constitutionally convicted,&#39;&#39; Waxman said.
<P>    But Nashville lawyer Alfred Knight, representing Lanier, said the women had submitted to his advances because of his prominence in a small town, not because of his judicial authority.
<P>    His conduct, therefore, could not be attributed to Lanier&#39;s official authority, Knight argued.
<P>    But Chief Justice William Rehnquist, noting that Lanier reminded one woman that a custody case involving her child was pending before him, suggested, &#39;&#39;Surely a jury could conclude there was an implied threat.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Among the court&#39;s nine members, only Justice Clarence Thomas asked no questions from the bench. He did at times whisper to Justice Stephen Breyer, who sits beside him.
<P>    A decision is expected by July.

<P>   The plan is expected to reduce the staff and provide savings as the state faces a huge budget shortfall.
<P>   Not so fast, said state Attorney General Charles Burson, who argued that a new department would be illegal; Sen. Bob Rochelle, D-Lebanon, who said the governor must bring the matter to the Legislature; and many in the governor&#39;s Cabinet, who said it&#39;s actually inefficient.
<P>   Rochelle criticized the governor Tuesday and released both Burson&#39;s opinion and a survey by the comptroller&#39;s office showing that a majority of the governor&#39;s commissioners oppose a central legal department.
<P>   &#39;&#39;A central legal department for the state would paralyze rather than empower departments,&#39;&#39; said Commerce and Insurance Commissioner Douglas Sizemore in a response to the proposal in report by the Tennessee Commission on Practical Government. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;While it may save money on the front end, it would greatly impair the ability of the departments to render services in an efficient manner.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Other responses from commissioners:
<P>   * &#39;&#39;Disagree that establishing a law department is the way to go,&#39;&#39; said Health Department Commissioner Fredia Wadley. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;I have worked under this system in Metro (Nashville government) and it was the pits. Our department did not have a good lawyer, and he never had time to handle our problems.&#39;&#39;
<P>   * &#39;&#39;Strongly disagree,&#39;&#39; said Revenue Commissioner Ruth Johnson.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The legal division in Department of Revenue plays a critical role in the administration of the tax laws, and the effectiveness of those attorneys would be severely curtailed if they were taken out of the organization of the department.&#39;&#39;
<P>   * &#39;&#39;The proposal would decrease familiarity, responsiveness and expertise, especially to those departments, such as the Tennessee Department of Correction, which require intensive daily interaction with staff counsel,&#39;&#39; said Correction Commissioner Donal Campbell.
<P>   The governor, a Republican, sought to replace lawyers&#39; specialization with cross-training and have them work for all departments; that would reduce their numbers from 164 to 100. 
<P>   Already, the number of lawyers has been reduced by about 30 through attrition, said Beth Fortune, the governor&#39;s press secretary.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The governor asked the Cabinet for input, and they obliged,&#39;&#39; Fortune said. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s the governor&#39;s ultimate decision, and he believes they should be centralized in one location.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Already, the lawyers are moving into one building in downtown Nashville, but Fortune insisted it would not mean cross-training in a new legal department.
<P>   Burson opined that state law permits departments and agencies to employ staff attorneys who &#39;&#39;work solely under the supervision&#39;&#39; of the departments who hired them or for the attorney general, but that creating a &#39;&#39;new, centralized law department&#39;&#39; would not be legal without legislation.
<P>   The administration may, Burson said, move state attorneys into one physical location as long as they still answer to their assigned departments.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;re going to do everything by the book,&#39;&#39; Fortune said. The governor has not yet planned legislation seeking a change,  she said.
<P>   Rochelle, in a press statement, accused the governor of attempting to establish a &#39;&#39;second set of lawyers.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;Will he also need a second set of personnel officers or a second set of purchasing officers?&#39;&#39; Rochelle asked.
<P>   He criticized Sundquist for providing no study or explanation to legislators.
<P>   The commissioners&#39; responses were compiled, at Rochelle&#39;s request, by the comptroller&#39;s office, which reviewed commissioners&#39; comments to the idea of centralizing all lawyers in the Tennessee Commission on Practical Government. 
<P>   The commission was established by the administration.
<P>   Rochelle also asked for an attorney general&#39;s opinion, which he promptly forwarded, along with the Cabinet&#39;s comments, to the governor.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By David Keim, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>bout 40 parents and children from the Sterchi Hills area told the school board Tuesday they don&#39;t want students rezoned from Powell to Gresham Middle or Central High schools.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It just seems that it would fracture Sterchi Hills,&#39;&#39; said parent Scott Nicley, who spoke for residents of the still-developing subdivision. &#39;&#39;We have a tight-knit, close, comfortable little neighborhood, and we would like to keep it that way.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The rezoning aims to relieve overcrowding at Powell schools, as do rezonings of 102 students from four schools to West Hills Elementary and 41 students from Karns Middle to Bearden Middle.
<P>   The board will vote on the rezonings next month. They would take effect next school year.
<P>   Only 19 children -- those who will enter middle or high school for the first time next school year -- would be required to go to Gresham or Central instead of Powell, although as many as 96 could be affected.
<P>   Students currently at Powell Middle or High schools would be allowed to finish school there, but they would need to find their own transportation.
<P>   Those who depend on bus service would have to go to Gresham or Central, reducing enrollment by about 49 students at Powell Middle and 47 at Powell High, according to Assistant Superintendent Roy Mullins.
<P>   Parents at Tuesday&#39;s school board work session said they purchased homes in Sterchi Hills in large part because of the quality of the Powell schools.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Not to insinuate one school is better than another,&#39;&#39; Nicley said, but parents look carefully at schools before buying a home. &#39;&#39;We feel like we moved into the Powell community and that&#39;s where we would like to commit our resources&#39;&#39; even beyond the schools.
<P>   Parents want school officials to be sure Powell schools aren&#39;t filled with transfers from other counties or other zones. They also want to be sure Powell schools are truly at capacity and that Gresham and Central can handle new students.
<P>   Powell Middle has 880 students. &#39;&#39;The capacity of the school is 800,&#39;&#39; Mullins said. He said Powell High is similarly overcrowded, while Central has a capacity of 1,375 with only 1,296 students.
<P>   School Board Chairwoman Margaret Maddox told parents, &#39;&#39;We as a board will certainly be assured that the need and the questions that have been raised tonight will be answered.&#39;&#39;
<P>   In the other rezonings:
<P>   * Students would be shifted into West Hills Elementary from four schools: Rocky Hill Elementary (21 students), Ball Camp Primary (33), Karns Intermediate (39) and Karns Primary (9).
<P>   Those numbers could be lower. The rezoning requires children who will be in kindergarten through third grade starting in 1997-98 to change schools. Those who will be in fourth or fifth grades next year don&#39;t have to change schools if their parents provide transportation.
<P>   * Mullins said 41 students could be shifted from Karns Middle to Bearden Middle. Students who will be in seventh or eighth grade at Karns, however, can continue attending if they can get their own rides.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Michelle Williams, Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>PRING CITY -- Watts Bar Nuclear Plant got a good performance rating during its first year of operation, but the Tennessee Valley Authority believes it deserves superior marks.
<P>    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees the nation&#39;s 110 nuclear plants, gave Watts Bar top rankings for engineering and maintenance, but found plant operations and plant support were average.
<P>    During a meeting Tuesday with NRC officials, TVA nuclear chief Oliver Kingsley said employees deserved a higher grade after working years to complete a now successfully-running plant.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The fact that this was a start up year should have factored in more heavily than it did,&#39;&#39; Kingsley said. &#39;&#39;This sends the wrong message to our people, who&#39;ve worked so hard for so long.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Luis Reyes, who this month replaced Stewart Ebneter as regional administrator for the NRC, said Watts Bar exceeded the national average for first-year operations, but &#39;&#39;we have to be cautious with our ratings because we want them to keep it up.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The plant&#39;s weaknesses were for configuration controls, attention to detail and some procedural problems.
<P>    The one-year review started November 1995 and was released last month.
<P>    Reyes added, however, that Watts Bar has operated at a high capacity since it began generating power for sale in May, which is a testament to the equipment and workers.
<P>    He&#39;s also &#39;&#39;never seen such a low level of waste in the first year.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Watts Bar is one of the nation&#39;s most watched nuclear plants because of two decades of safety and construction problems. Equipment and design flaws forced TVA to spend the past decade verifying the plant&#39;s systems to meet NRC standards.
<P>    By the time it finally started generating power, the plant&#39;s price tag was $7 billion, making it also the nation&#39;s most expensive.
<P>       A second reactor at the plant was canceled.
<P>    Since June, Unit 1 has reached a capacity of 85 percent; the industry average is 65 percent for first-year plants.
<P>    The reactor also operated for 117 straight days until a scheduled outage this fall and continuously since then.
<P>    Reyes told Kingsley he could petition the NRC to reconsider the overall rating by writing a letter and supplying documents to support why Watts Bar deserved a superior rating. 
<P>   Kingsley hasn&#39;t decided whether he will officially challenge the rating.
<P>    While Watts Bar seems to be performing well, another TVA plant just 20 miles away isn&#39;t.
<P>    Last month, the NRC proposed a $100,000 fine against the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant in Spring City for problems with equipment and electrical breakers.
<P>    Earlier in the year, NRC proposed another $130,000 in fines for problems, including fire protection.
<P>       Kingsley said most of those problems have been corrected. However, since September, there have been at least four reactor malfunctions.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>aying people don&#39;t take bankruptcy laws seriously, a federal judge sentenced a former Knoxville businessman to 10 months in prison despite sentencing guidelines that would have allowed no jail time.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve got to stop this bankruptcy fraud, it&#39;s rampant in this country,&#39;&#39; U.S. District Judge James Jarvis said Monday just before sentencing Jerry A. Bruno. &#39;&#39;People don&#39;t pay attention to their oath is all it is.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Bruno, the former president of the Knoxville-based Copy Systems Inc., pleaded guilty to bankruptcy fraud last summer. Under federal sentencing guidelines, he faced a range of 10-16 months, but it could have been served at a halfway house or even on home detention.
<P>   Jarvis wasn&#39;t amenable to either option during a hearing in which he appeared to become increasingly unhappy with Bruno, who he said had a prior fraud conviction in North Carolina.
<P>   &#39;&#39;People get in trouble and they go into bankruptcy and don&#39;t pay attention to the court&#39;s orders,&#39;&#39; Jarvis said. &#39;&#39;They try and circumvent the court&#39;s order, and sometimes, they do.&#39;&#39;
<P>   He noted the guidelines, adding, &#39;&#39;But in this case, and this case alone, the court finds that it would be in the best interest of justice&#39;&#39; that Bruno be sentenced to 10 months in prison.
<P>   According to court documents, Bruno, who lives in Florida and does most of his business in Atlanta, was chief operating officer of a company that bought and sold copy machines and office equipment. He and his wife were the sole stockholders.
<P>   The business apparently wasn&#39;t faring very well because Bruno filed for Chapter 11 -- or reorganization -- bankruptcy protection in April 1991.
<P>   A month later, a bankruptcy judge ordered Copy Systems Inc. to pay Bruno an annual salary of $45,000 and that the salary payments be made only after it had paid the payroll, taxes and payments to First American National Bank, according to court documents prepared by Assistant U.S. Attorney Hugh Ward.
<P>   Bruno, however, received more than that -- approximately $66,550, according to his plea agreement.
<P>   According to documents filed by Bruno&#39;s attorney, Michael P. McGovern, Copy Systems made certain payments to Bruno for things like car payments, apartment rent and other expenses before the bankruptcy was filed.
<P>   It continued to do that even after the bankruptcy order limiting Bruno&#39;s salary to $45,000.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It is those continued payments that gave rise to the indictment,&#39;&#39; McGovern wrote.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> state law may prevent two educators from serving on the Knox County Election Commission, but a clarifying opinion is being sought from the Tennessee Election Commission, state Sen. Bud Gilbert said Tuesday.
<P>   That prospect is troubling to Gilbert, R-Knoxville, because the two candidates who are educators are female. All things being equal, he said, he supports a female for the commission because all other members are male.
<P>   Also Tuesday, Gilbert said he&#39;s considering asking for a delay in the Saturday vote on a replacement for Commissioner Hazel Showalter, who died last month. She was a Republican.
<P>   Gilbert said he may seek a delay in order for the GOP caucus members to get more information on candidates and allow time for others to express interest.
<P>   The seven members of the Knox County Republican legislative delegation are scheduled to vote Saturday at the annual Legislative Delegation meeting.
<P>    That meeting begins at 8:30 a.m. in the Small Assembly Room of the City County Building.
<P>   The seven-member caucus makes the recommendation for a replacement to the state Election Commission, which then makes the appointment. The state commission meets on Tuesday, Jan. 14.
<P>   On Monday, state Rep. Jim Boyer, R-Corryton, said the three &#39;&#39;serious&#39;&#39; candidates he knows of are Donna Wright, principal at West High School; Rebecca Longmire, a librarian at Gibbs High School; and John Tindell, a member of the Knox County Republican Executive Committee.
<P>   Boyer is chairman of the selection process. Tindell served as Boyer&#39;s Halls campaign coordinator in Boyer&#39;s first successful run for office.
<P>   All three candidates live in either North or Northeast Knox County, an important factor to state Sen. Ben Atchley, R-Knoxville. He said it has been many years since that area of the county has been represented on the commission.
<P>   Gilbert said Commissioner Courtney Pearre, a Republican, is seeking an interpretation on the state law from the state panel.
<P>   That law begins by stating: &#39;&#39;Neither an elected official nor an employee of a state, county, municipal or federal governmental body or agency or of an elected official may serve as a member of a county election commission.&#39;&#39;
<P>   A subsection of the law, however, exempts &#39;&#39;schoolteachers.&#39;&#39; That may save the chances for Wright and Longmire. He said elsewhere in state statutes &#39;&#39;schoolteacher&#39;&#39; is defined as essentially an educator holding a teacher&#39;s certificate. 
<P>   That would likely apply to a principal and a librarian, Gilbert speculated.
<P>   State Election Coordinator Brook Thompson on Tuesday said the commission is attempting to get an answer to the Knox County delegation in a day or two.
<P>   Gilbert said that, based on his initial reading of the law, a government-employed janitor could not serve on the commission but a teacher could.
<P>   He said clarification is needed because the public&#39;s confidence in the election process was shaken enough by last November&#39;s foul-up on early votes in the unification question.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There have been a lot of discussions going on among legislators&#39;&#39; about a replacement, said Gilbert. &#39;&#39;We want to do right by the public. The public is concerned about the election. The appointment should not be patronage. It should be based on merit.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Gilbert said he thinks Wright would be an &#39;&#39;excellent&#39;&#39; choice. He said he does not know Longmire but has heard her credentials are strong, too.

<P>    &#39;&#39;We were not able to use driver&#39;s license data bases virtually all day Monday, which means we could not issue driver&#39;s licenses,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;The only alternative we had was to issue temporary licenses for 90 days.&#39;&#39;
<P>    An average 7,300 people apply for driver&#39;s licenses on an average day.
<P>    Those who received the temporary license must go through the process again.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It was a production job that began running late Sunday and should have been completed Monday morning,&#39;&#39; Kimbrough said. &#39;&#39;The production job couldn&#39;t be stopped in the middle of the job. What was running was a commercial driver&#39;s license report.&#39;&#39;

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>n Indiana man has pleaded guilty in federal court to helping sell a pound of methamphetamine to an undercover U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent.
<P>   Chester Wayne Hamilton, 51, of Indianapolis drove his Ford Bronco around a restaurant parking lot &#39;&#39;in a counter-surveillance- type manner&#39;&#39; while the DEA agent waited patiently inside before the buy, according to court documents.
<P>   Hamilton entered his guilty plea Monday before U.S. District Judge Leon Jordan to a single count of conspiracy to possess methamphetamine with intent to distribute it.
<P>   A co-defendant in the case, Sharon Kay Lester, earlier pleaded guilty to drug charges in the case.
<P>   According to court documents prepared by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Mitchell, the case developed from telephone conversations that Lester had with a DEA confidential informant regarding the purchase of methamphetamine.
<P>   The secretly recorded calls occurred between Dec. 15-20, 1995.
<P>   &#39;&#39;During these conversations, an agreement was reached between Ms. Lester and the (informant) whereby the informant would supply Ms. Lester with one pound of methamphetamine through his associate, (DEA Agent) Mark Poag, acting in an undercover capacity, for a total price of $17,500,&#39;&#39; Hamilton&#39;s plea agreement states.
<P>   Lester arranged to make a $2,500 down payment with the remaining $15,000 to be paid after she sold the methamphetamine.
<P>   On Dec. 22, 1995, she and Poag met at the Burger King Restaurant on Merchant Drive where Poag &#39;&#39;made arrangements to sell Ms. Lester the previously agreed upon one pound of methamphetamine at this location&#39;&#39; later that night, according to records.
<P>   Just before Poag arrived, however, he received a page and after reaching the restaurant returned the call from a nearby pay phone.
<P>   Lester answered from a pay phone at a service station across the street where she was standing beside a Bronco driven by Hamilton. She told Poag to drive across the street and meet her there. Poag responded by telling her to get over to Burger King.
<P>   Before she did, Hamilton drove around the area for approximately 15 mintues before dropping Lester off and returning to his position across the street.
<P>   Once inside, Lester handed Poag the money in an envelope and went outside to wave Hamiltion over.
<P>    She and Poag then walked outside to Poag&#39;s vehicle where he gave her a shoe box wrapped like a Christmas present supposedly containing the drug.
<P>   The pair were arrested moments later when Lester got back in Hamilton&#39;s vehicle.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> New Tazewell man who discussed blowing up the Cumberland Gap Tunnel connecting Kentucky and Tennessee was indicted Tuesday on federal weapons charges.
<P>   Gary Lee Seabolt, 25, who was arrested on a criminal complaint in late December, is charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm and with making false statements in the acquisition of a firearm.
<P>   He was also charged with receiving a quantity of explosive materials, &#39;&#39;. . . that is, a supplementary T.N.T. artillery charge, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such materials were stolen,&#39;&#39; the indictment states.
<P>   Mike Durham, an agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, confirmed that Seabolt discussed blowing up a tunnel.
<P>   The Cumberland Gap tunnel, which consists of two parallel passageways carrying traffic north and south, connects Bell County, Ky., to Claiborne County.
<P>   U.S. Magistrate Robert P. Murrian ordered Seabolt to undergo a mental competency examination during the hearing Tuesday.
<P>   According to the indictment, Seabolt was in possession of a .22-caliber rifle and a 20-gauge shotgun and has previously been convicted of crimes carrying a sentence of more than a year in prison. Seabolt, according to court papers filed by Assistant U.S. Attorney David Folmar, has multiple felony convictions including two commercial burglary convictions in Union County in 1994.   A search warrant was served on his residence in a New Tazewell trailer park on Dec. 20, 1996, and the firearms and the explosive device were discovered.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>HATTANOOGA -- Hundreds of people wrote federal regulators in protest to a Pennsylvania company building a $2 billion hydropower facility in the Sequatchie Valley.
<P>    Three federal agencies, which must issue permits before Armstrong Energy Resources of Butler, Pa., can build the plant, solicited public comments for the past few months as part of an environmental impact study. The deadline was Tuesday.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Generally, most of the comments were against,&#39;&#39; said Celeste Miller, spokeswoman for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s typical in this process to get more opposed comments because those who respond usually have a personal interest in it.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Miller said citizens&#39; responses will be read and cataloged before the environmental impact statement is completed, probably later this year.
<P>   About 1,000 comments were received collectively by the FERC, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
<P>    The comment period was slated to end in October, but the response from residents led the agencies to extend the period by 90 days.
<P>    Residents are worried about land seizures, pollution and the location of transmission lines along hundreds of acres in Sequatchie and Bledsoe counties.
<P>    Armstrong wants to pump water from area creeks to the top of a mountain for later release through a generator, making up to 1,500 megawatts of power. The electricity will be sold to TVA, which will then market it to power companies.
<P>    The plant could create about 1,000 construction jobs and 100 permanent jobs. If approved, construction could begin by 2000.
<P>    The protests from residents have apparently already made some impact.
<P>    Armstrong announced last month that it was cutting in half its plans from two plants worth $4 billion to one plant worth $2 billion. The plant would be built in Bledsoe County near Pikeville.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>HARLOTTE, N.C. -- A confessed killer who did not fit the established profile of a serial killer was convicted Tuesday of methodically raping and murdering nine women over a 20-month period.
<P>    Henry Louis Wallace was convicted of 28 felonies, including nine counts of first-degree murder. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.
<P>    Relatives of some of the victims were in court when the verdicts were read.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I am numb. My heart is beyond pain,&#39;&#39; said Dee Sumpter, whose daughter Shawna Hawk was among the victims.
<P>    Wallace knew his victims, while most serial killers target strangers, an expert testified during the trial. And he is black while most serial killers are white.
<P>    Wallace, 31, admitted raping and killing the women from 1992 into 1994. Seven of the women were strangled and two were stabbed to death.
<P>    Wallace has not yet been tried for two other killings, one in the Charlotte area and another in South Carolina.
<P>    The same jury that convicted Wallace will meet again Monday to begin hearing evidence for the sentencing phase and decide whether he should be sentenced to execution or to life in prison.
<P>    Defense attorneys did not dispute that Wallace killed the women, but argued he was mentally ill, driven by obsessional sexual fantasies that rendered him incapable of forming the intent to kill.
<P>    Wallace did not testify, but jurors heard the chilling recordings of his confession to homicide investigators.

<P>   Criminal Court Judge Steve Bebb sentenced Hester to serve one year in prison with the remaining years suspended.
<P>

<P>   General Sessions Court Judge Geoff Emery rebuked the young men, who smashed mailboxes, vandalized cars and inflicted other damage over several hours Dec. 19 in the Barrington, Copperfield and Willow Oak subdivisions in the Karns area.
<P>  &#39;&#39;This isn&#39;t something that was done on a dare in 10 minutes,&#39;&#39; Emery said. &#39;&#39;This is something that took a long time to accomplish.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>AN FRANCISCO -- Apple Computer co-founder Steve Jobs returned to the fold Tuesday, joining the company&#39;s current leader in describing plans to restore Apple to former glory as the industry&#39;s innovator.
<P>    Jobs, sharing the stage with Chairman Gil Amelio at the MacWorld Expo trade show, described how technology from his Next Software Inc. will help Apple develop a new operating system for the Macintosh personal computer. Apple is buying Next, which Jobs started after leaving Apple more than 11 years ago.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This is our mission: What we want to do is provide relevant, compelling solutions that customers can only get from Apple,&#39;&#39; said Jobs, who will advise Amelio on the new operating system, the critical software that controls the Mac&#39;s basic functions.
<P>    More than 4,000 people crowded into a hotel ballroom to hear Amelio and Jobs. Many in the audience gave Jobs, who guided the development of the original Macintosh, a standing ovation when he appeared near the end of Amelio&#39;s long presentation.
<P>    Amelio&#39;s talk at the biggest trade show devoted to the Macintosh drew intense scrutiny because of Apple&#39;s recent decision to buy Next, its stubborn financial problems and doubts both have raised about the company&#39;s long-term prospects.
<P>    One key question raised by Apple&#39;s plan to blend its technology with Next&#39;s in creating a new operating system is compatibility. Some Macintosh users and software developers have wondered whether their computers and existing Mac programs would soon be obsolete.
<P>    But Amelio assured them they won&#39;t be forgotten as Apple makes the complex transition, expected to take several years.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We simply don&#39;t want to abandon the installed base of users we have today,&#39;&#39; said Amelio, who wore a collar-less shirt and jacket in contrast to his usual suit-and-tie attire.
<P>    Next&#39;s software, used in computers for businesses, has a reputation of being easy for developers to work with, crash resistant and able to let the computer carry out several tasks at once. While Macintosh users are famed for their devotion to their computers, they have long wanted those features.
<P>    Apple plans to get the new operating system in developers&#39; hands by the end of the 1997 and to customers within a year after that. The new program, code-named Rhapsody, will run on current and future Macintosh computers and will include technology that will let it work with most applications now being used.
<P>    The company intends to make the transition as painless as possible by continually upgrading the current operating software, called System 7, for five to 10 years, according to Apple&#39;s chief technologist, Ellen Hancock.
<P>    The first upgrade, called Harmony, is due later this month, and a second, dubbed Tempo, is set for release in July. Two more are planned for 1998.
<P>    Amelio said Tuesday that while Apple&#39;s recent financial results are disappointing, the company is still fundamentally sound and will continue to recover.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s sort of like hitting one of those air pockets in turbulence,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;But we&#39;re going to stay the course.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Tombras Group is developing a marketing campaign for the Knoxville Convention and Visitors Bureau to convince more groups to hold meetings here, as well as to convince more tourists to spend the night, eat and shop here.
<P>   But first, they have to stop in Knoxville.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We need to be more than one of the many gateways to the Smokies,&#39;&#39; said Steve Richardson, a Tombras account supervisor who is overseeing the campaign for the bureau. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re more than that. We need to be something more than Big Orange Country. . . . We&#39;re more than a nice stopover place for people traveling along the interstates.&#39;&#39;
<P>   It&#39;s been 15 years since the bureau hired an advertising agency to develop a marketing communications plan, said Mike Wilds, executive director of the Knoxville Convention and Visitors Bureau.
<P>   The plan could include all types of advertising, from newspapers, trade publications and the Internet to television and radio ads.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We felt like prior to Tombras starting their creative processes, it would be good if some community leaders had the opportunity to share with them their views on Knoxville and how they feel about what is there to attract people to Knoxville and how Knoxville should be positioned,&#39;&#39; said Wilds.
<P>   About 25 business and community leaders attended two focus group sessions last month conducted by Tombras.
<P>   
<P>   &#39;&#39;The product in part is how the community sees itself,&#39;&#39; said Richardson. &#39;&#39;We got them all in the same room to probe ideas and opinions of how they saw Knox County&#39;s best selling points.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Many of the group&#39;s comments focused on what they saw as Knox County&#39;s strength as a &#39;&#39;hub&#39;&#39; for the region, and on a renewed spirit for marketing the county as a destination.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;re at a crossroads with expanding air service and the convergence of interstates,&#39;&#39; Richardson said. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re at a crossroads for nature and technology with a large number of area attractions, venues, and events. We&#39;re the hub in the middle of all that.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The core of the program needs to focus on getting tourists to stay in Knox County, he added.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We want them to spend the night here, eat in our restaurants, and shop with our merchants,&#39;&#39; he added. &#39;&#39;For them to go to the mountains one day is fine but we want them to come back here to spend the night.&#39;&#39;
<P>   In addition, the county may have to limit its access to larger-scale conventions because of its lack of adequate facilities, but will continue to target smaller meeting groups such as military reunions and religious organizations, as well as target families and other leisure travelers.
<P>   A preliminary plan will be submitted to Wilds by the end of January. Most of the plan will be funded by the hotel/motel tax.
<P>   The bureau also plans to seek further funding from the state, and through promotional programs and cooperative ventures. 
<P>   The Tombras Group was unanimously selected after a recommendation from the Knox County Tourist Commission&#39;s advertising subcommittee. Five other agencies were interviewed.

		<FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>iller Industries Inc., an Atlanta-based towing equipment company, has bought a Greeneville manufacturing plant formerly used by Greeneville Industries, a subsidiary of Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co.
<P>   The 100,000-square-foot facility located on 10 acres of industrial property will house operations of Miller&#39;s newly acquired subsidiary, Vulcan Equipment Co. of Olive Branch, Miss.
<P>   The Greeneville plant will employ 30-40 people initially and up to 150 over time, said Adam Dunayer, chief financial officer.
<P>   Capital investment in plant and equipment is expected to reach $3 million to $4 million.
<P>   Vulcan will make car carriers -- tow trucks with flat beds on the back -- in Greeneville. The company has a similar facility in Pennsylvania. The addition of the Greeneville facility will double its production capacity.
<P>   Vulcan will also offer installation and painting capability at Greeneville. Vulcan expects to produce 500-600 car carriers per month when the facility is fully operational. Production is expected to begin by March.
<P>   Greeneville Industries shut down in mid-1994 after defense cutbacks reduced contracts from the U.S. Navy. Nearly 300 people lost their jobs.
<P>   Greeneville Industries used the facility to weld parts for the Navy&#39;s nuclear submarine program, and that was a help in attracting Miller Industries, said Tom Ferguson, president of the Greene County Partnership, a consolidated economic development agency.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We were able to convince them we have an available work force here and they&#39;re not going to have to spend a lot of money training people,&#39;&#39; Ferguson said.
<P>    Scott Niswonger, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Landair Service Inc., bought the building after the shutdown and has used it for warehousing, but he really bought it in hopes of attracting another manufacturer, Ferguson said.
<P>   A growth credit program that will give the company reduced electric rates over the next 3-5 years and a training program for new hires were offered as incentives, he said.
<P>   Ferguson expects a number of the welders who once worked for Greeneville Industries to apply for jobs with Vulcan.
<P>   Miller Industries has manufacturing operations located in Chattanooga and in Pennsylvania, Mississippi, France and England.
<P>   Miller was one of the top performing stocks on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996, Dunayer said, and was in the top 10 of Forbes magazine&#39;s list of the best 200 small capitalization companies. It was also picked to move to the Forbes list of the 400 largest companies, he said.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Nick Gates, News-Sentinel sportswriter</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Columbus Chill is perched atop the East Coast Hockey League&#39;s North Division and it&#39;s no mirage. They&#39;re swift and tough, make tape-to-tape passes, and are willing to drop their gloves when challenged.
<P>    The Chill, minus No. 1 goaltender Jeff Salajko, didn&#39;t miss a beat Tuesday night and destroyed Knoxville 8-3 at the Civic Coliseum to add to the Cherokees&#39; mounting miseries.
<P>   Knoxville coach Barry Smith again was the verbal target of fans. A few chanted for his ouster.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We have a lot of people in the stands yelling for Barry&#39;s neck,&#39;&#39; all-star center Jim Brown said. &#39;&#39;When they&#39;re yelling for Barry&#39;s neck, they&#39;re yelling for our neck. Barry&#39;s not the one out there playing the game.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Barry&#39;s done all he can do as far as teaching us what he wants us to do. The reason we&#39;re not winning is we aren&#39;t doing those things.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Joe Coombs had two goals in support of backup goaltender David Brumby, who made 30 saves and improved his record to 5-1-0. Derek Gauthier, Keith Morris, Derek Clancey, Dave Hymovitz, Matt Oates and Beau Bilek also scored for Columbus.
<P>    Salajko was called up by Indianapolis earlier in the day. He is tied with Roanoke&#39;s Dave Gagnon for the most wins (18).
<P>    The Cherokees (12-19-1) fell behind 4-1 after one period and never had a chance against the Chill, whose 10 road wins tops the ECHL. Columbus killed six of seven shorthanded situations and converted two of four power-play chances.
<P>    Knoxville lost for the 12th time in 13 games. The slumping Cherokees have dropped five in a row, four on home ice.
<P>    Vaclav Nedomansky, Chris Fess and Brown scored Knoxville&#39;s goals. Brown&#39;s came on a power play and was his 20th.
<P>   The Cherokees&#39; dressing room resembled a morgue. Heads were down and faces long. The players held a closed-door meeting without their coach.
<P>   &#39;&#39;This is as bad as it&#39;s been in my 21 years of hockey,&#39;&#39; a dejected Brown said. &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve pretty much said everything we can say.&#39;&#39;
<P>    It took only 50 seconds for the Chill (23-10-1) to score. Gauthier roared in on Brad Guzda unchecked. He faked the goalie off his skates and deftly put a backhander into the cage.
<P>    Goals by Morris and Coombs 1:39 apart made it 3-0 and the outcome was no longer in doubt.
<P>   Knoxville&#39;s run of bad luck also continued. Nedomansky, for the third consecutive game, had a goal disallowed. He stuffed the puck behind Brumby with 37 seconds left in the first period. However, it came a split second after referee Kevin Pollock lost sight of the puck and blew his whistle. But it hardly mattered.
<P>    If there was a glimmer of hope for the home team, it was the second period. The Cherokees limited the Chill to six shots on goal and outscored Columbus 2-1. But it was only a glimmer.
<P>    Goals by Hymovitz and Oates in the first 1:56 seconds of the third period made it 7-3 and finished Guzda. He was replaced by Trent Cavicchi.
<P>    
<P>    <B>ALL-STAR REPEATER: </B>Brown has earned a trip to the ECHL All-Star Game for the second consecutive season.
<P>  The 22-player squad -- one player from each team, excluding the Charlotte Checkers -- will play the defending ECHL champions Jan. 21 at 9,570-seat Independence Arena in Charlotte. Game time is 7:35.
<P>    Roger Neilson, associate coach of the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League, will coach the All-Stars.
<P>   
<P>    
<P>    <B>SUSPENDED:</B> Knoxville&#39;s attempt to trade forward Kyle Reeves to the Jacksonville Lizard Kings has failed. Reeves has indicated he will not report to void the four-player deal.
<P>    Reeves, the ECHL&#39;s second-leading scorer with 29 goals in 31 games, got into a shouting match with Smith during the first period of Knoxville&#39;s 5-2 loss to Roanoke on Saturday night. He changed into street clothes during the first intermission and left the arena.
<P>    Reeves was suspended Tuesday for not reporting to the Lizard Kings, who are in last place in the South.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Gina Stafford, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>hen it comes to pollution in the Pigeon River, the Environmental Protection Agency has &#39;&#39;little regard&#39;&#39; for the public&#39;s concern, according to officials with the 25,000-member American Canoe Association.
<P>   The ACA, described by a spokesman as a &#39;&#39;conservation-based recreation organization,&#39;&#39; reported Monday that public comment written to the EPA was 100 percent opposed to the variance recently issued to Champion International for operation of its Canton, N.C., paper mill.
<P>   In response to a request by the ACA for all public comments concerning the potential issuing of a variance or permit, the EPA provided 135 letters, according to David Jenkins, ACA&#39;s director of conservation and public policy.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I was quite amazed that EPA did not receive a single comment in support of Champion,&#39;&#39; Jenkins stated in a press release issued Monday. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;This clearly shows how little regard EPA has for the public&#39;s concern. One hundred percent of the people responding said deny the variance and EPA still approved it.&#39;&#39;
<P>   On Dec. 26, the EPA approved a new permit issued by North Carolina officials allowing Champion to continue operating the Canton mill and polluting the Pigeon River at a level above what is allowed under federal water quality standards.
<P>   Four days later, government officials and business advocates from three counties challenged Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist to sue the Environmental Protection Agency. The group charged the EPA with shirking its duty in allowing Champion to continue polluting the Pigeon River, which flows into Tennessee.
<P>   Vice President Al Gore also declared in a statement on Dec. 30 that he was pleased that the state of Tennessee filed a formal objection to North Carolina&#39;s issuance of the permit. Gore further stated he has &#39;&#39;personally asked EPA Administrator Carol Browner to thoroughly and carefully review this objection and take appropriate action.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Public comment is required for issuance of a permit but not for a variance, according to EPA officials. Further, as a result of meetings with Tennessee environmentalists and the ACA, Champion&#39;s permit was significantly strengthened, officials said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The EPA shares Tennessee&#39;s concerns about the Pigeon River and will fully support water quality standards set by the state,&#39;&#39; EPA spokesman Stephanie Cutter said Monday.
<P>   &#39;&#39;When we considered the North Carolina variance, we listened to the citizens of Tennessee and approved the North Carolina variance only after being assured it would meet current water quality and health standards of Tennessee.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Should Tennessee decide to strengthen its standards, as we have said repeatedly, the EPA will enforce at those levels.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Champion officials haven&#39;t previously been made aware of the public&#39;s letters, company spokesman Al Joyce said Monday.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We don&#39;t know the EPA procedure for handling public comment, and we haven&#39;t seen any of the letters. This is the first we&#39;ve heard of it,&#39;&#39; Joyce said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The permit and the variance do require Champion to look for ways to continue to reduce the impact on the river, and we&#39;re committed to doing just that. I guess we respect the right of anybody to voice their opinion on any subject.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Jenkins said the 135 letters came from a mix of Tennessee state and local officials, fishermen, kayakers, representatives of church groups, outdoor clubs, environmental organizations and outdoor and tourism-related businesses.
<P>   Meanwhile, Attorney General Charles Burson on Monday declined to discuss Champion issues but said through a spokeswoman that various legal options &#39;&#39;are all under active consideration.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Burson declined to say whether he would accept an invitation to meet Jan. 14 with EPA Regional Administrator John Harkinson.
<P>   Harkinson had invited Burson to meet with him in Nashville at a planned session with the Tennessee Environmental Council.
<P>   Outgoing State Environment and Conservation Commissioner Justin Wilson planned to attend a meeting today in Atlanta between southeastern state officials and Harkinson, and Wilson said Champion issues may be discussed then.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By The Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>ASHINGTON -- Shrugging off calls from several Republicans to surrender power, Newt Gingrich lobbied the House GOP rank-and-file in private on Monday for a new term as speaker despite admitted ethics violations.
<P>    &#39;&#39;He was not contrite. He was not apologetic. He was sincere and persuasive,&#39;&#39; said Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois. Republican leaders insisted after the 31/2-hour session that Gingrich would prevail when the votes were cast at the opening session of the 105th Congress today.
<P>    One lawmaker said that in the emotionally draining meeting, Gingrich told Republicans he expected no further embarrassing disclosures to come out in his case. Others said the Georgian accused Democrats of using the House ethics committee for political mischief.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Basically, he let the members know that this is not about Newt Gingrich. This is about political assassination,&#39;&#39; said Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the GOP whip.
<P>    Gingrich himself said little as he left the meeting. He told reporters it had gone &#39;&#39;very well. I had a great time.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Still, it was clear his critics were determined to follow through with their plans to oppose him. Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, recently elected to his 11th term, issued a written statement saying the Georgian was &#39;&#39;ethically damaged&#39;&#39; and that &#39;&#39;for the country&#39;s sake&#39;&#39; should be replaced by another Republican.
<P>    Rep. Linda Smith of Washington said she also would oppose Gingrich because, once returned to office, &#39;&#39;he will take all the focus off the positive agenda and onto him.&#39;&#39; At least two other Republicans indicated plans to oppose Gingrich&#39;s re-election.
<P>    A public opinion poll showed two-thirds of Americans, including half of Republicans, believe Gingrich should be replaced as speaker. The same CNN-USA Today-Gallup survey found 41 percent of Americans said Gingrich should resign from Congress altogether.
<P>    A CBS News poll also released Monday found 51 percent of Americans saying the charges against Gingrich are serious enough to justify his replacement as speaker, 33 percent said they are not and the rest didn&#39;t know.
<P>    After the Republican caucus, Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House, flatly predicted Gingrich would be re-elected.
<P>    After two years of steadfast denials of wrongdoing, Gingrich conceded on Dec. 21 that &#39;&#39;in my name and over my signature, inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable statements were given to the (ethics) committee.&#39;&#39;
<P>    In addition, he agreed to an ethics committee statement that he had failed to &#39;&#39;seek and follow&#39;&#39; legal advice that would have told him he was improperly using tax-exempt organizations to further political aims.
<P>    The ethics committee is expected to meet in the next several days to determine Gingrich&#39;s punishment, and ultimately the issue will reach the House floor.
<P>    In comments echoed by other Republicans, Rep. William Goodling of Pennsylvania said Gingrich had assured fellow Republicans at the caucus that he believes there are no further damaging disclosures to emerge in his case.
<P>    Other lawmakers said Gingrich fielded questions about his case and blamed the Democrats.
<P>    Rep. Mark Foley of Florida told reporters that while Gingrich&#39;s critics spoke, they received a cooler reception that his supporters.
<P>    &#39;&#39;To those who suggested that Newt step aside there hasn&#39;t been any applause,&#39;&#39; Foley said. &#39;&#39;But to those suggesting Newt remain as speaker there have been strong ovations.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- More than twice as many murderers, rapists and pedophiles on probation move to Tennessee than leave for other states, a legislative committee concluded Monday.
<P>   A special House committee called by Rep. Doug Jackson, D-Dickson, hopes to remedy problems under the federal Interstate Compact, an agreement between 40 states regrading the movement of parolees and felons on probation.
<P>   The compact permits monitoring of these individuals from state to state, but Jackson, other state officials and victims rights&#39; groups say Tennessee is getting the short end of the stick.
<P>   In fact, persons convicted in other states are attracted to Tennessee.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The word on the street is that there are a lot of jobs in the state,&#39;&#39; said Bobby Halliburton, Department of Correction assistant commissioner and compact administrator. Felons &#39;&#39;said they have no family here; they said it is a low-property tax state, there&#39;s no income tax and there&#39;s a low crime rate.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Part of the problem may be in Tennessee.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We all know we have some problems with letting more offenders in than we send out,&#39;&#39; said Correction Commissioner Donal Campbell.
<P>   The Correction Department oversees felons on probation -- that is, felons who have not served time in prison but are under supervision for crimes committed elsewhere. In the 1995-96 year, 1,158 felons on probation entered Tennessee, compared to 515 that left the state.
<P>   In contrast, the Board of Paroles oversees parolees in Tennessee under the compact but gets about the same number from other states as leave Tennessee.
<P>   The Board of Paroles reported 599 parolees -- felons who have served prison time -- had moved here in November, compared to 572 that left that month.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We interpret the compact very strictly,&#39;&#39; said Donna Blackburn, executive director of the Board of Paroles.
<P>   The compact was approved at the federal level in 1934 and adopted in Tennessee in 1955.
<P>   Debbie English, Correction Department legal counsel, said it was intended to provide supervision of felons &#39;&#39;to protect the community&#39;&#39; and to provide &#39;&#39;rehabilitation through monitoring.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Under the terms of the compact, felons on probation and parolees in other states may enter Tennessee if they are residents, have family members here, have jobs waiting here or get Tennessee&#39;s approval, English said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We have very dangerous individuals entering the state,&#39;&#39; Jackson said.
<P>   Campbell conceded his department could do a better job. Policies for probationers entering Tennessee, for example, are not up to date, as opposed to the policies of the Board of Paroles, which told the committee it has tough, written guidelines.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There are changes that will be made,&#39;&#39; Campbell said. &#39;&#39;We recognize that there are some problems.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Defining a felon&#39;s family in writing and requiring that the felon live within 20 miles of his family may be recommended, Campbell said.
<P>   Jackson and other committee members proposed legislation or Correction Department changes to:
<P>   * Adopt tough compact rules for admission to the state.
<P>   * Reject nonresidents.
<P>   * Reject applicants with proposed jobs that are inappropriate.
<P>   * Make it a felony in Tennessee to violate other states&#39; parole or probation.
<P>   * Make it a crime to give false information when applying to move under the compact, and make it an offense if the parolee/probationer violates Tennessee&#39;s probation and parole laws.
<P>   Now, the person may be sent to the convicting state if they violate parole and probation laws there.
<P>   The committee meets again in late January.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By The Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- The 16th year is anything but sweet for Tennessee teenaged drivers and their parents, according to a survey.
<P>    The Nashville Banner examined 1993-95 reports of crashes involving drivers who were 16 years old, the minimum age for obtaining a driver&#39;s license.
<P>    The survey found that about one of every four licensed 16-year-olds was involved in a crash during each of those years.
<P>    That compared to one crash per 25 licensed drivers for all other age groups during the same period.
<P>    Of Tennessee&#39;s 95 counties, Sumner County ranked worst, the Banner reported.
<P>    Sixteen-year-old drivers accounted for about 1 percent of the state&#39;s licensed drivers during each of the years in question, yet annually they were involved in about 5.5 percent of the total accidents in the state.
<P>    While a majority of the crashes by 16-year-olds produced property damage only, the number of injury-producing crashes rose to 3,048 in 1995. There were 30 fatalities among 16-year-olds in 1995.
<P>   Diane Thorne, director of the Governor&#39;s Highway Safety Office, said novice drivers need to understand that an accident is no accident if it&#39;s preventable.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We need to quit calling them accidents,&#39;&#39; Thorne said. &#39;&#39;They are wrecks. They are crashes. They are not accidents.&#39;&#39;
<P>    State Rep. John Deberry, D-Memphis, blames Tennessee&#39;s licensing system.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s too easy,&#39;&#39; said DeBerry, who tried unsuccessfully in 1995 to raise Tennessee&#39;s minimum licensing age from 16 to 17.
<P>    DeBerry complains that teens progress from bicycles to cars within a matter of a year.
<P>   &#39;&#39;If a kid can park a car, drive around the block with a driving inspector and he can see, then he can get an unrestricted license. That&#39;s where the problem is,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>  Researchers say teens&#39; inexperience and willingness to take risks hamper them from the first moment they grip the steering wheel.
<P>    Their abilities to &#39;&#39;search and scan&#39;&#39; the roadway are less developed than more-experienced motorists, and they are &#39;&#39;more likely to perceive hazardous situations as less dangerous than they are,&#39;&#39; said Pat Waller, director of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.
<P>    &#39;&#39;For instance, they&#39;re unable to recognize that they should move over when they see cars trying to merge,&#39;&#39; Waller says.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Amy McRary, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>vi, the author with one name and more than 90 awards for his children&#39;s books, has written a serialized children&#39;s novel for newspapers.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Keep Your Eye on Amanda&#39;&#39; tells the adventures of two young twins who happen to be raccoons. Amanda, as guessed by the title, is the curious rascal of the pair. The story&#39;s 21 chapters start today and will be published each Tuesday in The News-Sentinel.
<P>   Serializing a novel isn&#39;t a new concept, but it hasn&#39;t been done often in today&#39;s papers. &#39;&#39;I am of the age where I remember reading books serialized in newspapers as a kid,&#39;&#39; said Avi, an avid newspaper reader. &#39;&#39;It is something I have always wanted to do and it somehow all worked out.
<P>  &#39;&#39;It&#39;s an exciting opportunity to bring something wonderful to kids,&#39;&#39; said Avi in a recent telephone interview from his Boulder, Colo., home. &#39;&#39;I feel like there is some sort of mission involved here in the best sense of the word.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The idea for &#39;&#39;Amanda&#39;&#39; came from Avi&#39;s kitchen. &#39;&#39;I moved here a little more than a year ago to Colorado. Two days later, I walked down and there were a couple of raccoons in my kitchen. I had to chase them out. During the summer, I was having dinner and five raccoons walked in.&#39;&#39; 
<P>   A novel serialization is among the several different writing styles employed by Avi, whose first book was published in 1970. He&#39;s written a comic book -- &#39;&#39;City of Light, City of Dark&#39;&#39; -- and composed another book entirely in dialogue -- &#39;&#39;Who Was That Masked Man, Anyway?&#39;&#39; Well known for historical fiction like the Newbery Honor Book &#39;&#39;The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle,&#39;&#39; Avi&#39;s also written the funny &#39;&#39;Romeo and Juliet -- Together (And Alive) and the spooky &#39;&#39;Something Upstairs.&#39;&#39; His new two-book &#39;&#39;Beyond the Western Sea&#39;&#39; novel about 1851 immigration from Europe to America was written in the style of the Victorian novel. Two new books -- &#39;&#39;Finding Providence&#39;&#39; and the story collection &#39;&#39;What Do Fish Have To Do With Anything?&#39;&#39; --  are scheduled to be released this year.
<P>     Although he is a prolific author who works on several books at once, Avi says writing is extremely difficult. &#39;&#39;Amanda&#39;&#39; took eight to nine months to complete.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s a long, slow process of endless rewriting; I rewrite 40 to 50 times.&#39;&#39; He may get tired of retelling the story, &#39;&#39;but the fact is it gets better all the time.&#39;&#39; 
<P>   Growing up Avi dreamed of designing and flying airplanes, not of creating and writing books. He lives with a learning disability that makes writing and spelling a laborious process. &#39;&#39;I am still a bad speller,&#39;&#39; he says.
<P>   But at age 16 he dreamed of becoming a playwright after a tutor encouraged him. &#39;&#39;She looked through the dishevel and the mess and said, &#39;You&#39;re interesting. I like you.&#39; &#39;&#39;
<P>   A former librarian, Avi spends lots of time researching his books&#39; time period and/or subject. &#39;&#39;For every 100 pieces of information, you use one.&#39;&#39; He frequently reads his in-process books to school groups or shares them with writer friends. He&#39;s changed books after watching -- not hearing -- the reactions of young listeners.
<P>   &#39;&#39;You sense it&#39;s not working very well and you go back and change,&#39;&#39; he says.
<P>
<P>&#39;&#39;Kids are very polite, but they can get restless. And when there&#39;s all that squirming around, you know it&#39;s not there. If they are still, you know you have them. It&#39;s not their comments, but their body movement.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Avi worked as a librarian for years while writing, hoping his books would be published. He tried writing adult novels, none of which were published. &#39;&#39;I think I must have thrown those out,&#39;&#39; he now says. He left his librarian job to write full time 17 years after his first book -- a collection of stories he told his older son -- was published. 
<P>   His audience has likely changed in more than two decades &#39;&#39;but it&#39;s not something I&#39;m conscious of.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;(Because of) the nature of television, the pace of it, you have to be able to tell a story that gets off the mark very quickly, that holds a kid&#39;s attention. But once you do that, it&#39;s not very difficult.&#39;&#39; 
<P>   He frequently speaks to school groups and is often asked for his advice about writing. He doesn&#39;t soft-peddle the nature of his craft.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I tell them the most important thing to do for writing is to read. Reading teaches you more about writing than anything else. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;I try to tell them it&#39;s very hard; I don&#39;t pretend it&#39;s easy. Simply because a lot of kids get very frustrated thinking that they don&#39;t write very well. If they are frustrated, that&#39;s a good sign. If they think they have written something really good the first time, they&#39;re in trouble.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Being discouraged is what writing is all about -- you look at it and think, &#39;That could be better.&#39; . . . But there is wonderful satisfaction in writing a story that works.&#39;&#39;

<P>   &#39;&#39;We think it probably fits the reckless endangerment statute,&#39;&#39; Knox County District Attorney General Randy Nichols said.
<P>   The prostitute, who gave a North Knoxville address, was listed Monday in serious condition at the University of Tennessee Medical Center. She was taken Saturday to the facility after she was found bleeding severely from the vaginal area.
<P>   At first, the woman told police she had miscarried the 7-month-old fetus. An examination by doctors revealed otherwise.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There&#39;s no evidence that she tried to self-abort,&#39;&#39; Nichols said. &#39;&#39;There was some problem with the pregnancy, and she thought she had miscarried.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The police probably saved the child&#39;s life. We&#39;re told the baby has a very healthy heartbeat.&#39;&#39;
<P>   When Knoxville officers encountered the prostitute on Milligan Street, she had been scuffling with another woman, records show. The other woman told police she was trying to help the prostitute, whose jeans were soaked in blood.
<P>   The other woman told police the prostitute had just injected herself with cocaine.
<P>   Nichols said state law allows a person to be charged if he or she engages in conduct that could cause serious bodily injury to an unborn child. Nichols said the charge would be a misdemeanor carrying a maximum of nine months in jail upon conviction.
<P>   Because the prostitute has other pending charges, including failure to appear in court and possession of drug paraphernalia, police said they probably won&#39;t charge the woman until she is released from the hospital. The woman has a criminal history with more than a dozen convictions -- including two for prostitution -- dating to 1984, records show.
<P>   &#39;&#39;If I can keep her in jail, she won&#39;t be able to smoke crack cocaine,&#39;&#39; Nichols said.
<P>   What happens after the baby is born?
<P>   &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know the answer to that,&#39;&#39; Nichols said. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve never attempted to take a child from a mother like this before.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Jim Balloch, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>ORRISTOWN -- A proposed industrial park in south Hamblen County, which created a political firestorm and led to a citywide referendum in November, is the subject of a study committee.
<P>   The committee, appointed by Morristown Mayor J.B. Shockley shortly after city voters rejected a bond issue of up to $5.775 million to finance the park, will hold at least two public hearings, said council member Kay Senter, who is committee chair.
<P>   Other committee members are Councilman Luke Pack, who opposed the use of eminent domain to take land for the park; the Rev. Frank W. Houston; Carl Storms; and Lynn Elkins.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Some people think the committee&#39;s purpose is to pick a site, but that is not correct,&#39;&#39; Senter said. &#39;&#39;We were appointed to establish the criteria for selection of a site.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The date for the first public hearing has not been set, but it will be late this month, Senter said.
<P>   When Shockley appointed the committee, he said it was in part to heal division the industrial park issue had created.
<P>   &#39;&#39;One of the major bones of contention about the proposed site is, and was, what makes a site suitable for an industrial park,&#39;&#39; Shockley said. &#39;&#39;We need a good solid description of what qualities will and would make a good, successful industrial park site.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Several days after the committee was formed, an issue of Tennessee Town and City magazine published an interview Shockley had given after the referendum. His remarks indicate the city remains committed to the originally targeted site.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Our plan is the same as the initial plan -- to appraise, negotiate and purchase,&#39;&#39; Shockley said in the interview. &#39;&#39;This is a prime spot to locate an industrial park. The state of Tennessee will tell you that. Our industrial boards here will tell you that, even though we have a very few unwilling sellers.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Park supporters, organized as Citizens for Progress, argue that the site is the best suitable industrial site remaining in Hamblen County and that the park is critical to securing the area&#39;s economic future. That future, they say, is threatened by emotional anti-park arguments raised by a few landowners.
<P>   Some of the targeted landowners, organized as Stop the Industrial Park, are angry that they learned from news media that their property had been selected and could be taken by eminent domain if they did not want to sell. They also raised questions about the site selection process.
<P>   After a divided Morristown City Council approved the bond issue, STIP persuaded enough city voters to sign a petition calling for the referendum, which defeated the bond issue.
<P>   Tim Hopson, president of STIP,  said his group suspects pro-park forces have no intention of considering any other site.
<P>    &#39;&#39;They are for this one, do or die,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We believe the committee members are all sincere folks and will do the very best job they can.
<P>    &#39;&#39;But anything they come up with has to go through City Council, and (the pro-park forces) still have the majority vote there.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Senter said that while the committee &#39;&#39;was probably created as a public relations gesture . . . I believe we can take it a step further and produce some independent results of substance. For instance, I think we can produce some recommendations which, if followed, will improve the process used in the future to select any site for any project.&#39;&#39;
<P>   She said the committee can, among other things, independently evaluate a criteria list presented by the city&#39;s industrial development board, which selected the south Hamblen site.
<P>   &#39;&#39;If nothing else,&#39;&#39; she added, &#39;&#39;we will make sure everyone who wants to be heard on this will get to be heard.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Campaign financial statements, filed after the referendum, show that Citizens for Progress received more than $20,000 in contributions during the second reporting period -- including a $1,500 contribution from the Industrial Development Board of the city of Morristown.
<P>   Morristown&#39;s newspaper, the Citizen-Tribune, contributed $1,000. The Citizen-Tribune&#39;s publisher, Jack Fishman, is chairman of the city&#39;s Industrial Development Board.
<P>   Morristown City Administrator Mike Lutche contributed $1,000.   Other contributions include:
<P>
<P>   * $2,000 from Tenn-Rental.
<P>   * $1,000 from Barge Waggoner Sumner & Cannon Engineers Architects & Planners, which produced site maps for the project and whose engineer, Randy Corlew, is a member of the Industrial Development Board and chairman of the Chamber of Commerce&#39;s private industrial development board.
<P>   * $1,000 each from Wallace Hardware; Franklin Federal; Tuff Torq; Price and Price; First Tennessee Bank; Bacon, Jessee, Perkins and Swanson; United Southern Bank; Sun Trust; Greene County Bank.
<P>   * $500 each from ISU Agency; Tennessee Industrial Disposal; Lakeway Hotels; ACN Inc.; Toyoda TRW; United Cities Gas; Andrew Johnson Bank; Rusty Wallace Pontiac; Morristown Ford; Coffman Oil; Rogers Petroleum; Pioneer Petroleum; and McGuffin Truss.
<P>
<P>     For the same period, STIP contributions, largely from individuals, totaled $520. In the first reporting period, STIP was also heavily outfinanced by Citizens for Progress.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>urder defendant Richard A. Tate was sent to a state mental health institute Monday after two experts found him incompetent to stand trial for killing his young son in 1990.
<P>   Knox County Criminal Court Judge Richard Baumgartner ordered Tate, 32, sent to Middle Tennessee Mental Health Institute in Nashville. He will remain hospitalized until his mental health improves enough for him to stand trial, the judge said.
<P>   Tate&#39;s institutionalization came seven years to the day that he allegedly slashed and nearly decapitated 13-month-old Michael B. Tate. Knox County prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.
<P>    The case is among the oldest active prosecutions in Knox County Criminal Court.
<P>   Knox County District Public Defender Mark Stephens and Assistant Public Defender John Halstead contend Tate is mentally retarded as well as mentally ill. Tate was evaluated last month in separate sessions by psychologist Eric Engumand Dr. Clif Tennison, a psychiatrist at Helen Ross McNabb Center Inc.
<P>   The experts noted Tate suffers from paranoia and recently tried to hang himself in the Knox County Jail. Engum and Tennison said Tate also suffers from hallucinations or misperceptions.
<P>   Tate has been beaten several times by jail inmates and has complained of poor treatment by guards. Stephens said jail authorities have worked with him to try to make his client&#39;s life better.
<P>   Tate appeared in court Monday with a large red scrape on his left cheek. Stephens said his client, who has served time in prison on other convictions, dug out the skin where prisoners once forcibly placed a beauty mark.
<P>   Tate&#39;s case has been delayed through the years in part because lawyers debated who should prosecute him. The Knox County district attorney general&#39;s office ultimately was removed from the case; 9th Judicial District prosecutors took over.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>EMPHIS -- An agreement between the Tennessee Valley Authority and Memphis health authorities means the agency will cut smog-producing pollution at one of its facilities.
<P>   Memphis Health Department officials want TVA to curb the release of nitrogen dioxide at the Allen Fossil Plant generating station in southwest Memphis. Nitrogen dioxide reacts with sunlight to form ozone, a lung-damaging component of smog.
<P>   The agreement requires that 65 percent of the coal burned between May 1 and Oct. 1 each year be of a cleaner-burning, low-sulfur variety mined in Western states.
<P>   Local officials will write the agreement into the operating conditions of the plant&#39;s air pollution permit, said Carter Gray of the Health Department. TVA air regulatory specialist Steven Strunk said the agency hopes to burn all low-sulfur coal at the plant and exceed the terms of the agreement.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- Sen. Bill Frist and two Tennessee representatives are opposed to wider use of marijuana as medicine.
<P>   Voters in California and Arizona have approved exempting doctors from prosecution if they recommend marijuana for their patients.
<P>   But the Clinton administration said it will continue enforcing the federal ban on using marijuana as medicine.
<P>   Frist, a heart transplant surgeon, said Senate and House colleagues have sought him out for advice on the matter.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There is no demonstrated medical use of the drug,&#39;&#39; said Frist, a Republican. &#39;&#39;We do need more scientific studies. . . . I think it does boil down to science in terms of are there specific medical indications in which this is the only drug available.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Henderson, a former federal prosecutor in West Tennessee, said he found it incredible that a state could vote to legalize pot.
<P>   &#39;&#39;How a majority could vote that way? . . . Maybe they inhaled before they went, I don&#39;t know.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Bryant said he is against any effort &#39;&#39;under any guise, to legalize a very harmful drug.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Murfreesboro, shares Bryant&#39;s views.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I oppose any attempts to weaken our laws governing narcotics,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;If any substance has medicinal value, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has a procedure to scientifically analyze the evidence and approve drugs accordingly.&#39;&#39;
<P>   But Grant Houston, past director of the Nashville chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML, said clear evidence has been presented about the value of marijuana.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The administration and the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) are impeding the understanding of the truth by playing with nitpick details and keeping smoke in the public&#39;s eye,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It (the government) wants us to get our information from politicians and policemen. This government is more interested in vomiting in pain correctly rather than a puff of a marijuana cigarette.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Pam Park, News-Sentinel business writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT>hilips Consumer Electronics recently clarified its intentions regarding its operations in Knoxville, Jefferson City and Greeneville, but there are still some short-term and long-term &#39;&#39;ifs&#39;&#39; remaining.
<P>   The Philips headquarters and 150 people move to Atlanta, but the engineering and support staffers stay in Knoxville. The customer service center stays in Jefferson City. GC Capital is poised to buy and operate the main manufacturing plant in Greeneville, and buyers are being sought for other facilities there.
<P>   The key &#39;&#39;if&#39;&#39; at this point is the sale of the Greeneville Plant 3 facilities to GC Capital LLC.
<P>   Plant 3 houses the television manufacturing, shipping and warehousing and injection molding operations. Right now, about 1,050 workers are employed there, according to their union. In peak production times, the number goes up 500-600.
<P>   Rather than abruptly closing a plant that is underutilized and putting hundreds of people out of work, Philips has sought a buyer. Philips management deserves credit for that. However, the potential new owners, trying to negotiate a deal that will allow them to compete with manufacturing plants across the Mexican border and in the Asia-Pacific region, have run afoul of workers.
<P>   In December, the Plant 3 workers soundly rejected a labor contract that would have cut their benefits significantly and shifted more of the payment burden for continuing benefits to them.
<P>   At an average of $8.55 per hour, Philips Greeneville plant wages were already lower than the $11.03 average manufacturing wage in the Knoxville area. Cuts would put some workers at the poverty line, their union said.
<P>   During the holidays, GC Capital principal George Taylor said he didn&#39;t know what else he could do and was not sure whether he would attempt further contract negotiations.
<P>   Philips has amended 60-day layoff notices for the plant -- originally issued Oct. 3 to be effective Dec. 31 -- until Jan. 13, when it still hopes to close the sale. If there is no immediate labor settlement, Philips could extend the notices still further.
<P>   Whether Philips will extend the notices &#39;&#39;is completely contingent on developing events,&#39;&#39; Philips spokesman Jayson Hill said.
<P>  Speaking of layoff notices, Philips&#39; Oct. 3 WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notice) Act notice was a blanket statement that indicated<B> </B>all the Philips Greeneville employees were to be permanently laid off in connection with the sale of the facilities. (This was supposed to be a technicality because the new owner was expected to rehire most of them.) After The News-Sentinel and others published a story to that effect, Robert Minkhorst, president and chief executive officer, issued a clarification, saying only the 500 or so seasonal employees were affected by the notice.
<P>   At that time, the Tennessee Department of Labor did not have a copy of the notice on hand. When I requested a copy last week, they said they only had the cover sheet -- they had requested the attachments that detailed the number and positions of workers to be laid off but had not received them. Later, a TDOL spokeswoman called to say the dislocated worker unit was told the notice affected 637 seasonal workers. Since the rest of the employees would be retained by the new company, the state would not need a notice for them, she said.
<P>   Next I asked union officials for a copy of their Oct. 3 WARN notice. It listed 1,933 people to be laid off. Since Philips now says it is extending its notice to Jan. 13, it looks like the Oct. 3 notice applied to the whole lot after all. Or not. Or maybe Philips gets to pick one. Or both.
<P>   In another piece of numerical confusion, Knoxville and Knox County economic development and government leaders were justifiably ecstatic about retaining 850 jobs when Philips decided to move only 150 executive and sales staff to new company headquarters in Atlanta. The engineers and support staff are to stay in Knoxville, at least for the time being. The only problem is that the 850 jobs so joyously cited appear to include about 300 people who work at the Jefferson City service center. That would mean Knoxville actually kept about 550 jobs.
<P>   That&#39;s nothing to sneeze at. Minkhorst seemed pleased to announce it, and we&#39;re definitely pleased to hear it.
<P>   State and local authorities worked hard to find some incentives they could legally offer Philips to keep them here -- most economic incentives are based on attracting new jobs rather than retaining existing ones -- but part of the reason for Philips&#39; decision is its continuing manufacturing relationships in the area. Philips is apparently guaranteeing GC Capital production contracts for four years. At the end of that time, who knows? And what if the GC Capital deal falls through?
<P>   We may be looking at another re-evaluation of Knoxville sometime in the future. All we can do is make sure we&#39;re ready, and competitive.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Pam Park, News-Sentinel business writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT>eRoyal Industries Inc. has purchased the assets of a Costa Rican company that makes a key component of its temperature-monitoring medical devices.
<P>   Sensores Cientificos, a manufacturer of sensors with ceramic thermistor chips used to monitor core and surface body temperature during surgery, is now DeRoyal Central America.
<P>   The company has 60 employees in a 13,000 square-foot facility in San Jose, Costa Rica. Chips produced there will be shipped to the DeRoyal campus in Tazewell for completion.
<P>   The asset purchase, for which terms were not disclosed, was both a defensive and offensive move for DeRoyal, said Brian DeBusk, chief operating officer. 
<P>   Sensores Cientificos had been DeRoyal&#39;s supplier since about 1993.
<P>    Then DeRoyal learned the company wanted to sell the Costa Rican facility and consolidate its operations in Saint Kitts in the British West Indies, where it would focus on automotive sensors and generic printed circuit boards.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We looked at this as a threat because it could have interrupted our supply of a key product. On the upside, it was an opportunity to add this technology into our existing manufacturing processes,&#39;&#39; DeBusk said.
<P>   Control of the ceramic thermistor chip is important because it can account for 60 percent to 90 percent of the cost of a sensor component, DeBusk said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It really is what drives the cost of the completed device,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   DeRoyal will use the chips in its products and sell chips to other medical companies. It is expected to improve DeRoyal&#39;s competitive position.
<P>   &#39;&#39;In health care today, the name of the game is becoming a low-cost producer,&#39;&#39; DeBusk said.
<P>   The chips are commonly used in esophageal stethoscopes, which are inserted down the esophagus to monitor heart sounds during surgery. When a sensor chip is included in the device, it can also be used to monitor core body temperature.
<P>    A temperature sensor can be included in Foley catheters for urinary drainage so the catheter can serve a double purpose. It&#39;s more comfortable for the patient, more discreet and more cost effective, DeBusk said.
<P>   Hospitals also use the thermistor chip in measuring the body temperature of babies. They hold it against a newborn baby&#39;s skin with a small pad and use measurements off the probe to control the temperature of an incubator or radiant warmer, he said.
<P>   The chips could be made anywhere, but the process does require &#39;&#39;somewhat skilled&#39;&#39; labor, DeBusk said. More than 90 percent of the Costa Rican work force is literate, by high standards, and they understand technical issues, he said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I can see why it had been a favorite place for doing this kind of work,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   In December DeRoyal signed licensing agreements with Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corp. for the use of two inventions developed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
<P>    Those inventions are expected to offer a better, less costly way to deliver radioisotopes used in medical diagnostic imaging and are also part of DeRoyal&#39;s move into the high technology sector.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>TORRS, Conn. -- Lucy is nursing and cleaning up her baby, Lil, born less than an hour before her visitors arrive. Vanessa is bleeding from a cut in her ear. Ginger and Gina are having a late breakfast.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Moo,&#39;&#39; they greet their callers.
<P>   The visitors are not cowed. They are a professor and two fourth-year students from Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, and they are here to test nearly 100 cows at the University of Connecticut dairy farms for pregnancy.
<P>   They will not use home pregnancy tests, or ultrasound. Instead, they will reach deep into the cows and check to see if their uteruses are enlarged.
<P>   Not that they are without modern techniques and technology. It&#39;s just that it saves time and money to do it the old-fashioned way, and time and money are much on the minds of these vets.
<P>   Today&#39;s veterinarians use syringes and scalpels and ultrasound machines, but they also use calculators. They are reaching beyond emergency and sick cattle work into farm management and production medicine. They look into the raising of calves, into milking machines, and into feeds and crops.
<P>   The idea is to help farmers improve production, and make their farms more efficient. An example: Sherry Holt and Margaret Farnon, the students who are testing the cows, also will visit a small commercial dairy farm to analyze its management and make suggestions on how the owner can improve profits.
<P>   &#39;&#39;When they are in practice, they can advise a client not just how to treat a sick cow but how to improve their management in order to be more efficient,&#39;&#39; says Dr. George Saperstein, head of the Tufts ambulatory service. &#39;&#39;The more efficient the farmer, the more net profit, the better-off the veterinarian.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The future of veterinary medicine on the farm is advising the client on how to be more efficient so that we&#39;re partners in their operation. Rather than the plumber you call when the pipe is broken, we&#39;re the consultant that recommends how to prevent the pipe from breaking in the first place.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Saperstein, 46, is a second-generation veterinarian.
<P>   &#39;&#39;My father&#39;s generation went into it for different reasons than my generation did,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;I think in the &#39;40s when he went into it, it was seen as a way to serve your small home community and learn a sophisticated medical trade.
<P>   &#39;&#39;When I went to veterinary school, I wanted to work for somebody for a couple of years, and then hopefully have my own practice. Today&#39;s students want to work in a large group practice and have decent hours. My generation, my father&#39;s generation, would work until there was no more work, which was around the clock, seven days a week.&#39;&#39;
<P>   It is not the most lucrative occupation. Tuition is about $26,000 a year at Tufts. After graduation, the starting salary is around $30,000 a year.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think we&#39;re all a little different,&#39;&#39; says Holt, 41, who has degrees in photojournalism, nursing and marketing, and was just shy of a thesis for one in wildlife biology when she was accepted at Tufts. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve always loved wildlife. I&#39;m better at medicine than I am at art. My kids are older. I didn&#39;t want to think about human medicine because I really wasn&#39;t up to eight more years. I was too old to start medical school as far as I was concerned.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Farnon, 34, was an environmental consultant before she turned to veterinary science. She exults in it.
<P>   &#39;&#39;You get to use your body and your mind,&#39;&#39; she says. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s a very physically active job. If you&#39;re a person who likes animals, it&#39;s just endless joy to be with them all day and have that be your work.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The pregnancy tests are uneventful. Some of the cows are bossy. Others are rude, butting heads at the water cooler to go first. Some are curious, sniffing their visitors. Vanessa, the one with the cut ear, is frightened as Dr. Howard Levine, an associate professor at Tufts, stitches it.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think animals are like people.&#39;&#39; says Farnon. &#39;&#39;They do have fear, happiness. They have a lot of the same emotions we experience, but I think they&#39;re unlike us in that they don&#39;t complain.&#39;&#39;

		<h3>Raytheon to buy TI defense unit</h3>
<P>
<P>   BOSTON -- As defense companies combined around it, Raytheon Co. faced a choice: Get bigger or get out.
<P>   On Monday, Raytheon put its money on the table with an agreement to buy Texas Instruments&#39; defense business for $2.95 billion. The deal increases its chances of being one of the surviving defense contractors.
<P>   Texas Instruments Defense Systems & Electronics Group employs about 12,000 people and had projected 1996 revenue of about $1.8 billion. Raytheon, which itself has about 75,000 employees, said the unit would remain based in Lewisville, Texas.
<P>   No significant job cuts were projected.
<P>   The announcement sent shares in both companies rising on the New York Stock Exchange, where Texas Instruments Inc. rose 621/2 cents to close at $67.621/2 and Raytheon was up 25 cents to close at $50.
<P>   The cash purchase, expected to be completed in the second quarter of 1997, would place Lexington, Mass.-based Raytheon second to Lockheed Martin Corp. in revenue from defense electronics.
<P>   Its overall defense revenue of $8 billion still leaves it a distant third to Lockheed and the company formed by last month&#39;s announced merger of Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. Raytheon&#39;s total annual revenue will be about $15 billion after the acquisition.

In May 1992 he joined UNC Inc. as vice president and controller.
<P>
<P><h3>Denso names new vice president</h3>
<P>
<P>   Denso Manufacturing Tennessee Inc. has promoted Jack Helmboldt to vice president, production, maintenance, production control and manfacturing engineering, alternator/starter division.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By David Keim, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>mprovements to Knox County&#39;s Juvenile Court facilities and laptop computers for the Knoxville Police Department are in limbo because the city and county can&#39;t agree on how to divide $815,500 in federal grant money.
<P>   Juvenile Court Judge Carey E. Garrett said Friday the county needs about half the money to replace computers that are &#39;&#39;10 years out of date&#39;&#39; and to fix security problems that are growing increasingly difficult.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It all depends on the county getting a fair share of the grant, as I understand it,&#39;&#39; Garrett said.
<P>   Fixing the problems will cost an estimated $581,100, but the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance awarded the county only $93,714 from the federal Local Law Enforcement Block Grants Program this year.
<P>   The city got $721,799 and has offered the county $100,000.
<P>    The county wants about $300,000 of city money, however, according to a chart provided by County Executive Tommy Schumpert.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;re still negotiating,&#39;&#39; Schumpert said Friday.
<P>   Knoxville Police Chief Phil Keith said the city needs most of its grant money to provide more laptop computers and other technology for officers.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It is part of our strategic plan to build the infrastructure of our organization to carry it into the 21st century,&#39;&#39; Keith said. &#39;&#39;It will help us do a better job in our investigations; it will help us track and preserve evidence better.
<P>  &#39;&#39;It will assist us in developing and training our officers in the computer technology business, and the bottom line is it will lower our operating costs, or at least contain our operating costs, which of course has a great deal of importance to me.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The original grant amounts were based on the violent crime rate in local jurisdictions, and most violent crimes in Knox County occur within the Knoxville city limits.
<P>   Federal rules, however, allowed the county to appeal to state Attorney General Charles Burson if a substantial city-county funding disparity was &#39;&#39;likely to threaten the efficient administration of justice.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Burson certified a funding disparity in September, leaving the city and county to settle the matter themselves.
<P>   Schumpert said a consultant who studied Knox County&#39;s justice system said the county should get half the grant money.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We really operate all of the justice system except law enforcement, and law enforcement is divided&#39;&#39; between the city and county, Schumpert said.
<P>   He argued his case in a Sept. 3 letter to Burson.
<P>   The original funding level &#39;&#39;threatens the efficient administration of justice as it gives only one player in the Criminal Justice System the majority of the financial power,&#39;&#39; Schumpert wrote.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The rest of the members of the system (for which Knox County alone has funding duties), the Knox County Sheriff&#39;s Department, the Clerks, the District Attorney&#39;s Office and the Public Defender&#39;s Office, have no voice without your certification&#39;&#39; of a funding disparity.
<P>   Keith and Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe, however, argued the funding disparity didn&#39;t threaten the administration of justice, pointing out the county got the bulk of federal Byrne Block Grant Program money last year.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It is obviously clear if the juvenile records and information system were a priority and the court room security (was) part of an overall plan, that during the previous year of Byrne funds where 95 percent of those funds went directly to Knox County, these requested projects should have been considered but were not,&#39;&#39; Keith wrote to Burson.
<P>   The city helped the county get Byrne money this year, too -- $120,000 to $160,000, depending on whether one believes the city or county -- although Schumpert said that&#39;s a separate issue.
<P>   As for Burson&#39;s ruling that a disparity exists, Keith said:
<P>   &#39;&#39;He says there&#39;s merit to disparity. That&#39;s not saying he agrees. He made a political decision. He didn&#39;t want to referee local battles, and I don&#39;t blame him.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Keith and Schumpert both said they hope for a solution soon.
<P>    The money must be encumbered by Sept. 30, 1998.
<P>   The Juvenile Court judge said the new computers will help with sharing of information with law enforcement, lawyers and agencies that work with youths.
<P>   Also, Garrett said: &#39;&#39;The computer program is old and outdated. It doesn&#39;t keep the statistics that Nashvile requires, and we&#39;re in a bind all the time, getting the statistical records to Nashville accurately.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Security will include a metal detector and limited access to certain areas through use of electronic access badges.
<P>    Currently, security isn&#39;t a simple matter.
<P>   &#39;&#39;If there&#39;re any threats or any indication prior to the case being heard, we&#39;ll have people searched if we have any reason to believe there might be a weapon or a threat, but that&#39;s a slow process and hard to handle down here, because we have a big crowd in the waiting room,&#39;&#39; Garrett said.
<P>    &#39;&#39;On a busy day down here there&#39;s not even enough places for everybody to sit down.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Custody cases and others common to Juvenile Court tend to have high emotions, he said.
<P>    &#39;&#39;When you have juvenile fights, we have to separate them in the lobby pretty frequently.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We really are in serious need of some security.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT SIZE="+2">H</FONT>igh winds and heavy rains ripped across the state early Sunday morning, toppling the canvas tent over a hazardous waste storage area in Oak Ridge and sending a tree limb crashing into an East Knox County home.
<P>   The spring-like storm also spawned at least one possible tornado near Nashville. The twister touched down at a shopping mall and tore part of the roof off a crowded restaurant.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We have had an extremely busy night,&#39;&#39; Knoxville Police Department Sgt. Greg Hoskins said. &#39;&#39;There have been numerous calls of trees down, wires down and some isolated power outages.&#39;&#39;
<P>   National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Propst said a cold front swept through the area early Sunday morning, mixing with unseasonably warm air and producing the nasty weather. Some wind gusts topped 60 mph, and some areas reported hail nearly an inch in diameter.
<P>   Today&#39;s weather should return to normal, Propst said, with partly sunny skies and highs in the 40s.
<P>   Officials at the Department of Energy&#39;s Y-12 Plant in Oak Ridge say they believe a strong gust of wind hit the tent-like canvas cover over one of two hazardous waste storage areas on Chestnut Ridge. The incident poses no threat to public health, according to Y-12 Public Affairs Manager Patricia Greeson.
<P>    &#39;&#39;There is no threat to the environment or people,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;Because it is a storage facility, it is supposed to be kept in good order. Those storage facilities have undergone preventive maintenance as early as this summer. The wind must have been truly amazing.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Plant officials noticed around 2 a.m. that the tent-like canvas cover and the steel beams and tension wires supporting it had collapsed and fallen onto covered containers of hazardous waste, Greeson said.
<P>   By daybreak, Greeson said technicians and engineers had arrived to assess the damage, pump water out of the canvas, clean up debris and stabilize the containers of waste. Greeson said she is not sure how long the assessment and cleanup will take.
<P>   There are two storage facilities on Chestnut Ridge. Both hold a large number of drums filled with hazardous wastes, including some low-level radioactive materials, Greeson said. The actual containers of waste are still covered, but she said officials are taking every precaution. She said it&#39;s possible the drums of waste will be moved to another location.
<P>   Meanwhile, a couple was rudely awakened when a tree limb fell on their Rutledge Pike home. The Knoxville fire and police departments responded to the call, Hoskins said. No injuries were reported.
<P>   Propst said high winds also turned over a mobile home in Anderson County and blew the roof off a Harriman lumber company.
<P>   Residents of Middle Tennessee also suffered the sting of severe weather. In Nashville, patrons of the Olive Garden restaurant ate dinner under the stars when part of the roof went flying.
<P>   &#39;&#39;People started screaming,&#39;&#39; said waiter Jason Shinton, 23. &#39;&#39;We got under some tables, and people were screaming, &#39;Where do we go?&#39; &#39;&#39;
<P>    The incident was reported as a possible tornado, said Jean Ridley, a spokeswoman for the Metro Nashville Fire Department.
<P>    The storm also damaged three buildings near the restaurant, taking the facade off of another restaurant and damaging businesses in a nearby strip mall.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> pregnant prostitute who injected herself with crack cocaine Saturday night and then fought with another prostitute when she tried to help the bleeding woman may face charges for endangering her 7-month-old fetus, authorities said.
<P>   If charged, it would be one of the first times the seven-year-old endangerment statute is used against a mother for drug use.
<P>   Knoxville Police Department investigators said Sunday they will take the prostitute&#39;s case to the Knox County District Attorney General&#39;s office on Monday to see if charges can be filed against the 32-year-old woman.
<P>   Police initially believed the woman had flushed her fetus at a public restroom in a convenience store on Cherry Street, but a medical examination at the University of Tennessee Medical Center revealed the woman still was pregnant.
<P>   Investigators Edd Stair and Cindy Gass said the fetus was alive and did not show signs of any overt trauma.
<P>   But if the fetus survives and the woman gives birth, her baby likely will be addicted to crack cocaine, the investigators said.
<P>   Police discovered the pregnant prostitute Saturday night after responding to a call of a fight on Milligan Street. KPD Sgt. Gary Moyers said officers found the pregnant woman and another prostitute in some bushes. The two women were &#39;&#39;dusting themselves off&#39;&#39; and indicated there had been a fight, he said.
<P>   Moyers said the pregnant woman&#39;s jeans were soaked in blood, and officers found a second pair of blood-soaked jeans near the scene of the fight. When they questioned the prostitute, she told them she had aborted her fetus in the Cherry Street bathroom, Moyers said.
<P>   Police found blood smears in the bathroom and evidence the woman had wiped up her blood. Moyers said the prostitute believed she had flushed her nearly full-term fetus.
<P>   After leaving the bathroom, the woman walked to Milligan Street, where she began injecting herself with crack cocaine, according to police. The other prostitute saw the pregnant woman and tried to convince her to go get medical treatment. Moyers said the pregnant woman then began fighting with the other prostitute. The fight had just ended when police arrived, he said.
<P>   Police called for an ambulance, and the woman was taken to UT Medical Center. Once at the hospital, the pregnant woman told police conflicting stories and, at one point, insisted she had tossed her baby into a trash dumpster, officers said. Moyers and other officers began a hurried search but soon learned the drugged woman was still pregnant.
<P>   When the prostitute was told her fetus was alive, police said she grew upset and insisted she did not want the baby.
<P>   Authorities said Sunday UT doctors planned to keep the woman at the hospital for a few days but likely would release her as soon as her medical condition is considered stable. There are no plans to deliver the woman&#39;s baby before her release from the hospital, according to police.
<P>   The state Legislature in 1989 voted to include in the criminal statutes a viable fetus as a possible victim of assault or homicide. A person also can be charged with endangering a viable fetus under the reckless endangerment statute.

        Fake fat?</b></font><br>
<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Jane E. Brody New York Times News
        Service</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">S</font>hould American's just forget it
        and eat fat? </p>
        <p>Until quite recently that three-letter word had a
        decidedly positive connotation. A rich man was a fat cat.
        A fat check was much to be wished for, especially before
        the holidays. A fat baby was said to be beautiful and
        healthy-looking. </p>
        <p>My parents and grandmother spent my skin-and-bones
        childhood years trying to fatten me up, stuffing me with
        sticks of butter, bars of Velveeta cheese and cans of
        evaporated milk. (The effort failed, incidentally, until
        adolescent hormones took over.) </p>
        <p>In the last few years, however, the country has gone
        hog wild over low-fat, nonfat and fat-free foods.
        Supermarket shelves groan with cakes, cookies, chips,
        dips, cheese, sausage and that quintessential no-no, ice
        cream, minus most or all of the fat. </p>
        <p>People think that by avoiding fat they will
        automatically shed pounds. But many who once ate
        sparingly of such foods now indulge freely in their
        low-fat or nonfat versions, sometimes downing servings
        two or three times as large as those they would eat of
        the full-fat food. As a result, many Americans desperate
        to shrink their widening girth are getting fatter still
        on fat-free foods and little or no exercise. </p>
        <p>The recent introduction of snack foods prepared with
        an indigestible fat, Olestra, is likely to feed the
        desire to ''have one's cake and eat it too'' even further
        without doing a single thing to improve Americans'
        dietary habits. So far few Americans seem to have noticed
        that, except for avocados, fruits and vegetables are
        naturally low in fat or free of fat and offer the
        much-coveted bonus of helping to protect against heart
        disease and cancer. </p>
        <p>The fat-free frenzy has prompted one author to cry
        ''Enough!'' In his newly published, cheeky book ''Eat
        Fat'' (Pantheon, $24), Richard Klein, a somewhat
        corpulent Cornell University French professor, strives to
        reintroduce body fat as esthetically desirable to a
        society that now deplores every inch that can be pinched.
        Further, Klein is one of a small but growing number of
        antidieters who believe that indulgence may have
        paradoxical health benefits. Feel free to eat fat, he
        maintains, and you might even eat less. </p>
        <p>Humans, some researchers maintain, are hard-wired to
        desire calorically dense foods. And fat is the most
        caloric, providing 9 calories per gram as against 4
        calories per gram of sugar, starch and protein and 7
        calories per gram of alcohol. </p>
        <p>Dr. Adam Drewnowski, director of the human nutrition
        program at the University of Michigan, has concluded that
        people are born with a ''fat tooth'' that is even
        stronger than their sweet tooth, especially in adulthood.
        He said, ''Even children learn to prefer calorically
        dense foods; they are more efficient at satisfying
        hunger.'' </p>
        <p>He has shown that the consumption of sweet and
        high-fat foods can be decreased by pretreating people
        with an agent like naloxone that blocks the release of
        opiates in the brain. This observation may explain why
        people are driven to consume fats and sweets and why some
        people might even become ''addicted'' to them. </p>
        <p>Fats, and to a lesser extent sweets, ''may release
        neuropeptides in the brain that cause us to want and
        consume those foods that are rich in fats and sugars,''
        Drewnowski explained. Furthermore, he said, ''fats
        enhance the flavor, richness, aroma and mouthfeel of
        foods; fat-free foods don't carry flavors as well.'' </p>
        <p>The idea behind Olestra is to preserve the flavor and
        texture of fat on the tongue without having the consumer
        absorb the calories. The problem is that more than fat
        leaves the body with Olestra; fat-soluble vitamins do
        too, and the bowel can have trouble containing the fatty
        waste. </p>
        <p>Dr. Jules Hirsch, an obesity specialist at Rockefeller
        University in New York, said that from an evolutionary
        perspective it made sense for humans to crave fat because
        it was an efficient way to consume and store calories,
        providing needed energy to carry people through the lean
        times. Biochemically speaking, he said, ''it's cheaper to
        store calories from fat than to make fat out of
        carbohydrates.'' </p>
        <p>Furthermore, stored fat, being very inert chemically,
        does not disturb the body's balance of water and salts
        whereas carbohydrates take up lots of water. And unlike
        muscle, which is always working and burning energy, fat
        does not use up any calories while in storage. </p>
        <p>''But,'' Hirsch added, ''that doesn't mean it's such a
        good idea in our times of surfeit to consume and store
        lots of fat.'' With no famines between the feasts, our
        stores of body fat tend to remain permanent fixtures that
        can become a serious health burden, increasing the risk
        of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and some
        cancers, including breast cancer. </p>
        <p>There is growing evidence that many Americans are
        tired of trying to squelch their high-fat appetites and,
        by sheer force of will, staying away from steaks,
        cheeseburgers, french fries, chocolates and pie a la
        mode. </p>
        <p>Steakhouses have recently got a new lease on life, and
        McDonald's scratched the unpopular McLean burger and has
        bet its corporate dollar on the Arch Deluxe, a burger
        sporting 570 calories (610 with bacon) and 31 grams of
        fat. Add another 510 calories and 26 grams of fat from
        the super-size french fries and you have more than obeyed
        Richard Klein's dictum to ''Eat Fat.'' </p>

        size="2"><i>By Brian Courtney, News-Sentinel staff writer</i></font></p>
        <p><br>
        <font size="5">A</font>bout six years ago, Sharon Hazard
        of Wears Valley received a special wheelchair purchased
        by The Knoxville News-Sentinel's Mercy Fund. </p>
        <p>Later, in 1990, News-Sentinel readers came to her aid
        again, this time donating money for a down payment on a
        specially equipped van that permitted even greater
        mobility and enabled Hazard to drive herself to work. </p>
        <p>Today, still paralyzed from the waist down from a rare
        connective-tissue disorder, Hazard is grateful as she
        remembers the kindness extended to her and her family in
        their time of need. </p>
        <p>Hazard's children, Kassandra and Kristopher, 5 and 10,
        are grateful, too -- so thankful, in fact, that they
        voluntarily turned over the $200 they were paid in
        December for appearing in ''A Christmas Carol'' to The
        News-Sentinel to help those less fortunate at Christmas. </p>
        <p>Their money, along with contributions from hundreds of
        other donors, ensured that more than 3,500 families
        received food baskets and toys this Christmas through The
        News-Sentinel's Empty Stocking Fund. </p>
        <p>''One time, we weren't doing so well and people helped
        us, so I decided to help back,'' Kristopher said,
        explaining what motivated him to give. ''I thought maybe
        if little kids help, some older people would say, 'Hey,
        if these little kids are giving it, then why shouldn't
        I?' '' </p>
        <p>Kassandra said she would have bought a new dress and
        ''stuff'' with her half of the $200, had she spent the
        money on herself. But she thought helping others was more
        important. </p>
        <p>''I just wanted to give it away to somebody who didn't
        have anything,'' she said in a shy and smiling 5-year-old
        way. </p>
        <p>When asked by her mom to describe the difference her
        $100 would make, Kassandra rattled off a list that would
        have bankrupted Santa. </p>
        <p>''I thought people could get toys, money to build a
        house, things to decorate the house, food, clothes, a
        bike and . . .'' </p>
        <p>Hazard laughed as her daughter continued. ''I told her
        that her $100 probably wouldn't buy all that, but if she
        gave a $100 and a bunch of other people gave a $100,
        together, maybe it would be enough,'' Hazard said. </p>
        <p>Even in the face of adversity, Hazard said her family
        will always give back. </p>
        <p>''In giving you receive, and we've been blessed a
        thousand million times over,'' she said. </p>
        <p>Like their mother, Kristopher and Kassandra also
        suffer from the connective-tissue disorder known as
        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The disorder has contributed to
        several health problems that include hemorrhaging and
        bleeding at the joints. </p>

        than housing;</font><p><font size="5">N</font>ASHVILLE --
        A rise in state prison populations is fueling tension
        among inmates -- a condition that some prison watchdogs
        believe could lead to more escapes and riots. </p>
        <p>Spurred by get-tough crime initiatives, the state
        prison population has risen more than 40 percent between
        1992-95. </p>
        <p>But prison capacities haven't kept up with demand,
        increasing by only a third during that same time. </p>
        <p>With reports of inmate assaults jumping 82 percent
        during that same period, some are beginning to wonder if
        Tennessee prisons have reverted back to the troubled
        1980s of overcrowded prisons and increased inmate
        escapes. </p>
        <p>''It will show up in increased assaults and
        contraband,'' said Gordon Bonnyman, the former Legal Aid
        attorney who represented Tennessee inmates when the state
        prison system was declared unconstitutional in 1982. </p>
        <p>''Ultimately, it manifests itself in escapes and
        eventually riots. It's like predicting an earthquake: You
        know there's going to be a big one; you just don't know
        when.'' </p>
        <p>Tennessee prisons began to get crowded in the 1980s
        after former Gov. Lamar Alexander's Class X crime bill
        was passed by the Legislature. The bill lengthened some
        sentences and took away early release opportunities for
        others. </p>
        <p>A few years later, the prison system was taken over by
        federal courts after confinement in the state's prison
        was ruled an unconstitutionally ''cruel and unusual
        punishment.'' </p>
        <p>Prison riots followed in 1985, and inmate escapes
        climbed from 39 in 1978 to 140 in 1988. </p>
        <p>State Correction Commissioner Donal Campbell doesn't
        believe Tennessee's prisons are the same and the picture
        is not as bleak as other say. </p>
        <p>''The difference between then and now is we now have
        control,'' he said. </p>
        <p>Tennessee prisons are designed to house 16,668 inmates
        but are currently holding more than 18,000 prisoners. A
        new round of crime laws will again abolish parole for
        some offenders, ban furloughs and send criminals with
        ''two strikes'' or a violent offense and a previous
        conviction, to prison for life without parole. </p>
        <p>A new $50 million, 1,500-bed prison is slated to be
        built by 1998, but new inmate projections say the demand
        for prison space will fall short again in 1999. </p>
        <p>''We're certainly not back where we were, but we're
        headed in that direction,'' Bonnyman said. ''The snapshot
        of where we are now is not terrifying, but the direction
        we're heading is very frightening.'' </p>

        suspect jailed after hospital release</h3>
        <p>A 16-year-old murder suspect who was shot after he
        allegedly robbed a fellow gang member was released from a
        hospital Sunday and booked into the Knox County Jail. </p>
        <p>Melvin ''Little Melvin'' Davis was being held Sunday
        evening in the downtown jail in lieu of $70,000 bond on
        charges of aggravated robbery and aggravated assault.
        Davis had been hospitalized at Baptist Hospital of East
        Tennessee. </p>
        <p>Davis, also known as Melvin Tate, is a member of the
        East Side gang, whose members hail from East Knoxville,
        police have said. He is accused in the May 18 shooting
        death of Brittany Shenice Daniels, 5. </p>
        <p>Brittany was shot as she played on a sidewalk in
        Lonsdale Homes housing project when a group of East Side
        gang members drove up to the curb and opened fire,
        according to police. </p>
        <p>Davis turned shooting victim on Christmas Eve, one day
        after he allegedly robbed William ''Junebug'' Martin of
        $200 in the Walter P. Taylor Homes housing project,
        police said. Martin allegedly shot Davis but claimed
        Davis threatened him with a gun first. Police declined to
        charge Martin. </p>
        <p>Martin now is charged with attempted murder, however,
        after he allegedly shot another of Davis' friends,
        Jeremiah Davis, in a parking lot in the Austin Homes
        housing project Dec. 29. </p>
        <h3>Man driving stolen car faces cocaine charge </h3>
        <p>Police have arrested an East Knoxville man who
        allegedly has been dealing drugs out of a stolen car he
        insisted he bought from a 15-year-old boy, authorities
        said. </p>
        <p>Knoxville Police Department Patrol Officer Derek
        Weller charged Elmora Quince, 36, with possession of
        cocaine and marijuana for resale, driving on a revoked
        license and theft after an investigation at the Rama Inn,
        1500 Cherry St., where Quince had been staying. </p>
        <p>Weller said authorities believe Quince had been
        selling both powder and crack cocaine, as well as
        marijuana, from a stolen Toyota Camry. The Camry also
        bore a stolen license plate, Weller said. When Weller
        stopped Quince in the Camry outside the Rama Inn Saturday
        night, he said he discovered cocaine, marijuana and a
        large amount of cash. </p>
        <p>Quince told Weller he bought the stolen car from a
        15-year-old boy, but Quince insisted he did not know the
        boy or ask him for any documents to verify ownership of
        the car, Weller said. </p>

		<h3>St. Louis hires Avalanche assistant coach Quenneville</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>    The St. Louis Blues hired assistant coach <B>Joel Quenneville</B> of Stanley Cup champion Colorado as their new coach Sunday.
<P>    A source at the Kiel Center, where the Blues play, told The Associated Press a news conference has been scheduled for today. Quenneville confirmed the hiring to KSDK-TV in St. Louis.
<P>    Quenneville will be behind the bench as the successor to <B>Mike Keenan</B> on Tuesday night when the Blues are home against Edmonton.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s been tremendously exciting,&#39;&#39; Quenneville said. &#39;&#39;It certainly is a big challenge for me. I look forward to coming to St. Louis. It should be a lot of fun. I want to be a hard-working club.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Quenneville, 38, was the only candidate who has had two interviews and the only candidate who met with <B>Jerry Ritter,</B> the team chairman. The other contender was <B>Paul MacLean</B>. Former Blues and Montreal coach <B>Jacques Demers </B>dropped out of the running last week.
<P>    It has been 18 days since the Blues dismissed Keenan. The team is 2-3-3 under interim coach <B>Jimmy Roberts</B>.
<P>  <h3> In other hockey-related news:</h3>
<P>
<P><B></B>Colorado Avalanche captai<B></B>n<B> Joe Sakic</B> has a leg injury and is expected to be sidelined for four weeks. Sakic sustained a deep laceration on his left calf muscle during Saturday night&#39;s 4-4 tie against the Philadelphia Flyers. Avalanche trainer <B>Pat Karns </B>said doctors recommended Sakic be sidelined after he underwent surgery. The injury means Sakic will miss the NHL All-Star game at San Jose Jan. 18.
<P><B></B>Knoxville Cherokees captain <B>Wayne Anchikoski</B>, who has been on injured reserve (concussion) for more than two weeks, will be examined by doctors today and should be cleared to begin skating. The Cherokees, who have lost four consecutive games, play the Columbus Chill on Tuesday night at 7 at the Civic Coliseum.
<P>
<P><h3>Tennis</h3>
<P>
<P><B></B>Marianne Werdel-Witmeye<B>r</B> of the United States upset fourth-seeded <B>Barbara Schett</B> of Austria 6-1, 6-3 in the opening round of the Tasmanian International in Hobart, Australia. In other matches,<B> Sabine Hack</B> of Germany, the eighth seed, beat <B>Lindsay Lee</B> of the United States 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), and American <B>Anne Miller</B> defeated <B>Karin Kschwendt</B> of Austria 3-6, 7-5, 6-0.
<P><B></B>At Doha, Qatar,<B> Jim Courier</B> won his 20th career title and deprived<B> Tim Henman</B> of gaining his first ATP trophy, beating the Brit 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-2 in the final of the Qatar Open. Courier earned the $84,000 top prize. Courier said that his experience was an important factor in his victory. &#39;&#39;The first two sets were very close, but in the third I got going early and I played solidly,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;I&#39;m happy with that.&#39;&#39;
<P><B></B><B>Todd Woodbridge,</B> the fourth seed, defeated fellow Australian <B>Scott Draper</B> 6-2, 6-1 in the final of the $328,000 Australian Hardcourt tournament in Adelaide. Aussie<B> Pat Rafter</B> and <B>Bryan Shelton</B> of the United States beat Woodbridge and <B>Mark Woodforde</B> of Australia 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 for the doubles crown.

<P><h3>Running</h3>
<P>
<P><B></B>At Lake Buena Vista, Fla., Irish masters competitor <B>Dick Hooper</B> won the Walt Disney World Marathon by more than a minute. Hooper, 40, of Raheny, Ireland, passed Delray Beach&#39;s <B>Paul Marmaro</B> at 251/2 miles and cruised to the overall victory in 2 hours, 31 minutes, 19 seconds. <B>Larisa Zyuzko</B> of Russia, the fifth-place finisher in last year&#39;s Boston Marathon, won the women&#39;s race in 2:41:13. She was followed by <B>Alla Doudaeva</B> (2:43:14) of Moscow.
<P>
<P><h3>Auto racing</h3>
<P>
<P><B></B><B>Frank Williams</B> said he will appear in Imola before Italian judges next month to face a manslaughter charge arising out of the death of Formula One world champion<B> Ayrton Senna</B> at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. Although the hearing could be heard in his absence, the wheelchair-bound head of the Williams team said he would be present. &#39;&#39;I will be there and I will be defending my company and myself,&#39;&#39; Williams said. Williams and five other members of the team, including design director<B> Adrian Newey</B> and technical manager <B>Patrick Head</B>, have been charged with manslaughter in Senna&#39;s death which occurred at Imola when his Renault-Williams car hit a wall after failing to take a bend.

<P>
<P><B></B><B></B><B>Greg Norman,</B> whose putter deserted him most of the day, found it again on the 36th hole of the world finals at the Andersen Consulting World Championship of Golf at Scottsdale, Ariz. Norman&#39;s 15-foot birdie putt on his second visit to No. 18 Sunday at the Grayhawk Golf Club&#39;s Talon course earned him $1 million in golf&#39;s richest tournament. He shot 3-under-par 69 in the first 18 holes and 1-over 73 in the second. <B>Scott Hoch,</B> who never led, made up four strokes from the 15th through the 21st holes, but wasn&#39;t able to take advantage of opportunities created by Norman&#39;s erratic short game. Hoch won $500,000, including $175,000 in the finals. <B>Hisayuki Sasaki</B> of Japan won $350,000 for third place and <B>Sam Torrance </B>$300,00 for fourth.

		<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> full-power, over-the-air television station owned locally will begin broadcasting in the Knoxville market by the second quarter of this year, according to a local television executive.
<P>   The station, WINT-TV, Channel 20, was originally licensed in Crossville but is part of the Knoxville market, said Lewis Cosby, who was general manager for WKXT-TV, Channel 8, for eight years. 
<P>   The station is negotiating to affiliate with either Warner Bros.&#39;s WB Network or United Paramount Network (UPN), run by Paramount Pictures, Cosby said. A decision is expected next week.
<P>   The WB Network and UPN have both emerged in the past two years and enjoyed early successes in large urban markets. Much of the WB Network&#39;s programming is family-oriented and includes cartoons. UPN&#39;s most popular program is &#39;&#39;Voyager,&#39;&#39; a &#39;&#39;Star Trek&#39;&#39; spin-off.
<P>   Programming will be 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and the station might start a 10 p.m. local newscast as well as buy other syndicated programming. It will reach 1,276,000 people from Cleveland to Somerset, Ky., and from Newport halfway to Cookeville. About 40 percent of those viewers do not have cable, said Cosby.
<P>   The Crossville TV Limited Partnership, consisting of the family trusts of Cosby and Earl Taylor, formerly general sales manager for WKXT, and the Phipps family of Tallahassee, Fla., will own the station.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s a great opportunity because of the programming that&#39;s available,&#39;&#39; said Cosby.
<P>   The partnership is constructing a broadcast tower atop Buffalo Mountain, just above Oliver Springs. At a height of 2,200 feet above average terrain, it will be the highest broadcast tower in the area and may be the tallest in Tennessee, said Cosby.
<P>   The tower and transmitter will cost about $3.5 million.
<P>   Cosby said an office building housing the station&#39;s 30 to 40 employees will be constructed, probably in West Knoxville. No site has been selected.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Knoxville is the 60th (largest) television market in the U.S.,&#39;&#39; said Cosby. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s very unusual to have only four TV stations operating.&#39;&#39;
<P>   WTNZ-TV, Channel 43, is airing UPN programming from 10 to 11 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, according to the Fox channel&#39;s general manager, Michael Brunette. The station will be dropping it at the end of the year when its contract with UPN expires.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Our interest in him (Cosby) having it would allow us to have a 10 o&#39;clock newscast,&#39;&#39; said Brunette. &#39;&#39;The other benefit of him having UPN . . . the night they broadcast he can air it live, where we have to tape-delay it. He could air it like the network wants him to.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Cosby anticipates negotiations with individual cable operators before the network will be broadcast on local cable systems.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We would look at them like any new potential programming,&#39;&#39; said Barbara Lewis, general manager of Scripps Howard Cable TV Co., which recently completed a merger with Comcast Corp. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;It all depends on what the programming is, and is it a good value?&#39;&#39;
<P>   In July 1995, the partnership purchased WINT for about $800,000 from John and Helen Cunningham of Crossville.
<P>   The station first signed on in the 1970s but since has been on and off the air for years. It signed back on in October 1996 and has been airing a video catalog channel out of Powell.
<P>   Two years ago, the Federal Communications Commission approved a petition to upgrade the station.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Morgan Simmons, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">U</FONT>nder Tennessee&#39;s water quality laws, a stream that&#39;s suitable for recreation must have &#39;&#39;no objectionable color.&#39;&#39;
<P>   And while the color standard is expressed as a narrative -- not numerically, as the Environmental Protection Agency suggests it should be -- state officials say it nevertheless establishes a benchmark the Pigeon River fails to meet.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We think our standard is objective even if it&#39;s not numerical,&#39;&#39; said Paul Davis, director of the Tennessee Division of Water Pollution Control. &#39;&#39;Our position is that even during normal flows, the water color is clearly objectionable.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Champion International&#39;s new discharge permit calls for 50 color units at the state line -- the same standard EPA set eight years ago when it took authority of Champion&#39;s permit from North Carolina.
<P>   Davis said Tennessee&#39;s main priority is that EPA impose stricter limits on color, adding that the state would be satisfied with improvements at the state line, not at the paper mill&#39;s discharge pipe, in Canton, N.C.
<P>   &#39;&#39;At this point our agency is concerning itself with the appearance of Tennessee waters,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;If Tennessee waters looked clean, we would leave conditions in North Carolina to them.&#39;&#39;
<P>   In a recent letter to Tennessee Attorney General Charles Burson, John H. Hankinson Jr., EPA Region IV administrator, wrote: &#39;&#39;When Tennessee promulgates objective water quality standards, EPA will be in the best position to assure full consideration of Tennessee&#39;s concerns.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Davis said that like other states, Tennessee sets both numerical (objective) and narrative water-quality standards, depending on the pollutant.
<P>   &#39;&#39;When we regulate compounds that might have a toxic effect on fish, we tend to use numerical standards,&#39;&#39; said Davis. &#39;&#39;In other areas, our standards are expressed in the narrative form, such as no objectionable color or odor.&#39;&#39;
<P>      Davis said that at this point, the state has not reached a decision on when it will formulate a numerical limit for color on the Pigeon River.
<P>   On the Tennessee side, the Pigeon River varies in color from a green to brown, depending on the rain. Davis said that while upgrades to Champion&#39;s paper mill have produced a 70 percent improvement in color, the river is still too dark.
<P>   &#39;&#39;A mountain river like the Pigeon should look something like the Little River below Townsend,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;At this point our position is that our standard is being violated. You don&#39;t have to have a number to tell that.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Fishery biologists say that while color improvements have resulted in increased smallmouth bass reproduction on the Pigeon&#39;s lower end, the overall number of fish species is about half what the river would support if unpolluted.
<P>   In terms of recreation, pollution on the Pigeon River means wasted whitewater potential. According to an economic study released by Walters State Community College, a thriving rafting industry on the Pigeon would generate $7.3 million a year.
<P>   Twelve companies currently run raft trips down the Pigeon&#39;s gorge section, where the size and quality of the rapids are comparable to the Ocoee River.
<P>   Robert Platte, operations manager for Wildwater Ltd. and president of the Pigeon River Permittees Association, said improved color in the Pigeon River could boost the whitewater industry by 30 or 40 percent.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Fifty percent of our guests comment on the water quality,&#39;&#39; said Platte. &#39;&#39;The river itself is exciting, but because of the color, some of our customers have reservations about coming back.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT SIZE="6"><B>Sundquist, union head differ on layoff figures</B></font><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By Rebecca Ferrar and Tom HumphreyNews-Sentinel Nashville bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- Gov. Don Sundquist lashed out at the state employees&#39; union chief Friday over layoffs that may result from the budget crunch.
<P>    Linda McCarty, Tennessee State Employees Association president, says she believes next year&#39;s $300 million estimated shortfall will result in &#39;&#39;thousands&#39;&#39; of layoffs.
<P>    But Sundquist says those numbers are way off base.
<P>    &#39;&#39;All I would ask is that TSEA be patient,&#39;&#39; the governor said. &#39;&#39;My experience with TSEA is that they tend to take a view that is not realistic and embellish it somewhat.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Of the $14 billion budget, there&#39;s only $1 billion available from which the administration says it will cut. Areas the governor plans to keep intact include education, transportation, TennCare and prison security.
<P>    Sundquist has said there likely will be more layoffs. So far, about 100 people have lost jobs because of this year&#39;s budget shortfall.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It literally could be thousands of people,&#39;&#39; McCarty said. Both she and personnel officials estimate an average state employee&#39;s salary costs the state about $26,000, including benefits.
<P>    Sundquist has asked all departments to cut their budgets before any layoffs are announced to balance the 1997-98 budget. But he said he cannot yet say what savings would result from layoffs.
<P>    McCarty, in a separate interview, criticized the $120,000 being paid each to Nancy Menke and Fredia Wadley in the newly reorganized Department of Public Health.
<P>    &#39;&#39;No wonder they can&#39;t say it&#39;s saving any money,&#39;&#39; McCarty said. &#39;&#39;This administration has stated time and again that it is looking at state government from a business perspective. Generally, when a business reorganizes, they can point to the nickels and dimes that will be saved. . . . That hasn&#39;t happened here.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The Legislature must sign off on abolishment of the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation as part of Sundquist&#39;s reorganization. McCarty said TSEA must decide whether to oppose the move during the upcoming legislative session.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   State Environment and Conservation Commissioner Justin Wilson left office on his birthday Saturday, giving his successor the oath of office as a final act.
<P>    The new commissioner, Milton Hamilton, said he planned to present Wilson with a birthday gift after the ceremony -- a T-shirt bearing the words &#39;&#39;Happy Birthday to the Wonderful One.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Not long ago, Wilson got a set of cap pistols from his staff at the department. That was based upon Wilson&#39;s pledge to go after Champion International Paper Co. with &#39;&#39;blazing guns,&#39;&#39; said department spokeswoman Melissa Miller.
<P>    There was no word on whether the effectiveness of the cap pistols was proportional to the effectiveness of his dealing with Champion on Pigeon River pollution.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>    Hamilton, by the way, will be doing a lot better financially as commissioner than as a legislator -- both now and in the future.
<P>    His state salary goes up from $16,500 as a state senator to $81,267 as commissioner of Environment and Conservation.
<P>    Further, as a state legislator, he would be entitled now to an annual pension of $26,880 -- though legislators elected after 1976 cannot make more in pension than they do in pay.
<P>    (Hamilton was elected before the cap was adopted.)
<P>    According to officials at the State Retirement Office contacted by The Commercial Appeal of Memphis, Hamilton would boost his annual pension to $49,068 if he stays in his new post for five years -- possible if Sundquist wins re-election in 1998 and keeps Hamilton on the job.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>aturday was a special day for Adam Shapira of Oak Ridge.
<P>   Instead of watching, reading about or joining Internet discussions about &#39;&#39;Star Trek&#39;&#39; and the three other television series spawned by it, he had the opportunity to share his keen interest and knowledge with other enthusiasts firsthand.
<P>   Shapira was one of several hundred people who paid anywhere from $16-$20 to attend a Star Trek celebration at the Knoxville Convention and Exhibition Center. 
<P>   &#39;&#39;I&#39;m a big Star Trek fan,&#39;&#39; Shapira said, proudly wearing a Star Trek uniform top he purchased several months ago at a local costume shop. &#39;&#39;The main reason I came here is to be with other people who are into Star Trek like I am.&#39;&#39;
<P>   While he&#39;s glad the convention came to town, Shapira said he&#39;s a little baffled about why he didn&#39;t hear about it sooner. Apparently, all the Star Trek mailing lists Shapira subscribes to on the Internet made no mention of a Knoxville convention.
<P>   &#39;&#39;My mom showed me about this convention in the paper last night. Otherwise, I would have missed it,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>    Joe Kindle, owner of Trek Productions, which stages Star Trek conventions nationwide, said his company hosts about 30 conventions every year. The average attendance is between 700-1,000, according to Kindle. But if &#39;&#39;things really go well,&#39;&#39; the conventions can attract between 2,000-3,000 people, he said.
<P>    What goes on at a convention?
<P>    Fans meet and snap photos with Star Trek celebrities such as Marina Sartis. Sartis is better known to fans as Counselor Deanna Troi on &#39;&#39;Star Trek: The Next Generation.&#39;&#39; They also buy and collect Star Trek goods that include T-shirts, uniforms, coffee mugs, pins, videos, clocks, books and action figures. 
<P>   Aaron Shumate trekked all the way from Massachusetts to attend Knoxville&#39;s Star Trek convention.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Thirteen hours just for this,&#39;&#39; Shumate said as he surveyed the array of vendors selling Star Trek memorabilia and the line of people waiting to get an autographed picture from Chase Masterson. Masterson portrays &#39;&#39;Leeta the Dabo Girl&#39;&#39; on &#39;&#39;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Shumate, who has been to four other conventions in the last two years, said TNG, trekkie speak for &#39;&#39;Star Trek: The Next Generation,&#39;&#39; is his favorite.
<P>   However, Shumate said he religiously tapes &#39;&#39;Star Trek: Voyager&#39;&#39; and enjoys watching &#39;&#39;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Star Trek conventions give Alex and Teresa Bradley of Knoxville a chance to show off their uniforms from &#39;&#39;Star Trek: The Next Generation.&#39;&#39;
<P>   &#39;&#39;We don&#39;t get that many opportunities to wear these uniforms,&#39;&#39; Alex Bradley said with a laugh.
<P>   &#39;&#39;But they&#39;re usually a hit,&#39;&#39; Teresa Bradley added.
<P>   She said they wore them to dinner while attending a Star Trek convention in Huntsville, Ala., and the restaurant&#39;s manager jokingly said told them the establishment served Romulan ale.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Randy Kenner, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>ix years after dedicating its new sanctuary, Wallace Memorial Baptist Church and a now-defunct steel fabricator are battling in court over the construction in a case that&#39;s been dragging on since 1993.
<P>   Now in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the case originated in Knox County Chancery Court when Associated Services/68 Steel Inc. filed a lawsuit accusing the church, one of its members and a Nashville construction firm of causing it to go out of business.
<P>   The company, which was located in Knoxville, signed on to do the steel fabrication and erection work on the project in late 1989.
<P>   It contends that it was misled on the project, forced to overcome shoddy construction plans and an inadequate budget before finally being used as the scapegoat when things went wrong and the construction fell behind schedule.
<P>   The company claims it was eventually forced off the job and ultimately collapsed because of the costs it accumulated during the project.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Upon information and belief, it became the intent of the defendants to force 68 Steel to leave the project, so that any cost overruns, or difficulties with the project could then be blamed totally on 68 Steel,&#39;&#39; the action in bankruptcy court states. &#39;&#39;Expecting 68 Steel to be put out of business by their actions, the defendants believed this would prevent the revelation of the real reasons for the project&#39;s problems.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Wallace Memorial and the other defendants, however, contended in the chancery court case that 68 Steel&#39;s problems were the result of its ineptitude, and the church suffered cost overruns.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The shop drawings prepared by 68 Steel were defective and were not submitted in a timely manner,&#39;&#39; states the answer of Wallace Memorial and its trustees in 1994.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Furthermore, the steel fabricated by 68 Steel and furnished to the project had numerous defects and was not delivered in a timely manner.
<P>   &#39;&#39;These failures of 68 Steel constitute negligence and a breach of the fabrication contract and caused substantial damage to the church,&#39;&#39; the answer by Wallace Memorial&#39;s attorney, Reggie Keaton, states.
<P>   The church also contends that it didn&#39;t force 68 Steel -- owned by Richard J. Hunt, Scot T. Chrisman and G. Burgan and Marifrances Chrisman -- off the project.
<P>   &#39;&#39;68 Steel ultimately abandoned the project,&#39;&#39; it states.
<P>    Named as defendants along with Wallace Memorial are its trustees; Knoxville businessman Tom Jensen, a member of the church&#39;s expansion committee; the Nashville-based Equitable Church Builders Inc.; and Jimmy Earl Kelley, who worked as a construction superintendent.
<P>   The case was a day away from going to trial in Chancery Court on Nov. 27, 1995, when 68 Steel withdrew its lawsuit. It filed for Chapter 11, or reorganization, bankruptcy protection the following day, admittedly to escape a trial on the church&#39;s counter-claim for damages.
<P>   The bankruptcy case was later converted to a Chapter 7, or liquidation, bankruptcy by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Richard Stair, who appointed Maurice Guinn to serve as its trustee.
<P>   The current action, which seeks $1.5 million in damages, was filed by Guinn to recover money that would be distributed to 68 Steel&#39;s creditors -- if the company won.
<P>   Wallace Memorial has a claim of more than $450,000 against 68 Steel firm&#39;s estate, according to documents filed in the case.
<P>   The dispute arises out of the project in which 68 Steel, established in 1989, successfully bid on the fabrication work. It did the erection work, also.
<P>   Problems quickly arose, according to the adversary case, because the plans and specifications were &#39;&#39;so inaccurate and impossible to interpret that they prevented 68 Steel&#39;s timely and effective preparation of structural steel shop drawings.&#39;&#39; The company also contends the building was laid out incorrectly. 
<P>   Kelley and Jensen were informed of the problems but ignored them, according to 68 Steel&#39;s action, opting instead to blame the problems on the steel company and demand revisions. It states that Kelley and Jensen refused to pay for the extra work.
<P>   Wallace Memorial and the various other defendants have filed motions to dismiss the case and have not filed answers to it yet.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>ne hundred thousand dollars in six hours -- that&#39;s how much money Knoxville College hopes to raise during this year&#39;s local broadcast of The College Fund/United Negro College Fund annual telethon known as the Lou Rawls Parade of Stars.
<P>   The telethon, now in its 17th year, will air at 7 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 11 on WBIR-TV, Channel 10. It will be hosted by WBIR news anchors Cassandra McGhee and David Nelson.
<P>   Proceeds from the telethon benefit the 40 private, historically black colleges and universities supported by The College Fund/UNCF. Knoxville College is one of them.
<P>   Dr. J. Harvey Gillespie, vice president for institutional advancement at Knoxville College, said he and local telethon co-chairs Dr. Dhyana Ziegler, broadcasting professor at the University of Tennessee, and Bill Willis, retired general manager of TVA, are optimistic that they will meet and possibly surpass the $100,000 goal.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We are optimistic in the fact that the Knoxville community has rallied around KC in the past and supported our various fund-raising endeavors,&#39;&#39; Gillespie said. &#39;&#39;We wouldn&#39;t expect anything less from this community because of the spirit of philanthropy that exists here.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Last year&#39;s Knoxville telethon campaign raised $86,000 -- $1,000 more than the goal.
<P>   KC will benefit two-fold from the telethon, according to Gillespie. The college will keep 75 percent of the funds that are raised locally. The other 25 percent is added to the national College Fund/UNCF fund-raising pool, where it is divided among the 40 schools.
<P>   For the 1995-96 academic year, KC received a total of $1.3 million from The College Fund/UNCF, Gillespie said. Of that amount, about $45,000 provided support for more than 20 students who are enrolled with College Fund/UNCF scholarships. The remaining money was earmarked for operational costs, building improvements and faculty development, he said.
<P>   This year, Gillespie said he expects Knoxville College to receive even more money, since the amount each school receives is related to how much money they contribute to the fund.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Raising $100,000 for UNCF seems small when you consider how much we receive in return,&#39;&#39; he said.

<P>
<P>   Police on Saturday charged a man with attacking a South Knoxville couple after they awoke to find the alleged burglar inside their home, authorities said.
<P>   Knoxville Police Department Investigator Larry Vineyard charged Michael S. Gattis, who gave a South Knoxville address, with especially aggravated robbery in connection with the New Year&#39;s Day incident.
<P>   Vineyard said he questioned Gattis Saturday after determining Gattis, who has a &#39;&#39;lengthy history&#39;&#39; of theft-related charges, was a suspect. Gattis allegedly confessed to the Jan. 1 incident &#39;&#39;after a long interview&#39;&#39; with Vineyard, the investigator said.
<P>   Gattis is accused of breaking into the Stratford Road home of Cliff D. Bridges, 69, who was awakened New Year&#39;s Day by his wife&#39;s screams. Police said the wife woke up first and saw a man in the bedroom. When Bridges tried to come to his wife&#39;s aid, the burglar attacked Bridges and his wife, police said. Bridges was bitten on the stomach and his wife was hit in the face.
<P>   Vineyard said he has a second suspect in the case who may be charged later.
<P>

<P><h3>Bybee driver dies as truck hits parked rig </h3>
<P>
<P>   NEWPORT -- A Cocke County man was killed Saturday when his pickup truck struck another truck, troopers said.
<P>   The victim was identified as James C. Stone, 50, of Bybee.
<P>   Troopers said Stone was driving on Industrial Road when his truck struck a tractor-trailer parked on the side of Industrial Road.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Public can review plans for highway changes </h3>
<P>
<P>    An open house to allow the public to review and comment on preliminary design plans for the intersection of Interstate 640 and Broadway  will be held Tuesday, Jan. 7.
<P>   The time is 5 to 7 p.m. The state Department of Transportation will conduct the open house at Whittle Springs Middle School, 2700 Whiteoak Lane. The design calls for reconfiguring the ramps and improving connections to Old Broadway.
<P> 
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Knoxville police arrest six in drug operations </h3>
<P>
<P>   A 16-year-old boy was among the six people arrested Friday night in an undercover operation that targeted street dealers in and around the city&#39;s housing projects, authorities said.
<P>   The teenager allegedly sold crack cocaine to a Knoxville Police Department patrol officer who was posing undercover, Sgt. Greg Hoskins said. The boy was one of six alleged street dealers arrested in the operation, labeled a &#39;&#39;buy-bust,&#39;&#39; and charged with sell and delivery of cocaine. In a buy-bust operation, an undercover officer buys illegal drugs from the dealer, who then is arrested for making the sale.
<P>      The operation was conducted by officers with KPD&#39;s Repeat Offenders Program unit and the patrol division, Hoskins said.
<P>   
<P>
<P><h3>Morgan County prison escapee caught Saturday </h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>     WARTBURG -- Florida authorities captured a Tennessee inmate Saturday who had escaped from the Morgan County Regional Correctional Center in September.
<P>   Christopher A. Wells, 28, of Knoxville was taken into custody early Saturday morning after Florida police spotted him driving a stolen vehicle with North Carolina license plates.
<P>   Wells walked away from his work site at the Morgan County Recycling Center on September 9, 1996. Authorities said Wells stole a car that had a shotgun inside.
<P>   Currently jailed in Florida, Wells will be returned to Tennessee. He could face up to five more years in prison for his escape. Wells was serving a 12-year sentence for burglary and grand larceny at the time of his escape.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Anne Wallace Allen, Associated Press writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>EST DUMMERSTON, Vt. -- The Maple Valley ski area in West Dummerston has all the ingredients it needs for the coming season: trimmed trails, working chairlifts, an inventory of rental skis and a spruced-up base lodge.
<P>   &#39;&#39;All you need to do is press a button and it could go,&#39;&#39; said Terry Tyler, who founded the modest ski resort 35 years ago.
<P>   But no one is pressing the button this year. Like dozens of other small ski areas, Maple Valley will stay closed this winter, at least for now. It will be the first season in 30 that the ski area hasn&#39;t opened.
<P>   Like many other small ski areas, Maple Valley is the victim of a changing economic climate. A few decades ago, Vermont had about 80 ski areas, said Bill Scheer, a spokesman for the Vermont Ski Areas Association. This season, only 18 will open, according to the White Book of U.S. Ski Areas, an industry guide.
<P>   Nationwide, ski areas are going out of business or consolidating all over the United States. Their numbers have shrunk from about 745 in the mid-1970s to about 520 now, said Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas Association in Lakewood, Colo.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s almost like regional malls, if you will,&#39;&#39; Berry said. &#39;&#39;The mom-and-pop stores are gone, and regional malls have replaced them.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Industry analysts say the small ski areas are dying out largely because they can&#39;t afford the snowmaking, high-speed chairlifts and other amenities most skiers want.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s economies of scale more than anything,&#39;&#39; said Alphonse Gilbert, a professor of ski area management at the University of Vermont&#39;s School of Natural Resources. The big areas, Gilbert said, also offer better rental equipment, accommodations and instruction.
<P>   &#39;&#39;These big areas get a name that helps attract people, also,&#39;&#39; Gilbert added. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s part of skiing: where you ski. All of those things play a role.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Skiers these days expect more than they did 20 years ago.
<P>   &#39;&#39;When people go skiing today, they don&#39;t expect to hit a rock, and they&#39;re surprised when they do,&#39;&#39; Berry said.
<P>   With 50 acres of trails, a vertical drop of 1,000 feet and just two double chairlifts and a T-bar, Maple Valley 
<P>
<P>can&#39;t compete head-to-head with close neighbors like Mount Snow-Haystack, Stratton and Bromley.
<P>   Mount Snow, the largest of those three, has 760 skiable acres and 24 alternatives for getting up the mountain, including two high-speed quads. Up north, Stowe, Smugglers&#39; Notch, Jay Peak and Sugarbush all have a vertical drop of more than 2,000 feet.
<P>   But small areas that dominate a niche do prevail.
<P>   One is the friendly, family-run Cochran Ski Area in Richmond, with three rope tows and 850 feet of drop.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They make a real effort to introduce skiing to young people; a lot of families feel comfortable taking their children there for lessons,&#39;&#39; Gilbert said of Cochran. &#39;&#39;The other areas that don&#39;t have that kind of niche are going to find it very difficult to compete with the bigger, full-facility areas.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Another is Mad River Glen, which is evolving into a cooperative owned by skiers.
<P>   Mad River&#39;s management sells the resort on its natural snow, and the resort doesn&#39;t allow snowboards.
<P>   Tyler, 64, a former professional ski-jumper who worked for decades as a contractor building chairlifts all over New England, said he believed Maple Valley, which is beset by financial and legal problems, could survive with different management.
<P>   Recent managers, Tyler said, overextended the area&#39;s finances by putting in night skiing and trying to run it seven days a week.
<P>    He said he would have kept its hours to a minimum to limit payroll costs, focusing on weekends and holidays and times when school children would use it.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I feel if I was running it today, I could make a go of it,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   The decline of the smaller areas doesn&#39;t necessarily help the ones that remain. In fact, the larger ski areas draw their customers from a population that learned to ski and snowboard at smaller, inexpensive areas near home.
<P>   &#39;&#39;As they go out of business, it becomes a more complex task to become a skier and a snowboarder,&#39;&#39; Berry said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The industry is very concerned with it.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The large ski area that can provide a busy visitor with a smooth, all-inclusive ski vacation will continue to attract people who have plenty of money but very little time. And small areas will continue to be a casualty of an overall free-time shortage that often drives modern life, Berry said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;People&#39;s time is very valuable, and they want an absolute guaranteed investment return for their time,&#39;&#39; Berry said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;re nostalgic about their passing and we&#39;re saddened by their passing, but to some extent it&#39;s a sign of the times.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT SIZE="6"><B>Wine drinking at an ebb</B></font><basefont size=6><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Consumption off across Europe</FONT></basefont></FONT><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By Brian Murphy, Associated Press writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">R</FONT>OME -- From the ancient birthplace of the god of wine comes sobering news: Bottles of vino -- from rich Chianti to bubbly spumante -- are increasingly staying corked.
<P>    Wine consumption in Italy has dropped steadily during the past generation and, according to recent figures, the estrangement from the grape shows no signs of reversing.
<P>    There&#39;s vexation in the vineyards; concern in the cellars.
<P>    &#39;&#39;If it keeps up like this, we will be looking at a real crisis,&#39;&#39; said Paolo Bartezaghi, spokesman for the Italian Wine Union. &#39;&#39;I hate to use the word crisis, but that&#39;s what we&#39;re heading toward.&#39;&#39;
<P>    A study published in November by the Milan-based industry group reported a drop in average per capita wine consumption from 54 liters -- about 14 gallons -- a year in 1991 to a little under 47 liters in 1993.
<P>    &#39;&#39;And we know it&#39;s gone down a few more liters since then,&#39;&#39; said Bartezaghi.
<P>    Theories for the decline reveal as much about Italians&#39; lifestyle changes as their drinking habits.
<P>    The afternoon meal is still long, but often less spirited. &#39;&#39;People, especially in the big cities, are being forced to really work after lunch -- not just disappear,&#39;&#39; said Alessandra Ghelardoni, a director at the Nielson research group&#39;s Milan office, which tracks wine drinking trends in Italy.
<P>    And there is an expanding health consciousness.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Wine?&#39;&#39; said Anna Pizzi, who was heading into a Rome gym. &#39;&#39;Once in a while. You know, it&#39;s really not good for your figure.&#39;&#39;
<P>    But other Italians -- especially younger ones -- have gravitated to diet-busting fast food and the relatively small, but growing, array of ethnic restaurants and pubs. Sales of beer and liquor, such as Scotch and cream whiskey, have never been higher, the state statistics agency Istat reported.
<P>    &#39;&#39;In some people&#39;s eyes, having wine is a sign of Italy&#39;s impoverished past,&#39;&#39; said Ghelardoni. &#39;&#39;They want to drink something they see as more up to date with the &#39;new&#39; Italy.&#39;&#39;
<P>    &#39;&#39;Beer is definitely chic,&#39;&#39; declared Claudio Lancia as he and his date tipped back a pint at one of Irish-style pubs in Rome bankrolled by Guinness and other brewers.
<P>    It&#39;s a similar story in other Mediterranean countries where wine once ruled uncontested.
<P>    Greek wine consumption has fluctuated since 1961, but generally has been on the decline, to less than 9 gallons a person each year.
<P>    Meanwhile, the amount of beer drunk in Greece has shot up more than eightfold to nearly 11 gallons a year.
<P>    In Spain, per capita consumption of wine has dropped nearly half from 15.6 gallons in the 1980s.
<P>    But wine producers continue to thrive through expanding exports.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The U.S. market is in constant growth,&#39;&#39; said Giuseppe Liberatore, director of a consortium of Chianti producers.
<P>    Table wine sales in the United States reached a record 387 million gallons in 1995 and were up 7 percent for the first six months of 1996, according to the San Francisco-based Wine Institute.
<P>    About the only good news at home for Italian wine producers is that consumers are becoming more discriminating. Surveys show that sales of top-quality wines -- with their correspondingly higher prices -- are holding steady.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s true that Italians are spending less, but they are spending better,&#39;&#39; said Federico Castellucci, a spokesman for the Federvini trade group.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Pam Park, News-Sentinel business writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Knoxville News-Sentinel is closing KnoxLink, its computer bulletin board service, and becoming an Internet access provider in partnership with InfiNet, a national Internet company that works with newspapers.
<P>   Jack Lail, manager of online publishing for The News-Sentinel, said KnoxLink will close Jan. 31. Internet access through Knoxnews.com is available now by calling 1-800-391-7497.
<P>   Partnering with InfiNet will allow The News-Sentinel to focus on its strengths while offering customers the benefits of greater resources and technical experience available through a national Internet service provider, Lail said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;re a newspaper. We&#39;re content people and running a bulletin board service is very customer service oriented,&#39;&#39; Lail said. &#39;&#39;This allows us to do content and still offer people a way to get to the Internet. We hope to compete very aggressively with the other people around town who are doing Internet service.&#39;&#39;
<P>   KnoxLink was launched on Labor Day 1995. It had as many as 3,000 user accounts and handled more than 287,000 calls and 3.8 million messages, but in analyzing user preferences, Lail discovered people wanted Internet access rather than a &#39;&#39;sort of local AOL (America Online) service.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The Knoxnews.com service will offer unlimited surfing for $19.95 and a basic surfer plan that costs $9.95 per month for 10 hours. Each additional hour costs $2. A 24-hour help line is available, and subscribers get a registered copy of the Netscape Navigator Internet browser software. The company is offering one month of free access for people who would like to try it out, Lail said.
<P>   The News-Sentinel online publishing staff will devote itself to the company&#39;s three Web sites -- Knoxnews.com, GoVols.com and GoSmokies.com, Lail said.  It will continue to offer custom Web-site development and related services.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We think it lets us concentrate on what we do best,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   The News-Sentinel is the second newspaper in the Scripps Howard chain to partner with InfiNet. The Naples (Fla.) Daily News was first, Lail said. More are expected to follow.
<P>   InfiNet has relationships with more than 130 newspapers, 65 of which are affiliates. It is the only Internet company that devotes itself to developing publishing tools and revenue streams for newspapers, said Peter Ill, vice president of affiliate services.
<P>   InfiNet was founded by a group of U.S. Navy retirees as Wybern Technologies, a local Internet service provider in Norfolk, Va. Landmark Communications Inc., a private media company based in Norfolk, bought 80 percent of Wybern Technologies in 1994. In May 1995, Landmark bought the remainder and formed a 50-50 partnership with Knight-Ridder Inc. Gannett Co. Inc. joined the group in February, and InfiNet is now an equal partnership among the three media companies, Ill said.
<P>   InfiNet offers a number of services to help newspapers publish on the World Wide Web. In an Internet-access arrangement, InfiNet handles equipment installation and maintenance, arranges and maintains phone lines, and offers 24-hour technical support using 800-number and other services.
<P>   The local affiliates handle the sales and marketing and split the money with InfiNet, Ill said.
<P>   InfiNet has a full set of publishing products, including real estate, classified, automotive and other programs on the Web to establish new revenue streams, Ill said. Some newspapers use InfiNet&#39;s services to sell access to their archives, he said.
<P>   The three InfiNet partners saw the Internet coming, realized it would have an impact on publishing, and set out to get involved and develop an effective strategy, Ill said. They continue to explore how the Internet will affect newspapers in the future, he said.

		<h3>Wired Ventures gets big jolt of money</h3>
<P>
<P>   SAN FRANCISCO -- After twice planning to go public, and twice thinking better of it, new-media company Wired Ventures Inc. announced it has nailed $21.5 million in equity financing from private institutional investors.
<P>   Wired wouldn&#39;t say who the new investors are or disclose the terms of financing. Company officials waxed optimistic about the new capital and said it would allow the 4-year-old magazine publisher, Webcaster and book publishing firm to take its game to the next level.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve got the money we need to go forward,&#39;&#39; said Don Markley, Wired Ventures spokesman.
<P>   In addition to the monthly Wired print magazine, Wired Ventures operates HotWired, a cluster of sites on the World Wide Web, and recently launched HardWired, a book publishing division.
<P>   Privately held Wired Ventures canceled planned IPOs last summer and fall, the latter a $66.5 million offering. The cancelations came amid leaked internal e-mail memos and press reports that the company&#39;s online ventures were bleeding money.
<P>
<P><h3>Long-distance firms oppose Ameritech plan</h3>
<P>
<P>    WASHINGTON -- Ameritech&#39;s request to provide long-distance service to its local customers in Michigan is drawing protests from long-distance carriers, which contend the company has not satisfied federal requirements.
<P>    Chicago-based Ameritech asked federal regulators this past week for permission to provide long-distance service in part of its local telephone region. Ameritech is the first of the nation&#39;s Bell companies to make such a request, and it took federal regulators and potential long-distance rivals by surprise. A law enacted last February permits local Bell companies to provide long-distance service, and Ameritech is either offering or plans to offer such service in more than 40 states where it does not provide local phone service.
<P>    The real fight is over the Bell companies providing long-distance service to their own states, where they see their biggest opportunity to offer one-stop communications shopping most cheaply and efficiently.
<P>    The Federal Communications Commission, with input from the Justice Department, has 90 days to act on the Ameritech request.
<P>
<P><h3>Detailed Internet game directory published</h3>
<P>
<P>    Lycos Press has distributed to bookstores the Internet Games Directory, a guide to such resources on the Internet.
<P>    While reviews, hints and strategy guides are some of the resources available online for the game enthusiast, locating useful, relevant or even game-specific information can be difficult. The book claims to provide details on how to locate even the most esoteric game information, from online real-time games on the Internet to downloadable games for teenagers and adults.
<P>    Authors Marc Saltzman and Sean McFadden are online gaming experts.  Saltzman hosts &#39;&#39;Marc&#39;s Web Watch&#39;&#39; on &#39;&#39;The Edge,&#39;&#39; a popular radio show in Toronto, and has also reviewed games for Maclean&#39;s Magazine, Electronic Arts Canada and Canada Computes! McFadden is a senior editor and writer for Lycos, where he reviews Web sites for the Games and Hobbies section of the Sites by Subject directory.
<P>    Lycos Press is a three-year effort between Lycos Inc., an Internet search and guide company, and Macmillan Publishing USA&#39;s QUE imprint.
<P>
<P><h3>Rapid growth predicted for DVD-Video</h3>
<P>
<P>   DVD-Video players, expected to be introduced in the United States in 1997 at prices of $599 and up, will appeal primarily to high-end home theater enthusiasts, a new market study by InfoTech, the Woodstock, VT-based market research firm.
<P>   About 820,000 units will be sold worldwide, the study predicts.
<P>   By 2000, however, the expected rapid acceptance of DVD-ROM on the PC desktop will drive down the costs of shared components dramatically, InfoTech predicts. This should enable DVD-Video players to reach mass market pricing (in the $250 range) and should stimulate a tenfold increase in demand that will culminate in a worldwide installed base of over 80 million units by 2005, according to the predictions.
<P>    DVD-Video is expected to benefit from the active support of four studios behind their respective hardware partners&#39; launches: Time-Warner (Toshiba), Columbia-TriStar (Sony), Polygram (Philips) and MCA (Matsushita).  Based on an analysis of the release plans of both major studios and independents, InfoTech projects that more than 600 DVD-Video titles will be available worldwide by year&#39;s end; that is projected to increase to more than 8,000 by 2000.

		<h3>Norman, Hoch will play today for the &#39;World Championship&#39; </h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>    <B>Greg Norman </B>vs. <B>Hisayuki Sasaki </B>was little more than a walkover. <B>Scott Hoch </B>against <B>Sam Torrance </B>took longer.
<P>    In the end, though, the inevitable happened Saturday in semifinal matches of the Andersen Consulting World Championship of Golf in Scottsdale, Ariz.
<P>    Norman, the white-thatched Aussie who has won more PGA money than anyone in history, needed 14 holes to defeat Sasaki, the Japanese champion, 5 and 4.
<P>    He ended the match with typical brilliance, chipping in from a bunker about 18 feet from the pin for his seventh birdie. The ball arced, bounced twice and hit the stick and dropped into the hole.
<P>    Hoch beat Torrance, a Scot who won the European section, 4 and 2, with his seventh birdie in a round that also included an eagle. He was 9-under when the match ended two shots shy of a full round.
<P>    Norman and Hoch will play a 36-hole match today, with the winner pocketing $1 million for winning the tournament in its second year. Sasaki and Torrance have an 18-hole match for third place.
<P>    The $3.65 million event offers golf&#39;s largest purse, with $2.28 million already distributed to contestants and winners of Japanese, European, United States and International sectionals last spring and summer.
<P>
<P><h3>College basketball</h3>
<P>
<P>* The Tennessee Tipoff Club begins its second season on Monday. The club meets weekly at 11:30 a.m. at The Foundry on the World&#39;s Fair site. Ex-Georgia coach <B>Hugh Durham </B>will be the first guest speaker. Call <B>Ron Rochelle</B> at 470-8444 for information.
<P>* <B>Brandy Reed </B>of Southern Mississippi, the Conference USA player of the year in 1995-96, has been suspended again for continuing academic problems. The 6-foot-1 junior forward was suspended after the fall semester.
<P>
<P><h3>Baseball</h3>
<P>
<P>* The names of Cincinnati Reds executives and relatives were among those that General Motors said Reds owner <B>Marge Schott </B>used to falsify 57 auto sales at her dealership, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported. The people whose names were used were unaware of the situation and weren&#39;t involved, the newspaper reported.
<P>* The Atlanta Braves&#39; new stadium will have to undergo repairs even before the baseball season starts. Concrete concourses at the stadium -- which was built for the Olympics but is now being converted to a 49,800-seat baseball park -- already have noticeable cracks. And on the upperdeck, concrete has chipped away, leaving scars a half-inch deep.
<P>* The Boston Red Sox have raised ticket prices for the 1997 season, breaking the news to season ticket-holders in an apologetic letter from general manager <B>Dan Duquette</B>. The news may be a signal that the Red Sox will not be able to sign free agent pitcher <B>Steve Avery</B>.
<P>
<P><h3>Football</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>Robert Irsay&#39;s </B>wife will collect his $25,000 monthly salary from the Indianapolis Colts and his son will get to see his medical reports as a result of the latest court appearance by the bickering relatives. The Colts&#39; owner has been in poor health since suffering a massive stroke in November 1995.
<P>* Hall of Famer <B>Lee Roy Selmon </B>has been selected the Walter Camp Football Foundation&#39;s 1996 Alumnus of the Year. Now an associate athletic director at South Florida, Selmon will be honored at the annual Walter Camp dinner Feb. 15 at Yale.
<P>
<P><h3>Tennis</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>Justin Gimelstob,</B> a late replacement who had never played mixed doubles before this week, teamed with <B>Chanda Rubin</B> to give the United States its first title in the Hopman Cup in Perth, Australia. Gimelstob and Rubin beat <B>Wayne Ferreira </B>and <B>Amanda Coetzer </B>3-6, 6-2, 7-5 in the decisive mixed doubles match to earn a 2-1 victory over South Africa in the final. Rubin defeated Coetzer 7-5, 6-2 in the opening women&#39;s singles, before Ferreira tied the match with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) win over Gimelstob.
<P>* Fourth-seed <B>Todd Woodbridge </B>and <B>Scott Draper </B>won their semifinal matches  to set up an all-Australian final since 1988 at the Australian Hardcourt  championships. Woodbridge topped Sweden&#39;s <B>Mikael Tillstrom </B>to win 6-7 (6-8), 7-6 (7-3), 6-3; Draper beat American qualifier <B>Jeff Tarango </B>6-1, 3-6, 6-2.
<P>
<P><h3>Correction</h3>
<P>
<P>* Farragut&#39;s <B>Brooke Burnett</B> hit the 3-pointer that sent the Lady Admirals&#39; basketball game with West into overtime Friday night. Another player was listed as making the shot in a story in Saturday&#39;s News-Sentinel.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Don Jacobs, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">U</FONT>sing a drunken driving law less than 72 hours old, area law enforcement agencies already have seized three vehicles.
<P>   &#39;&#39;When you take their car, it&#39;s just like taking their weapon,&#39;&#39; Knox County Sheriff&#39;s Department spokesman Chuck Denney said Friday.
<P>   Sheriff&#39;s deputies have seized two cars using a law that became effective Jan. 1. The Tennessee Highway Patrol has seized one vehicle in Campbell County.
<P>   &#39;&#39;What you&#39;re going to see at first is a lot seized on driving on revoked charges, and that&#39;s what we have here,&#39;&#39; Denney said.
<P>   Under the new law, anyone who lost driving privileges because of a drunken driving conviction can have their vehicle seized if they are caught driving.
<P>   That&#39;s what happened Wednesday to Charles Wesley Kiestler, 23, of Whittaker Road in East Knox County.
<P>   According to court documents, KCSD Deputy Tim Laycock saw Kiestler allegedly speeding in a 1984 Honda Prelude. Laycock determined Kiestler&#39;s driving privileges had been revoked in December 1994 because of a drunken driving offense, so he seized the car.
<P>   Kiestler was released from Knox County Jail after posting a $500 bond on the driving on a revoked license charge. He could not be reached for comment.
<P>   At 12:43 a.m. on Friday, Dennis Wade Hutchison, 47, of Brushy Valley Road in Powell became the second person in Knox County to feel the bite of the new law.
<P>    According to court records, the unemployed Hutchison was seen &#39;&#39;weaving in and out of his traffic lane&#39;&#39; on Central Avenue Pike by Deputy J.H. Lane. When Lane stopped the 1979 Oldsmobile Cutlass, Hutchison admitted drinking &#39;&#39;about six beers,&#39;&#39; records state.
<P>   Hutchison failed field sobriety tests administered and refused to submit to a breath-alcohol test, records show. Hutchison was charged with a fourth offense of drunken driving and a second offense of driving on a revoked license. Hutchison was jailed on a $3,000 bond, and the car was seized.
<P>   &#39;&#39;In the past, if you revoked someone&#39;s driver&#39;s license, that was meaningless to them,&#39;&#39; Denney said. &#39;&#39;But when you seize their car, they know you mean business.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s not our intent to go into the used-car business, but it sends a strong message to drunken drivers.&#39;&#39;
<P>   According to the Tennessee Department of Safety, there were 7,830 convictions last year for driving on a license revoked because of a drunken driving conviction.
<P>   Anthony Kimbrough, spokesman for the state Department of Safety, said the vehicles are being seized under the same guidelines used for years under drug laws.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Innocent owners are protected,&#39;&#39; Kimbrough said.
<P>   If a bank has a lien on a seized car, the loan will be repaid with proceeds from the auction of the vehicle, he said. If the car belongs to someone other than the charged driver, the vehicle can be reclaimed by the owner as long as they didn&#39;t know of and consent to the illegal use of the car.
<P>   Administrative law judges appointed through the Tennessee Secretary of State&#39;s office will hear evidence about forfeiture of seized cars, usually within 30 days of the confiscation.

		<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- Gov. Don Sundquist moved on Friday to put the state&#39;s mental and physical health programs into a single bureaucracy, predicting a reduction of state employees and taxpayer costs over the long term.
<P>    &#39;&#39;There will be less confusion, less overlap,&#39;&#39; said Sundquist.
<P>    The governor stressed, however, that the overhaul was not driven by the state&#39;s current financial problems but by his longstanding goal of increasing government efficency without reducing services.
<P>    In the short term, he said there will be little impact on the budget or employees -- though that will change &#39;&#39;over a long period of time.&#39;&#39; He declined to predict the amount of long term savings or the number of layoffs of state workers.
<P>    The realignment comes with the state facing a $100 million shortage in funds for the current fiscal year and a projected $300 million shortfall for the 1997-98 fiscal year that begins July 1.
<P>    All commissioners have been asked to find ways to cut spending, but Sundquist said the reorganization is a separate matter designed to eliminate &#39;&#39;disjointed efforts&#39;&#39; in the present bureaucratic setup.
<P>    Under the governor&#39;s plan, the present Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation will be abolished and its functions placed under a new Department of Public Health.
<P>    The new department will continue work of the present Department of Health and will also take over administration of the state&#39;s TennCare program.
<P>    The Department of Finance and Administration has been overseeing the TennCare program. It has also taken responsibility for many mental health and mental retardation programs under a reshuffling announced last year.
<P>    The state Legislature, which goes into session next week, must approve the plan to abolish the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. The other changes were accomplished by an executive order, effective on Friday, the governor said.
<P>    Together, the consolidated Department of Public Health will have about 10,000 employees.
<P>    Nancy Menke, who previously has served as Sundquist&#39;s legislative lobbyist and chief policy adviser on children&#39;s services and prisons, will serve as commissioner of the new, consolidated department.
<P>    The current health commissioner, Dr. Fredia Wadley,  will have the title of &#39;&#39;chief health officer.&#39;&#39; She said the job will include all her present duties plus input into TennCare &#39;&#39;from a medical policy standpoint.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Both Wadley, a pediatrician, and Menke will be paid the same salary -- $120,000 per year.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The consolidation recommended by the Tennessee Commission on Practical Government will eliminate duplication of services, provide more effective services and eventually save money,&#39;&#39; Sundquist said.
<P>    The commission was a group of businessmen appointed by Sundquist that recommended an array of changes in government structure -- few of them implemented so far.
<P>    The governor said he anticipates another announcement on restructuring government soon but declined to give details. Previously, he has expressed interest in consolidating various work-force job-training programs that are now housed in the Department of Labor, the Department of Employment Security and some other agencies.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I believe very strongly that we need to restructure state government to face the new challenges of the 21st century,&#39;&#39; Sundquist said in a statement at his Friday news conference. &#39;&#39;Increasingly, our state -- and all states -- are facing the prospect of more responsibility but less revenue from the federal government. . . . We have to operate more effectively and more efficiently.&#39;&#39;

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- Monroe County lawyer James Curwood Witt Jr., son of a judge and grandson of a prosecutor, was appointed to a new seat on the state Criminal Court of Appeals by Gov. Don Sundquist on Friday.
<P>    Witt&#39;s appointment completes the naming of three new Court of Criminal Appeals judges -- one for each grand division of the state -- that were authorized by the state Legislature last year.
<P>    The state&#39;s Judicial Selection Commission had sent Sundquist three nominees on Sept. 20. The governor picked Witt over Paula Voss, an assistant public defender in Knoxville, and Thomas Wright, a federal public defender in Greeneville.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Judge Witt has shown his commitment to fairness throughout his career,&#39;&#39; Sundquist said in a statement. &#39;&#39;His work with young people will bring an important perspective to the bench.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Witt, 47, is a graduate of Hiwassee College, Madisonville; Tennessee Wesleyan College, Athens; and the University of Tennessee College of Law. He has been in private practice at Madisonville since 1973 and served three years as Monroe County&#39;s juvenile judge.
<P>    He has served as president of the Monroe County Bar Association and the Boys and Girls Clubs of the Monroe area. He has also served as a member of the Tennessee Conference of Juvenile Court Judges, the Tennessee Judicial Council and the Tennessee Juvenile Justice Advisory Group.
<P>    He has four children and is a member of First United Methodist Church of Madisonville.
<P>    Witt&#39;s father was a circuit court judge in Monroe County, while his grandfather, Beecher Witt, was a district attorney general.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It is an honor that Gov. Sundquist has chosen me to fill this position,&#39;&#39; said Witt in a statement released by the governor&#39;s office. &#39;&#39;I look forward to joining my colleagues on the Court of Criminal Appeals to increase the efficiency of the appeals process in this state.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The three new court seats were created in response to reports that the appeals court workload had increased to a level where cases could be delayed.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he case of a 58-year-old Miami man accused of delivering two kilograms of cocaine to a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration informant in Knoxville has been sent to a federal grand jury.
<P>   U.S. Magistrate Robert P. Murrian also ordered Verma D. Powell held without bond pending his trial following preliminary and detention hearings Friday in federal court.
<P>   Powell, who has a 1982 federal conviction for heroin trafficking, was arrested Dec. 18 after allegedly delivering cocaine to the unidentified informant in a motel parking lot.
<P>   According to an affidavit by DEA Agent David E. Lewis, the case grew out of a Dec. 16 telephone conversation between the informant and Powell.
<P>   &#39;&#39;During this conversation, Powell agreed to come to Knoxville from Miami and deliver to the (informant) at least one kilogram of cocaine,&#39;&#39; Lewis wrote.
<P>   Lewis testified Friday that the two men had done business on previous occasions but conceded when questioned by Powell&#39;s attorney, Albert Levin, that he had only observed this one delivery.
<P>   But Lewis also noted he monitored the phone conversation and a tape of the alleged delivery, adding, &#39;&#39;It certainly appeared that they had done this before.&#39;&#39;
<P>   He wrote in his affidavit that Powell arrived in Knoxville on the morning of Dec. 18, 1996, and paged the informant using a pre-arranged code.
<P>   &#39;&#39;This code would indicate that Powell was at the East Towne Mall parking lot and was awaiting the (informant),&#39;&#39; Lewis wrote.
<P>   The two men met at the mall and then Powell, in a gold Cadillac, followed the informant to the Days Inn hotel on Asheville Highway, where the two men pulled around back and parked, according to Lewis.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Approximately 30 seconds later, Powell was observed at the rear of his vehicle holding a plastic bag which contained two brick-shaped packages,&#39;&#39; Lewis wrote. &#39;&#39;Powell handed this package to the (informant), at which time Powell was arrested.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ed Holt argued that Powell, who is still on probation for his prior drug conviction, is both a danger to the community and a risk to flee and urged that he be held without bond. He also noted that Powell had jumped bond at least once before.
<P>   Levin, a Miami lawyer, countered that Powell works and has a house and family in Miami and hasn&#39;t been in legal trouble in the 11 years since he was released from prison on his prior drug offense.
<P>   Murrian agreed with Holt and ordered Powell held.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>lthough the city of Knoxville rejected the idea, Knox County will move forward with a study of whether taxpayers are getting their money&#39;s worth from at least seven local economic development agencies.
<P>   The city and county together spend approximately $3 million annually on the groups, which include the Greater Knoxville Chamber of Commerce, The Downtown Organization, the Knoxville/Knox County Convention and Visitors Bureau and the Greater Knoxville Sports Corp.
<P>   County Commission unanimously approved a resolution last month asking County Executive Tommy Schumpert to name a five-member task force to evaluate the agencies&#39; effectiveness, as well as that of the city&#39;s Department of Economic Development.
<P>   The commission&#39;s resolution also &#39;&#39;encouraged&#39;&#39; Mayor Victor Ashe and City Council to name five members. On Thursday, however, the council declined, voting instead to ask Ashe and Schumpert to do the work themselves.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I just don&#39;t know why they didn&#39;t want to participate,&#39;&#39; Schumpert said, but he planned to proceed as county commissioners directed and present his selections to the commission&#39;s Intergovernmental Committee in two weeks.
<P>   Commissioner Mike Ragsdale, who proposed the task force with Commissioner Scott Davis, was &#39;&#39;disappointed&#39;&#39; with the city&#39;s decision not to take part.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I&#39;m going to encourage Mr. Schumpert to appoint individuals from the city,&#39;&#39; Ragsdale said. Asked if council members might be invited, Ragsdale said, &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t think there&#39;d be a thing in the world wrong with that.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Two council members supported the task force idea -- Nick Pavlis and Carlene Malone. Malone said outsiders should study economic development efforts.
<P>    The county task force will include &#39;&#39;business, labor and industrial representatives,&#39;&#39; according to the resolution passed by County Commission.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I feel somewhat concerned we&#39;re not willing to open the process up a little bit and have outside eyes as well as inside eyes look at it,&#39;&#39; Malone said, pointing out that &#39;&#39;people are very protective of their turf in the economic development arena.&#39;&#39;
<P>   She expressed some amusement that &#39;&#39;45 agencies with straight faces take responsibility for every hamburger job that comes to town,&#39;&#39; but her colleagues said they just don&#39;t want another committee.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think it&#39;s an administrative matter which can be recommended to us,&#39;&#39; Councilman Ed Shouse said, pointing out that the mayor can move faster than a committee to make recommendations in time for a February budget workshop.
<P>   Ashe said he would follow the council&#39;s wishes.
<P>    He&#39;s already indicated he would consider incrementally reducing Chamber of Commerce funding by $25,000 a year, from the current $125,000.
<P>   As for the county task force, Ashe said, &#39;&#39;Whatever recommendations they have I will certainly seriously look at.&#39;&#39;

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>n attorney for James Earl Ray says his client is not about to make a deathbed confession on the slaying of Martin Luther King Jr. as some civil rights leaders have called for.
<P>   Andrew N. Hall, Ray&#39;s attorney in Wartburg, said Ray will not make any kind of confession since he has said all he intends to say in the book he wrote about his life and the shooting of King in 1968 in Memphis.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Ray wrote a book (&#39;&#39;Who Killed Martin Luther King&#39;&#39;) a few years ago in which he purports to tell all he knows about Dr. King&#39;s assassination,&#39;&#39; Hall said in a letter to reporters.
<P>   Hall also took issue with Jesse Jackson asking Ray for a confession, saying he was disturbed &#39;&#39;by his (Jackson&#39;s) lack of compassion and feeling for Mr. Ray and his family.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Ray initially confessed to the slaying but later recanted and has continued to maintain his innocence while serving a 99-year sentence.
<P>   Ray lapsed into a coma last month and appeared near death from complications of liver disease. He was moved from a Nashville hospital to a special-needs prison Dec. 30.
<P>   Hall also said that he will amend Ray&#39;s lawsuit against the state in trying to get him health care.
<P>   He said that Ray had complained for a year that he was sick and could not get Prison Health Services Inc., which dispenses medical care to inmates for the state, to give him proper medical attention.
<P>   Hall said Ray&#39;s condition (cirrhosis of the liver) should have been diagnosed earlier.
<P>   &#39;&#39;That should have been done a year ago when they could have done something about it,&#39;&#39; Hall said. &#39;&#39;Now he has something that is serious. What I contend all along is that if he had been given treatment when he began asking for it, he wouldn&#39;t be there (hospital) today. He would be back at Riverbend being a model prisoner.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Hall said the prognosis for Ray&#39;s recovery is not good.

<P><h3>Monterey board supports chief amid &#39;back-biting&#39;</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   MONTEREY -- The mayor and board of aldermen have voted to support police chief Bruce Breedlove amid &#39;&#39;back-biting&#39;&#39; in his department.
<P>   Alderman Keith Davis, chairman of the police committee, said he wanted officers in the police department to begin working together.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I know morale is low in the police department. I don&#39;t know what the problem is, but there seems to be a lot of back-biting going on,&#39;&#39; he said Thursday night.
<P>   One example of apparent trouble within the department was the defacing of a &#39;&#39;wanted poster&#39;&#39; circulated statewide by the TBI.
<P>   A name under one of the photos was scratched out and Breedlove&#39;s name was penciled in.
<P>   Breedlove told the board he didn&#39;t know who did the defacing, but he said he knew it was from &#39;&#39;within ranks.&#39;&#39;

<P><h3>Good weather, bad news, say ski team members</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   CHATTANOOGA -- For the last 10 years, members of a zany local water ski team have rung in the new year by water skiing through the elements: rain, sleet, snow and ice.
<P>   This year, the skiers had to settle for one of the warmest New Year&#39;s Days in memory for Tennessee.
<P>   &#39;&#39;A little disappointing,&#39;&#39; Chattanooga skier Rob Lemmons said of his run Wednesday in 66-degree weather. &#39;&#39;It takes a little of the fun out of it.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The traditional New Year&#39;s Day water ski run on the Tennessee River began in 1986 amid 20-degree temperatures and flurrying snow.
<P>   About 30 members of the Greater Hiwassee Ocoee Ski Team were looking for a fun, and slightly challenging, way to celebrate the holiday.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We do this to start the year off correctly,&#39;&#39; said Don Bowker, an eight-year member of the club.
<P>   Although 1997 started out balmy, the water was still chilly.
<P>   &#39;&#39;When we get in there, we won&#39;t mind (the weather),&#39;&#39; said Tommy Newman of Cleveland, Tenn. &#39;&#39;But you like it to be cold and spitting snow. Makes it more challenging.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Chattanooga&#39;s high temperature of 70 degrees Friday tied a record. In Knoxville, Friday&#39;s high was 68 degrees.

		<h3>ValuJet wins partial FAA approval</h3>
<P>
<P>    ATLANTA -- The Federal Aviation Administration granted ValuJet a partial victory on Friday, approving the airline&#39;s flights to Florida, but denying an expansion of its fleet.
<P>    The airline had struggled to win the FAA&#39;s approval for flights to West Palm Beach and Fort Meyers in Florida and Dallas since it was allowed to return to the skies in September.
<P>    FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said ValuJet has not formally sought approval to resume service to Dallas. In addition, the FAA did not grant ValuJet&#39;s request to add five planes to its current fleet, but Bergen said the request is still being reviewed by the FAA.

<P><h3>Government to monitor Texaco</h3>
<P>
<P>    WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- Federal regulators will have power to monitor Texaco&#39;s treatment of blacks under an agreement reached Friday that gives a federal agency a role in the company&#39;s anti-discrimination settlement.
<P>    The agreement &#39;&#39;reflects our serious concerns with the employment practices at Texaco,&#39;&#39; said James Lee, regional attorney for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
<P>    The EEOC had investigated Texaco&#39;s hiring and promotion practices and found them to be racially discriminatory. That was before the separate civil suit became a national embarrassment to Texaco with the release of tape recordings in which executives mocked blacks and plotted to destroy documents.
<P>    Shortly after Texaco announced a tentative $176 million settlement of the suit in November, the EEOC asked federal Judge Charles Breiant to let it intervene &#39;&#39;to protect the public interest.&#39;&#39; The agreement is contingent on final court approval of the civil settlement, which includes back pay and raises to black employees and various programs to diversify Texaco&#39;s work force and improve working conditions for black employees. The agreement allows the EEOC to monitor the progress of those programs.

<P><h3>Burkhart proposes added facility</h3>
<P>
<P>   The Army Corps of Engineers&#39; Nashville District soon will consider whether to permit additions to Burkhart Enterprises&#39; barge unloading facilities at mile marker 1.0 on the French Broad River in Knox County.
<P>   The District said Burkhart proposes building five mooring cells, each 16 feet in diameter, as base for an added unloading station at terminals that now handle steel, salt and coke shipments. Burkhart also proposes riprapping 600 feet of shoreline behind the new cells, and it seeks a 10-year maintenance dredging permit to remove up to 2,000 cubic yards of material from a 100-by-1500-foot area of the river near the dock.
<P>   The public may file comments on the proposal by writing Bradley N. Bishop of the Corps Regulatory Branch by Jan. 27 at P.O. Box 1070, Nashville, TN 37202-1070. Comments also may be mailed to TVA&#39;s Land Management Team at Suite 300, 804 U.S. Highway 321 North, Lenoir City, TN 37771-6440.

		<h3>Kentucky will spend $24 million on stadium</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>     The University of Kentucky has begun soliciting bids for a $24 million expansion and renovation of Commonwealth Stadium, despite record low attendance this past season at the 23-year-old stadium.
<P>    The expansion, which most likely will be done before the 1998 season, will increase capacity from 57,800 to between 63,000 and 66,000, athletic director <B>C.M. Newton </B>said Thursday.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We think it&#39;s in our best interest financially to do this, or we wouldn&#39;t do it,&#39;&#39; Newton told The Courier-Journal. &#39;&#39;And that&#39;s what our studies showed.&#39;&#39;
<P>    UK was left with more than 100,000 empty seats last football season -- the lowest attendance since Commonwealth Stadium opened in 1973. School officials, however, are confident they can fill seats in the future.
<P>    The anticipated construction will include luxury suites in the corners of the stadium, new and renovated restrooms, concession-area renovation and expansion and the addition of a &#39;&#39;Wildcat stadium store.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Newton said the work will be done in phases, beginning with renovations before the 1997 season. If all goes as planned, it will end with construction of 20 to 40 luxury boxes and permanent end-zone seating -- replacing metal bleachers -- before the 1998 season.
<P>
<P><h3>College football</h3>
<P>
<P><B></B><B>Tony Daniels,</B> a defensive end at Texas Tech, said that he was making himself available for the NFL draft. He is the second Red Raiders&#39; junior to make that decision, joining star tailback <B>Byron Hanspard</B>. Texas Tech opens next season at Tennessee.

<P>* The NCAA has accepted Clemson&#39;s penalties in the case of defensive end <B>Trevor Pryce </B>illegally using a university long-distance credit card. Pryce, an All-ACC player, had to sit out two games and Clemson froze coach <B>Tommy West&#39;s </B>salary for a year because he waited almost a month before reporting the violation. 
<P>* The U.S. Military Academy is nearing a decision whether or not to join Conference USA in football.
<P>* Kansas City&#39;s <B>Marty Schottenheimer </B>(South) and the Washington Redskins&#39; <B>Norv Turner </B>(North) will be coaches in the Senior Bowl at Mobile, Ala., a Jan. 18 matchup of senior college  players looking to become pros.

		<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>ASHINGTON -- U.S. Rep. Zach Wamp emerged Thursday as the first Tennessee House member undecided on Newt Gingrich&#39;s re-election as speaker after Gingrich admitted filing inaccurate statements with the House Ethics Committee.
<P>   Wamp, a Chattanooga Republican, wants to get more information about the Ethics Committee&#39;s investigation of Gingrich before the House&#39;s leadership election Tuesday, Wamp aide Dick Kopper said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;He has not yet made a commitment on this vote,&#39;&#39; Kopper said.
<P>   About a dozen of the 226 House Republicans in the next Congress so far have declared themselves undecided about Gingrich&#39;s re-election.
<P>   The full Ethics Committee is to meet Wednesday, the day after the election for speaker, to discuss the form of punishment for Gingrich&#39;s admitted inaccurate statements that his former fund-raising political committee, called GOPAC, was not connected to a college course that he taught.
<P>   Republicans are saying he likely will be given a reprimand that will be embarrassing but would not be the most severe penalty of &#39;&#39;censure,&#39;&#39; which would require him to give up the speakership.
<P>   The Associated Press Thursday quoted unnamed sources as saying that the ethics panel&#39;s subcommittee will recommend only a reprimand and not censure for Gingrich. But some key Democrats told reporters their members on the ethics panel so far have not agreed to that proposed deal.
<P>   Wamp plans to attend a meeting of Republicans and their leaders Monday to discuss any concerns they have about Gingrich&#39;s case.
<P>   Most House members are not returning to Washington until Monday to prepare for Tuesday&#39;s swearing-in ceremony and other organizational meetings.
<P>   Rep. John J. Duncan Jr., R-Knoxville, has said he wants more information about Gingrich&#39;s ethics case before making public comments and has not stated a position on whether Gingrich should remain speaker, aide Bob Griffitts said. Duncan was on vacation Thursday and could not be reached, Griffitts said.
<P>   Also, Rep. Van Hilleary, a Grandview Republican, has not expressed any reservations about re-electing Gingrich as speaker, aide Ed Frank said. Hilleary also was on vacation and could not be contacted.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Right now, I have no reason to believe that he will not be voting for Newt,&#39;&#39; Frank said of Hilleary.
<P>   Rep.-elect William Jenkins, a Rogersville Republican, was traveling in the state Thursday and could not be contacted, Rep. Jimmy Quillen&#39;s staff said. Jenkins, who won&#39;t get House office space until Monday, was elected to succeed Quillen, who is retiring.
<P>   Another Tennessee Republican, Ed Bryant of Henderson, has said he will vote for Gingrich&#39;s re-election.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Frank Munger, News-Sentinel Oak Ridge bureau</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>AK RIDGE -- Despite high-profile problems with two Oak Ridge projects that turn radioactive waste into glass, the U.S. Department of Energy remains interested in  vitrification technologies and would like to proceed with testing. 
<P>    Funding shortfalls and other issues, however, have jeopardized future developments that will require millions of dollars. 
<P>    One of the demonstration projects -- &#39;&#39;in situ vitrification&#39;&#39; -- involves the melting of old nuclear waste pits at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The technique is supposed to convert the soil and waste into a volcanic glass, sealing the hazardous constituents inside for thousands of years. 
<P>    An ISV operation was halted in the spring after a &#39;&#39;burp&#39;&#39; in the underground melt zone spewed shards of molten glass and damaged the massive hood that covers the pit and collects gaseous emissions. A planned March 17 restart is no longer feasible because of cuts in DOE&#39;s environmental budget, and the project has been placed on indefinite hold. 
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s not dead, but it&#39;s not alive,&#39;&#39; said John Sweeney of DOE&#39;s environmental restoration staff. If new funds become available, a 1997 restart is still possible, he said. 
<P>    Earl Leming, Tennessee&#39;s environmental oversight chief in Oak Ridge, said state officials would like to see DOE complete the melt in order to gauge the technology&#39;s merits. The effectiveness is still unclear, he said. 
<P>    The other Oak Ridge project -- termed &#39;&#39;transportable vitrification system&#39;&#39; or TVS -- is a waste-treatment experiment located at DOE&#39;s K-25 Site. The system is supposed to melt mixed wastes containing hazardous chemicals and radioactive elements. The molten glass then would be poured into stainless steel containers and sent elsewhere for disposal. 
<P>    The TVS project was shut down in November after more than a ton of molten glass leaked from the system&#39;s melter during a preliminary test. No toxic waste was involved in the early operation, but the problem caused about $850,000 in damage and created a new realm of uncertainties. The system won&#39;t be restarted until mid-summer at the earliest. 
<P>    Leming said vitrification technologies are attractive because they could help stem the migration of contaminants in groundwater. But the state also wants questions on glassification projects to be resolved. 
<P>    The state has approved restart of TVS testing, but Leming said he has asked DOE to evaluate how much it will cost to decontaminate the melt facility. DOE needs to weigh that cost against the potential benefits, he said, because if the upcoming demonstration fails then a cleanup must follow. 
<P>    Leming said the technology has promise, &#39;&#39;but obviously they need to demonstrate it.&#39;&#39; 
<P>    Dave Hutchins of DOE said investigators believe the leak of molten glass was a combination of several factors, all of which can be fixed. 
<P>   One problem was the system had been shut down and restarted too many times, which affected the seal on tiles that form walls of the octagonal melter. The experimental system was operated at Clemson University and DOE&#39;s Savannah River Site in South Carolina before it was brought to Oak Ridge last year. 
<P>    If the prototype facility operates successfully, it could be modified for long-term use to treat a backlog of wastes stored at Oak Ridge, Hutchins said. 
<P>    There are skeptics who question the process. Ralph Hutchison, coordinator of the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance, said he wonders why there are so many problems in Oak Ridge vitrification tests. 
<P>    &#39;&#39;Making glass isn&#39;t rocket science,&#39;&#39; he said. 
<P>    OREPA has serious questions about TVS and is adamantly opposed to any restart of ISV, which Hutchison said has proved a failure in East Tennessee, partly because of the area&#39;s high water table. 
<P>    &#39;&#39;We consider in situ vitrification to be dead, and DOE should not waste more tax dollars trying to resurrect it,&#39;&#39; Hutchison said. 
<P>    Sweeney said if DOE decides to restart the ISV project, there will be plenty of advance notice and discussions with &#39;&#39;stakeholder&#39;&#39; groups, including environmental activists.

<P>   Four people died in the park during 1996 year, compared to six or seven in most years during the past decade and 10 deaths inside the park during 1993.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s been quite a peaceful year, there have been no major searches and no plane crashes,&#39;&#39; said Miller.
<P>    The four deaths that occurred in the Smokies this year all happened during the summer months.
<P>    The first resulted from a motorcycle crash in early June on the park&#39;s heavily traveled Newfound Gap Road June 3.
<P>    Gary Paulis of Miami, Fla., died from massive internal injuries.
<P>    The other three occurred in a three-week period in August and early September.
<P>   The first occurred on Aug. 25 when Charles Barry of Alcoa died after being stung by a swarm of yellow jackets in the Tremont area.
<P>    One week later, Jerry Taylor of Cocke County died when he and the horse he was riding fell from a bridge into Big Creek. Taylor suffered massive head injuries.
<P>    The following week, Michael Chad Bickle of Pigeon Forge died when the 1989 Pontiac Fiero he was driving struck a stone wall and overturned on the section of Highway 441 commonly referred to as the &#39;&#39;spur.&#39;&#39;
<P>    In 1995 the park had seven deaths; 1994, six deaths; 1992, six deaths; 1991, five deaths and in 1990, four deaths.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">J</FONT>ERUSALEM -- A second Israeli soldier was detained Thursday on suspicion that he knew of plans by off-duty Pvt. Noam Friedman to open fire on Palestinians in a crowded Hebron market.
<P>    Friedman, 22, said he acted alone in planning and carrying out Wednesday&#39;s shooting in which five Palestinians were injured. He said he hoped to hamper Israel&#39;s planned pullout from most of the West Bank city.
<P>    His attorney, Naphtali Werzberger, said Friedman was unhappy in the army and had asked an army psychologist to recommend his discharge, but was denied. No immediate comment was available from the army.
<P>    Werzberger said Friedman has a heart problem that also affected his state of mind. He said his client recently became more devout, growing a beard and refusing to eat army food that did not have special rabbinical approval.
<P>    Friedman has said he hoped to stop Israel&#39;s withdrawal from most of Hebron.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I acted alone. It was my decision,&#39;&#39; he said after a judge in the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva ordered him held for 10 days while charges are prepared. Asked about suspected accomplice Yuval Jibli, Friedman said: &#39;&#39;I have no idea why he was arrested.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Jibli, 21, served with Friedman on a logistics base near Jerusalem. He was brought before the same court and ordered held for four days while police investigate allegations of conspiracy and &#39;&#39;non-prevention of a crime.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Israeli media said Jibli entered an Arab village on Wednesday and shot two bullets into the air.
<P>    Jibli, who like Friedman wore the black skullcap of Orthodox Jews, denied any wrongdoing.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I am innocent. I made no conspiracy. It&#39;s all lies and deceit,&#39;&#39; he told reporters as he left the court.
<P>    Jibli&#39;s mother, Aviva, told local TV that her son knew Friedman, who had visited their home once.

<P>   Danny Johnson, 33, was found dead by his girlfriend Wednesday after partying at local bars New Year&#39;s Eve, police said.
<P>   Investigators said they believe Johnson knew his killer and probably let that person into the house not long after taking a cab home.

<P>
<P>   JACKSBORO -- Three people have been charged with drug offenses by the Campbell County Sheriff&#39;s Department following raids over the New Year&#39;s holiday, Sheriff Ron McClellan said.
<P>   Loretta Maye Baker, 47, of LaFollette was charged with possession of marijuana, possession of cocaine and possession of drug paraphernalia. Sgt. Ted Williams searched Baker&#39;s home and found the alleged drug items, McClellan said.
<P>   K.C. Evans, 36, and Sharon Henegar, 29, both of LaFollette were charged with possession of cocaine and possession of drug paraphernalia. Sgt. Williams found a bag of what was believed to be cocaine in the plumbing. Scales also were found, McClellan said.

<P><h3>Good weather is bad news for good year</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   CHATTANOOGA -- For the last 10 years, members of a zany local water ski team have rung in the new year by water skiing through the elements: rain, sleet, snow and ice.
<P>   This year, the skiers had to settle for one of the warmest New Year&#39;s Days in memory for Tennessee.
<P>   &#39;&#39;A little disappointing,&#39;&#39; Chattanooga skier Rob Lemmons said of his run Wednesday in 66-degree weather. &#39;&#39;It takes a little of the fun out of it.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The traditional New Year&#39;s Day water ski run on the Tennessee River began in 1986 amid 20-degree temperatures and flurrying snow. About 30 members of the Greater Hiwassee Ocoee Ski Team were looking for a fun, and slightly challenging, way to celebrate the holiday.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We do this to start the year off correctly,&#39;&#39; said Don Bowker, an eight-year member of the club.
<P>   Although 1997 started out balmy, the water was still chilly.
<P>   &#39;&#39;When we get in there, we won&#39;t mind (the weather),&#39;&#39; said Tommy Newman of Cleveland, Tenn. &#39;&#39;But you like it to be cold and spitting snow. Makes it more challenging.&#39;&#39;

<P>   David Pride of Norene has been ordered before the Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners Jan. 10. He faces a possible fine of $100,000.
<P>   Pride said local vets often recommend him to horse owners.
<P>   &#39;&#39;That&#39;s why I&#39;m here. I&#39;m out here to help the animal, not to hurt the animal,&#39;&#39; he said.

		<h3>Suleymanoglu, Indurain announce retirements</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>    &#39;&#39;Pocket Hercules&#39;&#39; needed only a few seconds to win his third Olympic title. <B>Miguel Indurain </B>was in the spotlight for three whole weeks for his fifth Tour de France triumph.
<P>    Yet <B>Naim Suleymanoglu,</B> the extroverted Turkish weightlifter, and Indurain, the modest cyclist from Spain, had much in common, and on Thursday both announced their retirements.
<P>    They were national heroes. Suleymanoglu would be carried through the streets on the shoulders of his countryman after he had triumphed at Olympics or world championships. Equally, the Spaniards loved Indurain and would chant his name whenever he appeared in public.
<P>    They both won their last major titles at the Atlanta Olympics -- Suleymanoglu in the 141-pound competition and Indurain in the time trial.
<P>    Both appeared unbeatable in their specialty.
<P>    Indurain won his first world championship title in 1995 and an Olympic gold medal a year after. He became the first rider to win the Tour de France five times in a row when he triumphed in 1995 by his biggest margin.
<P>    He became Spain&#39;s most famous sports figure and some would argue the greatest sportsman the country has ever produced. That in a country where soccer is easily the dominant sport.
<P>
<P><h3>Basketball</h3>
<P>
<P>Hiwassee&#39;s women&#39;s team will play No. 1-ranked Central Florida (16-0) today in the McDonald&#39;s Classic in Ocala, Fla. Hiwassee (13-0) beat Hillsborough, Fla., 103-65 Thursday to advance.
<P>
<P><h3>Hockey</h3>
<P>
<P>* Boston goaltender <B>Bill Ranford</B>, who lost his off-season arbitration case and grumbled about his salary ever since, signed a three-year contract extension with the Bruins. An arbitrator set Ranford&#39;s salary at $1.75 million this year, making him the 16th-highest paid goalie in the league.
<P>* <B>Keith Primeau </B>of the Hartford Whalers was suspended indefinitely by the NHL for a slashing incident. The center, who sat out a Thursday night game, will have a hearing today with the league. Primeau slashed Washington Capitals center <B>Joe Juneau </B>on Wednesday and was assessed a major penalty and a game misconduct on the play.
<P>* Dayton Bombers goaltenders <B>Derek Herlofsky </B>has been named the East Coast Hockey League player of the month for December. Herlofsky, 25, set a team record with 10 consecutive victories, three shy of the league record.
<P>
<P><h3>Miscellany</h3>
<P>
<P>* Heisman Trophy winner <B>Danny Wuerffel</B> is among eight athletes being honored by the NCAA for their achievements in athletics, academics and leadership. Wuerffel, the All-America quarterback from Florida, will join the other winners at an NCAA awards dinner Jan. 12 in Nashville. The other winners are <B>Atim Barber,</B> football-track, Virginia; <B>Adam Burgasse</B>r<B>,</B> diving, California-San Diego; <B>Jennifer Clarkson,</B> basketball, Abilene Christian; <B>Michael Fisher</B>, soccer, Virginia; <B>Berit Puggaard,</B> 1996 Olympic swimmer, SMU; <B>Jennifer Kenola,</B> soccer, Notre Dame, and <B>Annette Salmeen</B>, Olympic gold medalist in swimming, UCLA.
<P>
<P><h3>Horse Racing</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>Allen E. Paulson,</B> who kept Cigar racing in 1996, is the recipient of the 1996 Eclipse Award of Merit.  The Thorughbred Racing Associations said that Paulson&#39;s &#39;&#39;extraordinary sportsmanship and dedication to thoroughbred racing was demonstrated by his decision to race Cigar as a 6-year-old rather than retire him to stud.&#39;&#39; Cigar&#39;s value as a stallion soared when he won all 10 of his starts in 1995 and was voted Horse of the Year.
<P>
<P><h3>Tennis</h3>
<P>
<P>* Top-seeded <B>Thomas Muster</B> of Austria won his second-round match in the $635,000 Qatar Open, setting up a quarterfinal match against <B>Jim Courier.</B> Muster defeated <B>Christian Ruud </B>of Norway 6-2, 3-6, 7-5 and Courier topped Romanian qualifier <B>Razvan Sabau </B>6-3, 6-4. Defending champion <B>Petr Korda </B>rallied to beat <B>Magnus Norman</B> of Sweden 6-7 (3-7), 6-4, 6-2, and <B>Sergi Bruguera</B> defeated fellow Spaniard <B>Javier Sanchez</B> 6-0, 6-1 in other second-round matches.
<P>* <B>Justin Gimelstob,</B> a 19-year-old UCLA student, defeated Australia&#39;s <B>Mark Philippoussis</B> 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), leading the Americans into the final of the Hopman Cup mixed team championship at Perth, Australia. Gimelstob&#39;s success followed a 7-5, 6-0 victory by <B>Chanda Rubin </B>over Australia&#39;s <B>Nicole Bradtke </B>in women&#39;s singles and gave the U.S. team an insurmountable 2-0 lead.
<P>* Slovakia&#39;s <B>Karol Kucera</B> upset second-seeded <B>Mark Woodforde </B>6-3, 6-4, ending the Australian&#39;s hopes of winning the Australian Hardcourt championships for the third time. American qualifier <B>Jeff Tarango </B>also advanced to the quarterfinals in the Australian Open tuneup, beating sixth-seeded <B>David Prinosil </B>of Germany 6-2, 6-4. Tarango will face Sweden&#39;s <B>Jonas Bjorkman</B>, a 6-3, 6-4 winner over American <B>Jonathan Stark.</B>

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Jamie Satterfield, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT> New Year&#39;s Day party turned deadly when a fire broke out in a bedroom at an East Knoxville house, authorities said.
<P>   Two people were killed in the 7:11 p.m. blaze at 2204 Chester Ave., near Dandridge Avenue, including the sister of the woman who claimed responsibility for the fatal fire, said Knoxville Fire Department spokesman Norman Hammitt.
<P>   The house had two smoke detectors, Hammitt said, but they lacked batteries.
<P>   The dead were identified as: Christine Dumas, 41, and David Cowan, 43.
<P>   Hammitt said four people -- homeowner Willie Mae Hudson, 68, her two daughters, Dumas and Rosella Dumas, 43, and Cowan -- were inside the house when the fire started.
<P>   Rosella Dumas and Cowan had been &#39;&#39;drinking and smoking&#39;&#39; in a bedroom of the home when both &#39;&#39;passed out,&#39;&#39; Hammitt said. The eldest daughter apparently had a lit cigarette in her hand, he said.
<P>   When Cowan and Rosella Dumas woke up, they discovered a mattress was on fire, he said. They yelled for Hudson to get out of the house, according to Hammitt.
<P>   Hudson, Rosella Dumas and Cowan were able to escape, but once outside realized Christine Dumas was still inside, Hammitt said. Cowan ran back inside to try to rescue her, but Hammitt said the two made it only as far as the front door. That&#39;s where firefighters found their bodies.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Evidently, they were trying to get out,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   A KFD firefighter, Capt. Royal Dodsen, was injured trying to battle the blaze, Hammitt said. Dodsen was treated and released at Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center for smoke inhalation.
<P>   One of Hudson&#39;s neighbors, Margaret Boyd, said she was alerted to the fire by a &#39;&#39;popping sound&#39;&#39; she heard from her house, which is directly across the street from Hudson&#39;s home.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I thought it was somebody shooting firecrackers,&#39;&#39; she said.
<P>   When she looked outside, Boyd said she saw flames &#39;&#39;shooting everywhere,&#39;&#39; especially around the bedroom window where firefighters believe the blaze started.
<P>   Hudson was running from the house toward a next-door neighbor&#39;s home, Boyd said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;She was trying to get somebody&#39;s attention,&#39;&#39; Boyd said.
<P>   Boyd and other neighbors said Hudson repeatedly asked police and firefighters if her daughter was dead in the hour following the discovery of the fire. A chaplain was requested to help Hudson with the death.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s not real to her yet,&#39;&#39; Boyd said of Hudson&#39;s reaction.
<P>   Hammitt said Hudson&#39;s small house was packed with furniture, and that hindered both the two victims&#39; efforts to get out of the burning house and firefighters&#39; efforts to save them.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We had a very difficult time getting in the house because of the unusual amount of furniture,&#39;&#39; Hammitt said. &#39;&#39;Once we got in, we had to go through all that furniture. There was a great deal of fire and smoke. Heavy smoke alone will blind you and then trying to maneuver around all that furniture.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Firefighters tried to enter the home through the front door but wound up using a side entrance on the opposite side of the house from the bedroom where the fire was concentrated, Hammitt said.

        <p><br>
        <font size="5">K</font>noxville's first baby of 1997
        wasn't exactly a surprise. </p>
        <p>Daniel Franklin Self was delivered three weeks early
        by Caesarean section at 12:05 a.m. at Fort Sanders
        Regional Medical Center. </p>
        <p>''Dr. (Tammy) Baker said it'd probably be fun to try
        for the first baby of the new year,'' Daniel's mother,
        Lesha Self, said Wednesday afternoon. </p>
        <p>Said father Jerry Self: ''We were trying for 12:01,
        but it was 5 after.'' </p>
        <p>The baby was breathing faster than normal and had an
        infection, so he was transferred immediately to the
        Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at East Tennessee Children's
        Hospital, where he was in good condition. </p>
        <p>Fort Sanders spokeswoman Teresa Gross said the new
        year wasn't the driving factor behind the early birth. </p>
        <p>The doctor ''recommended they go ahead and do a
        C-section because of a condition called intrauterine
        growth retardation,'' Gross said. ''That's a condition
        where the baby's head is growing larger than the rest of
        the body. Also, she (found) decreased fetal movement. The
        baby wasn't moving very much, and the doctor suspected
        some fetal distress.'' </p>
        <p>Gross said it was her understanding the doctor was
        going to be at the hospital Tuesday night for other
        births, so it made sense to schedule Daniel's entrance
        into the world. </p>
        <p>The hospital will give the couple a gift certificate
        to the Baby Superstore. </p>
        <p>Daniel is the couple's first baby together. They'll
        mark their first anniversary March 8, and each had a boy
        when they married. </p>
        <p>Jerry Self, 27, works for Kern's Bakery, doing
        ''whatever they ask me to do.'' </p>
        <p>Lesha Self, 21, is a licensed practical nurse at
        Blount Memorial Hospital. </p>
        <p>They hope to take Daniel home to Maryville soon. </p>
        <p>''He's doing good,'' the mother said. ''He's getting
        better. He's doing a lot better today than he was last
        night.'' </p>
        <p>Her husband has hopes for their son already, that he
        might be a doctor, a professor, a musician. ''Something
        that's got money involved,'' he said, laughing. ''We've
        got a nice boy. Proud of him,'' Jerry said. ''I'm happy I
        got him.'' </p>

        staff writer</i></font></p>
        <p><br>
        <font size="5">W</font>hile the rest of Knoxville whoops
        over bowl games and toasts a new year, Lorayne Lester is
        busy plotting the future of the University of Tennessee's
        largest college. </p>
        <p>UT Vice Chancellor John Peters has tapped Lester for a
        three-year term as dean of the College of Arts and
        Sciences. She is the first woman to serve in the post. </p>
        <p>''Dr. Lester is an extremely capable, articulate and
        visionary person,'' said Linda Maxson, the dean for
        undergraduate affairs and associate vice chancellor for
        academic affairs. </p>
        <p>''She cares passionately about this institution. One
        needs to have that kind of commitment to the faculty, the
        students and the institution to lead in these challenging
        times.'' </p>
        <p>Lester takes the helm as UT officials begin to grapple
        in earnest with budget woes expected for the 1997-98
        school year. Though there's no final word yet, Maxson and
        other officials say the state Legislature may allocate
        the university the same funding as last year, if not
        less. </p>
        <p>But Lester said she has spent her life around UT and
        has gained the insight to help the school navigate rough
        waters. </p>
        <p>''There will be no question of having to learn the
        ropes, having to wonder who to call for what,'' Lester
        said. ''There's no time for that right now. It's going to
        take serious concentrated efforts to get through the next
        few years.'' </p>
        <p>Lester served as associate dean under former Dean
        Lorman Ratner for six years. Before that, she was head of
        the Department of Speech Communication and
        president-elect of the Faculty Senate. A faculty member
        since 1960, she earned her bachelor's, master's and
        doctoral degrees at UT. </p>
        <p>When Ratner retired from his post last spring, Maxson
        said UT officials planned a national search to find his
        replacement. </p>
        <p>Then Maxson said budget worries forced the school to
        call off searches for several open positions. </p>
        <p>Lester was appointed interim dean. </p>
        <p>Peters finalized the appointment in November. </p>
        <p>Lester said she and her team will immediately kick
        into high gear their plans for the 27 academic
        departments, more than a dozen interdisciplinary programs
        and countless institutes and centers under her control. </p>
        <p>''We'll be helping them devise ways of reducing their
        budgets -- if necessary changing the focus of their
        programs to balance the budget of the college,'' Lester
        said. </p>
        <p>Lester said she will begin budget hearings with
        department heads as early as mid-January. She has asked
        them to lay out sample budgets in the event that 1997-98
        state funding gets chopped either 3, 6 or 9 percent. </p>
        <p>''The presumption is that everybody will have to think
        in terms of reducing,'' she said. </p>
        <p>Though there are sure to be some serious cuts in the
        coming years, Lester said she hopes to keep the college
        focused on its mission: providing high-quality graduate
        and undergraduate programs, sustaining research and
        reaching out to the community. </p>
        <p>''We will be challenged in the forseeable future,''
        she said. ''But I don't want to see the mission change
        because we're going through a bad patch.'' </p>

        <p>Relieving stress and creating personal time have
        become the mantra of the 90s. </p>
        <p>There are devices and potions to aid you in your quest
        for stress reduction. In every bookstore, there are
        self-improvement books aimed at relieving tension, but
        let's face it, we're too busy to read them. </p>
        <p>We're hauling the kids to and from ball practice.
        We're grocery shopping and meal planning. We're cleaning
        the house, parenting and trying to maintain our
        friendships. Not to mention working. </p>
        <p>Creating personal time -- time to reconnect the mind
        and body -- is one of the biggest challenges we face --
        especially for women. </p>
        <p>Pamela J. Free, author of ''Come Home To Your Body''
        writes, ''Body, mind and spirit all must be connected and
        acknowledged in our daily lives for us to feel joy and
        inner peace, health and vitality.'' </p>
        <p>Finding and enjoying personal time can help us lead
        more focused and creative lives. </p>
        <p>Massage and meditation are two methods some people use
        to balance the needs of mind and body. </p>
        <p><b><img src="../../images/logos/resolvelogo.gif"
        alt="I Resolve" align="left" hspace="7" vspace="7"
        width="177" height="203"></b><b>Massage</b>. ''Part of
        massage is training your mind not to react to stress in
        the same old ways,'' says Teresa Holley, state
        chairperson of the Tennessee Massage Therapy Association
        and owner of Knoxville's Healing Touch Therapeutic
        Massage. </p>
        <p>''Stress can make you sick in so many ways,'' says
        Holley, ''massage helps you cope with everyday stimuli in
        a healthy way.'' </p>
        <p>Massage is the manipulation of tissues by rubbing,
        stroking or kneading, either with the hands or other
        instruments for remedial or therapeutic purposes.
        Different massage techniques are used for a variety of
        needs. </p>
        <p>Holley cites recent research from the University of
        Miami that suggests, massage is critical to the
        development of infants, an improved sense of well-being
        and belonging among the elderly, and adjunct to good
        health in all people. </p>
        <p>An on-site massage, generally a five to 15 minute
        massage at work, helps keep you alert and focused.
        Companies are beginning to recognize the advantages that
        an on-site massage can offer employees. Holley says the
        purpose of the on-site massage is to eliminate the
        problems the body has worked itself into during the
        course of a day. These range in cost from about $5 to
        $15. On-site massages are given to fully-clothed clients
        on a special chair. </p>
        <p>Someone balancing the rigors of work and family who
        has lots of decision-making responsibilities may enjoy a
        relaxation massage. This type would be given at a spa or
        salon. Holley says the relaxation massage generally lasts
        from 30 minutes to an hour and in Knoxville ranges in
        price from $30 to $50 depending on the business and the
        length of the session. This type is a ''table'' massage
        with the client lying in a relaxed position. </p>
        <p>For herself, Holley likes a deep tissue massage. It's
        more intense than the relaxation massage. She generally
        indulges herself once or twice a month. She says an
        enhanced immune system, a more alert mind, and an
        improved mental image are a few of the benefits. </p>
        <p>According to Holley, a mid-week massage, ''catches you
        when you are starting to feel taxed by all the things you
        have to do. It relaxes you and gets you through the
        week.'' </p>
        <p>As of 1996, any massage therapist providing massages
        for compensation without a Tennessee license is in
        violation of the law. To verify a license call the
        Massage Licensure Board at (615) 532-5083. </p>
        <p><b>Meditation</b>. ''Meditation increases our
        awareness of the continuity of body, mind and spirit. It
        brings us home to these three essential aspects of
        being,'' says Dr. Joan Harrigan, a clinical psychologist
        in private practice in Knoxville and Oak Ridge. She is
        also a meditation instructor. </p>
        <p>She says, ''We sometimes tend to polarize the body,
        mind and soul as if they were separate, in reality, to
        me, they exist on a continuum.'' </p>
        <p>Harrigan describes meditation as the ability to
        concentrate the mind ''so that the individual is
        simultaneously calm and alert.'' She describes this
        feeling as ''a peaceful inner awareness.'' </p>
        <p>There is a form of meditation practiced by every
        religious tradition, according to Harrigan. For example
        the eastern tradition known as meditation is often called
        contemplation in the Christian tradition. </p>
        <p>''The human being by nature loves to experience the
        meditative state,'' Harrigan says, ''we experience it
        quite spontaneously while engaged in activities that we
        love.'' The skill, she says, comes from the ability to
        meditate at will. </p>
        <p>Meditation begins by relaxing the body, then by
        regulating the breathing. Then focus inward on the mind.
        Harrigan says meditation is a step-by-step process. </p>
        <p>''The key,'' she says, ''is the breathing and
        regulating it. A simple breath awareness is an easy way
        to begin to learn how to meditate. Sit quietly and be
        aware of the blow of the breath. </p>
        <p>''It's very helpful to select an appropriate
        contemplation device,'' says Harrigan. ''People often use
        a word or phrase such as peace or love...This steadies
        the mind and gives it a focus.'' </p>
        <p>The new focus moves the ''mental chatter, instant
        replays of yesterday, and previews of tomorrow'' to the
        mind's background. This allows the mind to focus on the
        point of contemplation. </p>
        <p>Ultimately, she says, an experienced mediator is able
        to go beyond the contents of the mind and hover in the
        peaceful stillness found in that state. </p>
        <p>There is, she says, an increased awareness. ''It is
        tremendously refreshing, comforting and,'' she hesitates,
        ''blessed.'' </p>
        <p>The practice, says Harrigan, who conducts periodic
        seminars in Vedanta meditation, an Indian approach, is
        effective in managing high blood pressure, stress, and
        anxiety. It reduces recovery time from physical trauma,
        helps relieve headaches, and phobic reactions. It also
        increases self-awareness, self-acceptance and
        concentration. </p>
        <p>Harrigan says she makes time to meditate, usually in
        the evening before bed. Choose a quiet, uninterrupted
        place. </p>
        <p>''I recommend to students that they select a place to
        use every time they meditate so that it becomes
        associated with a peaceful, open state of awareness.'' </p>
        <p>Meditation has to be made a priority, she says, and it
        isn't for everyone. Harrigan suggests students try it
        before making up their minds. There are many books on the
        market about different philosophies of meditation. For

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Rebecca Simmons News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">B</FONT>ath pillows, scented candles, luxurious shower gels --  it&#39;s all about pampering, relaxation and the union of body, mind, and soul.
<P>   Everyone is moving at such a fast pace that the home, and often the bathroom, becomes an oasis of retreat from hectic schedules. 
<P>   For those who cannot afford a day spa complete with massage and mud pack, there are alternatives.
<P>   Some people enjoy relaxing after a hard day with a tub bath. 
<P>  But, &#39;&#39;It&#39;s hard to relax when someone is pounding on the door or passing a note under it,&#39;&#39; says Tia Needham, who with her husband Ron, own and operate Little Sisters Gifts in the Old City, &#39;&#39;...but those critters (her children) go to bed sooner or later.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Needham says she waits for the children to go to school or to bed before she indulges in her daily bath ritual.
<P>   At Little Sisters Gifts, the Needhams&#39; have one of the area&#39;s largest selections of incense in a wide variety of flavors.
<P>   Needham likes to experiment with different fragrance combinations in her bath. It&#39;s all part of aromatherapy -- using essential oils from flowers and herbs to heal the body and psyche. Aromatherapy tools can be in different forms from candles and incense to oils.
<P>   She says one of her favorites, the combination of peppermint and lavender oils in the bath, is invigorating. To relieve stress, she recommends eucalyptus, peppermint and lemon grass. The combination, she says, will clear your head and improve breathing.
<P>   But according to Needham, nothing &#39;&#39;says home&#39;&#39; like spice scents. She likes cinnamon and vanilla. 
<P>  The tub should be filled with warm, not hot, water. According to &#39;&#39;Blended Beauty&#39;&#39; by Philip B., &#39;&#39;Exposing your skin to hot water and then going out in the windy, cold air will dry and chap skin,&#39;&#39; in the winter time. 
<P>   Use bath salts or bath pearls to help smooth the skin. A bubble bath is fun with toys for adults like fruit-shaped sponges that can be used in place of a cloth. 
<P>   Set aside one hour for your bath so you won&#39;t feel rushed. Light scented candles or burn incense. Put on soft relaxation music like sounds from the Rainforest or Pachelbel with Ocean Sounds. 
<P>   Ease into a bubble bath and use a bath pillow to support your head. Bath pillows are sold in specialty shops, but a folded towel will also work. 
<P>   Lather up with a mesh sponge or exfoliating gloves using your favorite scented shower gel. 
<P>   Use a tub rack for all those bath essentials to keep them from falling in the water or on the floor. It extends to both sides of the tube and hangs over the water. For those people who like to read in the bath, it keeps glasses, books and magazines dry. 
<P>   Remember to breathe deeply while relaxing in the bath to release tension in the shoulders. 
<P>   After bathing, discover the pleasure of slipping into a comfortable robe made of terry cloth or chenille.
<P>   To seal in the skin&#39;s moisture, use a creamy body lotion after each bath or shower and a facial moisturizer. While the skin is still soft, use a pumice stone to get rid of those rough spots on the feet and elbows.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By The Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT>ORT CAMPBELL, Ky. -- A group of civilians, who work on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell, have hired a lawyer and say they plan to sue to block collection of a Kentucky tax they claim is unfair.
<P>    The base straddles the Tennessee-Kentucky border. A recent effort by Kentucky&#39;s Revenue Cabinet to crack down on Tennessee residents who work on the Kentucky side of the base but don&#39;t pay Kentucky income taxes has prompted protests from the workers. Until about a month ago, many of the Tennesseans had been able to dodge the state&#39;s income tax.
<P>    About 2,000 civilian employees who live in Tennessee but work in Kentucky owe Kentucky income tax. But Tennessee residents who work in Tennessee pay no income tax because the Volunteer State doesn&#39;t have one.
<P>    Military personnel do not pay the tax.
<P>    The tax issue literally divides Fort Campbell. The airfield, most of the public school buildings and many training facilities are in Kentucky.
<P>    Anytime there is talk of moving an office at Fort Campbell, anxious Tennessee residents fear having to pay the tax that Kentucky has collected for 42 years.
<P>    Conversely, there is jubilation when an office moves from Kentucky to Tennessee and the paycheck deduction disappears. Moving just a few feet can add thousands of dollars a year to a paycheck.
<P>    The cabinet has cracked down on those who have avoided the tax. It has notified dozens of Fort Campbell employees that they owe back taxes, according to leaders of a group opposed to the tax.
<P>    In recent months, Revenue Cabinet auditors have reviewed Fort Campbell&#39;s payroll records, and the agency has begun billing scofflaws for back taxes, interest and penalties, according to leaders of Concerned Citizens of Tennessee.
<P>    One worker was assessed $14,000, said George Kaelin of Clarksville, an air traffic controller at Campbell Army Airfield and one of the leaders.
<P>    Kaelin said the mandatory withholding will cost him $150 a month.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Kentucky takes income tax from me, yet makes me pay out-of-state college tuition and out-of-state fees for fishing and hunting and boating licenses. It&#39;s as unfair as you can get.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Citing state confidentiality laws, Revenue Cabinet spokeswoman Janis Stewart said she could not confirm or deny an investigation but said there is &#39;&#39;not a program targeting anyone at Fort Campbell.&#39;&#39;
<P>    About 400 of the Tennesseans vow to challenge the tax in court. Worth Lovett of Clarksville, a teacher at a post school who says he has grudgingly paid the tax, said he expects as many as 800 Fort Campbell workers may join a class-action suit.
<P>    He said the group intends to ask a Kentucky judge to exempt Tennessee residents, or if that effort fails, to limit the number of years the state could recover any back taxes.
<P>    Kentucky has reciprocal agreements with most border states so that people who commute across state lines to work are taxed in just one state. But because Tennessee has no income tax, there is no reciprocity.

		<FONT SIZE="6"><B>Trail open to disabled via all-terrain wheelchairs</B></font><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By The Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- Rangers didn&#39;t want to pave the woodsy trail circling Radnor Lake. But how could disabled folks use it otherwise?
<P>   The answer: all-terrain wheelchairs.
<P>   Two new ones are now available for free at the state natural area.
<P>   &#39;&#39;As long as the weather is reasonable, you can take them out,&#39;&#39; said Mike Carlton, manager of Radnor Lake State Natural Area.
<P>   Carlton, who has negotiated the 2.6-mile trail in one of the chairs, said the deep-grooved tires -- much like mountain bike tires -- allow the chairs to make it through the wood chips that cover the trail.
<P>   And the front ends lift up to move over small sticks in the way.
<P>   Donations made the project possible. Columbia-HCA gave the money to rework parts of the trail and build a new bridge, Carlton said. Xerox paid for the two chairs.
<P>   A third chair had been bought earlier by Friends of Radnor.
<P>   &#39;&#39;This way people can get out and see the birds and the colors of the trees and not expend too much energy for it to be pleasurable,&#39;&#39; said Will Clark, an employee of Holland Medical Equipment.
<P>   He said he has been out to Radnor, but trying to get around the trail in his own wheelchair is too difficult.
<P>   The two nonmotorized chairs, which Carlton said his company sold at a substantial discount, make it possible. And the chairs don&#39;t have to be pushed, so a visitor can be independent.
<P>   Reworking the lake trail, which included some route changes to make it more level, was critical, too.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The old bridge was too narrow. It would bark the skin off your knuckles,&#39;&#39; Carlton added.
<P>   Floyd Stewart Jr., 48, said he is pleased to have a chance now to make the lake loop -- and is glad to do it without the help of asphalt.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We just can&#39;t go in and pave every nook and cranny,&#39;&#39; said Stewart, who became a quadriplegic after his neck was broken in a car wreck almost 13 years ago.
<P>   Taking advantage of technology to go out in nature the way others have at Radnor -- on a wood chip-lined trail -- is a boon, he said.
<P>   An employee at the nonprofit Center for Independent Living, Stewart said paved trails also have their place and that the disabled need to be able to get into the out-of-doors.
<P>   Already some special education classes have come to take the Radnor trail and watch canvasback, bufflehead and other ducks found on the lake at this time of year, Carlton said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Kids who wouldn&#39;t normally be able to go around the lake trail can now go around it,&#39;&#39; he said.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">K</FONT>INGSPORT -- Most people in the 1st District know how to get to the congressman&#39;s office. Now, the new congressman will be finding his way there.
<P>    Bill Jenkins will move into the same Kingsport office that retiring Rep. Jimmy Quillen used for three decades.
<P>    &#39;&#39;People kept telling me they knew how to get there,&#39;&#39; Jenkins said.
<P>    The move will officially occur when Jenkins takes the oath of office Tuesday, Jan. 7.
<P>    Jenkins, a former Tennessee Valley Authority board member and most recently a Circuit Court judge in Rogersville, said he decided to make Quillen&#39;s quarters in the Kingsport Post Office his own after consulting with constituents.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We are going to remain in the Kingsport office at least on a temporary basis,&#39;&#39; said Jenkins, a Republican from Rogersville.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We may make it permanent. After talking to the General Services Administration, we found that for cost and space, we would be better off staying in the Kingsport office.&#39;&#39;
<P>    He said the public&#39;s familiarity with the Kingsport office was also a deciding factor in his plans to make Kingsport the location of his district office.
<P>    He said he is looking at opening a second field office in one of the counties in the western end of the district.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We know there are some counties that will be willing to make some space available to us for a rotating office,&#39;&#39; Jenkins said.
<P>    Jenkins has also named Bill Snodgrass, a former consultant with the state Department of Education and a one-time adjunct faculty member at East Tennessee State University, as the director of his field office.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Our goal for the field office is to continue the excellent work done by Congressman Quillen&#39;s staff,&#39;&#39; Jenkins said.
<P>    Jenkins said Snodgrass&#39; &#39;&#39;exemplary professional credentials and experience make him an excellent choice&#39;&#39; to serve as his field representative.

<P>
<P>
<P>   A South Knoxville couple fought with a burglar in their home early Wednesday morning, according to a Knoxville Police Department report.
<P>   The 69-year-old husband, Cliff D. Bridges, told officers he was awakened by his wife&#39;s screams and discovered a man in the bedroom. During the ensuing scuffle, the husband was bitten on the stomach, and his wife, who was not identified in the report, was struck in the face.
<P>   The burglar, who escaped with about $100, had apparently broke into the Stratford Road home by prying open a front window, the police report stated. The victims were treated at Baptist Hospital of East Tennessee.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Man, 33, killed by train ID&#39;d as Etowah resident </h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>   A man struck and killed by a train in Northwest Knox County was identified Wednesday as a 33-year-old Etowah, Tenn., resident.
<P>   Terry Martin Thompson died about 4:30 a.m. Tuesday when a train struck him near the intersection of Amherst and Piney Grove Church roads. The Knox County Sheriff&#39;s Department released his name Wednesday morning.
<P>   The train engineer saw Martin sitting on the tracks and repeatedly sounded his whistle. He slowed the train but could not avoid the man.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Two employees on leave after Nashville drowning </h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>   NASHVILLE -- A group home has placed two employees on administrative leave following the bathtub drowning of a 20-year-old woman resident.
<P>   Nashville&#39;s medical examiner has ruled the weekend death of Vikki Sublett accidental. But the Open Arms Care Corp. has placed two of its employees on leave without pay while conducting an internal investigation.
<P>   The home houses people with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities.
<P>   Sublett was found floating in a bathtub at about 11 p.m. Saturday by an employee, the police report said.
<P>   Attempts were made to resuscitate Sublett. She was taken to Southern Hills Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.
<P>   &#39;&#39;This is just a terrible tragedy, an unfortunate tragedy and something we have never experienced before and hope to never experience again,&#39;&#39; said Brian Durbin, administrator of the 6-year-old facility housing 64 men and women.
<P>   The home has notified the state departments of Human Services and Mental Health and Mental Retardation about the death.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>UT administrator struck, cut by man with knife</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   A University of Tennessee administrator and community activist told police he was attacked Tuesday by a knife-wielding assailant.
<P>   Dennie Littlejohn, 49, a manager in UT&#39;s space and facilities management department, was treated and released at the University of Tennessee Medical Center.
<P>   According to a Knoxville Police Department report, Littlejohn said he was at an apartment on Townview Drive when someone knocked at the door between 4 and 4:30 p.m.
<P>   Littlejohn stated when he opened the door, his assailant, a 55-year-old man, charged him, knocked him down, cut him on the arm and back with a knife and struck him in the face and head, the report stated.
<P>   No motive for the attack was stated in the report. The alleged assailant was identified, and Littlejohn was advised how to obtain a warrant and prosecute.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Prehistoric Indian bones discovered at state park</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>   NASHVILLE -- State Archaeologist Nick Fielder believes bones found in Long Hunter State Park are those of a prehistoric Indian.
<P>   The bones were found Tuesday near the shore of Percy Priest Lake in the park east of Nashville.
<P>   Fielder said he believes the lake may cover part of an ancient Indian burial ground.
<P>   A partial jaw, lower leg and tooth were found by a couple and a child.
<P>   Fielder said he will search for more remains at the site.

		<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>EW YORK (AP) -- AT&T Corp., hoping to be more nimble by streamlining itself, completed its three-way split with the spin-off of computer marker NCR Corp.
<P>    AT&T said Wednesday that it completed its restructuring with the distribution of 101 million shares of NCR common stock to AT&T shareholders.
<P>    As previously announced, those holding shares of the world&#39;s biggest long-distance company on Dec. 13 received 1 share of NCR for each 16 shares of AT&T they hold.
<P>    NCR was acquired by AT&T in 1991. Then, in an effort to improve its agility in an increasingly competitive telecommunications market, AT&T announced in September 1995 it would divide itself.
<P>    First, it spun off its equipment business into a company called Lucent Technologies Inc. Then, it decided to make NCR -- AT&T&#39;s attempt to make become a player in computer manufacturing -- a separate entity on Dec. 31.
<P>    AT&T also sold a majority position in AT&T Capital Corp. to a consortium of investors.

		<h3>Earl apologizes, returns to LSU basketball team </h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   Highly touted freshman <B>Lester Earl </B>is back on the LSU basketball team after quitting for two days.
<P>    Earl quit on Sunday, apologized Tuesday and rejoined practice Wednesday.
<P>    Coach <B>Dale Brown </B>interrupted practice 30 minutes after it began Tuesday to let Earl apologize to his teammates for leaving. He spoke to teammates on the court and watched practice for a few minutes, but would not talk to reporters.
<P>    Brown said Earl had come to him to apologize earlier, saying he felt that he had been selfish -- not as a player, but as a person.
<P>    He quoted Earl as saying he was very disappointed in his own play, especially against Fresno State, which LSU upset 79-75 on Sunday.
<P>    He scored a game-high 23 points, but played only five minutes in the second half, when the Tigers rallied from a 22-point deficit.
<P>    &#39;&#39;He said he should have been more receptive to the team&#39;s feelings for the great win and how well people played and he&#39;s really sorry about it,&#39;&#39; Brown said.
<P>    Brown said Earl will not start in Saturday&#39;s SEC opener at Mississippi State.
<P>    Brown and Earl&#39;s older brother and teammate, <B>Louis Earl,</B> said the Parade All-American&#39;s frustration has been building because of inconsistent play this year.
<P>    He was second on the team in average minutes played (26.6) and in scoring (9.3) and third in rebounding (5.7), but had been accustomed to more at Glen Oaks High in Baton Rouge, which he led to three consecutive state  championships.
<P>    Colorado freshman guard <B>Allen Barksdale,</B> also from Baton Rouge, attended Tuesday&#39;s practice and said he is planning to transfer to LSU. Barksdale said he has left Colorado, and LSU is trying to determine when he is eligible to practice.
<P>    If he transfers, Barksdale could not play for LSU for one calendar year.
<P>
<P><h3>NFL</h3>
<P>
<P>* Vanderbilt University Medical Center has decided against competing for a contract to be the sports medicine provider for the Houston Oilers when the team moves to Nashville. Vanderbilt decided it could not be competitive with bids from Baptist Hospital and Columbia-HCA Healthcare Corp.
<P>
<P><h3>Hockey</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>Victor Gervais </B>of the Hampton Roads Admirals was selected the East Coast Hockey League player of the week after contributing two goals and six assists in a 2-0-1 week for his team. <B>Jim Brown </B>of the Knoxville Cherokees was nominated after getting three goals and six assists in four games.
<P>* Goaltender <B>Guy Hebert </B>of the Anaheim Might Ducks bested <B>John Vanbiesbrouck </B>of Florida, stopping 28 shots for his 13th career shutout as Anaheim beat the Panthers 3-0. It was Hebert&#39;s fourth shutout of the season, tying his career best set last season.
<P>* <B>Jeremy Roenick,</B> who had 267 goals and 329 assists in eight seasons with the Chicago Blackhawks, returns to play in Chicago tonight for the first time since he became a free-agent signee with the Phoenix Coyotes.
<P>
<P><h3>Tennis</h3>
<P>
<P>* <B>Justin Gimselstob </B>and <B>Chanda Rubin </B>scored a dramatic mixed doubles victory to lift the U.S. to a 2-1 victory over defending champion Croatia in a Hopman Cup match in Perth, Australia. Rubin beat <B>Iva Majoli </B>6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-3) in  women&#39;s singles before <B>Goran Ivanisevic,</B> ranked No. 4 in the world, downed Gimelstob 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-5. Then Gimelstob teamed with Rubin to win the decisive doubles 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (9-7). The victory gave the U.S. a 2-0 record in the round-robin tournament and it can earn a spot in the final by beating Australia tonight.
<P>* Russia&#39;s <B>Andrei Cherkasov,</B> given a controversial wild-card berth when defending champion <B>Yevgeny Kafelnikov </B>asked for him to be included, beat Australia&#39;s <B>Patrick Rafter </B>6-2, 7-6 (15-13) in the second round of the Australian Hardcourt championship. Cherkasov, ranked 149th in the world, is Kafelnikov&#39;s training partner.
<P>* Britain&#39;s <B>Tim Henman,</B> ranked 29th in the world, advanced to the quarterfinals of the $635,000 Qatar Open with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Egyptian qualifier <B>Tamer El Sawy</B>. <B>Thomas Muster </B>is top-seeded in the event.
<P>* Defending champion <B>Sandra Cacic </B>of the U.S. advanced to the quarterfinals of the New Zealand Classic, beating third-seeded compatriot <B>Linda Harvey-Wild </B>6-4, 7-5. Top-seeded <B>Anke Huber </B>of Germany also advanced, beating <B>Ann Grossman </B>of the U.S. 6-4, 6-2.
<P>* Top-seeded <B>Brenda Schultz-McCarthy </B>of the Netherlands beat compatriot <B>Miriam Oremans </B>7-6 (7-5), 6-0 in the second round of the Gold Coast Classic in Australia.
<P>
<P><h3>Track and field</h3>
<P>
<P>* Olympic 100-meter champion <B>Donovan Bailey </B>says he has been slighted by the American media. He is upset that he didn&#39;t receive a single vote for AP male athlete of the year. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s just the total ignorance of Americans,&#39;&#39; Bailey said. &#39;&#39;They think they&#39;re the world. They don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in the rest of society.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT size="2"><I>By John Stiles, News-Sentinel state editor</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Environmental Protection Agency has agreed to &#39;&#39;review&#39;&#39; a variance for Champion International&#39;s wastewater permit, a good start to the New Year for supporters of the Pigeon River who rallied Wednesday, vowing to see the stream flow clear.
<P>   In a letter to Tennessee Attorney General Charles Burson, John H. Hankinson Jr., Region IV administrator wrote Tuesday: &#39;&#39;I will review whether additional actions are necessary in view of the new information in your letter.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Burson, on instructions from Gov. Don Sundquist, had written EPA criticizing the federal agency for granting a variance to the Clean Water Act that allows the North Carolina paper mill to dump tea-colored water into the river.
<P>   Hankinson wrote that the EPA will review Burson&#39;s contentions about errors in the manner in which EPA issued the permit.
<P>   Also Tuesday, EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner, in a letter to Burson, pledged to &#39;&#39;work closely&#39;&#39; with Sundquist.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I believe it is critical to honor the choices made by a state to protect its health and environment through the federal backstop created by the Clean Water Act,&#39;&#39; she wrote.
<P>   Hankinson also wrote that he will meet in Nashville on Tuesday, Jan. 14, with the Tennessee Environmental Council to discuss the issue.
<P>   The council is comprised of 44 environmental organizations that deal mainly with air and water issues, Alan Jones, executive director, said.
<P>   Browner&#39;s letter to Burson came one day after Vice President Al Gore told her to &#39;&#39;carefully review&#39;&#39; Tennessee&#39;s objections.
<P>   On Tuesday night the Dead Pigeon River Council gathered with other proponents of a clean river and renewed their pledge to pressure the EPA to force Champion to stop polluting the river.
<P>   An organizer, Gay Webb, said the council has been battling Champion for 10 years, and the New Year&#39;s Eve rally was to &#39;&#39;rededicate&#39;&#39; supporters.
<P>   Also Tuesday, the Tennessee Environmental Council took EPA to task for granting the variance.
<P>   Champion&#39;s paper mill in Canton, N.C., last week was awarded a variance to its wastewater permit by North Carolina. The variance calls for water to be monitored at the state line some 37 miles downstream from the plant at the Tennessee-North Carolina line.
<P>   Lifelong residents of Cocke County, Tenn., where the river flows into the state, say the water often is tea-colored and has an odor. They say it&#39;s time Champion was required to measure the color at the plant.
<P>   Supporters in recent weeks have become increasingly critical of politicians who have promised to take action on their behalf.
<P>   The waters of the Pigeon River empty into Douglas Lake and eventually make their way into Knoxville in the Tennessee River.

        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">N</font>ASHVILLE -- Eleven lawyers applied
        to become Tennessee's attorney general by the New Year's
        Eve deadline set by the state Supreme Court, which will
        pick among them in a new and more open selection process.
        </p>
        <p>If the court wants on-the-job experience, it can look
        to three lawyers who have already served as top aides to
        Tennessee attorneys general. They are Patsy Cottrell, the
        current chief deputy attorney general, and two men who
        previously held similar posts -- John Knox Walkup and
        William Hubbard, both now practicing law in Nashville. </p>
        <p>At least three other applicants are well-known to the
        Supreme Court justices and thus rated in speculation as
        strong contenders for succeeding Attorney General Charles
        Burson, who has announced his resignation effective Feb.
        14. They include: </p>
        <p>* Court of Criminal Appeals Judge Paul Summers, a
        former district attorney general from Somerville in West
        Tennessee. </p>
        <p>* Margaret Behm of Nashville, who has chaired the
        Judicial Selection Commission that nominates lawyers for
        appointment as judges by the governor. </p>
        <p>* Shelby Grubbs of Chattanooga, who served as chairman
        of the Supreme Court-appointed Alternate Dispute
        Resolution Committee, a panel that helped develop a
        system for settling squabbles through mediation rather
        than trial. </p>
        <p>Other applicants include Charles Fleischmann,
        president of the Chattanooga Bar Association; Phillip
        Noblett, also a prominent Chattanooga attorney; Michael
        Roden, an assistant U.S. attorney in Nashville; Susan
        Short Jones of Nashville; and Larry Parrish of Memphis,
        who is best-known publicly for leading a crusade for
        anti-pornography legislation in the 1970s. </p>
        <p>By non-binding tradition, the Supreme Court has chosen
        an attorney general who resides in whichever grand
        division region of the state that is home to the fewest
        Supreme Court justices. Currently, that is East
        Tennessee. Only one of the five justices -- Riley
        Anderson of Oak Ridge -- is from the eastern grand
        division. West Tennessee has two -- Justices Lyle Reid of
        Brownsville and recently appointed Janice Holder of
        Memphis. Middle Tennessee also has two -- Chief Justice
        Aldolpho A. Birch and Justice Frank Drowota, both of
        Nashville. </p>
        <p>There is also much speculation that the justices would
        like to appoint a woman as attorney general, since only
        men have held the post throughout Tennessee history and
        four of the five justices are male. </p>
        <p>In the past, the court has picked attorneys general --
        including Burson -- in a secretive, closed-door process.
        Among leading critics of that process has been Knoxville
        Mayor Victor Ashe, who has also pushed to have the
        attorney general chosen by popular vote. Tennessee is the
        only state with an attorney general selected by its state
        Supreme Court. </p>

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Jesse Fox Mayshark, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>t the Interfaith Health Clinic in the 4th and Gill neighborhood, Dr. Rob McDonald and his staff see 1,000 or more working poor patients a month who don&#39;t have health insurance.
<P>   Many adults ask the doctor to give them a physical evaluation so they can apply for a federal disability check. McDonald says no.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I try to point out the importance of working and being productive because a lot of people I know who are on disability wind up becoming quite frustrated and depressed, and they don&#39;t know why,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;But I think it&#39;s because we were meant to work. . . . I have told people right to their face, &#39;I do not like disability because of what it does to you.&#39; &#39;&#39;
<P>    There are two kinds of disability checks: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), paid to adults who have worked but become disabled, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a welfare program for disabled people with little or no work history.
<P>   The Social Security Administration is making changes in both programs this year to assure the checks are given to people who need them, that they&#39;re spent properly and, when possible, that they&#39;re temporary.
<P>   Starting today, the government no longer will pay people for being drug addicts or alcoholics. This summer, some children on SSI -- primarily those classified with attention deficit disorder or other behavioral disabilities -- will face re-evaluations.
<P>   And with 10.8 million Americans drawing $5.1 billion in disability checks each month, the agency wants to do what it can to be sure people don&#39;t draw a check without trying to get better.
<P>   Tom Margenau, a spokesman at the Social Security Administration&#39;s headquarters in Baltimore, said the agency is considering proposals to get more people off disability and back to work.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve frankly stated that we haven&#39;t done a very good job of that in the past, and the statistics bear that out,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>
<P>Will to work?
<P>
<P>   Margenau said only 1 to 2 percent of people approved for disability leave the program because they find full-time work.
<P>   In many cases, people are permanently disabled and unemployable.
<P>   But officials think a lot of people currently on disability could be retrained for work if they&#39;re willing.
<P>   &#39;&#39;If they&#39;re interested, we will take them,&#39;&#39; said Bruce Brown, a field director for the state&#39;s Vocational Rehabilitation program. &#39;&#39;But &#39;if they&#39;re interested&#39; is the $64,000 question. A lot of times they&#39;re not.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Jim Rovere, Social Security district manager for Knox, Loudon, Sevier and Union counties, said his office refers disability applicants to Vocational Rehabilitation if there&#39;s a chance they can be retrained.
<P>   He said many people with physical disabilities can no longer do manual labor but could learn other less strenuous skills.
<P>   People on SSDI can have trial work periods of up to nine months during which they still receive their disability checks.
<P>   If they are able to keep &#39;&#39;substantial employment&#39;&#39; after nine months, the disability checks stop.
<P>   But Brown said many people referred to Vocational Rehabilitation don&#39;t participate. He said counselors contact each person at least twice to offer their services.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Since we&#39;re completely a voluntary program, a person has to want our services before we provide them,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   Last year in the entire state, Vocational Rehabilitation offices found full-time employment for just 186 people from SSI or SSDI programs, according to state officials.
<P>   That&#39;s not to say other people on disability don&#39;t work. James Farr, a Social Security fraud investigator, said he often finds people working and not reporting it so they can keep their disability checks.
<P>   They sometimes get caught only because they get cocky.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Sometimes it&#39;s a disgruntled spouse or relative,&#39;&#39; Farr said. &#39;&#39;It could be someone working with that person, and they&#39;re bragging about how they&#39;re ripping off the government.&#39;&#39; 
<P>
<P>Community approach
<P>
<P>   Margenau said the Social Security Administration is looking at a number of ways to get more disabled people to try working.
<P>   For one thing, the agency wants to raise awareness of the trial work period.
<P>   &#39;&#39;(People) are afraid that if they go to work, they&#39;ll automatically lose their benefits,&#39;&#39; Margenau said.
<P>   Also, the adminstration recently put out a request for proposals to coordinate resources in communities to encourage retraining and re-employment.
<P>   One of the companies offering a bid is Maximus, a for-profit social-services agency based in Virginia. Maximus has worked for Social Security before, most recently monitoring the discontinued drug and alcohol disability program.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We would come up with a nationwide list of clients who are receiving these (disability) benefits and who could benefit from vocational rehabilitation services, and then subcontractors would sign up to work with them,&#39;&#39; said Bob Muzzio, project director for Maximus.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We think that has a lot of potential because . . . it&#39;s trying to get people who are on disability into the work force. The focus would be not so much on reassessing (medical conditions) as on finding skills that would match the disability.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Muzzio said Maximus has been successful with a similar program in northern Virginia which matched up welfare recipients with agencies that can help them find employment.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve placed so many clients that we don&#39;t have any clients left on welfare rolls,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   In addition to the money saved by putting more disabled people to work, Brown said a more aggressive rehabilitation program would lift the self-esteem of those receiving the checks.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Someone once said the best therapy is a job. That&#39;s not our official motto, but it&#39;s really true,&#39;&#39; Brown said. &#39;&#39;People can have a physical disability of some sort that they&#39;re eligible (for payments) on, but the real disability would be just feeling so bad about themselves.&#39;&#39;

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ASHVILLE -- About 1,000 families have signed up for Tennessee&#39;s new prepaid college tuition program, and its marketing efforts have not yet begun.
<P>    The state&#39;s new Baccalaureate Education System Trust, or BEST, opens this spring. The program lets Tennesseans pay college tuition costs years ahead of time and at today&#39;s rates.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I think you can call it unrestrained enthusiasm. I get asked about it two or three times a day,&#39;&#39; said state Treasurer Steve Adams, who will direct BEST.
<P>    At least 22 states have started some form of the college savings plan.
<P>    Earlier this year, Congress provided an attractive tax incentive for them.
<P>    Parents, grandparents or friends can buy tuition credits at today&#39;s rates for future students, even while they are infants. The money goes into what amounts to a state-administered mutual fund.
<P>    State money managers, accustomed to handling huge pension investments, usually produce a return on the funds greater than the growth of college tuition rates.
<P>    Tennessee pension fund investments have grown at a rate of almost 10 percent over the past decade while tuition rates have increased about 5 percent.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I hope that the fact that the state is managing this fund gives people some confidence that this is not a fly-by-night scheme, but something that is going to be around for a long time. It gives people a chance at a child&#39;s early age to identify and plan for the opportunities for kids to go to college,&#39;&#39; Adams said.
<P>    Congress settled a long legal dispute this year by allowing gains on the investment to be deferred until a student uses the credits. The student, not the purchaser, becomes liable for the tax in a presumably low tax bracket. In private investment funds that might be used for the same purpose, gains are taxed annually to the purchaser, reducing appreciation of the fund.
<P>    Tennessee tuition credits will be priced at about $22.50 each at the start, with 100 credits producing the annual average tuition at state universities, community colleges and technical schools. Tennessee purchasers can buy up to 1,500 credits in case the student decides to attend a more expensive private school or use them for graduate work. The credits can be used at any accredited school anywhere in the country.
<P>    The Legislature approved the prepaid tuition plan last spring, and an oversight committee approved its operating rules in mid-December.
<P>    Officials are working on a marketing plan to launch sales by April.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Steve Baker, Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>ost Tennesseans had never heard of<B></B> <B>Richard Odom</B> when 1996 began. But as the year played out, the man convicted of murdering a 78-year-old woman played a central role in the biggest news story of the year.
<P>   Odom is the man whose death sentence was appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court. Three of the five justices voted to overturn the sentence, ruling that the law had been wrongly applied in Odom&#39;s case.
<P>   One of those justices -- <B>Penny White </B>-- was up for re-election in August 1996, and the case became a cause for people who feel the judicial system is too soft on criminals.
<P>   In a first for the state Supreme Court, a sitting justice was voted off the bench.
<P>   &#39;&#39;People are tired of soft-on-crime judges who will look for the tiniest of technicalities to let scum go free,&#39;&#39; said <B>John Davies</B>, a Chattanooga man who campaigned for White&#39;s defeat.
<P>   The staffs of TV and radio stations and of newspapers who are members of The Associated Press in Tennessee voted White&#39;s defeat the top news story of 1996.
<P>   White&#39;s election loss beat out some big stories in balloting taken in mid-December. The rest of the top 10:
<P>
<P>F-14 Crash
<P>
<P>   Navy Lt. Cmdr. <B>Stacy Bates </B>had been visiting with his Chattanooga parents before he and another crewman climbed into their F-14 Tomcat for a return flight to California on Jan. 29.
<P>   The fighter climbed steeply from Nashville International Airport before falling into a neighborhood. Three people in a house struck by the jet were killed.
<P>   The Navy probe faulted Bates&#39; squadron commander for not grounding him after a series of mistakes months before the crash. Lawsuits against the Navy have been filed by families of the three victims killed in the house.
<P>
<P>The Oilers
<P>
<P>   After weeks of clandestine meetings, months of negotiating and a referendum, the NFL Houston Oilers are headed to Tennessee, which can count itself a player in the big leagues.
<P>   Memphis, which spent years and thousands of dollars trying to land a team, may well be the first home for the NFL franchise while a stadium is built in Nashville. Oilers owner <B>Bud Adams </B>has pitched the team as a Tennessee team, and said he wants to attract fans from Knoxville, Chattanooga and Huntsville, Ala.
<P>   A new nickname and team colors must be picked. Fans had to buy licenses for their seats in the new stadium plus tickets to the games.
<P>
<P>Gary Dockery
<P>
<P>   In 1988, police officer <B>Gary Dockery </B>was answering a call in Walden, Tenn., when he was shot in the head. The brain injury left him mute, motionless and in a nursing home.
<P>   In February 1996 he was moved to a hospital for treatment of pneumonia. His family believes he overheard them discuss whether they should let the pneumonia run its course or risk surgery.
<P>   Suddenly, Dockery began to talk. He described his Jeep, told his sons -- now 20 and 12 -- how much he loved them, recited the names of his horses and recalled camping trips he&#39;d been on.
<P>   Dockery&#39;s story inspired a nation, and especially families with relatives in comas and semi-comatose states. While Dockery didn&#39;t maintain that level of alertness, doctors say he can follow instructions and has learned to operate a motorized wheelchair by listening to a nurse&#39;s instructions.
<P>
<P>Church Arson
<P>
<P>   When the Inner City Church in Knoxville burned Jan. 8, the nation quickly riveted its attention on a series of arson attacks against black churches.
<P>   The Rev. <B>Jesse Jackson</B> came to its empty parking lot to plead for a unified defense against the attacks.
<P>   A federal task force reported that 22 Tennessee churches had been burned since January 1995, second only to the 29 destroyed in Texas. But only nine of the Tennessee churches had black congregations.
<P>   The outrage may have been re-directed, but it did not subside. Gov. <B>Don Sundquist</B> appointed a task force to devise its own strategy for fighting back. Donations poured in from people who wanted to see churches rise from the ashes.
<P>
<P>Clinton, Gore
<P>
<P>   The &#39;96 presidential election wasn&#39;t supposed to be the big event it became. Republicans made a determined run against President<B> Clinton</B>, some said to send a message to<B> Al Gore </B>that 2000 wouldn&#39;t be a cakewalk.
<P>   There were dozens of visits to Tennessee by <B>Bob Dole</B>, <B>Jack Kemp</B>, Clinton and Gore, who often took the opportunity to spend the night at his home in Carthage, Tenn.
<P>   In the end, the margin wasn&#39;t as close as expected. Clinton and Gore won four more years.
<P>
<P>Welfare Reform
<P>
<P>   Welfare reform proposed by Gov. Sundquist became effective in September, setting an 18-month limit on aid payments.
<P>   Recipients now are recertified every six months to ensure their job status and earnings haven&#39;t changed.
<P>    To help welfare recipients get work, the state has begun such programs as Fresh Start classes. Most recipients are required to take the four-week classes to increase their self-esteem, motivation and preparation for the job market.
<P>
<P>Watts Bar
<P>
<P>   Twenty-three years and $7 billion after appearing on the Tennessee Valley Authority&#39;s drawing boards, the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant in Spring City, Tenn., is producing power.
<P>   It is the last reactor on line from the agency&#39;s grand plans of the 1970s to build a network of 17 nuclear power reactors. TVA ended with five, and they produce enough power to run a million homes.
<P>
<P>The Ocoee Olympics
<P>
<P>   Cities spend millions competing for the Olympics, and when Atlanta won the &#39;96 Summer Games, some of the good fortune spilled into Tennessee.
<P>   The kayak and canoe competitions were held on the Ocoee River in the southeastern corner of the state.
<P>   Four years of preparation went into the week&#39;s activities that drew 42,000 visitors and 134 competitors from 30 countries.
<P>
<P>Lamar Alexander
<P>
<P>   The former Tennessee Republican governor&#39;s race for president didn&#39;t succeed, but it probably paved the way for another <B>Lamar Alexander</B> candidacy in 2000.
<P>   Alexander, who also was president of the University of Tennessee and U.S. secretary of education under President <B>George Bush</B>, may have company. Republicans are promoting the chances of Sen. <B>Fred Thompson</B>, R-Tenn. The lawyer-actor won a full six-year term in 1996 and has a recognizable face.

<P>   My child, 10, thinks she is too fat. How can I help her lose weight without interferring with her ideal growth and development?
<P><B>A.</B>
<P>    More children are overweight now than at any other time in our nation&#39;s history. To their credit, they are expressing interest in losing the extra pounds.
<P>   Parents should encourage children to make healthy food choices -- at home and when eating at restaurants and school cafeterias. The Food Guide Pyramid offers a suitable eating pattern for children as well as adults.
<P>   Besides known health benefits of physical activity, exercise also provides children with opportunities for fun, social interaction and skill development. Substitute active play for television viewing and other sedentary activities, such as computer and video activities. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends those activities be limited to one to two hours a day.
<P>   Parents need to be good role models and make healthy choices themselves.   Success in helping children develop healthy lifestyles depends on promoting good nutrition and providing physical activities they enjoy.

<P>
<P>   TAZEWELL -- A fire destroyed two apartments and a Claiborne County newspaper&#39;s offices Tuesday, authorities said.
<P>   The early morning blaze heavily damaged the offices of the Claiborne Progress.
<P>   The blaze may have started in one of the apartments, authorities said.
<P>   The newspaper&#39;s archives also were heavily damaged.
<P>   Some of the archives that were destroyed had been spared in a fire at the newspaper in the 1930s, authorities said.
<P>   The Tazewell-New Tazewell Fire Department was called about 3 a.m. and remained on the site until after noon.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Middle Tennessee man accused of killing pets</h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>   FRANKLIN -- A 20-year-old Lewisburg man has been charged with beating to death five pet chickens and two rabbits.
<P>    Philip McCorkel Jr., also known as Phillip M. McCorkle, is charged with seven counts of intentional killing of an animal.
<P>    General Sessions Judge Al Nations set bond at $500 when McCorkel made a brief court appearance Friday.
<P>    A warrant signed by Animal Control Officer Bobbi Zupan said McCorkel went to the rural Williamson County home of Tammy R. Kelly on Oct. 11 without the owner&#39;s knowledge or consent.
<P>   Once there, he allegedly killed the chickens and rabbits.
<P>    The chickens and rabbits &#39;&#39;were a child&#39;s pets,&#39;&#39; said Judy Ladebauche, director of Williamson County Animal Control.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They were kept in a large fenced area on the back of the property.&#39;&#39;
<P>

<P><h3>Wilson school official sued over payment of ads</h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>   MOUNT JULIET -- A newspaper is suing the Wilson County school superintendent over payment for campaign advertising.
<P>    The Mount Juliet News, a weekly newspaper, claims James Francis has not paid a $254 bill for advertising purchased in mid-July for an August election.
<P>    Francis also may face proceedings from the state Election Commission for failing to disclose a $158 advertising bill on his campaign finance statement, said Martha Ann Sutherland, Wilson County assistant election registrar.
<P>    Sutherland said her office would issue Francis a warning letter giving him 10 days to respond to the omission.
<P>   If Francis fails to file the proper forms within the required time period, it would be a violation of state campaign finance laws, she said.
