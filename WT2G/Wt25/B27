<dd>THIS IS A CHAPTER ABOUT money—what it costs us in good old Yankee dollars to enforce laws against consensual activities. We will not be exploring the cost in human suffering, the cost to our civil rights, the cost of our religious freedom, the cost to our moral character, the cost to our personal safety, or the cost to our human resources. This is a chapter about dollars and lack of sense.
<p>
<dd>We will explore not only what we spend each year enforcing laws against consensual activities, but also what we might gain if we brought the underground economy of consensual activities aboveground.
<p>
<dd>Let's start with what we spend on enforcing laws against consensual activities, and let's start with the easy figures. Because there's a war going on, we get wartime reporting (that is, lots of reporting) on drugs. Tens of millions of dollars are spent each year gathering, compiling, analyzing, and publishing drug statistics. The Department of Justice even has a toll-free number (800–666–3332). At taxpayers' expense, you can have all your questions answered about drug busts, drug laws, and the war on drugs' battle plan. Consequently, what we are spending on the consensual crime of drug use is easy to discover—sort of.

<dd>The obvious figures are: each year we spend $13 billion at the federal level and $16 billion at the state and local levels to catch and incarcerate (and, to a far smaller degree, educate) drug possessors, users, manufacturers, and traffickers. That comes to $29 billion a year.
<p>

If, as reported by the Pentagon, the military spent half a billion dollars from 1980 to 1990 ferreting out homosexuals in its ranks (and we can add that $500,000,000 to the cost of consensual crime enforcement), imagine how much they spend eradicating the far more prevalent consensual activity of drug use.

<p>
<dd>So, all together, what portion of its $260 billion does the Defense Department spend fighting the war on drugs? Let's say a very conservative $7 billion.
<p>
<dd>The war on drugs alone, then, is costing $40 billion per year. What about the rest of the consensual crimes? Here the statistics are not so readily available.
<p>
<dd>In some cases, information is simply not available. In the arrest statistics for consensual crimes, for example, only drug abuse, gambling, prostitution, drunkenness, disorderly conduct, and vagrancy are separated out. Homosexuality, adultery, bigamy, and polygamy are put into a category called sex offenses which includes arrests for any number of nonconsensual sexual activities. Further, consensual crimes are often hidden in other categories. For example, when two people agree to perform a consensual activity, they are sometimes charged with conspiracy to commit a felony. By charging people with conspiracy, the police don't have to prove the people actually did something, only that they conspired to do it. The word conspiracy has some fairly evil connotations. It simply
means, however, agreeing to do something. So, if you agree with another person to engage in drug use, prostitution, sodomy, adultery, gambling, or anything else illegal, you can be arrested for conspiracy. You can also be arrested for conspiring to blow up a building, murder someone, or kidnap a four-year-old. It all goes under the general category of conspiracy to commit a felony. There are other terms that hide consensual crimes. Pandering (the charge Heidi Fleiss was arrested for) and racketeering are two favorites.
<p>
<dd>Then there's the category called All Other Offenses. Dumped into this category are 3,743,200 arrests—22% of the total arrests in 1994. What's in that category? After dozens of phone calls, I discovered the answer: nobody knows. It's a catch-all where violations of all local, state, and federal ordinances that don't fit into the Department of Justice's clear-cut categories are put. How many of those are consensual crimes—and what it cost to enforce them—is anybody's guess.

<p>
<dd>Those who study such things and make professional guesses (expert opinions) estimate that between 4 and 6 million of the 15 million arrests each year are for consensual activities. Let's take the lower end of that range and call it 4 million.
<p>
<dd>We know that in 1994, 1,350,000 of these 4 million arrests were for drug offenses. We also know that the government spent $29 billion on those 1.35 million drug arrests. Therefore, we can conservatively estimate that it spends at least another $10 billion a year on the other million consensual crime arrests, trials, and incarcerations.
<p>
<dd>Adding the $3 billion of foreign aid and the $8 billion spent by the Coast Guard and the military on consensual crimes, it's fair to say that we spend $50 billion a year on prohibiting consensual crimes. In fact, it's almost certainly an understatement.
<p>
<dd>There are innumerable financial costs I'm not including in that $50 billion. Each year, for example, $10 billion in personal property is stolen and never recovered. As we shall see in the chapter, Consensual Crimes Encourage Real Crime, most of these thefts are committed by addicts to pay for the artificially inflated price of their drugs. Many of these thefts involve violence. According to the American Association for Public Health, violence in this country costs nearly $500 billion in medical care and lost productivity.

<p>
<dd>There are two kinds of statistics, wrote Rex Stout, the kind you look up and the kind you make up. When we want to explore how much money the American economy loses each year by keeping the traffic of consensual crimes underground, you can make up as many statistics as I—or any expert—can invent. Surveys asking people to admit to criminal activity are notoriously inaccurate, and statistics given about some future event aren't really statistics, but projections, guesstimates, crystal-ball gazing, and blue-skying. Whether you see Blue Skies or Stormy Weather, it's still a weather forecast and, as Gordy, the weatherman on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, defensively asked, What do you think I can do? Predict the future?
<p>
<dd>Determining how much money is lost to the U.S. economy due to laws against consensual activities requires knowing two things: (a) How big is the underground of consensual crimes? and (b) How much bigger or smaller would this economy become if it were legalized?
<p>
<dd>Determining the size of the underground economy depends on law enforcement estimates and surveys. This is a problem. Law enforcement estimates go up and down depending on what law enforcement wants the estimates to show. When law enforcement wants more money, it gives estimates of crime so severe it would seem that, for the protection of all citizens, leaving one's house should be made illegal. On the other hand, when law enforcement wants to show what a stellar job it is doing, the crime wave of April becomes the pastoral of May.
<p>
<dd>The other way to determine the level of consensual crime activity is through surveys conducted either over the phone, in writing, or in person. Even when surveys are conducted anonymously, the person being surveyed hardly feels anonymous. An organization, after all, had to call or write you. It has your phone number or address. When you go in person to take part in an anonymous survey, you can hardly walk into the interview wearing a ski mask. (As these surveys sometimes take place in federal buildings, you had better not walk in wearing a ski mask.) Whether taking the survey by phone, by mail, or in person, the participant has every reason to believe that his or her identity is not entirely secret. Therefore, when one's responses could have criminal consequences, one
tends to revert to self-protection and, quite simply, lie. Studies that asked about recent drug usage, for example, backed up by urine samples, revealed that only about half the people who had taken drugs (as revealed in the urine samples) admitted in the survey to having taken them.

<dd>What does all this mean? It means we don't know how big the underground economy in consensual crime is. Looking at a number of studies, one begins to get an idea of at least a range of underground commerce. I cannot, however, in good conscience say, Because of this statistic, this study, this report, and this expert's opinion, we know the underground economy is . . . How can one make a prediction without accurate data? And how can we predict the future when we still disagree about the past?
<p>
<dd>For example, although most historians agree that alcohol consumption increased during Prohibition, there is a school of thought that says alcohol consumption decreased during Prohibition, and took quite some time after Prohibition to build up to pre-Prohibition levels. Therefore, to people who believe this claim, Prohibition was a success. This reconstruction of history seems to have been circulated by William Bennett while he was drug czar, as justification for (a) the drug war and (b) his czarship. Others who find it too inconvenient, uncomfortable, or time-consuming to re-evaluate their stance on drugs also bandy about the Prohibition-as-a-success argument.

<dd>This view of history relies on official government statistics on the consumption of alcohol before, during, and after Prohibition. These figures, for the most part, did not track home brewing, bootlegging, allowing grape juice to ferment into wine (Bad, grape juice, bad!), using industrial alcohol for personal consumption, and importing alcohol from Canada, Mexico, and beyond the three-mile limit. About the only alcohol the government officially tracked during Prohibition was alcohol produced for medicinal purposes. While this was used for recreational purposes as well, it certainly did not reflect alcohol's complete recreational use. Prohibition ended as America was in the depths of the depression. Many people couldn't afford food, so it's not surprising they couldn't
afford alcohol. The depression led directly to World War II, where sacrifices and shortages were commonplace, and a good deal of the drinking population (the young men) were shipped overseas where they did their drinking (or at least wanted to). Declaring that Prohibition worked is an example of using official—but drastically incomplete—figures to support a convenient point of view.
<p>
<dd>So, guess along with me as we try to determine what the underground economy in consensual crimes might currently be, what it might become if it were allowed to rise aboveground, and how much we can tax it (without driving it back underground again).

<dd>We know more about the size of the underground of drugs than any other consensual crime. Experts testifying before congressional committees say that $1 trillion in drug money is laundered worldwide each year. It is estimated that 40%, or $400 billion, of this is laundered in the United States. The remaining $600 billion is laundered outside of the United States, but much of that $600 billion either could have originated in the United States, or could have been used by a middleman to purchase drugs bound for the United States. (The U.S. is the #1 licit and illicit drug market in the world.)
<p>
<dd>That's just the amount laundered. Drug money doesn't have to be laundered until some of the big guys want to spend the money in big ways on big things. Smaller amounts of dirty money pass between smaller players all the time. All these cash transactions are not included in the $1 trillion figure of laundered money.
<p>
<dd>Another indication of the plenitude of drugs and the volume of sales is that each time law enforcement announces a new record drug bust in which tons and tons of some illicit substance worth billions of dollars were seized—usually with a comment such as, "At least this poison won't find its way into the schoolyards of America"—the street price for that particular drug does not alter one cent.
<p>
<dd>Another way to estimate the size of the underground drug market would be to look at the value per pound of drugs seized and multiply that by the amount of drugs most experts claim is never detected. We would still get an astronomical figure. We can't pretend, however, that this would be the figure for drug sales if drugs were legal. The only thing that keeps drug prices high is that drugs are illegal. When legal, the marketplace will soon dictate the proper price. That people have been willing to pay outrageously inflated prices for drugs indicates they would also be willing to pay outrageously inflated taxes on drugs.

<dd>To determine the national prostitution economy, we could take the number of arrests and multiply it by the number of clients the average prostitute sees between arrests, and multiply that figure by the average amount the average client contributes (financially, that is), and that would give us a figure. The problem is, most prostitutes I've talked with don't get arrested even once in a given year—most haven't been arrested at all. The number of clients between arrests, then, would be difficult to determine.
<p>
<dd>So what I thought I'd do is compare prostitution to an already aboveground industry that is similar to prostitution. We need to find an industry that projects a friendly image, satisfies a real need at a fair price, is conveniently located, and is designed for rapid turnover. The obvious answer: fast food. McDonald's alone pulls in $21 billion a year; Burger King, $6.4 billion. Even the slogans fit: We do it all for you and Have it your way. Then there's Wendy's (sounds like a bordello, doesn't it?) and Jack-in-the-Box. (I'm not saying a word—and I'm not even going to mention In-N-Out Burger.) Some innovative bordellos might, like the burger chains, offer drive-through service: pick what you want from a large illustrated menu, pay at window #1, pick up your order at window #2.
<p>
<dd>Of course, not everyone wants fast food. So, there are dining places from Big Boy's to Lutece that could be the inspiration for more substantial bordellos.

Also known as the Magic Fingers Kingdom, it could feature such attractions as Wenches of the Caribbean, The Haunted Whore House, The Gay Nineties Dance Hall, Chip and Dale's Chippendale Review, and the Mayflower Madam River Cruise.

Also, if prostitution ever became acceptable, the amount spent on flowers, candy, and greeting cards would probably drop. The loss to these industries would have to be deducted from the increase to the aboveground economy caused by legalizing prostitution. Nevertheless, the economy, overall, would be ahead.

<p>
<dd>And now for the bad news.
<p>
<dd>Much of the $50 billion we're spending to prosecute consensual crimes each year we are, in fact, not just spending but borrowing. The $50 billion gets tossed into our national debt. Since it's already topping $5 trillion, $50 billion more hardly gets noticed.
<p>
<dd>But, noticed or not, the national debt does command our interest—6% interest to be exact. To finance the annual persecution of 4,000,000 Americans and the incarceration 750,000 more, the government sells treasury bills, which pay, as of early 1996, 6% interest per year. Fifty billion borrowed for 30 years at 6% compound interest comes to $250 billion in interest—providing we pay it off in 30 years, of which there is no guarantee.
<p>
<dd>Those who bemoan the harm consensual crimes might do to their children should take a good look at the very real harm that will befall their children when the interest on financing this year's Inquisition comes due somewhere down the pike. For every year we spend $50 billion enforcing laws against consensual activities, we're adding an additional $250 billion to the next generation's pile of inherited woes. That's if interest rates stay at 6%. Every percentage point they go up adds $67 billion to the total bill.
<p>
<dd>None of this, by the way, takes into account how much we're spending to borrow the $150 billion we could be collecting in yearly tax revenues.

<p>
<dd>Rather than spinning our wheels asking what we can do to stop consensual crimes, why not direct all that creative energy toward how we can best spend that $450 billion?
<p>
<dd>Finally, consider that almost every consensual criminal who goes through the criminal justice system and is incarcerated for, say, a year, becomes a permanent negative economic unit. Most people in society are positive economic units—that is, they produce more in goods, services, or ideas than they consume. Negative economic units, however, are a drain on society, the economy, and the nation. An ex-con is essentially unemployable—especially during times of high unemployment. This forces the ex-con—in order to physically survive—to go on welfare, turn to crime, or both. 
Eventually, enough of these negative economic units become an economic black hole that, unseen, sucks the lifeblood from even the most productive economy. By turning ordinary consenting adults into criminals, we are creating millions of economic vampires.
<p>
<dd>We must be very careful that we do not unnecessarily create negative economic units. There will always be the criminals—those who go about physically harming the person and property of others—and they will need to be put away. Paying for this is part of the cost of living in a safe country. Each life destroyed, however, by the arrest, trial, and incarceration of a consensual criminal is an unnecessary permanent liability on our country and our economy. These people simply don't believe in the American dream anymore, know the American system is not fair, and are quite convinced that the entire system doesn't work.

<DD>WHAT THE ENFORCEMENT of laws against consensual activities does to individuals is nothing short of criminal. The government is destroying the very lives of the people it is supposedly saving.
<P>
<DD>A single arrest, even without a conviction, is, in many cases, enough to ruin a life; a conviction and a year in jail are almost guaranteed to. All this, of course, is "for their own good." As the Horace of Spain (1559–1619) wrote, "No pain equals that of an injury inflicted under the pretense of a just punishment."
<P>
<DD>Let's take a look at the process of arrest, trial, conviction, and jail. Please don't think of this as something happening to some "criminal" who "deserves it." Think of it as something happening to you or one of your friends or relatives. If you have ever taken part in any consensual crime, it was luck alone that kept at least some of these things from happening to you.
<P>
<DD>As the song goes: there, but for fortune, go you or I.
<P>
<DD>When you are arrested, you are thrown into a world of violent criminals handled by individuals who are well-trained in treating people like violent criminals. Don't expect that you will be treated any differently. (A friend of our family used to regale us with both horror and laughter at the treatment he received during a consensual crime arrest. After recounting an indignity or personal
violation, he would lift his hands to heaven and say, "Who was I gonna call? The police? They were already there!")

<DD>Prior to—or simultaneously with—the arrest, comes the search.
<P>
<DD>You can be home one evening watching TV when you hear a knock at the door. "Who's there?" you ask, having seen some nicely uniformed police officer in a documentary on crime prevention recommend that you never open your door without knowing who is on the other side.
<P>
<DD>"Open the door. It's the police. We have a warrant to search your premises." This is likely to be the only warning you get before your door is broken down (if a "no-knock" warrant is issued, you won't even get a first knock). The police automatically assume that you are (a) guilty and (b) hurriedly destroying evidence: flushing drugs, pornography, or prostitutes down the toilet. The door
is opened (by you or by them) and, without a moment's hesitation, three or four or five or ten uniformed and/or uninformed police begin going through everything you own.

<P>
<DD>Here a frightening question may cross your mind: how do you know whether these are really police? Answer: you don't. Even if they flash a badge, everyone knows fake badges are readily available. If you have the presence of mind to ask to use the telephone to call the station house to confirm that this is an authorized search, the request will almost certainly be denied.
<P>
<DD>So there you are, surrounded by a group of armed authority figures who are going through everything you own, putting "suspicious" articles into boxes or plastic bags, and you can only hope it's really the police and not some enterprising band of criminals. (On the other hand, maybe one should hope it is a band of criminals—stuff can be replaced; time in prison cannot.)
<P>
<DD>At about this point, you are "Mirandized." Amidst the hub-bub of your fish tank being drained (who knows what you may be hiding under the sand), your toilet being dismantled (lots of room for contraband behind, in, or "down there"), and every container in your kitchen being emptied onto the counter ("This stuff in the oregano jar smells a lot like marijuana"), being read your constitutional
rights sounds something like this: "<I>Mumble mumble</I> you have the right to remain silent <I>mumble mumble</I> right to an attorney <I>mumble mumble</I> can and will be used against you <I>mumble mumble</I> do you understand?" And then, amidst this atmosphere of physical, emotional, and psychological terror, the questioning begins. By this time, often, you will be handcuffed.
<P>
<DD>You are asked about people, incidents, and things going back as far as seven years (the statute of limitation on most felonies). You are asked to remember where you were, who you were with and what you were doing at a particular time, on a particular date. If you're like most people, you don't remember what you had for dinner two weeks ago, much less what you did on a specific date two
years ago, but "not remembering" is treated as a clear indication of "withholding evidence," "interfering with justice," being "uncooperative," and, of course, guilt. If you happen to remember something, anything, these comments will be carefully recorded, and, if you happen to have a more complete recollection later, it will be taken as a sign that "you truly don't have an accurate memory
of the situation" or that you "lied to the police."

<P>
<DD>Once armed with a search warrant, anything the police recover of an "illegal nature" or even a "suspicious nature" is fair game. They can dismantle and destroy anything that might hold any illegal substance—and, considering how compact certain drugs are, this means that they can dismantle and destroy anything. They can take with them any "suspicious substances" for laboratory testing.
This could include the entire contents of your medicine cabinet, kitchen pantry, and garage. Anything that might be used to "document" your criminal activity can be confiscated. This means all files, correspondence, notes, diaries, address books, phone bills, video tapes, audio tapes, and even your computer. If you do business from your home, a police search can put you out of business immediately.
<P>
<DD>Getting back your possessions can take weeks, months, and, in some cases, years. You may find yourself trying to reconstruct your personal and business records from scratch at a time when you need them most—while gathering evidence for your defense. Meanwhile, the police could well be calling all the people in your phone book or professional database, asking if they know you and, when
they respond yes, asking them such questions as, "Do you know anything about this person's involvement with drugs (prostitution, homosexuality, gambling, etc.)?"

<P>
<DD>Anything that might indicate what "kind of person" you are can also be seized, even if it's not directly related to a crime. This includes books on certain subjects, magazines, newspapers, even what station your television or radio was tuned to—anything that might make you look unusual, peculiar, unconventional, or make a jury of twelve "normal" people think you're pretty weird overall
and probably deserve to go to jail for either the crime you are being charged or for the many crimes you've gotten away with.
<P>
<DD>Whether you're arrested or taken to the police station for "questioning" or on "suspicion," your property that hasn't either been destroyed by the police or taken with them is pretty much up for grabs. If the police broke down your door, they don't exactly call a carpenter and locksmith to make sure that everything is secure before they head off for their next round of searching and seizing.
They may put some tape across the outside of your door, saying "POLICE LINES. DO NOT CROSS," which, to any burglar, means "LOOT INSIDE. OWNER SAFELY IN JAIL. WELCOME." One person who had been searched and seized told another who had gone through a similar experience, "After the police left, burglars came, ransacked my apartment and took everything of value," to which the other victim
replied, "How could you tell?"
<P>
<DD>Sometimes you can't tell. If you're carted off before the police are finished searching and seizing, you may come home and not know the difference between vandalism, theft, and the work of professional law enforcement. If you can't get bail together quickly—or are held in jail for two, three, four days before bail is even set—you may never see any of your property again. If the police
suspect you were using your home, car, or any other possessions for drug selling, they too will be immediately seized, and you may never see them again either. But, we're getting slightly ahead of our story.

<DD>When you are taken downtown ("downtown" does seem to be the favorite euphemism for a police station; even if you live downtown, you will still be taken downtown), you will probably be put in some sort of holding cell (or, as they call it, a holding tank) for an indefinite period of time. (The Supreme Court says that you can be held for forty-eight hours without even being charged.) If
you are lucky, you will be alone in such a cell. Most likely, however, what with jails at 101% capacity thanks to the rigorous enforcement of laws against consensual activities, you will probably find yourself in a much larger cell with some real criminals who have also been recently arrested—some yelling, some moaning, some covered in blood (their own or others'), some vomiting, and some
with
little or no control of other orifices.
<P>
<DD>Once there, you are a criminal. Period. No distinction is made between criminals whose crimes have innocent victims and criminals whose crimes do not. Even if you are not harassed, molested, abused, exposed to a contagious illness, or raped, the sights, smells, and sounds are hideous. The odor of one person vomiting, for example, can cause a chain reaction of retching to which few are
immune.

<DD>Seldom do holding tanks have anything soft in them, such as mattresses, pillows, or blankets. Concrete, wooden, or metal slabs are the most that one can hope for, and even on these unforgiving surfaces—due to overcrowding—there is seldom room to actually lie down. If you are not physically strong enough to stake out your own territory you may end up sitting on the floor or standing until
the police get around to questioning you, which might not be until some time the next day, or the next. (Suspects are sometimes intentionally put in the worst holding cells to "soften them up" for questioning.)
<P>
<DD>Then there is the questioning. Questioning is designed to be traumatic. Whether they use subtle psychological manipulation, hellfire and brimstone histrionics, or a combination of the two in the classic "good cop, bad cop" technique, questioning is designed to make you feel guilty about everything so that you'll confess your guilt about something. You'll be asked to explain pieces of
your life pulled from the search and taken out of context: Polaroid pictures, journal entries, personal letters.
<P>
<DD>The courts have determined that, in order to get you to confess, police can confront you with evidence they have made up. They can show you drugs and claim to have found them in your house. They can show you affidavits signed by names taken from your address book accusing you of elaborate criminal conduct. The police will attempt to convince you that they have an airtight case against
you on a greater charge so you'll plead guilty to a lesser charge.
<P>
<DD>Somewhere, you will be faced with yet another major choice. Could you—with one or two phone calls—contact a good, competent, honest criminal attorney? Few people know how to contact a criminal attorney because few people—including those who regularly take part in consensual crimes—think of themselves as criminals.

<DD>Eventually, the first wave of a very dark ocean known as The Truth About Lawyers reaches your beach. Criminal lawyers want retainers—that is, money up front of anywhere from $5,000 to $25,000. This is just the tip of the legal iceberg, which frequently runs into hundreds of thousands of dollars.
<P>
<DD>If you are arrested for a consensual crime involving drugs, it will be harder for you to obtain the services of an attorney than if you had been arrested for, say, murder. If an attorney takes your case for a drug charge and you are found guilty, the courts can force the attorney to give all the money he or she has made from your case to the law enforcement agency that arrested you. It's
part of the assets forfeiture law. The courts have ruled that not only are your house, car, money, land, investments, bank accounts, and other tangible assets forfeitable, but everything you've paid your attorney as well. Consequently, criminal attorneys are hesitant to take on drug cases. Murderers, rapists, and robbers are getting better legal representation than pot smokers.
<P>
<DD> Many attorneys (un)scrupulously investigate the client's net worth and, lo, when the case is over, the final bill comes to within a few thousand dollars of this amount. If they can't justify charging all this money themselves, they call in any number of attorneys as "specialists" or "consultants." These same attorneys call your attorney in their cases to act as a "specialist" or "consultant."
<P>
<DD>The only alternative is to declare yourself too poor to hire an attorney, in which case you will be assigned a public defender who is overworked, underpaid, and sometimes not very good (which may be why he or she got a job as a public defender in the first place).

<DD>After you are arrested, questioned, and charged, you are arraigned. Basically, this is going before a judge who will set bail. Ah, bail. Let's say that your bail is set at a nice, low, reasonable $50,000. Can you put your hands on $50,000—in cash? From inside a jail? Can anyone you know (who would do it for you) immediately come up with $50,000 in cash? If the answer to these questions
is "no," your choice is either (a) stay in jail until your trial (it might be months) or (b) visit the bail bondsman. Bail bondsmen take 10% of the bail in cash (they are kind enough, however, to accept Visa, MasterCard, and American Express). To put up a $50,000 bond, they take $5,000. Even if the charges are dropped the next day, they keep the $5,000. Still, if you can post bail in any
form,
you're one of the lucky ones: 51% of all those who go trial cannot afford bail and are jailed from the time of the arrest through the final verdict. If you're fortunate enough to have—or to have friends who will help you put up—the $5,000, you are then free to return to whatever is left of your previous life, much of which may have been confiscated under the assets forfeiture law.
<P>
<DD>You're also free to return to work. Ah, work. With the detention, questioning, arresting, arraigning, and gathering of bail money, you may have been in jail for several days, or several weeks. What do you tell your boss? In all likelihood, your boss already knows. The friendly detectives from the police department have already visited your boss, asking if you had behaved in any "unusual"
ways which might indicate that you were involved in drugs (prostitution, gambling, sodomy, etc.).
<P>
<DD>You may be fired. If you argue (quite correctly) that you haven't been convicted of anything, and that one is, in our country, innocent until proven guilty, the boss will probably vaguely refer to something such as, "Where there's smoke, there's fire," or "At our company, we can't even risk the hint of impropriety."

<DD>Finding another job will not be easy. An arrest, even if it ends in a dismissal or an acquittal in court, remains on your record. Many companies check for arrest records as a standard part of screening applicants. Banks, credit card companies, lending institutions, rental agencies, and others use it as an indication of credit worthiness. Even though it is blatantly unfair, and directly
violates the tenet that you are innocent until proven guilty, many companies use a "record of arrests" as a reason not to hire you, rent you an apartment, or extend credit.
<P>
<DD>Ironically, the presupposition of guilt for consensual crimes is even higher than for violent crimes. If you are accused of, say, holding up a bank at gunpoint, even your boss might say, "Oh, I doubt it." If, however, you are accused of propositioning a hooker or smoking a joint, most people conclude, "Yeah, she probably did it," or "Why was he dumb enough to get caught?"
<P>

<DD>Now, too, is the time when that church or religious group you've been supporting for so many years shows its true colors. If your alleged crime is one of the consensual crimes, chances are your church considers it a sin. Some clergy advise accepting the punishment for a consensual crime as an extension of God's punishment for having sinned and as a lesson not to do such a
despicable-in-the-eyes-of-the-Lord thing again. Or they just avoid you and your calls altogether. In other words, don't expect a nun who looks like Susan Sarandon to appear and give you unlimited pastoral counseling.

<DD>And, of course, consensual crimes put an incredible strain on the family. If a significant other doesn't know about his or her partner's forays into consensual crimes, an arrest is a shocking way to find out (The Hugh Grant Syndrome, Part II). If the significant other does know and, perhaps, even takes part in the consensual crime with his or her partner, there is still lots of room for
incrimination. "I told you not to bring that stuff in the house!"
<P>
<DD>A consensual crime arrest could cause parents to permanently lose custody of their children. In Oregon, for example, if you are arrested with even less than an ounce of marijuana, you can be charged with "endangerment"; your children can be taken from you and placed in the state's foster care system. Statistically, your child has, while in that foster care system, a 20% chance of being
either physically or sexually abused. The children will also be exposed to kids who are, themselves, criminals. What innocent children might be forceably exposed to could destroy their entire lives.

Your home? Your credit limit? It's traumatic having to put a dollar amount on the people we love, but when they're accused of a consensual crime, that is what we must do.

<DD>It's little wonder, then, that, at this point, most people accused of consensual crimes seriously contemplate suicide. Not only is one's own life in shambles—the loss of possessions, living space, savings, reputation, job, friends, future—but the fear of being a burden on the friends and family who are willing to help is a pressure some people cannot bear. All this despair, combined with
the fear of prison, can make suicide seem not only the most logical, but the only solution. At the very least, one finds oneself in an ever-deepening and seemingly bottomless depression. (If this chapter is becoming too depressing, please remember that, unlike the consequences of being arrested for a consensual crime, this chapter does have an end.)
<P>
<DD>If you choose to stay alive (which, by the way, I recommend), now starts the seemingly endless round of hearings, motions, further questionings, preparation of defense, and waiting, waiting, waiting. One thing you will not have to wait for are your attorney's bills. These will come on time, and you will be expected to pay them on time.
<P>
<DD>Somewhere along the line, plea bargaining begins. Anyone who says that gambling is illegal in the United States needs only look at plea bargaining to know this is not the case. In plea bargaining, you are asked to gamble the rest of your money or the rest of your life on the verdict of your trial. Rather than go for an all-or-nothing, guilty-or-not-guilty, on the charge for which you
are accused, you agree to plead guilty to a lesser charge with a preset lesser sentence. If you accept the "bargain," you will have a permanent criminal record—not just an arrest, but a conviction—and you may spend some time in jail, but less time than if you were found guilty of the original charge. The good news, however, is that the legal bills stop; the interminable waiting is over; and
you can get on with what's left of your life. If you want to bet on The Trial, however, it means that the legal bills begin to escalate, and, if found guilty, you will almost certainly get a worse punishment than you would have if you had pled guilty to the lesser charge. (Prosecutors and some judges don't seem to like pushy people cluttering up the court systems looking for justice.)

<DD>A plea bargain may be the only economic alternative. It's hard to get a job when an employer discovers you are awaiting trial and may have to "go away" for, oh, five years at some point in the indefinite future.
<P>
<DD>Once the credit card companies find out about your arrest, they'll probably start canceling your cards. (If you use a credit card with the bail bondsman to get out of jail, that's a red flag to credit card companies.) People awaiting trial, you see, have this nasty habit of going bankrupt. Can you imagine why? Lawyers know this too, which is why they work very hard to be paid on a regular
basis. (Bankruptcy attorneys want the full amount up front before they even touch a case.)
<P>
<DD>If you go to trial, you usually have the choice between a jury trial or a trial before a judge (a "bench trial"). When charged with a consensual crime, you are dealing not just with the facts of guilt or innocence; you are also dealing with individual prejudices. On hearing what you're accused of doing, will the prejudice of the jury be such that your guilt will be presumed and the trial
merely a formality? Judges tend to be a bit more sophisticated, having dealt with real criminals who go around raping, robbing, and murdering, but judges have their prejudices too. They also have political pressure. During a "crackdown" or "war" on this or that consensual crime, a judge is more likely to find guilt and sentence heavily. Economics enter the picture once again: jury trials
tend to last longer than bench trials, and legal fees during criminal trials often run $2,000 to $5,000 per day, per attorney. (If they don't have all your money yet, your attorneys will strongly recommend that you have at least two attorneys representing you at the trial. If you're rich, they'll suggest an entourage.)

<DD>Prosecutors hate to lose. If the trial seems to be going in your favor, you will be offered better and better plea-bargains. Your attorney doesn't want to lose either (it's very difficult to collect a final bill from a client who is in prison); so, if the case seems to be going against you, your attorney will recommend accepting poorer and poorer bargains.
<P>
<DD>Meanwhile, everyone is involved in the psychological guessing game of "reading the jury." Who's on our side? Who's not on our side? This process begins with the selection of the jury and continues throughout the trial. If you have money, your attorney can hire a professional who will, during the selection process, do on-the-spot instant psychological profiles of each potential juror along
with a recommendation as to whether or not the juror would be favorable or unfavorable to your case. Once the juror is selected, investigative companies can give overnight reports as to the net worth, politics, religion, marital status, sexual preference, and spending habits of each juror. This overnight profile costs, oh, $5,000 to $15,000 per jury, and, if you can afford it, your attorney
will claim it's "an invaluable tool" in helping to "shape" your defense.
<P>
<DD>A lot of invaluable tools are available, and the more valuable you are, the more invaluable they become. There is, for example, the expert witness. The expert witness is a professional who is paid an exorbitant amount of money to give the "expert opinion" that you are right and the state is wrong. A popular expert witness in consensual crime trials is the psychiatrist. For, $3,000 to
$10,000 each (you'll want at least two), the psychiatrist will "examine" you and claim that you're not a criminal, you're just sick; you don't need jail, you need treatment. Why, with a year or two of therapy you could once again be a productive member of society. (The only thing that made you an unproductive member of society, of course, was being arrested, but it's best not to mention that
at this point in the trial.) Yes, if you were sentenced, that is, if the court referred you to five psychiatric sessions per week for a year, that would be much better for you and all of society than that same year in the Big House. And, if the court takes this suggestion, that's only another $25,000 to $50,000 out of your pocket.

<DD>If you are found guilty, the next wait begins: the wait for sentencing. During this time, you can choose whether or not to appeal your case. "An appeal," explained Finley Peter Dunne, "is when you ask one court to show its contempt for another court." If you thought the first round of legal fees was expensive, when you move into the world of appellate courts, legal fees go into hyperdrive.

<P>
<DD>You can appeal for a mistrial. Here, you are asking the appellate court to declare your original trial invalid because of a technical legal error made by the judge, jury, or prosecution. If you are successful in winning this appeal, your trial will be declared null and void—but that doesn't make you free: you have to start all over again with another trial, another jury, another round
of legal fees.
<P>
<DD>You can also appeal on constitutional grounds. Your lawyer can claim—using some of the brilliant arguments given in the chapters, "Laws against Consensual Activities Are Unconstitutional" and "Laws against Consensual Activities Violate the Separation of Church and State, Threatening the Freedom of and from Religion"—that the very law violates your constitutional rights and that the court
should overturn the law. Here, you are looking at cases going to state supreme courts and, perhaps, even the federal Supreme Court. You are also looking at legal fees, not in the hundreds of thousands, but in the millions. (Most cases involving individuals that reach the Supreme Court are paid for by organizations such as the ACLU, who are doing it not just for the individual, but to set
a legal precedent that will affect others.)
<P>
<DD>While the case is on appeal, if you don't want to spend time in jail, there is a little matter of additional bail. You are now, in the eyes of the court, a convicted criminal; thus the new bail will probably be higher than the first. Not everyone can meet bail, of course. Most people can't afford anything other than accepting their sentence and doing their time.

BIG MIKE: "We're in prison." are the noise and the smell. The smell
is body odor, cigarette smoke, unflushed or backing up toilets, diarrhea, vomit, and wafting through it all is the strange but clearly unpleasant aroma of the mysterious substances the prisoners are fed. The noise is a cacophony of televisions, radios—all tuned to different stations—boom boxes, and voices. Some of the voices are shouting. Some of the voices are babbling. Some of the voices
are singing, chanting, or praying. Some of the voices are communicating. Because the person they are communicating with could be several cells away, to the untrained ear the conversation sounds like the rest of the yelling. (Sometimes twenty or thirty of these conversations are going on simultaneously.)

<DD>There is absolutely no privacy. A toilet (with no toilet seat) is bolted to the wall of each cell. It is usually only inches from the bottom bunk. If it becomes clogged and will not flush, it may take several days to get fixed, but the prisoners have to use it anyway.

Visitation days are once a week (in some prisons, once a month) and you usually see your friends or loved ones (those who are willing to travel the hundreds, sometimes thousands of miles) through a thick, plastic partition. No touching is permitted. In some prisons, you talk by telephone as the separation
between the two of you is not only bullet-proof but sound-proof. These conversations may be monitored and recorded. The prisons that allow conjugal visits only do so only every few months.

<P>
<DD>In most prisons, reading is limited to what's in the prison library. In many prisons, reading material must be sent directly from the publisher. Books, magazines, or newspapers sent by individuals are returned or destroyed. That means if you want to read a book that's out of print (which most books are) or is printed by a publisher that does not do direct mail order, you are out of luck.
<P>
<DD>Then there's a matter of money. Except for the absolute necessities, you must pay for everything: books, stationery, postage, cigarettes, cassette tapes, your television, everything. You can make this money at a prison job that pays approximately twenty cents per hour. If you are transferred from one prison to another—which can happen at any time and as often as the penal authorities
dictate—you must leave all but the basic necessities behind and start over.

<DD>Rape in prison is something of a sport, like hunting. Devout heterosexuals, who would just as soon kill (and may have killed) a male who approached them with a sexual proposition, seem to become sexually ravenous as soon as the prison door slams behind them. Rape, of course, in any situation is not a sexual act; it is an act of violence, domination, control. The macho sport in prison
is who-you-can-get-how-often-and-when. The only way to keep from becoming an open target and susceptible to gang rapes and individual hits at every possible opportunity is to become the "punk" of the most powerful hunter you can. He will then protect you from all the rest—although he may occasionally trade you or give you as a gift to one of the other hunters.
<P>
<DD>By the way, if you report any of this to the authorities, you will be killed. It's that simple. Turning in a fellow prisoner will mark you, both in and out of prison, for the remainder of your life (which will not be a long one).
<P>
<DD>Although rape is excruciatingly painful, humiliating, and degrading, if you don't die of hemorrhaging, there's always AIDS. Due to the high incidence of intravenous drug use, both in and out of prison, and completely unprotected sexual activity inside of prison, AIDS has reached epidemic proportion within the prison system. In 1991, 15% of all deaths in prison were AIDS-related. Condoms,
of course, are not provided by most prisons. Prisoners are not supposed to be having sex; therefore, they're not; therefore, they don't need condoms. Even when condoms are available, rapists tend not to use them even to potentially save their own lives—it just isn't very macho.

In prison, consensual crimes are thought of as somewhat wimpy things, and since your crime did not involve violence against another person or another person's property, it will be assumed that you won't
fight back. You will be taken advantage of at every opportunity. Your pillow, blanket, and even mattress may be "borrowed" by another cellmate. Your clean towel will be exchanged for a dirty one. Any food that is even marginally edible will be consumed by others. ("You don't want this, do you?") Your hunter, by the way, will not protect you from all this; he is only there to protect you from
sexual attack. If you want additional protection, you will have to provide additional favors: money, cigarettes, running errands—little tokens of your appreciation.

To make

<LI>Low-grade marijuana is sometimes laced with the drug PCP to make the pot seem more potent. It's hard for users to know whether or not they've gotten great pot or PCP pot. Alas, PCP is far more damaging than even the most potent marijuana. Similarly, LSD is sometimes "enhanced" (without the buyer's knowledge) with strychnine, a lethal poison.
<P>
<LI>When dosages are unknown, it is difficult for the user to moderate consumption. If marijuana were legal, for example, the THC (the psychoactive element in marijuana) level could be printed on each package. People could then intelligently moderate their usage. As it is, one joint could have twenty times more THC than another, and the user—short of trial and error—has no way of knowing.  This becomes particularly dangerous when it comes to driving, operating machinery, or even cooking. With regulated, legal alcohol, one can moderate intake. The same is not true of uncontrolled substances.

As it is, credit is extended in a haphazard fashion and collection techniques are more intrusive and violent than even those practiced by DiscoverCard (although I know that's hard to believe).
</ul>
<P>

<DD>By now, however, we are veering into the chapter, "Consensual Crimes Encourage Real Crimes." (This chapter is about ruining lives. Having your arm broken by the Mafia would probably not ruin your life. It may play havoc with your penmanship for a while, but your life would go on.)

[When a victimless criminal] is
treated as an enemy of society, he
almost necessarily becomes one.
Forced into criminal acts,
immersed in underworld-related
supply networks, and ever-conscious
of the need to evade the police,
his outlooks as well as behavior
become more and more anti-social.

<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY of agreements; in fact, if these agreements (or, if you prefer, contracts) were not in place and voluntarily kept by most of the people most of the time, society as we know it would be impossible.
<p>
<dd>We agree, for example, to drive on the right side of the road. Why? It's a fairly arbitrary decision—half the world drives on the left side of the road. We, however, drive on the right side of the road. Even though no one asked our opinion as to which side of the road we would prefer to drive on (it was a decision made long before we were born), we still follow that agreement almost unthinkingly.
<p>
<dd>Can you imagine what driving would be like if even one-hundredth of one percent of the drivers refused to honor that agreement—if they tried to drive on the left side of the road at every possible opportunity? Can you imagine the chaos? The six-foot cement walls dividing even country lanes? The number of police it would take to force all cars to drive on the right side of the road?
<p>
<dd>During the 1992 Los Angeles riots, television showed us what happens when our tightly knit fabric of agreements begins to unravel. There was simply no way law enforcement could stop people from looting. The video images of this were astonishing: people would be seen carrying televisions, dishwashers, and VCRs out of appliance stores; a police car would pull up; people would set down whatever they were carrying, walk two feet away from it, stand there; the police car would drive off; people would put the loot in their cars and go back for more.

<p>
<dd>Watching an entire store picked clean in less than thirty minutes by an unorganized group of people struck fear in the hearts of Los Angeles residents: "What would happen if these people came to my house? What would stop them from coming into my apartment and taking everything I own in a matter of minutes?"
<p>
<dd>Answer: nothing.
<p>
<dd>Then something interesting happened. On television, one bit of video was played over and over. At first, it was humorous, but, with repeated viewings, it grew increasingly disturbing. The video showed someone who had put a looted television in the back of his pick-up truck. While he was caught in the traffic jam caused by other drive-in looters, two pedestrian looters picked up the television from the back of his pick-up truck and walked away with it. The original looter had a choice: his pick-up truck or the television. He chose his pick-up truck—and also avoided the confrontation of the superior two-against-one force.
<p>
<dd>Even people watching the scene it on freshly looted televisions began to realize that anyone with superior force could come in at any time and take the TV. The police could no more protect them than the police protected the store that owned the television set only hours before.
<p>
<dd>It wasn't the curfew or calling out the National Guard or a "show of strength" that brought an end to the riots. It was people voluntarily returning to the social contract of not harming other people's person or property. They did it out of fear—not fear of jail, but fear that, if most people did not voluntarily keep that contract most of the time, one's own possessions could never be considered secure—not ever, no matter what. People, as they say, "returned to their senses," and the sense they returned to was common sense.

<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>It is not police protection, it turns out, that keeps us safe. It is the social agreement not to harm each other's person and property. The police are there—and can only be there—for that small percentage of people who choose not to honor the agreement.
<p>
<dd>When government comes along, certain agreements become written down as laws. For the most part, the laws existed before we were born and the laws will exist after we're gone. Some of them are absolute ("Thou shalt not steal") and some of them are arbitrary ("Drive with your headlights on, not your parking lights"for, anyway?>). In Rome, for example, people drive at night with their parking lights on, but their headlights off. It works just as well and gives the city a quieter, softer glow.
<p>
<dd>Most people are willing to cooperate with both the absolute and the arbitrary laws of the government into which they were born, providing (a) the majority of people follow them, and (b) those agreements are fair: that they somehow make sense. "Don't harm other people's person or property and they won't harm yours" (a modern restating of "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you") makes sense. We will make personal allowances for others, knowing that others are making personal allowances for us. For those who don't choose to obey this fundamental agreement, there are police, courts, and jails.
<p>
<dd>When laws are irrational, however, people are less likely to sacrifice in order to obey them. A law against an activity which potentially can only hurt the person or property of the person committing the "crime" is far less likely to be honored than a law against an activity that does physical harm to the person or property of another.

<blockquote>
<dd>Far, far, more consensual crimes take place than crimes with genuine victims. We hear more about crimes with genuine victims because these crimes tend to get reported. The victim calls the police and says, "Hey, there's been a crime here." With a consensual crime, who's going to call the police? Except for some busybodies, do-gooders, and police entrappers, no one's going to report a consensual crime. And, unless a celebrity is involved (The Hugh Grant Syndrome, Part III), most consensual crime arrests are not reported on the news.
<p>
<dd>People take part in consensual crimes because the activities are appealing. A person discovers that he or she has broken the law, had a good time doing it, and reaped few, if any, negative consequences. This positive reinforcement makes it easy to commit the consensual crime again. And again. And again. Other consensual crimes are tried. Not bad. Although not yet caught, the person is, nonetheless, living outside the law and a criminal many times over.
<p>
<dd>Meanwhile, the leaders of government—the keepers of the rules—are going on and on about how bad drug use, homosexuality, prostitution, etc., are. Our leaders certainly seem more concerned about these than, say, shoplifting, insurance fraud, stealing from work, or other crimes with genuine victims. Our government certainly seems to be more concerned with combating hookers, homosexuals, and heroin than it is with combating sexism, racism, and air pollution.
<p>
<dd>This creates a truly subjective morality based on what the powerful do and do not like. It allows consensual sex among adults, for example, to be linked with muggings, bashing, rape, and murder. We hear condemnations of "sex and violence" as though they were somehow the same. They are, in fact, nearly polar opposites.

<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>The lines blur between genuine right and wrong, moral and immoral, good and evil.
<p>
<dd>The transition from committing consensual crimes to committing crimes with genuine victims can be an easy one. Once the fabric of obeying the rules is torn, it is very difficult to mend. The criterion for choosing a certain action is no longer "Is this right?" but "Will I get caught?" The person becomes an outcast in a world in which the police are the enemy and not the protector, in which everyone who appears to follow the rules of society is fair game, and in which one looks out for number one, no matter what the cost to others.
<p>
<dd>Declaring certain activities "criminal" has caused artificially inflated prices for the criminalized activities, thus guaranteeing real crime. If drugs were legalized and regulated, no drug user, even the most severely addicted, would have to spend more than $5 per day on drugs. As it is now, some people have $200, $300, $400 daily habits. To get $200 worth of drugs a day, one must be either (a) rich, (b) a doctor, (c) a thief, or (d) a drug dealer. Most end up, by default, at (c) and (d). In order to clear $200 a day, one must steal $2,000 a day in goods (fences pay about ten cents on the dollar) or directly rob enough people to accumulate $200 in cash.
<p>
<dd>According to Mark Moore of Harvard University, as reported by the National Institute of Justice,
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>Very large proportions of those arrested for street crimes such as robbery, burglary, and larceny are drug users. The addict's need for money to finance his habit and the mechanisms of addiction establish a link between drugs and crime.

<p>
<dd>The result: each addicted drug user becomes a one-person crime wave. It's not the drug that causes the crime; it's the prohibition of the drug. Having to come up with $200 per day might turn any of us into criminals. Five dollars a day: that's easy. A drug user could get that panhandling. He or she might even get a part-time job.
<p>
<dd>Some drug users make the money to pay the artificially inflated prices by selling drugs—in fairly large quantities. As I have pointed out before, these people are not too particular as to whom they sell: they can't afford to be. If children have the money, they sell to children. Because the drug underworld cannot depend on police protection or take disputes to civil courts, disagreements tend to be handled in an unpleasantly messy, highly criminal fashion.
<p>
<dd>Consensual crimes also encourage real crime by eroding public confidence in law enforcement. People are afraid to cooperate with police because it may allow the police to discover some little, hidden, private secret that would be best for the police not to know.

<blockquote>
<dd>Time was when people cooperated with the police fully, openly, immediately. If the police inquired about a friend or relative, it was assumed that the friend or relative was the victim of a crime and the police were trying to help. Now there is the fear that the friend or relative might be involved in a consensual crime. Our frank and immediate cooperation with the authorities might just help put a friend or a relative in jail. Even though we may not personally approve of our friends' or relatives' extracurricular activities, and may even think it best that they didn't take part in them, we don't want them to go to jail, and we certainly don't want to help put them there.
<p>
<dd>As most people at one time or another have taken part in one consensual crime or another, the respect given law enforcement officers has seriously eroded. A Robin Hood mentality has people identifying more with the criminals than with the police—who seem to be acting increasingly like the Sheriff of Nottingham.
<p>
<dd>Consensual crimes simply overburden an already groaning criminal justice system. With one serious, violent crime (murder, negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, arson) taking place every two seconds in the United States, do we really want the precious time of law enforcement officials spent regulating the private lives of individuals? Stories such as this, from the June 13, 1991, edition of the New York Times, are increasingly common:

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>The Manhattan District Attorney's office has been criticized for allowing the defendant to plea bargain 15 months ago to a trespass charge after having been charged with attacking a woman with an ice pick. The defendant received a 45-day sentence and served 30 days. . . .

Mr. McKiever had been arrested three other times: in 1982 for trespassing, in 1982 for petty larceny and in 1978 for grand larceny. . . .

At a news conference announcing the indictment in the slaying, Robert M. Morgenthau, the District Attorney, defended his office's action last year. . . . "I don't blame the public for being upset. This is a tragedy, and I wish it could have been averted. There are a lot of potentially dangerous people running around on the streets, and we'd like to lock up every one of them, but we can't do it. . . ."

Some lawyers say Mr. Morgenthau and his prosecutors are often forced into difficult decisions by a system that is overburdened by too many criminals and not enough judges.

"People blame Mr. Morgenthau, but what really can he do?" said William E. Hellerstein, a professor at Brooklyn Law School. . . . "There is still a lot of time being devoted to victimless crimes, . . ." he said. "But meanwhile there are large chunks of activity, violent activity, that as a practical matter has become decriminalized because the system cannot cope."</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

NO MATTER HOW loudly they may pontificate, the fact is mostpeopleinlaw enforcement do not consider consensual activities crimes. Each year since 1930, the United States Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have published the telephone book–sized Uniform Crime Reports. The advisory board for this report includes the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the National Sheriffs Association.
<p>
<dd>
And what crime statistic do the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and the National Sheriffs Association think most important? They have two categories: violent crime and property crime. Under violent crime are murder and negligent manslaughter, forcible (as opposed to statutory) rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Under property crime are burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson. The report says that these crimes, known collectively as the "Crime Index," are used "for gauging fluctuations in the overall volume and rate of crime."

According to the most recent report, in the late 1980s "law enforcement called for a thorough evaluative study that would modernize the UCR (Uniform Crime Reporting) program." After years of study, what was added to the report? Hate crime statistics and law enforcement officers killed and assaulted.

Law enforcement is based on a very simple premise: there is a perpetrator and a victim. The police catch the accused perpetrator and put him or her in jail. The courts then decide the guilt or innocence of the accused and an appropriate punishment if guilty. This protects the victim and others from further victimization and keeps the perpetrator from further perpetrations.
<p>
<dd>
A serious problem arises when the accused perpetrator and the victim are one and the same. Such is the case with consensual crimes. When the police put the accused in jail, they are putting the victim in jail too. How, then, can the police protect the victim? Law enforcement, thus perverted, begins to deteriorate.
<p>
<dd>
With a real crime, the genuine victim goes to the police and reports it. The police then set about to catch the criminal. With consensual crime, who reports the crime? Obviously, no one directly involved. Everyone consented to it; they're not going to be complaining to the police. The police, then, must become spies, busybodies, and entrappers in order to catch consensual criminals victimizing themselves. Imagine how demoralizing and corrupting this entire procedure can be to both police and society.

<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>Drug offenses . . . may be regarded as the prototypes of non-victim crimes today. The private nature of the sale and use of these drugs has led the police to resort to methods of detection and surveillance that intrude upon our privacy, including illegal search, eavesdropping, and entrapment.

Indeed, the successful prosecution of such cases often requires police infringement of the constitutional protections that safeguard the privacy of individuals.

Why, then, don't law enforcement officials speak out against the enforcement of laws against consensual activities? It's not a popular position—not with the general public, not with religious leaders, not with organized crime, not with politicians (who use crackdown-on-consensual-crime rhetoric to get easy votes), and not with some law enforcement officials.
<p>
<dd>
Law enforcement officials who are against the legalization of consensual crimes tend to fall into three categories: the conservative, the concerned, and the corrupt.
<p>
<dd>
<B><I>The Conservative</I></B>. Due to their personal convictions (often religious), they do not like one, some, or all of the consensual crimes. These officials usually discuss "morality," "the family," and "the values of decent Americans."
<p>
<dd>
These law enforcement officials are sincerely misguided. They are in a better position than most to know that personal morality cannot be regulated by force of law. They are faced daily with genuine victims of preventable crimes, whose suffering could have been avoided if there were more police to patrol certain areas or investigate certain crimes. These officials watch violent criminals, who they know are guilty, go free because there aren't enough detectives to gather the evidence necessary for conviction. And yet, because these officials believe personally that consensual crimes are wrong, they believe that consensual "criminals" should be punished.

<B><I>The Concerned</I></B>. These law enforcement officials know that the pursuit of consensual crimes is (a) hopeless, (b) a waste of time, and (c) counterproductive. Yet, when they consider the consequences of legalization, they become concerned. For example, drunk drivers kill more than 22,000 people each year. If drugs were legalized, wouldn't this rate be increased by "stoned" drivers? One doesn't need to see too many traffic accidents to realize that whatever we need to do to prevent even one more of these should be done. These officials are concerned, too, that a useful tool for investigating and gaining confessions to genuine crimes might be taken away. (In order to have a consensual crime charge dropped, some suspects "talk" and provide valuable information about real crimes.)
<p><p>
<dd>
As to these people's concerns, I pray that a thoughtful reading of this book will ease many of them. We'll explore the genuine crime of operating a motor vehicle while incapacitated (for whatever reason) in the chapter, "Protective Technology." As to using consensual crimes as a tool for gathering information on genuine crimes, I can only suggest that loyal law enforcement officers were probably concerned when physical torture was officially removed from their arsenal of interrogation. As effective as using consensual crime violations to reveal information about real crimes may be, its potential for abuses far outweighs its advantages. For example, in order to get off, a suspect might give false evidence against someone, helping to convict an innocent person. As much as
law enforcement officials want crimes solved, only corrupt law enforcement officials want those crimes "cleared" by the conviction of innocent parties. Which brings us to . . .

<B><I>The Corrupt</I></B>. These are the law enforcement officials who are getting something from consensual crimes remaining crimes. At the lower levels of corruption are police officers looking for easy collars. A collar is a police term meaning "arrest." Many police departments require a minimum number of collars per officer per month. As the month nears its end, police officers actively seek arrests to fulfill their quotas. What do you suppose are the easiest collars to make? People committing consensual crimes, of course. What could be easier than going where drug dealers and prostitutes ply their trades, or where gays and gamblers hang out, and then wait until something "illegal" is either offered or observed? Not only are these easy arrests; they also tend to be relatively risk-free.
Consensual "criminals" (other than higher-level and gang-related drug dealers) are not famous for carrying weapons or resisting arrest.
<p>
<dd>
At the next level of corruption are the officers who get "free samples" from drug dealers, prostitutes, and the like. At the next level up (down?) are the ones who get financial kickbacks for looking the other way.
<p>
<dd>
Then there are those who get the collars and the cash. The famous "suitcases full of money" are very real, especially in drug dealing. (Prostitutes don't tend to carry suitcases full of money.) Who knows how much money is in a suitcase full of cash? (A million dollars in $100 bills fits comfortably into a mid-sized Samsonite.) From the time of the bust until the suitcase gets checked into evidence, the contents could be down by, oh, $50,000. With the outrageously inflated prices caused by the illegalization of drugs, $50,000's worth of cocaine or heroin could get sidetracked on the trip downtown and nobody would notice. If somebody did notice, well, an arrangement could be made. ("Here. You take a bag, too.")

Sometimes otherwise honest cops go wrong simply because the amounts of money involved in consensual crimes are entirely too tempting. These are cops, not saints.
<p>
<dd>
This "easy money" corruption goes right to the top. One example: When an accused consensual criminal's land, property, or money is seized under federal assets forfeiture laws, the income is split between federal and local law enforcement. According to the Los Angeles Times (April 13, 1993), however, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department failed to turn over $60 million to the feds. A former sheriff's department sergeant was quoted as saying the sheriff's department "stole $60 million" from the feds in 1988 and 1989 drug busts, and the Times added, "he is convinced such practices continue."
<p>
<dd>
In addition to the opportunity for pilfering cash and drugs seized in raids, organized crime offers police large sums of money in exchange for information, participation, or cooperation. In multimillion dollar drug deals, a sizable amount is set aside for "security." Should consensual crimes go the way of alcohol prohibition, there would be very little for law enforcement personnel on the take to take.
<p>
<dd>
There's not much to say about corrupt law enforcement officials. Even though their graft may have begun innocently enough—perhaps even accidentally—over time they become spoiled, complacent, and lazy. If you're getting $200,000 a year for simply looking the other way, why would you want to go back to $38,000 a year looking for criminals? This laziness extends even into the milder forms of corruption, such as padding the collar quota with consensual crimes. Those on the easy "vice" details—entrapping prostitutes and gays or rounding up pornographers and gamblers—are not going to be pleased at the prospect of returning to the real world of cops and robbers.

No one has mixed feelings about firefighters, for example.

Most of the police I've met are genuinely dedicated to peace, in the broadest sense of the term. They want people to feel safe in their homes, in their cars, in their businesses, and walking down the street. If the police keep in check the small percentage of the population that violates that peace, they consider their job well done.
<p>
<dd>
I wholeheartedly support that job. If we removed the futile enforcement of laws against consensual activities from their job descriptions, policemen, policewomen, sheriffs, constables, G-men, G-women, and all the rest would once again become something they haven't been called in some time: peace officers.

THE MORE THAN 4,000,000 arrests made each year for consensual crimes aren't even the tip of the iceberg; they're more like the ice cube of the tip of the iceberg.
<p>
<dd>
When you consider the ubiquity of the drug trade, and all the prostitutes paid, bets made, illicit sex bade, loiterers in the shade, vagrants on parade, and transvestites in masquerade, it's easy to see that the cops can't catch 'em, the courts can't handle 'em, and the prisons can't hold 'em.
<p>
<dd>
To give one obvious example: In 1994, fewer than 15 million people were arrested for all crimes in the United States. In that same year, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, almost 26 million people illegally used drugs. The criminal justice system was burdened beyond capacity with the 15 million arrests (1.35 million of which were drug arrests). Can you imagine what would have happened if they had added 25 million more drug arrests? And that's just drugs.
<p>
<dd>
When it comes to consensual crimes, the term criminal justice is an oxymoron. There's no justice because they're not criminals. As we explored in the chapter, "Enforcing Laws against Consensual Activities Destroys People's Lives," putting consensual criminals into a system designed for real criminals has significant detrimental effects on the former.

It also has detrimental effects on the system itself. Avowed to treating all criminals alike (the woman holding the scales of justice is blindfolded), the courts, when they become overcrowded, treat all criminals a little bit easier.
<p>
<dd>
The scales of justice are a delicate balance. We may be able to add more jail cells by spending more money, but an effective court takes more than just an additional wing on the courthouse. Good judges take decades of seasoning. Around each judge must be assembled a support system of court clerks, legal researchers, court reporters, bailiffs, and other individuals.
<p>
<dd>
In our courts we seek the highest wisdom—the guidance of intelligence 
and maturity. Overcrowding the court system with consensual noncriminals keeps the bad judges in place, encourages incompetent lawyers to become judges, and prevents the truly good judges from doing their best.

The jury is as susceptible as its twelve members. With enough investigation money (and the perpetrators of organized consensual crimes have plenty of that), the defense can know by the first day of the trial almost everything there is to know about each juror. Which would be most susceptible to a threat, a bribe, or a little blackmail? Except in rare cases, the jurors go home after court adjourns and can easily be contacted. One or two highly motivated jury members can often create enough reasonable doubts (and juries in criminal cases are instructed to reach their conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt) in the minds of the other jurors to bring in a verdict of not guilty. At worst, it only takes one member of a jury to withhold his or her guilty vote for there to
be a hung jury. After a hung jury, the prosecutor is usually more than willing to enter into passionate plea bargaining: the concept of retrying the same case from scratch (which is what must happen with a hung jury) is, at best, disheartening. After a second or third hung jury, the case might be dropped entirely. Bribing or threatening jurors is such a common practice that it's known by the relatively trivial phrase jury tampering, which in no way conveys the seriousness or the significance of the crime.
<p>
<dd>
Finally, there are witnesses. Far from the melodramatic courtroom myth, the last-minute "secret witness" almost never appears. (In courtroom dramas, whenever a surprise witness is introduced, the judge invariably proclaims, "This is highly irregular!") By law, the witnesses each side plans to call to the stand must be presented to the other side some time before the trial. Thus witnesses, like jurors, judges, and prosecutors, are open to pretrial persuasion. Many trials are never brought to court because someone "gets to" the main witness for the prosecution, who "suddenly remembers" a different set of facts.

And then there are witnesses who are paid to bear false witness. Their payment may be in the form of money, drugs, or favors; or they may simply be blackmailed. These people will claim that the defendant couldn't possibly have been at the scene of the crime because they were all spending the weekend together in Wyoming—fishing by day and reading the Bible aloud at night. False witnesses can also be used to impugn the credibility of otherwise credible witnesses.
<p>
<dd>
When you combine the delicate balance of the criminal justice system with the large amounts of money made by the peddlers of consensual crimes (especially drugs and gambling), the potential for corruption is high and all too often realized. The big players with the big money tend to get off, while the little players with little money tend to get big sentences. In this way, defenders of the criminal justice system can say, "See, we're doing so much about drugs (or whatever the consensual crime may be). Our conviction rate is up and the sentences are stiffer."
<p>
<dd>
In courts that aren't corrupt, the massive overloading caused by the burden of processing consensual criminals as though they were real criminals creates, at best, a system with enough loopholes for plenty of real criminals (especially the ones who can afford the best lawyers) to go free.

<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>Two more senior federal judges recently joined a growing list of their colleagues nationwide in refusing to preside over drug cases as a protest to the extreme and counter-productive sentences they are required to impose in these cases. We are sympathetic with their distress.

Nearly 60% of all federal prisoners are now drug felons. Average prison terms for federal drug offenders have shot up 22% since 1986—while those of violent criminals fell by 30%. . . .

Congress has been unwilling to amend the Draconian sentencing law for fear of seeming "soft on crime." But the protests of these respected judges, along with the private rumblings of hundreds more across the country, must signal Congress that the law is unfair and unworkable.

The solution? Obviously, stop pretending that consensual activities are crimes. This would stop most organized crime—with its threats, blackmail, and bribery—overnight. Ending multi-prohibitions would immediately cut the workload of the criminal justice system in half. This would give the courts time to decide the guilt or innocence of people accused of crimes such as murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, theft, motor vehicle theft, arson, hate crimes, forgery, counterfeiting, fraud, embezzlement, buying and selling stolen property, vandalism, carrying concealed weapons, child molestation, and driving under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicating substances.

Prisons, as previously noted, are filled to capacity and beyond. In most areas an early-release program has been instituted, which, of course, does not differentiate between prisoners whose crimes had innocent victims and prisoners whose crimes did not. This puts truly dangerous criminals on the street sooner, giving them extra months—and in some cases years—to rape, rob, and plunder anew.

MOST CRIMES WITH genuine victims are individual enterprises, small businesses at best. Murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, theft, arson, hate crimes, forgery, counterfeiting, fraud, embezzlement, buying and selling stolen property, vandalism, carrying concealed weapons, child molestation, and driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics can usually be done by one, two, or, at most, a small band of people.
<p>
<dd>
Supplying the needs of people who engage in consensual crimes, on the other hand, is big business. Drugs are the best example. Getting all that marijuana, hashish, cocaine, heroin, and other chemicals to the millions of eager users every day (many of whom receive home delivery) requires enormous planning, preparation, personnel, coordination—in short, organization. Because the moralists of our society have chosen to label the distribution of these obviously desired substances crimes, these big businesses are known as organized crime.
<p>
<dd>
The big-business, international quality of organized crime today is evident even in the name it chooses to call itself. In the early days, crime organizations were called families because they were, in many cases, extended family units. As organized crime grew into a business at which anyone could play, it became known as a syndicate. Today it's known as a cartel, a word of international scope (the Germans spell it Kartell, the French cartel, and the Italians cartello).

Organized crime was first organized around a consensual crime during Prohibition. Making and distributing alcohol required breweries, distilleries, bottling plants, truck drivers, places to sell it (speakeasies), waiters, cooks, jazz musicians to entertain—it was a regular empire. When Prohibition ended in 1933, the empire was firmly in place and, with a little retooling, it turned to the marketing of other consensual crimes: prostitution, gambling, loansharking, and drugs.

<p><p>
<dd>
The organized crime of today is nothing like the organized crime of yesterday—it's much better organized, therefore much worse for the rest of us. Organized crime competes with IBM, GM, and Sears for law school and MBA graduates. (Based on results, IBM, GM, and Sears have not gotten the cream of the crop.) Organized crime's boats outrun the Coast Guard, their planes outfly the Air Force, their soldiers outshoot the Army, and their intelligence is smarter than the CIA's.

In addition to police, judges, prosecutors, and politicians, organized crime also has on its payroll doctors, scientists, and journalists in all media whose job it is to predict and report how terrible life would be if consensual crimes were legalized. (Organized crime's very existence depends on consensual crimes remaining illegal.) The media people on the payroll are also to report that organized crime is on the decrease, that its influence is minimal, and that the government is doing an absolutely crackerjack job of rounding up the few minor hoodlums that remain. ("No one is beyond the reach of the federal auth-orities. Well, just look at Noriega.")

Unlike in the old days, organized crime is hardly homegrown. Consensual crimes (especially drugs) have international investors. Most of the ill-gotten gain leaves our shores, never to return. (Well, some of it returns—when the cartel buys an American bank, high-rise office building, or other legitimate business.)
<p>
<dd>
The heavy-handed tactics and enforcement by violence continue, of course. Some things are traditional. Organized crime doesn't differentiate between crimes with genuine victims and crimes without. The well-oiled, well-run, well-connected machine runs just as well whether promoting a crooked investment scheme (bilking thousands out of retirement money) or importing cocaine (for obviously willing consumers). The criterion is never "Is it right?" only "Is it profitable?" The reason organized crime has stayed primarily with consensual crimes is that, due to the artificially inflated prices, consensual crimes are the most profitable.
<p>
<dd>
Thanks to the consensual crimes, the flow of money goes something like this: To pay the outrageously inflated price of their addiction, people steal things—from you and me. If what was stolen is not money, the item is taken to a fence, who pays about ten cents on the dollar (if the item is in new condition). The underworld resells the item at a profit. For every $100 of merchandise stolen, perhaps $30 goes into the cartel coffers. Then there are people who steal money. When people steal money to buy drugs, all of it goes into the underworld treasury. The money is then laundered by a trillion-dollar international scheme of money scrubbing, and the newly legitimized dollars are stored in Swiss bank accounts, off-shore banks, and other places outside the United States where
they cannot be traced—or taxed.

Here we find another significant way in which organized crime hurts us: no taxation. Just about all the money is tax free. Organized crime learned well the lesson taught by Al Capone, who was sent away for eleven years not for racketeering, bootlegging, or murder, but for tax evasion. The lesson organized crime learned was not to pay more taxes, but to be a lot more careful at bookkeeping.
<p>
<dd>
When illegal consensual activities are made legal, some of the underground will wallow about looking for new and better crimes to commit. Many—like the speakeasy operators who overnight became owners of successful nightclubs—will move aboveground (some by choice, some by necessity) and continue business as usual. For the first time in a long time these entrepreneurs will be able to focus on business and not on the business of protecting themselves from the police. The police will be able to find real criminals. The press will be able to report truth freely again, and we can all celebrate an unprecedented cycle of economic prosperity and decline in crime.

"The press" is an extremely broad term and includes all systems that make information available to people: newspapers, television, radio, books, lectures, movies, art, dance, telephone, cassettes, CDs, video discs, magazines, electronic bulletin boards, computer networks, billboards, video tapes, you name it. It's generally known as "the press" in our country because, when the founding fathers wrote freedom of the press into the Bill of Rights, the printing press was the most popular form of mass communication. Today we call it "the media."
<p>
<dd>
All of the world's major religions, philosophies, schools of political thought, and systems of government were spread through writing. In fact, the spread of civilization, religion, and the written word occurred simultaneously, each dependent on the other. The written word inspired, and the inspiration was passed on to others through the written word. All of the great religions were based on a "book"—a collection of writings—even before there were books. The Egyptians had the Book of the Dead; the Hindus had the Upanishads; the Jews had the Torah; Homer's Iliad and Odyssey told of the Greek gods; and the writings of Zoro-aster, Lao-tzu, Confucius, Buddha, the Jewish prophets, and the Greek poets made the sixth century B.C. a remarkable century indeed. Without writing and
the ability to circulate this writing (a "free press"), these traditions would have influenced very few and would probably be entirely forgotten today.

Christianity first spread due to the freedom-of-speech tradition of the Jewish synagogues: any adult Jewish male was free to have his say. Jesus (and, later, his disciples) used this freedom to spread his teachings. Although Jesus never published a word,variation of "Ain't nobody's business if she do."> selections of what he said were written down and circulated on scrolls. These "sayings" scrolls were very popular and, considering that each had to be copied by hand, they were what we would now call bestsellers—sort of a Lord's Little Instruction Book.

After the death of Jesus, the "quote books" continued to be popular and the letters (epistles) from various church fathers were copied, widely circulated, and studied. The surviving letters of Paul make up the majority of the New Testament. Thirty years or so after the death of Jesus, the sayings books were expanded by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and, later, John into the story of Jesus that we now know as the first four books of the New Testament. Four hundred years after the time of Christ, the Bible as we know it was compiled.
<p><p>
<dd>
The Bible was to become the most banned book of all time. For centuries, reading the Bible was forbidden—it was said that the ordinary person could not handle the power conveyed by direct contact with God's holy word. In fact, banning the book allowed religious and political leaders to manipulate the populace into submission, threatening eternal damnation for disobedience.
<p>
<dd>
Gutenberg's decision to use the Bible in 1455 as the first book printed on his new press is portrayed by many as an act of great faith—he was so much a man of God that he chose to print a holy book instead of a romance novel. It was, in fact, an act of rebellion—a major statement for freedom of the press.
<p>
<dd>
Prior to Gutenberg, all Bibles were copied by hand by monks in monasteries. The Catholic church had a monopoly on the production and distribution of Bibles. Not only were they very expensive, but their distribution was carefully regulated. Buying a Bible was part of a package deal: you usually had to build a chapel to house it and hire a priest (one who could read and write) to interpret it. Like buying a computer in the 1950s, it was a major commitment only a handful could afford.
<p>
<dd>
Gutenberg changed that. His Bible was relatively cheap (by Bible standards of the day), and available to anyone who could pay the price. For the first time, the word of God could be read and studied without the permission or interpretation of the holy mother church. Some say that this one act of freedom of the press was the greatest single factor behind the Reformation. The Bible, religion, Christianity, and the world would never be the same.

In our own country one book, more than any other single cause, was responsible for the revolutionary war: Common Sense by Tom Paine. This book (more a pamphlet, actually) was published in January 1776. The mood at that time in the British colonies was to continue negotiations with the mother country. A war against king and crown—the direct representatives of God on earth—was still, for many, unthinkable. Common Sense changed that. It sold more than 500,000 copies within a few months—that's one copy for every eight people living in the colonies. Certainly everyone who could read back then read it. It changed people's attitudes from placation to rebellion almost overnight.
<p>
<dd>
In July of 1776, the moment the Continental Congress approved the Declaration of Independence, it was "off to the press." Copies were printed and reprinted throughout the colonies. A good number of the colonists had read and studied it by the time the official signing took place in early August. The document was translated and widely circulated throughout Europe, where the mere possession of it in some countries was punishable by death. The Declaration fulfilled its intended purpose, and a nation prepared for war.

After the United States Constitution was written in 1787, it had to be "sold" to the electorate. This was done through a series of eighty-five articles—written primarily by James Madison and Alexander Hamilton—printed in newspapers throughout the country. The articles are now collectively known as The Federalist or The Federalist Papers. Without these, it is doubtful that the radical experiment known as the United States ever would have happened. Clearly seeing the power of the press, the founding fathers guaranteed its complete freedom in the very first amendment they added to that Constitution.

Probably the most influential book of the entire 1800s was a novel, Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. (The alternate title was Life Among the Lowly.) Published in 1852, it portrayed slaves not as chattel or animals, but as human beings, and (gasp!) portrayed their white owner, Simon Legree, as the villain. Talk about your book burnings in the South! Of the 300,000 copies sold during the first year, who knows how many were purchased in the South specifically for burning. The book and its 1853 follow-up collection of factual documents, The Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin, swayed popular opinion in the North toward the abolition of slavery. Without these books, anti-slavery might never have been a major theme of the Civil War.

In 1906, a book by Upton Sinclair, The Jungle, took a hard look at the meat-packing industry in the United States. A novel filled with many frightening and disturbing facts, The Jungle changed the way all food products were processed and packaged in the United States, and made major strides toward the enactment of worker protection and child-labor laws.

Radio found its stride in the 1930s. Some say Franklin Delano Roosevelt literally talked the nation out of its depression. By the late 1930s, while storm clouds gathered over Europe (as the more dramatic histories of the day like to put it), the mood of the American people was fiercely isolationist. "No more European wars!" was the battle cry. And yet, Americans were gently prodded into taking sides by what they heard on the radio. The major protagonists in the "European War" were England and Germany. What we heard from Germany were the unintelligible sounds of a ranting lunatic followed by the lock-stepping masses shouting, "Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Sieg heil!" England, on the other hand, had the warm, gentle, sometimes roaring, sometimes humorous voice of Winston Churchill.
Surely it would be okay to lend this nice man a few boats and lease him a few airplanes. And so, lend-lease was born, and the United States was no longer neutral.

On CBS Radio, Edward R. Murrow reported firsthand the devastation of German bombings on London during the blitz. This further tilted American sympathies toward the underdog, England. His voice did more to fight Hitler than probably any other. In 1954, he was to use television to take on yet another monster, Senator Joseph McCarthy and his witch hunt. "We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty," said Murrow on that historic telecast. "We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason if we remember that we are not descended from fearful men, not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes which were, for the moment, unpopular." In both instances, he risked his life; in both instances, he won. (He lost the battle with cigarettes, however,
dying of lung cancer in 1965.)

In our own time (well, I suppose that depends on when you were born, doesn't it?—in my own time, at any rate), we saw a president toppled by a couple of reporters, Woodward and Bernstein, who inspired thousands of young people to take up investigative journalism. Then, after Woodward and Bernstein were portrayed in the movies by Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford, tens of thousands applied to journalism schools.

Through the media we learn about our world, our life, medical breakthroughs, scientific advances, toppling regimes, the truth about history, useful news, trivial news, useful trivial news, good news, bad news—news.
<p>
<dd>
We rely on it, depend on its accuracy, and, if it turns out to be inaccurate, we expect another news organization to expose the expos. Freedom of the press is a fundamental right, up there with freedom of speech and freedom of and from religion. A free press is not a luxury; it's a necessity.
<p>
<dd>
How do consensual crimes corrupt our free press? Several ways.
<p>
<dd>
First, since committing a consensual crime is breaking the law and since breaking the law is news, reporters are often sent out looking for video on drug busts, hookers, or stories on who is sleeping with whom and whether they're married to someone else. In the end, none of this has much to do with our lives (certainly not in the way that murderers, rapists, robbers, polluters, price-fixers, and bribe-takers do). So—like the police, courts, and prisons—the reporters' time and the media's space are overburdened with fluff. And not very interesting fluff at that. (You've seen one drug bust on TV, you've seen 'em all.)"you'd think America was populated solely by naked women and cinema stars."> There's plenty of international tension, domestic strife, real crime, corruption,
and consumer activism to keep every reporter and his or her place of reporting busy, productive, highly rated, and of service to the community. There might even be a little time to dig up some good news.

Second, since consensual crimes are not based on hurting others but on religious interpretations by a handful of moralists, some journalists have been turned (some willingly, some not) into professional gossips and busybodies. Gossip is fine, gossip is entertaining, but it belongs on Entertainment Tonight and best-seller lists, not the network evening newscasts. "The things most people want to know about," wrote George Bernard Shaw, "are usually none of their business." Did Gary Hart really deserve to lose all of his political credibility because he took a boat ride with a young beauty? Mr. Hart's wife did not object; his ocean-going companion did not object; one must assume Mr. Hart himself did not object. To quote a television commercial of roughly that same time frame:
"Where's the beef?"think that commercial happened at about the same time as Gary Hart's aborted presidential campaign. I cannot be sure. History for me is broken into four phases: (1) before I was born, (2) from the time of my birth until now, (3) now, and (4) has it happened yet? I do know that both Gary Hart's being caught in adultery—not quite in the act, but at least in the yacht—and that dear lady asking "Where's the beef?" happened some time during Phase 2.> Was this one seagoing sexual misadventure really sufficient grounds to completely ignore everything political about him, everything this man stood for, spent a lifetime building, and was doing a fairly good job bringing to the arena of public discussion? Gary Hart was sacrificed to a group of yapping moralists
who claim that "an adulterer" is not fit to run for president. The yapping was served up by a "free" press bound by the chains of delivering late-breaking scandals with photos, video, and sound bites if at all possible. And what did the American people get in exchange? A truly dull campaign: Dukakis versus Reagan. Yawn. As Jay Leno observed, "Dukakis is Greek for Mondale."

Third, just as when cops need some easy collars and round up some consensual criminals, so too, reporters—when there's dead air to fill or an article to embellish—go out and round up some consensual crime stories. Need some quick video? Take a female reporter, put her in some fishnet stockings and a dress cut low enough to reveal her journalistic integrity, have her meander the sidewalk with the streetwalkers, and follow her with a hidden camera. (The camera can be hidden in a van marked ACTION   NEWS with a little satellite dish on top and you'll still get good video—men are terribly unobservant of all but one thing when their testosterone is raging.) If you really want ratings, put a male reporter in the same costume and situation.
<p>
<dd>
Finally, as with police, journalists should regain the respect they are entitled to. Reporting a lot of "trash for cash" has tarnished the good name of reportage. Remember when Walter Cronkite, as the anchor of an evening newscast, was considered "the most trusted man in America"? Why not return to those thrilling days of yesteryear? It wasn't just Walter Cronkite; Huntley and Brinkley were well respected. Brinkley's still at it, saying wonderfully honest things, such as "The one function that TV news performs very well is that when there is no news we give it to you with the same emphasis as if there were." There are, of course, other contemporary examples: Hugh Downs, Larry King, John Chancellor, and Bill Moyers.
<p>
<dd>
The press not only cheapens itself by playing tattletale and reporting the consensual exploits of others; it also "eats its young" by reporting on the consensual activities of its own. An absurd example of the latter involves an attractive female "reporter" who invited Larry King up to her hotel room, which just happened to have more hidden cameras than Allen Funt's bathroom. Well, the tape went on and on and on, and Mr. King made nary an improper move. But, dull as it was, they showed the tape anyway. After all, Larry King is a star; there's air time to fill; and, even if he didn't do anything, it will make a great teaser: "Larry King follows our reporter up to her hotel room! What happens then? Tune in tonight and find out!" (Although I don't remember the name of the show,
why do I have the sneaking suspicion it was on Fox? "All the networks are struggling now with their desire to put on live executions, if they could, to get the ratings," said Gary David Goldberg; "I think the difference is that Fox would put on naked live executions.")

IRRESPONSIBILITY IS AS old as mankind—literally. When God asked Adam, "Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?" Adam answered, "The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it." Note the dual layer of irresponsibility: Adam blames not only Eve, he also blames God for putting her with him.
<p>
<dd>
Irresponsibility is as old as womankind, too. After God heard Adam's rational lies, he turned to Eve and asked, "What is this you have done?" And Eve responded, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate." (Modern translation: "The devil made me do it!") It seems that the buck never stops in Eden. It's amazing that the serpent didn't blame its upbringing, claim it was high on drugs, or simply plead insanity. At the very least, the serpent could have argued that it was only following its religious beliefs. But responsible or not, God punished them all, and so here we all are today.
<p>
<dd>
Did you ever notice how disarming it is when people take responsibility and how irritating it is when they blame? If people spent half as much mental energy finding a way to keep an unfortunate occurrence from happening again as they spend on finding reasons why (a) what happened wasn't so bad, or (b) "It wasn't my fault," the world would be a lot better off.
<p>
<dd>
Responsibility is often confused with blame. When someone asks, "Who's responsible for this?" people often hear, "Who's to blame for this? Who can we punish?" Responsibility simply means that we are willing to accept the consequences of the choices we make. The unwillingness—and for some it appears to be a congenital inability—to accept the consequences for our choices is the definition of immaturity.

When children make a bet and lose, they get out of it by saying, "I had my fingers crossed!" So many of the explanations adults give to justify their behavior sound just as silly.
<p>
<dd>
No sooner was the term victimless crime coined than every scalawag, rascal, and down-and-dirty crook used it out of context to justify his or her genuinely criminal behavior. Michael Milken, for example, paid a public relations agency $150,000 per month to transform him in the public eye from criminal to victim. The goal, as James Stewart explains in his book, Den of Thieves, "was to turn public opinion from outrage to neutrality to acceptance, and finally to admiration." How did the PR people do this? By claiming Milken's legion of offenses, which caused plenty of innocent people to suffer, were victimless crimes. Because he didn't use a gun or a lead pipe, the PR firm did its best to convince the public that a crime without physical violence is also a crime without innocent
victims. This, of course, is nonsense, but with $150,000 a month and a few gullible journalists, you can fool some of the people some of the time.
<p>
<dd>
After the concept that Milken's transgressions were victimless crimes was swallowed by enough of the press and public, the PR agency made it look as though he was the victim. (No wonder some people hate the term victimless crime.) "The campaign was remarkably effective," reported Stewart, and the Christian Science Monitor lamented, "This episode demonstrates once more how modern public relations can manipulate public opinion. Some of the press, sadly, was sucked in by the blather."

Responsibility also means the ability to respond: no matter what happens to us, there's always some response we can make. The response is sometimes external, sometimes internal, often both. Even when one's external options are severely limited, one can choose to respond to them internally in productive and even uplifting ways. In his book, Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl recounts his experiences in a Nazi concentration camp. Subjected to physical horrors beyond imagining, Frankl learned that although he was not responsible for where he was or what was happening around him, he was responsible for his reaction to the events around him. He discovered this was a personal freedom the Nazis could not take away.

<p>
<dd>
But in our society, such courageous examples of responsibility and personal freedom are seldom discussed. We always seem to be on the lookout for who's to blame? Somehow, we think, if we can prove it's someone else's fault, it will make everything "all better." Somehow we believe that Life will comfort us in its arms, like a nurturing parent; if we can only prove we had nothing to do with our injury, we will receive extra strokes. "The tree made me fall out of it."

Although such comments may be momentarily comforting, they do very little to teach us to climb trees better. We seem to be seeking from life a giant parental "Oh, you poor thing."
<p>
<dd>
In eternally looking for someone or something outside ourselves to blame, we turn ourselves into victims. We begin to believe that we are powerless, ineffective, and helpless. "There was nothing I could do," people whine, as an affirmation of their powerlessness, rather than, "What could I have done?" or "What will I do differently next time?" This self-victimization erodes our character, our self-esteem, and our personal integrity. But we learn to whine about it so awfully well.
<p>
<dd>
The idea that certain consensual activities should be crimes helps create irresponsibility. The idea behind consensual crimes is that the government—like a great, caring parent—will protect us from the bogeyman, the wicked witch, and inhospitable trees. "We have thoroughly investigated everything," the government assures us, "and you will be safe as long as you don't do these things." To make sure we don't do those things, the government locks up everyone who attempts to lead us into temptation and, as an example, puts a few bad boys and girls away, too. (A multi-year version of "Go to your room!")

If we accept the view that government is the Great Protector, then it logically follows that whatever the government does not prohibit is okay. As we all know, this is not the case.
<p>
<dd>
Each of us is unique. We have our own set of needs, wants, tolerances, reactions, strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. Some people are deathly allergic to wheat, while others can chew double-edged razor blades. (I saw it on a newsreel once. Eeeeee!) Few people fit within the "norm" on absolutely everything. To be perfectly normal is abnormal.
<p>
<dd>
Government-set standards for personal behavior are based on the average. By making the norm the law, the government encourages us not to explore our own strengths and limitations, but to adapt and fit in as best we can to the norm. The strength and power of the diversity within us are never fully explored. Our depths are never plumbed and our heights are never scaled. We are not taught to learn from our mistakes, only to blame others for our failures. We don't discover what responses we are able to make; therefore, we never become responsible.
<p>
<dd>
This limitation creates a double danger: we may avoid the currently illegal consensual activities that could be, for us, a component of our health, happiness, and well-being (non-FDA-approved medications, for example). On the other hand, we may blithely indulge in perfectly legal consensual activities that cause us great harm (smoking is the most obvious example). At the very least, this double jeopardy is unsatisfying. At worst, it's deadly.
<p>
<dd>
Once we realize things aren't going so well, we either wake up and start exploring our response options (which can be difficult, because there's little in our cultural programming to support such action), or we decide we aren't playing society's game fully enough and try to find satisfaction by "toeing the mark" ever more vigorously.

Some people become professional victims. They complain and sue their way to riches. "I saw a little lawyer on the tube," sings Joni Mitchell, "He said, `It's so easy now, anyone can sue. Let me show you how your petty aggravations can profit you.'" In Framingham, Massachusetts, a man stole a car from a parking lot and was killed in a subsequent traffic accident. His estate sued the parking lot owner, claiming he should have done more to keep cars from being stolen. Does one smell a RAT (Run-of-the-mill Attorney Transaction)?

If people leave your house drunk and become involved in an accident, you can be held responsible, even if they insisted on leaving. If people are drunk and leaving your house, what are you supposed to do? Tackle them? Mace them and grab their keys? Shoot them, for their own protection and the protection of others?

On the other extreme, another group of people use their well-honed victim-finding mechanism to help other (often unwilling) people discover how they are screwing up their lives. "The busybodies have begun to infect American society with a nasty intolerance—a zeal to police the private lives of others and hammer them into standard forms," wrote Lance Morrow in his Time essay, "A Nation of Finger Pointers." He continues,

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>Zealotry of either kind—the puritan's need to regiment others or the victim's passion for blaming everyone except himself—tends to produce a depressing civic stupidity.

On the other side, the candlesnuffers of behavioral and political correctness enact their paradox, accomplishing intolerance in the name of tolerance, regimentation in the name of betterment.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The irony is not lost on our British brethren across the sea, from whom, two-hundred-and-some years ago, we broke in the name of liberty. "[There is] a decadent puritanism within America:" the Economist reports, "an odd combination of ducking responsibility and telling everyone else what to do." Britain—that suppresser of liberty—is, ironically, far freer with regard to consensual activities than the we're-going-to-have-a-revolution-for-freedom United States.
<p>
<dd>
Two of the basic common-sense rules of personal behavior are: (1) Make sufficient investigation before taking part in anything and (2) If you consent to do something, you are responsible for the outcome. Laws against consensual activities undermine both rules.

The situation is unfortunate but, hey, let's be responsible about it. We can't spend too much time blaming consensual crimes for irresponsible attitudes. "I'd be a responsible person if it weren't for consensual crimes!" That's irresponsible.That's Irresponsible! Each week people appear and tell their victim stories. The most irresponsible victim is named the winner (by some genuinely unfair process) and gets to choose from among three prizes. Whichever prize is chosen, the contestant gets a different one. The prize, of course, is shipped so that it arrives broken.> Whatever degree of irresponsibility we may have, let's be responsible for it.

The existence of consensual crimes is a problem to which we are able to respond. Let's work to change the laws, and, until then, in the words of Sergeant Esterhaus of Hill Street Blues, "Let's be careful out there."

THE PERFECT LAW, when broken, is followed by immediate punishment. This punishment follows in all cases, in all situations, every time the law is broken, no matter what.
<P>
<DD>
The best example of this is the law of gravity. Each time we violate the law of gravity, the consequences are immediate and consistent. If you drop something, it falls—every time. The law of gravity is not suspended for your birthday, religious holidays, or because you have friends in high places. What do we do when a law is so absolute and unrelentingly ruthless? We obey it and we forget about it. Even when something falls and breaks, we seldom blame gravity.
<P>
<DD>
And so it is with crime laws. The more likely one is to get caught, the less likely one is to commit a crime.
<P>
<DD>
There is, for example, a greater chance of being arrested and convicted for robbing a bank than for robbing a retail establishment, and a greater chance of getting caught robbing a retail establishment than a home. Criminals know this, which is why more homes are robbed than retail establishments, and more retail establishments are robbed than banks. But even house burglaries are kept in check because every burglary has a genuine victim—the owner of the house—and the crime usually gets reported to the police.
<P>
<DD>
Consensual crimes, however, by definition, have no genuine victims. If you visit a prostitute or place a bet with a bookie, neither you nor the prostitute nor the bookie is going to call the police to report the "crime." Each time a person takes part in a consensual crime, there is only a miniscule chance that person will be caught. Thus, the deterrent factor in consensual crime is almost entirely missing.

For every consensual crime arrest, there are millions of undetected, unreported, and unpunished occurrences. Some say the answer is to beef up law enforcement, make more arrests, and put 'em all "behind bars where they belong." It is just such statements—bristling with ignorance and arrogance—that have gotten us into the mess we're in today. If every person who ever committed a consensual crime were put behind bars, there would be more people behind bars than in front of them.
<P>
<DD>
"Make the punishments more severe! Set an example!" That doesn't work either. Historically, when consensual crimes were punished more severely than now—by flogging, dismemberment, burning at the stake—the incidence of consensual crimes was not abated, nor did harsh punishment "set an example" for the youth. It sometimes made the consensual crime irresistible. "If people risk torture for it," some concluded, "it must be pretty terrific."
<P>
<DD>
Each time you get in a car, there is a statistical chance you will be injured, disabled, or killed. If you knew that you were going to be involved in an accident on a particular day, chances are you wouldn't drive that day. Not knowing on what day it will occur, however, you get in your car and drive off, thinking about where you're going and what to listen to along the way, not about death on the highway. Each time someone takes part in a consensual crime, there is a chance—a statistically slim chance, but a chance—that he or she will be arrested, tried, and sentenced to prison. It is a such a small chance, however, most people don't even think about it.

The pain and suffering heaped on this random sampling, the 4,000,000 unfortunates each year who happen to be caught partaking in a consensual crime and, especially, the 750,000 currently in prison, can be eliminated overnight through legislation. We need only repeal the laws that put them in jail in the first place and grant a general amnesty for those who fell on the short side of the odds.

IF YOU HAVE LOTS OF money, you can pretty much take part in consensual crimes with impunity. (Note that not even one of Heidi Fleiss's well-heeled clients was investigated, much less arrested. She—far less rich and powerful than they—is left to hold the outrageously heavy bag.) A middle-class person runs more risk than a rich person, and a poor person runs the greatest risk of all.
<P>
<DD>
Rich people have drugs delivered by a reputable dealer who supplies "pure" drugs of uniform strength. Middle-class people go to the apartments of fairly reputable dealers, who sell drugs of varying degrees of purity and potency. Poor people go to crack houses or street corners; the dealer and potency are unknown; the impurity of the drug is guaranteed.
<P>
<DD>
In addition, crack houses established for more than a week are well known to both police and crooks. The crooks know that everybody going there has money; the police know that everyone leaving has drugs. On your way in, the crooks ask for a small donation (oh, one hundred percent) of your drug money (and, if you have it on you, your rent money, food money, and season-tickets-to-the-Philharmonic money). On your way out, the police arrest you.
<P>
<DD>
As it is with drugs, so it is with all the consensual crimes. With prostitution, the rich can afford expensive, exclusive escorts; the middle class deal with relatively safe call girls; and the poor take their chances with hookers on the streets. For legal gambling, the rich can fly to Atlantic City or Las Vegas. The middle class enjoy poker clubs or Las Vegas Nights at the local church; but the poor are stuck buying lottery tickets at the supermarket (which, as we shall see in the chapter on gambling, have worse odds than even the most crooked gambling casino).

Across the entire spectrum of consensual crimes, the poor have less selection, lower quality, more arrests, higher risks, and a far greater chance of being victims of genuine crimes.
<P>
<DD>
As we explored in the last chapter, consensual crimes are sporadically enforced. This type of arrest pattern invites a law enforcement officer to act on his or her personal prejudices, especially cultural stereotypes. The prosecutor, judge, and jury will—sometimes subconsciously—go along. "Blacks and Hispanics use drugs." "Provocatively dressed women are prostitutes." "Effeminate men are homosexuals." And on and on.
<P>
<DD>
All of this accounts for the outrageously disproportionate consensual crime arrest rates between rich and poor and between whites and blacks. According to the 1991 Uniform Crime Reports, 58% of the drug arrests were of whites versus 41% for blacks; 45% white arrests for gambling, and 47% black arrests for gambling. For prostitution, 60% white, 38% black. Vagrancy, 51% white, 47% black. This sounds evenly distributed until you consider that, in 1991, blacks composed only 12% of the U.S. population. Does this mean that blacks are more crime prone than whites? No. For a crime where there really is a victim, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, 89% of those arrested were white, only 9% black. This means that on a per capita basis, roughly the same number of blacks as whites were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics. On the other hand, also on a per capita basis, three times as many blacks were arrested for drug abuse than whites.

When focusing on a single drug, crack cocaine, the statistics are even more staggering. Here is an excerpt from a front-page story in the Sunday, May 21, 1995, issue of the Los Angeles Times (Keep in mind that the Times is one of the most anti-drug major newspapers in the country.):

<B>Cocaine: Records show federal officials almost solely prosecute nonwhites. U.S. attorney denies race is a factor.</B>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A growing chorus of scholars, civil rights advocates and clergy contend that the vast disparity in sentences between white and nonwhite crack dealers illustrates how the war on drugs has unfairly punished minorities.
<P>

Whites are more likely than any other racial group to use crack, according to surveys by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. But the U.S. Sentencing Commission reports that about 96% of the crack defendants in federal court are nonwhite. And, records show, the majority are low-level dealers, lookouts and couriers rather than drug kingpins.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A commission survey in 1992 showed that only minorities were prosecuted for crack offenses in more than half the federal court districts that handled crack cases across the country.
<P>
No whites were federally prosecuted in 17 states and many cities, including Boston, Denver, Chicago, Miami, Dallas and Los Angeles. Out of hundreds of cases, only one white was convicted in California, two in Texas, three in New York and two in Pennsylvania.
<P>
While defending themselves in court last year against accusations of discrimination, federal prosecutors in Los Angeles stated that they did not contest accusations that only minorities have been prosecuted federally for selling crack.
<P>
"Unfortunately, in this court's experience, those high in the chain of drug distribution are seldom caught and seldom prosecuted," said U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts in Los Angeles, as he gave a 10-year sentence to a young black man—a college graduate who had mailed a package containing crack.
<P>
In another Los Angeles case, U.S. District Judge Richard A. Gadbois lamented handing down a mandatory 10-year prison sentence to a welfare mother of four who was paid $52 to mail a package that, unbeknown to her, contained crack.
<P>
"This women doesn't belong in prison for 10 years for what I understand she did," Gadbois said. "That is just crazy."</FONT>

This uneven enforcement tends to support the belief held by the poor and nonwhites that the police are there to protect the rich and the white from—and at the expense of—the poor and nonwhite. The uneven enforcement increases distrust and contempt for all law enforcement among the poor and nonwhites. In these racially troubled times, it is a rift that we can ill afford.

Alcohol is used by 17% more whites than blacks (all these figures are on a per capita basis), and alcohol, society says, is fine (and legal). Marijuana is used once a week or more by twice as many blacks as whites, and marijuana, we're told, is bad. Blacks use heroin four times more often than whites and, well, heroin is so bad (we've been told), we are not to even think about it.
<P>
<DD>
On the other hand, hallucinogens are used by three times more whites than blacks, and we don't worry much about hallucinogens at all. How many peyote busts have you seen on COPS? Who was the last politician promising to "Get tough on mushrooms"? When was the last time you were warned that LSD would ruin your chromosomes? Whites use nonprescribed (illegal) tranquilizers 50% more often and stimulants twice as often as blacks, and we hear very little about these "dangers."

Wouldn't it be better for all classes of society—economic, ethnic, racial, sexual, and religious—to agree that physically harming the person or property of another is simply wrong, immoral, and will not be tolerated by rich, poor, black, white, or anyone else? Wouldn't this allow for unity within diversity? Isn't this the basis of a saner, freer, yet safer society?

Those who wish to sit smugly by, expecting police to ram the "proper" moral values down the throat of every "heathen, infidel, and low-life," may find that the heathens, infidels, and low-lifes are, to quote Paddy Chayefsky, "as mad as hell and not going to take it anymore."

Fewer than 6% of the prison population are women. At best, this means that women are more honest, peaceful, and law-abiding than men. At worst, it means that women are too smart to get caught. Whatever the reason, it's clear that men are, unquestionably, the criminal element in this country.
<P>
<DD>
The crimes for which women are arrested, however, are more likely to be consensual crimes.
<P>
<DD>
Almost 34% of the women in jail are there for drug offenses (compared with 22% of the men). In fact, there were more drug arrests of women than arrests of women for murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, and arson combined. More than 20% of the arrests for that catch-all consensual crime, "disorderly conduct," are women. And, not surprisingly, more than twice as many women are arrested for prostitution than men (the only crime in which women outnumber the men.)

Women not only commit fewer crimes; the crimes they commit tend to be crimes without victims. Consequently, enforcement of laws against consensual activities strikes more heavily against women than against men. Perhaps this is why the song, "T'aint Nobody's Biz-ness If I Do," has been recorded more by women than men.
<P>
<DD>
Meanwhile, women are more likely to be the victims of real crime (rape, obviously, and crimes such as purse-snatching, for which there is no male equivalent) than are men, and the police—diverted to catching consensual criminals—leave women unnecessarily unprotected.
<P>
<DD>
If plainclothes police officers went to high-crime areas and protected women rather than high-vice areas and arrested women, we'd all be a lot better off.

NO ONE WILL DENY that the reason some people take part in consensual crimes is personal problems. No one will deny that, for some, taking part in consensual crimes can also create or exacerbate problems.
<P>
<DD>
As long as certain consensual activities remain illegal, it is difficult for people who take part in those activities to know whether or not they have a problem (that is, a bad relationship) with any of those activities.
<P>
<DD>
It wasn't until after Prohibition was repealed that people began to face up to their drinking problems. Total abolition automatically creates its opposite: total abandon. When both extremes were removed from consuming alcohol, people could see clearly where they fell on the spectrum of "normal" alcohol consumption. Prohibition ended in 1933; the first chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous was founded a few years later. Had the cultural stereotype that everyone who drinks is a hopeless drunk and the counter-cultural stereotype of hard-drinking hero not been eliminated by Prohibition's repeal, it's doubtful that Alcoholics Anonymous would have gotten off the ground.
<P>
<DD>
As long as drugs, for example, are illegal, it's hard to say to a friend, "You might have a problem," without sounding like a bad drug-education commercial. People taking drugs have become immune to criticism: there's so much criticism, and so much of it is nonsense. (Please see the chapter, "Education, Not Legislation.") "Drug education" seems to be developed by people who know nothing about drugs. It's propaganda and justification, not education. People taking drugs eventually stop listening—even to their friends.

This is not the case with, say, alcohol. Yes, alcoholics tend to deny they have a problem (denial is a symptom of addiction), but alcoholics cannot wrap themselves in the garb of the social martyr: "My only problem is that drugs are illegal."
<P>
<DD>
Among social groups where most drugs are equally available and equally acceptable, more people can see that they have a problem. This has led to the growth of  Cocaine Anonymous, Drugs Anonymous, Potsmokers Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, the Betty Ford Clinic, and the many other drug treatment centers.
<P>

Some people don't know why they take part in illegal consensual activities, other than they're not going to let any damn busybodies tell them what to do. As St. Augustine wrote in his Confessions (circa A.D. 398),
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
Near our vineyard there was a pear tree laden with fruit that was not attractive in either flavor or form. One night, when I [at the age of sixteen] had played until dark on the sandlot with some other juvenile delinquents, we went to shake that tree and carry off its fruit. From it we carried off huge loads, not to feast on, but to throw to the pigs, although we did eat a few ourselves. We did it just because it was forbidden.
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
<P>
<DD>
If the "forbidden fruit" temptation were removed, people could choose to take part in a consensual activity or not—as they do now with alcohol—based on the risks and merits of the activity itself. When consensual activities are illegal, it's hard to tell if the motivating factor is (a) simple rebellion, (b) the natural desire for recreation, or (c) a deep-seated personal difficulty.

Problems are caused when the balance is off, when the relationship with something (often ourselves) is not good. When activities are prohibited, it's difficult to explore that balance; it's hard to evaluate the relationship. The laws against consensual activities tend to hide the potential problems from the people who need to know about them most: the people taking part in the activities.
<P>
<DD>
If one doesn't realize he or she has a problem, one will not seek effective treatment. (Being sentenced by a court to a treatment center does very little good except, possibly, to keep someone out of jail.) Solving a problem takes personal commitment, and that commitment comes through recognition. Keeping consensual crimes crimes, blocks that recognition.

<dd>LONG, LONG BEFORE  the white man traveled on hempen sails to find religious freedom in a New World, the natives on a land now called North America used sacramental plants to commune with nature, the universal brotherhood, and the Great Spirit.
<p>
<dd>The Incas chewed coca leaves, but only for spiritual purposes and only with the permission of their spiritual leader, the Inca. The conquistadors from Spain turned what was once a sacrament into a reward for work and, later, a stimulant for the energy to do more work. Changing the purpose and use of coca leaves was but one part of the European destruction of a great civilization.
<p>
<dd>Indigenous tribes throughout North America ate the buds of the peyote cactus as an expression of thanksgiving, a request for guidance, or in support of a brother who wanted to give thanks or seek direction. Peyote was always used in a formal, ceremonial way, and "recreational" use was considered a sacrilege. It took the white man—who knew or cared so little about the Native American way—until 1899 to find out what was going on and, of course, make it illegal. Oklahoma passed a law against peyote in 1899; New Mexico outlawed it in 1929. Not until the 1960s, when a sufficient number of white people began seeking mystical experience, was peyote considered "a menace" that had to be controlled nationally.

<dd>Humans have always sought ways to alter everyday consciousness. This is usually achieved either through changes in normal behavior, or by ingesting a consciousness-altering substance.
<p>
<dd>We "civilized" types—descendants of the primitive Native Americans' conquerors—have a strong bias that religious experiences should be obtained through altered action rather than sacramental ingestion. Prayer, fasting, penance, and personal sacrifice are all acceptable forms of achieving greater connection with God and Spirit. Ingesting chemicals, sacramental plants, or other consciousness-altering substances is not.
<p>
<dd>What we are aware of and that we are aware at all is due to a complex biochemical-electrical process in the human nervous system. A slight alteration creates a shift in consciousness. Any number of stimuli can trigger the chemical-electrical shift that leads to the change in consciousness.
<p>
<dd>All the "acceptable" techniques for achieving religious experiences involve chemical change. Prayer is changing one's focus—altering what one is thinking. Fasting causes a significant biochemical change. Even the "born again" experience as practiced by many churches is based on psychological pressure ("You are a sinner and you will spend all eternity in hell") and release ("Accept Jesus and you will spend all eternity in paradise"), which produces profound biochemical change.
<p>
<dd>When we have a shift in consciousness, our belief determines whether or not the shift is perceived as a religious experience. If we connect a certain positive feeling with God, each time we have that feeling we think of God. If we attach that same pleasant feeling to our spouse, each time we feel that feeling, we will think of our spouse. If we attach the same feeling to our favorite television program, each time we feel that feeling, we will think of our favorite television program, and so on.

<dd>A change of consciousness is an experience. If we choose to give that experience religious meaning, it becomes a religious experience. If we choose to associate it with someone we are in love with, it becomes a romantic experience. If we choose to associate it with our favorite television show, it becomes a video experience. We could even choose to associate it with something wicked and evil ("This is the devil tempting me" or "I'm having a psychotic episode"), and the same experience becomes a negative one.
<p>
It takes very little chemical change to bring about a profound shift in consciousness. LSD, for example, is not measured in milligrams, or thousandths of a gram, but in micrograms—millionths of a gram. As few as 25 micrograms—that is, twenty-five millionths of a gram—can bring about a profound change in consciousness that lasts many hours. After Dr. Albert Hofmann accidentally ingested LSD on April 16, 1943, he described his experiences :
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
<dd>I was seized with a feeling of great restlessness and mild dizziness. At home, I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant delirium, which was characterized by extremely excited fantasies. In a semiconscious state, with my eyes closed (I felt the daylight to be unpleasantly dazzling), fantastic visions of extraordinary realness and with an intense kaleidoscopic play of colors. After about two hours this condition disappeared.

<dd>Note that there's not much talk about God in there. In fact, at first psychiatrists thought the LSD experience closely resembled the delirium of extreme schizophrenia and explained, perhaps, the paintings of Vincent van Gogh. He was not interpreting those swirling sunflowers and "turbulent indigo" (Joni Mitchell's phrase) skies—he was painting what he saw. LSD, it was thought, should be taken by therapists to better understand the working of the schizophrenic mind, or by architects so that they might better design mental institutions to be healing and comforting places from an "insane" person's point of view.
<P>
<dd>Others thought LSD would be useful in therapy because it produced such a pronounced shift from ordinary consciousness. If insane people could be sufficiently jarred from their insanity—even for a brief period of time—perhaps their reality could be restructured, through therapy, into a healthier pattern.
<p>
<dd>Still others—such as author Aldous Huxley and Harvard professors Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert—thought that LSD opened the "doors of perception" (as Huxley called it) through which human consciousness could glimpse mystical visions. They maintain that LSD opened the consciousness through which all the great spiritual teachers—Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Krishna, Jesus, Mohammed, and others—had their insights and revelations.
<p>
<dd>Some thought LSD produced psychoses; others thought it produced enlightenment. How people approached the experience significantly influenced the results of the experience.
<p>
<dd>Those who took LSD thinking it was going to simulate schizophrenia left the LSD experience thinking, "Oh, that's what it's like to be crazy." Many who took LSD expecting mystical revelation got mystical revelation.
<p>
<dd>In the 1960s and early 1970s, hundreds of thousands—perhaps millions—accepted the Huxley-Leary-Alpert interpretation of LSD and, for the most part, had experiences they would describe as spiritual.

<dd>The "set and setting" was vitally important. The set was the mind-set: One had to ask oneself, "Am I taking part in this experience for kicks or for illumination?" The latter was recommended. The setting was the environment in which you took LSD, whom you were taking it with, what physical activities were planned: music, silence, readings aloud from the New Testament or the Tibetan Book of the Dead. In properly planned sessions one had a guide who had had the experience before, to provide safety, support, and encouragement.
<p>
<dd>Less than ten years later, by the mid-1970s, people were "dropping acid" on the way to the disco. "The Bee Gees! Jesus!" the psychedelic old-timers would lament. "What happened to the Beatles? And why are they going to a disco? If they want to go out, why don't they go to a real religious experience—like seeing 2001: A Space Odyssey in Cinerama?"
<p>
<dd>Soon "acid" became synonymous with any orally ingested consciousness-altering substance: tranquilizers, strychnine, it didn't matter. People were looking for a "trip," not a journey; a "high," not a higher state of consciousness. 
<P>
<DD>
Some of the original "mystical" LSD takers went on to explore God in more traditional ways: LSD was advertised as only one door to the house of perception; how you moved in was up to you. Richard Alpert took an ancient route, went to India, and became Ram Dass. Timothy Leary took the techno route and became fascinated with space travel, computers, and cyberspace. Whatever the outcome, LSD was a bright flash between the black and white '50s and the technicolor '70s. What people did with that flash was and is entirely up to them.

<dd>Throughout history, humans have sought the tree of life. People have tried to "return to the garden" by ingesting substances from the plant, mineral, and animal kingdoms. Some worked; most didn't.
<p>
<dd>Alas, in our country today sincere seekers cannot seek in this way. They are entitled to use the traditional methods as much as they please—but only those tried and accepted by "our Judeo-Christian forefathers." People can pray, fast, join a monastery or convent, become missionaries, and that's okay. Changing consciousness through external actions that produce internal chemical reactions is acceptable. Ingesting chemicals is not. If you do, you are not taking part in a sacrament, but committing a sacrilege. You will be punished for it not only in the hereafter, but here.
<p>
<dd>We'll explore further the absurdity of jailing people for religious beliefs in the chapter, "Unconventional Religious Practices." The point of this chapter is: although ingesting chemicals may not be part of the Judeo-Christian tradition, it certainly has a long and dignified history in the human tradition. To deny Americans—native or immigrant—the right to explore chemical sacraments is not only an interference with our religious freedom, but yet another example of imposing Judeo-Christian religious beliefs on others by force of law.
<p>
<dd>An understandably quiet movement of sincere, well-educated ("they have more degrees than a protractor," comments the Los Angeles Times) individuals is exploring anew the value of psychedelics. Today the "mind expanding" chemicals are often referred to as empathogens (empathy producing) or entheogens (become one with theos, God). And—shock and joy—the FDA is giving begrudging approval to limited research.

<dd>"We're like early man who says fire is too dangerous," says Rick Doblin, Harvard-trained social scientist and spokesperson for the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. "We're not even at the stage where we've figured out that fire can keep you warm in winter." MAPS is a nonprofit group that tracks the handful of approved psychedelic research projects throughout the United States.
<p>
<dd>The preliminary research has been encouraging, especially when empathetic chemicals are used in conjunction with the therapeutic process. "Psychotherapy is enhanced by an altered-state experience," said Charles S. Grob, M.D., one of the lead researchers of MDMA ("ecstasy") use in therapy. In other studies, using chemicals such as MDMA, MDA, and LSD has resulted in significant progress treating recidivism, sexual dysfunction, depression, and addiction, among many others.
<p>
<dd>Of course, even these token research programs are under fire and, by the time you read this, may have been halted altogether by ignorance and misplaced grief. One of the primary organizations challenging any research is Drug Watch International. This was formed by Dr. William Bennett (not the former Drug Czar turned bestselling pontiff on morality, but another one—how many can we take?) and his wife, Sandra, after "losing our son to cocaine in 1986."

<dd>This sort of kill-the-messenger response was echoed by actor Carrol O'Connor, who, in his grief following the suicide of his son, blamed it all on his son's drug dealer, who was promptly arrested.

(The dealer was sentenced to a year in prison.)

<DD>How does one explain to a parent grieving for a lost child that putting other parents' children in prison is not the solution? No one, apparently, has found the way to communicate this to the Bennetts. "Illicit drugs are illicit because they're harmful," they claim in circular, ignorance-perpetuating logic.
<p>
<dd>In fact, research has shown drugs in general and psychedelics in particular to be far less harmful than formerly feared. In 1995, UCLA's Ronald K. Siegel, one of the few researchers permitted to perform scientific studies on LSD after the blanket governmental ban in 1970, reported,

<dd>Meanwhile, a much larger group of individualists—just as sincere but lacking governmental sanction—explore their psyches, their world, their loved ones, their lives, and their God with entheogens.

<dd>MDMA was first synthesized in 1912. In the early 1980s, it was rediscovered and named ecstasy. "I wanted to call it empathy," its rediscoverer said, "but I thought ecstasy would sell better." It did—perhaps too much better. It was banned in 1986, when after enthusiastic articles in (among other publications) The Wall Street Journal, Time, and Newsweek—a bureaucrat in Washington decided it should be banned.
<p>
<dd>MDA, a naturally occurring chemical with empathetic effects similar to MDMA, is found in more than seventy plants as well the human brain. When the chemicals the body produces to suppress the effects of MDA are suppressed, small doses of MDA can produce powerful results. "The heart opens," one psychiatrist explained in nonpsychiatric terms.
<p>
<dd>While MDMA is still illegal, the plants containing MDA are not. (Think they'll ever get around to banning nutmeg, green tea, or the kola nut?) These plants are sold by various companies working entirely within the law.
<p>
<dd>For the most part, these enthogens are taken not as a high, but as a sacrament—a sacrament not to meant placate a vengeful God "out there," but to celebrate the essence of God within us all.

<DD>HOW CAN SOMETHING start out so good and become so bad? That's the question I ask myself each time I think about the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It began as a good idea, designed to educate and protect the citizens of the United States. Now it regularly raids alternative healers, keeps healing and rejuvenative drugs away from those who might benefit from them, dictates what is and is not proper healing, and wants to severely limit our ability to buy vitamins, minerals, and other nutritional supplements. The FDA has, like Dr. Frankenstein's experiment, gone awry.
<P>
<DD>In the early 1900s, prepared foods and packaged medicines were a mess. As Upton Sinclair described in The Jungle, his 1906 expos of the meatpacking industry, meatpackers would pack anything into skins—sawdust, rat droppings, the digestive tracts of animals and all that they contained—and sell it as "pure beef sausage." One could never be sure if a quart of beef stew contained an entire quart of beef stew—or even if it contained beef. Over-the-counter "patent" medicines did not list ingredients or strength of concentration on the label. Or they might claim to contain medicines and be nothing but sugar-water in an imposing bottle.
<P>
<DD>Normally, it would be left to the states to regulate food and drugs through local health codes, honest-weight restrictions, and other regulatory laws. With improvements in packaging, transportation, and marketing, however, by the turn of the century many products were traveling across state lines. This brought them under the jurisdiction of the federal government: regulation of interstate commerce was one of the powers enumerated to Congress.

<DD>In 1906, Congress passed the Pure Food and Drug Act, which established that foods and drugs should be "unadulterated," and that their contents be clearly labeled. This was a much-needed regulation. The act, however, had this little loophole: What is "adulterated" and who decides what is adulterated?
<P>
<DD>Ironically, according to the book, The Big Drink: The Story of Coca-Cola by E. J. Kahn, Coca-Cola was taken to court by the government for marketing a "mislabled" product. In 1903, Coca-Cola had replaced "the real thing," cocaine, with caffeine (it was cheaper). Coca-Cola was in trouble not because it contained cocaine, but because it didn't. The case continued in court for nine years, and Coca-Cola eventually agreed to make changes in its manufacturing process and to list its ingredients—which included neither coca nor kola.
<P>
<DD>In 1927, the enforcement of the law moved from the Bureau of Chemistry (a division of the Department of Agriculture) into its own bureaucratic structure: the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration—a formidable, respectable name if there ever was one. Not surprisingly, in 1931 it dropped the Insecticide from its title and became the Food and Drug Administration.
<P>
<DD>The FDA was then given the power to ban "harmful" additives. By what criteria do we define "harmful"? If a chemical has a known lethal dose, should it be prohibited? If that were the case, salt could never be used as an additive. For the most part, whatever the FDA decided was harmful was harmful. The decisions were (and are) capricious at best.

<DD>Over time, the FDA also grew to encompass regulation over all medical techniques, practices, and devices. The original Pure Food and Drug Act (also known as the "Wiley Act") only required that food not be "adulterated" or "misbranded" when shipped across state lines. In 1912, the act was amended to prohibit false therapeutic claims. The problem with that is the same as determining what is "harmful": Who is to say what is and is not therapeutic?
<P>
<DD>For example, the placebo effect is a scientifically proven fact: if people take an absolutely worthless substance and believe it's going to make them better, it tends to make about a third of the people better. Bona fide, licensed, reputable physicians use placebos every day—with the approval of both the Food and Drug Administration and the American Medical Association. The doctor will charge the full amount for an office visit, write a prescription, send the patient to a pharmacy to pay a large amount of money for sugar pills. And insurance companies knowingly and willingly pay the bills. Whether it's belief in the doctor, in the pills, in getting out of the house and paying some money, or a combination of all those factors, one thing is certain: many people who take the sugar pills get better faster than people who are told by the doctor, "There's nothing I can do about this; it will have to run its course."
<P>
<DD>And so it was with the patent medicines. If advertising copy (and patent medicines were the largest advertisers in the country at the turn of the century) could convince you that Mother's Soothing Syrup would cure your cold, for a certain number of people, the cold got cured sooner than it would absent Mother's Soothing Syrup. If the medicine didn't work, the most the government could do was require that the manufacturer issue a refund.

<DD>The 1912 law put the burden of proof on the government: a manufacturer had to be clearly defrauding the public. This was not stringent enough, however, and in 1938 the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was passed. Since then it has been up to the manufacturer to prove—scientifically—that its drugs are effective. Good-bye placebo effect. (For patent medicines, at least. For the AMA and "legitimate" pharmaceutical companies—fine!)
<P>
<DD>While the spirit behind strengthening the FDA was certainly a good one, the results have been anything but. Yes, we can buy foods relatively free of rat droppings (FDA guidelines restrict the amount of animal droppings and insect parts permitted in foods, but do not prohibit them altogether), and while it's good to know that hemorrhoid cream has actually shrunk a "hemorrhoidal tissue" here or there, much of the FDA's current activity amounts to dictating what does and does not heal people and prohibiting the latter.
<P>
<DD>Just as people should have the freedom to find and worship God as they choose, so too should they have the freedom to maintain and enhance their own health as they choose.
<P>
<DD>The FDA neither believes nor supports this contention. Only medicine as the FDA and the AMA (it's hard to tell them apart most of the time) define medicine is medicine. Everything else is quackery. Quackery, according to the FDA, is not just misguided medical practices that American consumers need to be educated about; quackery is fundamentally evil, and those who traffic in it—both suppliers and consumers—must be punished.

It was recognized that no drug is truly safe unless it is also effective, and effectiveness was required to be established before marketing—one of the major advances of medical history.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DD>How can one equate safety with effectiveness? A safe drug is one I can put in my body and know that, as long as I take it in recommended doses, will not cause me to shrivel up and die. An effective drug is something else again. Yes, if one takes an ineffective drug when one could, instead, be taking an effective drug, the illness  may become worse, and this is not good. To say, however, that the ineffective drug is not safe is confusing the issue and torturing the language. Saying a drug cures something that it does not makes the manufacturer guilty of false advertising, not of marketing unsafe substances.

<DD>The most the government should be able to do is warn the consumer of the potential risks—which include the risk that the drug or medical procedure may not be effective at all. Instead of giving certain products the "FDA seal of approval," the FDA wants to remove all products that it has not approved. The FDA also wants to arrest those products' manufacturers. I shouldn't say the FDA wants to do this—it's doing it right now.
<P>
<DD>According to Science magazine, it costs, on average, $231,000,000 and takes twelve years to do the necessary testing on a drug to receive FDA approval. If difficulties arise in the testing stage, the cost can be considerably more. This sheer financial burden keeps any number of useful drugs off the market. Pharmaceutical companies often don't bother with the necessary testing on promising drugs because they doesn't feel they will make back their investments. Even if a pharmaceutical company moves full speed ahead, cures are still, for the most part, twelve years from market. The FDA guidelines are known to be so strict and so all-pervasive that clothing manufacturer Lees can say of its Relaxed Riders jeans: "If they were any more relaxing, we'd need FDA approval."
<P>
<DD>Even worse than suppressing newly discovered drugs is the fact that drugs discovered years ago will never receive FDA approval and therefore can never be marketed. Who is going to spend twelve years and $231,000,000 proving the safety and effectiveness of a drug that anyone can then manufacture? No pharmaceutical company in the known world, that's for sure.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
As Jonas Salk has often remarked, it would be impossible to repeat his polio work today, when such ventures need to be passed by human-subject review boards and peer review boards and various other qualifying agencies. In 1952 you got the permission of the people involved and went out and did it, and then wrote up your results in a scientific journal. If something terrible happened, the blame would be on your head and the blood on your hands, and of course your career would be over—but in the planning stages, at least, life was a great deal easier for the medical experimenter than it has since become.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DD>By today's standards, the Salk vaccine (which was used widely starting in 1953) would not have been available until the mid-1960s—providing that Dr. Salk could have found a pharmaceutical company willing to gamble $231,000,000 on his vaccine. With current FDA guidelines, polio might be a common disease even today.

They came to Beth-saida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him. He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, "Do you see anything?"
<P>
He looked up and said, "I see people; they look like trees walking around."
<P>
Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. (Mark 8:22–25)
<P>
There some people brought a man to him who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man.
<P>
After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, "Ephphatha!" (which means, "Be opened!"). At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. (Mark 7:32–35)

In medical school I was taught that the only tools that work to help people are drugs and surgery. In the twenty years since then, I have seen that much of what I was taught is just plain wrong.

The medical establish-ment has been wrong about the big killers and cripplers like heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and arthritis. Wrong about the origins of these diseases. And wrong about how to remedy them. Their record is shameful.

<DD>Traditional Western medicine is known as symptomatic medicine. It diagnoses and treats symptoms. This is fine—and for the elimination of certain symptoms there is nothing like symptomatic medicine. To pretend, however, that symptomatic medicine represents the full range of healing and health enhancements available is a severely limited view. In fact, the two reasons (neither of them medical) the human life span has tripled in the past 400 years are plumbing, which took septic waste away from homes, streets, and cities; and transportation, which made fresh fruits and vegetables available year-round. The majority of lives saved by modern medical science can be summed up by the Three A's: Anesthesia (which permits surgery), Antiseptics, and Antibiotics.
<P>
<DD>While symptomatic medicine is marvelous, it does not justify our current attitude, which was summed up by George Bernard Shaw: "We have not lost faith, but we have transferred it from God to the medical profession." Many of the alternative methods of obtaining, maintaining, and enhancing health should be, if not encouraged, at least not forbidden by the FDA.

<DD>Not that genuine, bonafide, certified quacks don't exist. They do. But these charlatans would best be put out of business by a few civil lawsuits from disgruntled patients than from the meddling of the government, which is generally too slow to act and then overreacts.
<P>
<DD>The Food and Drug Administration is intimately connected with the American Medical Association as well as the handful of pharmaceutical companies which create and manufacture the majority of prescription drugs. Working at the FDA, being on the board of the AMA, and working for any of the large pharmaceutical companies is like playing musical chairs. The high-paying jobs—the gold ring on the merry-go-round—are at pharmaceutical companies. The best way to get a raise is to become a "public servant" for a couple of years and spend some time at the FDA or AMA.
<P>
<DD>Politicians frequently own pharmaceutical stocks. For example, when George Bush became vice-president, the New York Times reported, "The Vice President still owned the Eli Lilly stock upon taking office. It was his most valuable stock holding." Dan Quayle's family owns an enormous amount of stock in Eli Lilly. When Bush left the CIA in 1977, he was made the director of Eli Lilly (appointed by Dan Quayle's father), a post he held until 1979 when he began running for vice-president (with a generous campaign contribution from guess who).
<P>
<DD>While vice-president, Bush made what the New York Times called "an unusual move" when he "intervened with the Treasury Department in March in connection with proposed rules that would have forced pharmaceutical companies to pay significantly more taxes" (New York Times, May 19, 1982).

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
The U.S. government's recommended daily allowances (RDA) for vitamins and minerals are insufficient. Powerful food lobbies work overtime to keep these figures low. A nutrition label may proudly state it contains 100% of the RDA for Vitamin C. And since the RDA for Vitamin C is only 60 mg per day, the product looks good. But consider that some medical research puts the optimal intake of Vitamin C at 3,000 mg per day. Now, the manufacturer's claim seems ridiculous, as it contains only 2% of the optimal intake.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DD>And now the FDA wants to limit vitamin supplements to the recommended daily allowance. Larger doses would require a doctor's prescription. This means (a) doctors will be paid to write the prescriptions and (b) only certain authorized pharmaceutical companies will be able to manufacture the pills. Is the FDA really concerned that some of us are taking too much vitamin C?

<DD>The FDA does not, by the way, sit quietly in Washington rubber-stamping its approval or disapproval on various proposals. It has its own army of armed agents who—augmented by state and local law enforcement authorities—make raids. For example, here is how Saul Kant, director of the Life Extension Institute, described a typical FDA raid:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
On February 26, 1987, an armed force of about 25 FDA agents, U.S. marshals, and members of the Hollywood, Florida, police department smashed down the glass doors of our store at 2835 Hollywood Boulevard, and stormed into our nearby warehouse with guns drawn. As Bill Feloon, the vice president of the Foundation, was trying to leave the warehouse to find out what was going on at the building, he suddenly found himself staring down the barrel of a .45 caliber pistol, which belonged to a member of a second group of FDA agents, U.S. marshals, and police officers, who were simultaneously attacking the warehouse.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DD>The FDA can, overnight, put a nutritional supplement manufacturer out of business.
<P>
<DD>To say that the FDA sometimes overreacts is an understatement. When some truly despicable person laced Tylenol with cyanide in 1982, resulting in seven deaths, what did the FDA do? The answer you'll discover every time you open a bottle or a package of practically anything—tamper-resistant packaging. Notice it's called tamper-resistant packaging and not tamper-proof packaging. That's because no packaging is truly tamper-proof. Any deranged person with a hypodermic needle can poison any product wrapped in plastic, paper, or cellophane. To make the food and drug supply truly tamper-proof would require metal and glass packaging for everything from candy bars to loaves of bread to boxes of cereal.

<DD>Nonetheless, the FDA requires certain tamper-resistant packaging on certain consumable products. How much time do you spend each day removing tamper-resistant packaging? If it's only a minute a day, over 70 years of package opening, you will have wasted 425 hours thanks to FDA overreaction. More than 17 days (and these are 24-hour days) of your life will be spent complying with an FDA regulation which fails to solve a problem we no longer have.
<P>
<DD>Fortunately, whoever was insane enough to poison Tylenol in the first place stopped doing it. Voluntarily. And, thankfully, there have been few "copycat" occurrences. But this had nothing to do with tamper-resistant packaging. If some nut wants to randomly poison innocent people, he or she still can.
<P>
<DD>It is our right to seek the health care we choose.

<dd>Yes, it is a distorted way of looking at it. It is, however, the same distortion people apply to prostitution. Some people become prostitutes because they like it; others become prostitutes because they feel they are providing a service; many become prostitutes because—all things considered—it's the best job they can get. 
<P>
<DD>But isn't prostitution degrading?
<p>
<dd>Other than the unjustified cultural taboos against it, prostitution is no more degrading than any other job, and, in talking with prostitutes, one discovers that many find prostitution less degrading than other jobs.
<p>
<dd>"I make good money. That's why I do it," commented one prostitute; "if I worked at McDonald's for minimum wage, then I'd feel degraded."

<dd>One of the myths about prostitution is that it is full of drugged-out, washed-out, otherwise worthless men and women. This is not the case. "I find that the women, generally, are ambitious, clever, intelligent, gregarious, and usually like people," says Margo St. James, founder of C.O.Y.O.T.E.., the organization for prostitutes' rights. C.O.Y.O.T.E. stands for Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics. "The profession itself is not abusive; it's the illegality; it's the humiliation and degradation that is dealt to them at the hands of the police."

<dd>Norma Jean Almodovar agrees, and she knows whereof she speaks: Ms. Almodovar was a Los Angeles police officer for ten years and, tired of police corruption and genuinely immoral acts she was asked to condone daily, she quit and became a prostitute. If a prostitute went on to become a police officer, her prostitute friends would probably throw her a party. When a police officer became a prostitute, however, the police considered it a personal insult and felt they had to do something about it. They did. She was targeted, entrapped, and jailed. Ms. Almodovar's story is told in her 1993 book, <I>Cop to Call Girl: Why I Left the LAPD to Make an Honest Living as a Beverly Hills Prostitute</I>. In her book, she gives her views on whether or not prostitution is degrading:
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
That really depends on the individual involved or how one views sex. It was not degrading to me because I think that sex is a positive, nurturing act, and whether it is given out of love or rendered as a service, as long as it is consensual it is still positive.
<p>
On a scale of the pain or pleasure human beings can inflict on each other, if murder, rape, and torture are the worst, certainly giving another person an orgasm must be among the best. I cannot fathom how one could think that making another human being feel good for a fee could be degrading or demeaning unless it is degrading to make other people feel good.
<p>
If the reason society continues to arrest men and women who engage in prostitution is that it is degrading, then perhaps someone could explain how going to jail, being strip-searched, checked for lice, and asked to undress in front of dozens of insensitive guards and inmates somehow resolves this problem. Jail and prison were degrading to me, not prostitution.

<dd>When asked if prostitution is immoral, Ms. Almodovar replied,
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
Morality is the belief of the person. I don't consider it immoral. Everyone who works "sells" one or more parts of his or her body. Athletes, actors, actresses, and construction workers "sell" their body. The body is what is needed to engage in physical work. It would be difficult to engage in any profession without the use and therefore "sale" of one's body.
<p>
Perhaps because the genitalia are involved, people object to prostitution. In a free country people should be able to engage in behavior that others find immoral or objectionable as long as no force or fraud is involved. As an adult I feel confident that I can make my own moral judgments. For me it is not immoral to make other people feel good in a sexual way and receive payment for providing the service.

<dd>People are often surprised to learn that many prostitutes actually enjoy their work. Like all professionals who feel they are filling a need, prostitutes can feel a profound psychological satisfaction. Here is what Barbara, a Los Angeles prostitute, had to say:
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
I derive a great deal of satisfaction knowing that I'm turning some guy on, more than he's ever been turned on in his life. And I know I'm turning him on more than his wife. That's not that difficult to do, because the average American housewife, from what I've been able to tell through the husband, most definitely is not very adept. Most of them have this typical Anglo-Saxon–American guilt complex, and use sex as a tool against their husbands. They definitely don't know how to give pleasure to their husband.

<dd>Which brings us to the question, "Why do people visit prostitutes?" First, we must accept that sex and the desire to be touched in a nurturing way are human needs, like eating. (If not a need, after enough time they're certainly high on the list of wants.)
<p>
<dd>Sex always involves some sort of exchange. Those who are attractive enough exchange their attractiveness with other people—their attractiveness is the coin with which they pay for sex. Some people have a good personality; they trade charm for sex. Others spend time with and do things for the people (or person) they have sex with. Some people exchange the exclusivity of their emotional affection, tenderness, and care. The list of what people "spend" in order to have sexual and sensual needs fulfilled goes on and on.
<p>
<dd>Those who are too busy, not very attractive, too shy, or who simply don't want to be bothered with the dating game sometimes visit prostitutes. People also visit prostitutes because they want a walk on the wild side; some have a specific sexual fantasy they would like fulfilled. (Here, I am not necessarily talking about outrageously kinky things: many men, for example, visit prostitutes simply to receive oral sex—The Hugh Grant Syndrome, Part IV.)
<p>
<dd>There is no more need to pity or censure someone who visits prostitutes than there is to pity someone who doesn't always get home-cooked meals. Perhaps the person doesn't want all that comes with home-cooked meals. Perhaps the person hasn't found someone who wants to stay home and cook his or her meals. Or perhaps the person is simply tired of home-cooked meals and wants a little variety. As Sophie Tucker explained, "All men like a little piece of mutton on the side." And a good many women, too.

<dd>Some people are hypocritical about their purchase of sex: they know their interest in another is primarily sexual and will "buy" that person with candy, flowers, dinners, shows, concerts, gifts, and, perhaps, a few words of affection. They might even pay for sex by using the magic word that flings open the portals of sexual pleasure—<I>love</I>.
<p>
<dd>People on the receiving end of this are sometimes deceived, but often they're just playing the game, too. They want the attention, flattery, companionship, presents, and experiences ("I haven't been to that new restaurant, have you?") and are willing to trade sex for those.
<p>
<dd>There are two reasons prostitution is so despised in our culture: hatred of women and the taboos against paganism. In ancient times (pre-1985) women were valued for either domestic abilities (having children, raising children, keeping house, making clothes, cooking food) or entertainment (sex, pleasant talk, sex, dancing, sex, and sex). As women were not viewed as human beings but as necessary (and often burdensome) means to an end, a split developed—what we now call the "madonna/whore complex." A woman is either put on a pedestal, protected, taken care of, seen as "the mother of my children and the light of my life"; or she is used for sex, emotionally and perhaps physically abused, and seen as nothing more than "a slut." In the minds of many men, women must fall into one of these two categories. One seldom goes from the whore category to the madonna category, but the slide from madonna to whore (at least in the eyes of the man) is fairly common.

<dd>In the ancient Judaic culture, for example, the only woman with independence was the prostitute. All professions were filled by men. Everything was owned by men. The only valuable commodity a woman was allowed to own was her body and her charm. Women became whores because they didn't want to prostitute themselves to one man in marriage.
<p>
<dd>What men really resented about prostitution was the woman's independence.
<p>
<dd>In pagan cultures, however, women could aspire to a parallel but very different profession: temple (or sacred) prostitute. Pagans believed that physical pleasure signified the presence of the gods. Sexual pleasure—among the greatest of physical pleasures—was one of the gods' greatest gifts. Not only was sex pleasurable, it was essential to fertility, and fertility was life. The fertile ground gave its crops; the fertile livestock gave their young; the fertile trees gave their fruit. Human fertility was necessary for the propagation of the species. Everything was viewed in sexual terms: the rain falling on the receptive earth, the seed planted in the receptive ground, the net thrown into the receptive sea.
<p>
<dd>In this system, the feminine (receptive) quality was not just appreciated; it was worshiped. The temple prostitute—whether female or male—developed this quality to an art.

<dd>The temple prostitute performed many functions. She was the High Priestess (or he was the High Priest) of the temple. She or he would make offerings to the goddess or god of the temple, explore erotic visual delights through dance, play music, write and recite poetry, prepare sumptuous food, and concoct potions of love. The temple prostitute was, of course, also well trained in the arts of massage, touch, and erotic stimulation.
<P>
<dd>Sex was a sacrament; orgasm, a religious experience. The community respected and revered the sacred prostitute as much as any other priest or priestess. Prostitution was a high calling, an honorable and exalted position.
<p>
<dd>In Judaism and, later, Christianity, paganism did not fit. In the Old Testament, God demanded obedience, not orgasm. The temple prostitute was a sign of civilization, of refinement. For the Jews to wander in the desert for forty years and be successful warriors, all this pagan frivolity had to go. Among the most popular of the pagan frivolities—not surprisingly—was the temple prostitute. 
<P>
<DD>In the New Testament, Paul (in particular) denounced pagan practices at every opportunity. Paul speaks specifically against the temple prostitutes, not prostitution in general. Paul is condemning all pagan practices—the work of the temple prostitute being just one of them.

<dd>Sex being their profession, prostitutes are better versed in the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases than the average "amateur." Just as doctors, dentists, and other healthcare workers routinely put on rubber gloves for standard medical procedures, so too do prostitutes routinely insist customers wear condoms. Most prostitutes, in fact, have techniques for applying condoms that are nonobtrusive and erotic.
<p>
<dd>Where prostitution is legal, prostitutes are professionals. They know how to protect themselves and their clients. For example, a study of 535 prostitutes working in legal Nevada brothels showed that none of them was infected with HIV. Prostitutes also show a lower incidence than the general public of all other sexually transmitted diseases. Prostitutes know how to (discreetly) examine a client for signs of sexually transmitted diseases. They know what herpes sores look like, for example, and are not going to fall for the I-just-caught-it-in-my-zipper deception. Prostitutes also know how to satisfy their clients in safe ways even if the client does have a sexually transmitted disease. (Masturbation, for example, can be erotic and safe.)
<p>
<dd>In study after study, prostitutes who are not intravenous drug users have a lower rate of HIV infection than the general population. Prostitutes do not spread AIDS any more than drug use spreads AIDS. What spreads AIDS is unsafe sex and the use of contaminated needles. When the purchase of sex is legalized and the use of drugs is legalized, both of these transmission routes will be almost completely eliminated.

<dd>Prostitution is not disgusting, but what's happening today in connection with prostitution is. In several cities, the names of men arrested for soliciting prostitutes are published in the newspaper. These men have not been convicted, mind you—just arrested. Some cities send letters to wives and employers. Spurred by the laws, vigilante groups of moralists have formed. One group writes down license numbers of cars driving in areas known for prostitution, gets the owner's address from the department of motor vehicles (which cooperates in this "effort"), and calls the wives and employers telling them drivers were seen "looking for prostitutes." Some cities use the assets forfeiture laws and confiscate cars—permanently—even for a first offense.

<dd>The police are thoroughly corrupted by the techniques they must use in order to enforce the laws against prostitution. According to The Washington Post,
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
The police engage in substantial perjury to avoid the charge of entrapment and to obtain sufficient evidence for conviction "beyond a reasonable doubt." And perhaps even more upsetting, the police often must suppress their best evidence because they cannot admit having sex with the prostitute before the arrest.

<p>
<dd>The illegality of prostitution also creates an unsafe environment for the prostitutes. Those who object to prostitution because they find that it "degrades women" should realize that the women who take part in prostitution may or may not be degraded by the job, but are certainly degraded by the rape and other violence that can take place because prostitutes must ply their trade in clandestine ways and clandestine places. Further, these rapes and other acts of violence against prostitutes are seldom if ever reported to the police. If they are, the police dismiss them with, "That's part of the game. If you don't want it, don't be a hooker," or simply respond, "You can't rape a whore."

CENSORSHIP APPLIES TO basically three subjects: (1) Sex, (2) Violence, and (3) Ideas. Of the three, censorship of ideas is by far the most serious. It is also the most subtle.
<P>
<DD>
A major motivation behind censorship is paternalism. "You are not able to handle this information," the censor says; "therefore—for your own protection—we will keep it from you." The variation on that, of course, is "You and I will not be corrupted by this, but they—those poor uneducated, unsophisticated, unwashed masses—will not be able to handle it, so for their own good and the good of the country, we'll ban it."
<P>
<DD>
The other major motivation—far more pernicious—is to protect power. Here, someone or some group with power decides, "If this information got out, it might prove damaging to my (our) power, so I'd (we'd) better suppress it."
<P>
<DD>
All censorship is a violation of the First Amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DD>
It was a brilliant move for the founding fathers to put all of these guarantees together in one amendment. Almost all censorship is based on the religious and/or political beliefs of those in power. The bottom-line justification for censorship is invariably (a) "It's immoral!" (meaning, of course, against their religious beliefs), and/or (b) "It's un-American!" (which means it doesn't agree with their view about the kind of government America should have and the way that government should be run). In addition to the obvious free speech and free press guarantees, most censorship violates our First Amendment rights to freedom of and from religion. Even if the "freedom of speech, or of the press" clause were not there, applying the remainder of the First Amendment would eliminate almost all censorship as we know it.

But just in case the primary justification for all censorship—that is, religious and political suppression—was missed, the founding fathers added the freedom of speech and press clause: "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press." As I've asked before, what could be clearer than that? The only limitation on this freedom is, as always, harming the person or property of nonconsenting others. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes expressed this in his famous example from 1919:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic. [The] question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DD>
One could not, then, in supervising the demolition of a building, give the order, "Blow it up," knowing that there still were people inside. The willful murder of those people cannot be protected by saying, "Well, I was just exercising my right of free speech." Unfortunately, over the years, the "clear and present danger" of "substantive evils" that Justice Holmes gave as the exception to the First Amendment rights has been interpreted beyond his obvious physical example of starting a panic by falsely yelling "Fire!" More and more, the "clear and present danger" has been interpreted as a potential danger to our national morality—and we've already established the source of most "morality."

In 1991, for example, the Supreme Court ruled that nude dancing by women in a Las Vegas bar was not protected by the First Amendment. This dancing, the Court held, was on the level of shouting "Fire!" in a crowded theater. How retrograde we have gone from '19 to '91. This is considered a landmark decision. As Stanford University law professor Gerald Gunther explained,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
The court is saying that public morality trumps legitimate rights of expression. That's never happened before.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DD>
In the past, one had to define the "clear and present danger" by comparing whether or not the censored material would potentially cause the same physical harm as shouting, "Fire!" in a crowded theater. Now, the "clear and present danger" need only be as potentially harmful as consenting adults dancing nude in front of other consenting adults, in a bar—in Las Vegas. What a wonderful gift the Supreme Court gave us in 1991 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the passage of the Bill of Rights.

I'll explore the censorship of political ideas more fully in the chapter, "Unpopular Political Views." For now, let me turn to the two other favorites of censorship: sex and violence.
<P>

With censorship, we find another conservative-liberal division. Conservatives usually want to censor the sexual; liberals generally want to censor violence. Neither camp uses the word censor—they use words such as curb, protect, control, modify, and limit.

The problem with pornography is that it is done so poorly. "There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book," said Oscar Wilde more than one hundred years ago. "Books are well written, or badly written. That is all." Nothing much has changed since then. In 1993, Calvin Tomkins wrote in the New Yorker:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
Of all the minor art forms, pornography has remained the least developed. Certified pornographic masterworks, from Sappho to Nabokov, can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The best-known critical theorists of the form, from Anthony Comstock to Jesse Helms, have had the disadvantage of being morons. The National Endowment for the Arts supports pornographic experiment unwillingly, at best, and our popular culture contents itself with unimaginative increases in the gross annual depiction of bare skin and earnest copulation.

"I don't think pornography is very harmful," Sir Nol Coward summed it up in 1972, "but it is terribly, terribly boring."

Violence has its artists—Sam Peckinpah, Francis Ford Coppola, Ridley Scott. Where are pornography's artists? Twenty years ago, Deep Throat got publicity just because it had a plot. What have we got today? Mapplethorpe and Madonna?
<P>

Once upon a time, some of our best artists gave us our erotica. Today the Bible is used as a reason to censor. Not long ago, the Bible was used as a method to avoid the censor.

Michelangelo was able to do a magnificent male nude statue by calling it David (the model's real name was probably something closer to Tadzio). Michelangelo was also able to place a reclining male nude in the very center of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (the pope's personal chapel, for heaven's sake) by calling it Adam.

Gustave Dor (1832–1883), who had a taste for subjects not acceptable in his own time (although his obvious love for sex and violence would be right at home in our time), was able to create some of the most bizarre art of the nineteenth century simply by illustrating Bible stories. Because he had the good sense to call his etchings The Deluge and Jehu's Companions Finding the Remains of Jezebel, his work was welcomed in the same Victorian parlors and praised by the same Victorian social leaders who probably would have put him in jail if he had accurately entitled his etchings Naked Man, Naked Woman, and Four Naked Children Writhing in the Water and on a Wet Rock and Selected Body Parts of an Attractive Young Woman Being Examined by Four Men prior to Her Being Eaten by Dogs.  Because he was clever, however, Dor's Bible became so popular many people assumed that he wrote the text, too.

In 1967, Congress established and funded a National Commission on Pornography. Its report, published in 1970, found that it was not pornography, but the puritanical attitudes toward pornography that cause problems in America. The report said the problems stemmed "from the inability or reluctance of people in our society to be open and direct in dealing with sexual matters." In surveys, the commission found that only 2 percent of Americans thought sexually explicit material was a significant social problem. The report recommended that all legislation interfering with the right of adults to read, obtain, or view explicit sexual material be repealed.

When President Reagan put together another commission to study pornogra-phy, he did it right—extreme right. Attorney General Edwin Meese carefully selected eleven God-fearing (and, apparently, sex-fearing) Americans. One of the Meese Commission members was James C. Dobson, who wrote:

But there is not a minute to lose. "But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.

The antipornography movement of the 1980s represents yet another attempt by certain groups to impose their morals on the rest of society. What makes these efforts more threatening than those of the past is the extent to which they have been abetted by federal, state, and local authorities. The climate engendered by initiatives such as the Meese Commission has been described with only a bit of hyperbole by Hugh Hefner as "sexual McCarthyism."

The problem with violence is that it is not violent enough. According to the National Coalition on Television Violence, by the age of eighteen the average American will have seen 250,000 acts of violence and 40,000 attempted murders on television. And yet, how realistic will they be? Not very. When people are shot on TV, they grab the part of their body that is shot, fall over (if they are severely hurt), and continue with the written dialog. The dialog usually includes an obligatory "Ow" or "Ouch" or "Ahh" and then adds such stellar commentary (which must be a holdover from radio) as, "Why did you shoot me?" "My arm! [leg! chest! head!]" and the classic "I've been shot!" No matter how much dialog the victims have or how long it takes for the paramedics to arrive, we see
very little blood. We seldom even see holes in clothing, and almost never see holes in flesh.
<P>
<DD>
In real life, when someone is shot, blood is—to put it mildly—abundant. The victim goes into shock. Shock is not pretty: pasty face, severe trembling, eyes rolling toward the back of the head. Coherent dialog seldom passes the lips, but dinner frequently does—on the way out.

Even movies famous for violence are not allowed to go as far as real life. In The Godfather, Part III, for example, one of the villains is killed by being stabbed in the throat with his own eyeglasses. As originally filmed, the character sprayed large quantities of blood from his mouth. In order to avoid an X rating, however, the scene had to be re-shot, sans spraying.
<P>
<DD>
In The Godfather, Part II, when the Godfather (played by Robert DeNiro) becomes the Godfather by committing his first murder, he sticks the revolver in the mouth of his victim and, bang. In the movie, we see a little bit of brain and blood splatter on the door behind him. (The scene was shot for television sans even that little splattering.) In fact, even the movie version was incredibly tame. The AMOK Assault Video contains a news clip that was too graphic even for the evening news (if you can imagine that). It showed a politician who had been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He called a press conference. There he proclaimed his innocence, protested the unfairness of his persecution, pulled out a .357 Magnum, put it in his mouth, and pulled the trigger. What the camera captured is certainly enough to convince anyone not to play with firearms—or enter into politics. After his head exploded (a look at the Zapruder film in the movie JFK will give you an idea), blood poured from his nose and mouth. Although he was clearly dead, the blood kept gushing. We didn't see this in The Godfather, Part II.
<P>
<DD>
The other myth perpetrated in television and movies is how little people bruise and how quickly they heal. The day after a severe beating, the hero has a few red marks, wears a little white tape, and that's about it. In real life, he'd look terrible. Two days after a beating, in the movie, he's fine. In real life, two days after a beating you look worse than you did the day after the beating.

All of this sanitized violence only makes real violence a more acceptable solution to problems. It's not that violence is shown, and that causes violence; it's that violence is shown as the solution to problems; that causes violence. "A single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic," said Joseph Stalin (who knew). If, however, the way in which each of those million died and the suffering each went through had to be viewed one at a time in great detail, perhaps it would no longer be a statistic, and perhaps such tragedies would happen less often.

Portraying violence in all its gory would probably have these positive effects:
<P>
<DD>
<I><B>1. Far fewer people would watch violent programs</B></I>. In television, people vote with their remotes. In magazines, movies, and newspapers, they vote with their purchase. If enough people vote no, fewer violent acts would be depicted.
<P>
<DD>
<I><B>2. People would be less likely to take part in violence</B></I>. In your own home, you'd be less likely to shoot someone because you wouldn't want all that blood, vomit, and other internal fluids on your floor (wall, ceiling, couch, fish tank, etc.). You would also assiduously avoid situations where violent harm to your own person was remotely possible. One California judge sentences teenage drunk driving offenders to witness an autopsy of a traffic fatality caused by a drunk driver. It's been remarkably effective. Such a cold, forensic reality of violence would remove any sense of glamour from either hurting or being hurt. It's the human equivalent of the idea, "If each person had to kill his or her own dinner, there would be a lot more vegetarians."

The problem with censorship can be summed up in two words: <I>who decides?</I>
<P>
<DD>
If someone other than the end consumers—voting with their purchases, attendance, or remote controls—decides what should or should not, can or cannot, must or must not be said, depicted, or offered for sale, who should that person be? And who decides who that person should be? And who decides if those people are doing a good job deciding?
<P>
<DD>
Ultimately, censorship comes down to taste. What offends me may enlighten you. Do you want me deciding—based on my taste—what you should or should not be exposed to?
<P>
<DD>
Most censors don't stop at what offends them, of course: their overheated imaginations begin conjuring up what might offend this person or that group, and pretty soon almost everything is "pornographic." Many start sounding like Mervyn Griffiths-Jones, the prosecuting attorney in the 1960 trial to keep Lady Chatterly's Lover banned:

In addition, besides deciding what's good and what's bad, who decides what the punishment should be for violating these standards? For example, consider this comment from a young artist:

This may seem to be a trivial, even silly, comment for a young artist to make, but what if this young artist sets aside his art and turns to the art of politics? What if he gains enough power to fulfill not only his censorship dreams, but to inflict the punishments he finds appropriate? Well, that's precisely what happened. The artist-turned-politician who detested green skies and blue pastures had tens of thousands sterilized, and presided over the most sterile artistic period in the history of Europe—and these were the least of his crimes. As I'm sure you've guessed, the censor was Adolph Hitler. Which brings us to the F-WORD.

"I was arrested for using a ten-letter word that began with `c,'" said Lenny Bruce, "and I would marry no woman who was not one."
<P>
<DD>
From the standpoint of consensual crimes and freedom of speech, (if I may paraphrase Lenny Bruce) we must use that marvelous ten-letter word that begins with "t" (and certainly no one would marry me who didn't have a great deal of it): toleration. If I don't want Jerry Falwell editing my books, I must forgo the luxury of editing his sermons. (But I can dream, can't I?) To have a freedom ourselves, we must pick up the banner of that great light of the Enlightenment, Voltaire, and declare: "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."
<P>
<DD>
As long as we keep censoring, we are lost in the symptoms of our society's problems, thus ignoring the problems themselves. Pornography, for example, doesn't degrade women; women are degraded by our culture, and certain forms of pornography reflect that. Yes, we have a serious problem with the way women are treated in our culture, and pornography is a symptom, but let's not kill the messenger. Let's get the message and do something about it.
<P>
<DD>
Similarly, violence is a messenger. The idea that problems can be solved through violence causes violence. We have a problem with drugs? Let's declare a war on drugs! We have a problem with crime? Let's declare war on crime! We have a problem with violence? Let's declare war on violence! The deeply ingrained American attitude that we can solve any problem with enough force creates, feeds, and rewards the epidemic of violence we are currently experiencing.

IS MARRIAGE SUCH A fragile institution that it must be defended by putting all dissenters in jail?
<P>
<DD>
The obvious answer: "No—there will always be a fairly large percentage of people who want a lifelong, monogamous, formal, committed relationship with a partner of the opposite sex to keep the $32 billion bridal industry humming." Then why, I wonder (just as I wonder why it's called the bridal industry and not the bridal and groomal industry or simply the wedding industry), why must there be so many laws to encourage, support, and protect marriage?
<P>
<DD>
When it comes to professional relationships, the law recognizes just about every kind. In business, there are sole proprietorships, limited partnerships, corporations, and any number of other government (and, more important, IRS) recognized relationships. The laws and customs are neatly in place for mergers, takeovers, creating, and dissolving professional relationships of all shapes, sizes, and durations.
<P>
<DD>
Why is it, then, when it comes to personal relationships, there is only one legally recognized, community approved, IRS sanctioned relationship: one man and one woman promising fidelity until one of them dies? Only in this relationship—known as marriage—do people get the tax breaks, bank loans, realtor acceptance, and Welcome Wagon visits. 
Further, consenting adults entering into personal, romantic, or erotic relationships other than marriage might find themselves in jail. If you're sixty-three and a twenty-two-year-old fashion model finds your charm, sex appeal, and $500 million net worth absolutely irresistible, and this model, as Stephen Sondheim put it, "marries you a little," there may be a few raised eyebrows. Although eventually you'll probably be raising alimony payments, one thing you won't have to raise is bail. If, however, the same financial relationship were offered in more straightforward terms, in all fifty states (with the exception of a few counties in Nevada) you'd be arrested for solicitation, prostitution, or pandering.

Even if you firmly believe in, staunchly support, and passionately desire a one-on-one, monogamous, committed, lifelong partnership, if you happen to want that with a member of your own sex, that's illegal in all fifty states. Let's say you're heterosexual, then—so heterosexual, in fact, that you want to marry two members of the opposite sex. Sorry, that's a little too heterosexual: just one to a customer, please. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, bigamy is having one spouse too many; monogamy is the same.

There is no reason, of course, why a woman cannot have many husbands. The word polygamy, in fact, is not attached to gender. A man with several wives technically practices polygyny; a woman with several husbands practices polyandry.

In a few parts of the country—particularly among Mormons—polygamy (or, more accurately, polygyny) is quietly accepted. Some Mormons, in fact, consider polygamy their religious right. It is certainly true that polygamy, as a religious tenet of Mormonism, was driven out by this country's traditional religious intolerance and the government's willingness to give such intolerance full force of law. Professor Robert Allen Rutland tells the story:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
From 1831 onward the Mormons, whose religion embraced the practice of polygamy, had been hounded from settlement to settlement, and in 1844 their leader, Joseph Smith, and his brother were lynched by an Illinois mob; the surviving believers then trekked from the Mississippi to their New Zion in present-day Utah. After Congress outlawed bigamy in 1862 Mormons challenged the law, claiming that it violated their guarantee to worship freely. The high court decision upheld the law and kept Utah out of the Union until 1896.

As of early 1996, adultery (sex with someone who is married, or sex with anyone other than your spouse if you are married) is illegal in twenty-seven states. Oral sex (called sodomy in some states)—either giving or receiving—is illegal for consenting heterosexual adults in fourteen states. Even missionary style, conventional, heterosexual sex between unmarried consenting adults is illegal in nine states. Cohabitation (living as married with someone you're not married to) is illegal in ten states.

Any guess where all these restrictions come from? Almost invariably they are religious in origin. In their attempt to protect "the American family," fundamentalists are, in fact, destroying the institution of marriage. Lifelong, monogamous marriage is a relationship that many people are naturally drawn to. But when society programs those not drawn to that particular relationship to believe that they should or even must be married, people who have no business being in a marriage muck it up for those who want to be. 
<P>
<DD>
It's like visiting Disneyland. Some people naturally love the place. As long as only those who are drawn to Disneyland visit Disneyland, it is "the happiest place on earth." If, however, everyone were forced by law to visit Disneyland, then those who were not congenitally suited for Disneyland would—with their noticeable displeasure, rebellious acts, and disparaging comments—ruin it for those who wanted to be there.
<P>
<DD>
That's the state of marriage in America today. When people who really want to be married marry people who only think they should get married, both end up suffering. If people who want to get married, get married to other people who want to get married, the likelihood of success is fairly high. Meanwhile, if the people who don't want to get married but think they should get married are no longer told they should get married, they are free to explore and enter into whatever sort of relationships they do want. (On a purely physical level, psychiatrists say that 20 percent of the American public has no appreciable sex drive whatsoever.)

If business law had an equivalent to the laws concerning personal relationships, it would say, "If you're in business, you must have one partner, and only one partner, and keep that partner, until one of you dies." If this were the law, can you imagine the state of business in America? The same is true of the state of personal relationships.
<P>
<DD>
If we allow people to follow their hearts (and what else should they primarily follow in romantic relationships?) and allow relationships the freedom to grow, dissolve, merge, and interact with the same legal freedoms and protections we give business, then everyone—including (and perhaps especially) those who want a traditional marriage—would be a lot better off.
<P>
<DD>
This topic, of course, is the subject of its own book, which I have no intention of writing someday. From a legal point of view, to sanction (reward, in fact) only one kind of relationship and punish other relationships is simply not the law's business.

CALL ME DIM-WITTED, thickheaded, or just plain insensitive, but the consensual crime laws that seem the silliest to me are the ones directed against homosexuality. Why should criminal law care about whom other people love, feel affection for, date, live with, marry, or have sex with? I just don't get it.

I also don't understand the astonishing prejudice against gay people.  The New York Times reported findings of the (New York) Governor's Task Force on Bias-Related Violence:

In one of the most alarming findings, the report found that while teenagers surveyed were reluctant to advocate open bias against racial and ethnic groups, they were emphatic about disliking homosexual men and women. They are perceived "as legitimate targets that can be openly attacked," the report said. . . . The feelings were as strong among twelve-year-olds as among seventeen-year-olds. Many students added gratuitous vicious comments about homosexuals; that was not the case with other groups.

It also seems that groups that hate each other and disagree on absolutely everything else find one common point of agreement: homosexuality is bad, wrong, evil, wicked, and all the rest. Take, for example, L. Ron Hubbard and Jerry Falwell. One would think these two individuals were about as far apart as possible on every known spectrum. The fact that one is dead and the other is not quite dead is the least of their differences. Falwell dismisses Hubbard's creation, the Church of Scientology, as a "satanic cult." On the subject of homosexuality, however, Falwell and Hubbard seem to find some common ground.
<p>
<dd>
In the chapter, "His Master's Voice?" we'll explore how Falwell feels about "perverts." Here are some excerpts from L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics, the "15 million copy bestseller":
<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
The sexual pervert (and by this term Dianetics, to be brief, includes any and all forms of deviation . . . such as homosexuality, lesbianism . . .) is actually quite ill physically. . . . He is also so far from normal and so extremely dangerous to society that the tolerance of perversion is as thoroughly bad for society as punishment for it.
<p>
To make a pervert is, rather, something on the order of kicking a baby's head in, running over him with a steamroller, cutting him in half with a rusty knife, boiling him in Lysol, and all the while with crazy people screaming the most horrifying and unprintable things at him.

The thing that impressed me most, however, and moved me deeply was the discovery of the incredible amount of suffering experienced by homosexuals.

In Hitler's Germany they were exterminated by the thousands in the furnaces and gas chambers.

What causes such deep and unreasonable hatred?
<p>
<dd>
Prior to the late 1800s, the concept of homosexuality did not exist. The idea that one would exclusively feel romantically and sexually drawn to a member of the same sex was not considered. Yes, there was certainly homosexual activity, but this had always existed. The Hebrews, for example, did not have a word for homosexuality. When they wanted to describe the forbidden activity, they had to say, "Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable" (Leviticus 18:22). Similarly, the Greeks had no word for homosexual. Paul had to explain: "Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another" (Romans 1:26–27). There was no word, then, for a man who went to bed only with men or a woman who went to bed only with women.

To even ask the question would be as unusual as asking today, "Are you a hot dog eater or a hamburger eater?" The idea that one preference would exclude the other made no sense. Even if one has not eaten a hot dog in twenty years, one would never think of defining oneself as a hamburgerist. Likewise, a person who had never had a hamburger in his or her life but adored hot dogs, would not be labeled "a hotdogger."
<p>
<dd>
In societies of ancient Greece and Rome, sexual activity with either gender was perfectly acceptable. To exclusively go to bed with one sex or the other, in fact, was considered a bit odd—just as eating only raw vegetables might be considered a bit unusual today. In the ancient world, the distinction was: "Were you the dominant or the passive partner in the sex act?" In relationships between men, the dominant partner was praised, and the passive partner was condemned. Why? Because to play the passive partner meant a man voluntarily played the part of a woman.
<p>
<dd>
It's the ancient anti-woman prejudice that permeates what we call Western Civilizations. Why would a man want to play the part of a woman? To do so was considered unnatural, self-deprecating, and perverse. If slaves or captives did it with their owners, that was acceptable: they had to. But for a man who had a choice to take the passive role in sex was considered degrading.
<p>
<dd>
And therein lies the seed of the prejudice. It wasn't that homosexual activity was wrong; it was a man playing the woman's role in homosexual activity that was considered perverted.

Alexander the Great—whose masculinity was never in doubt—had as a primary sexual partner a castrated Persian boy. Alexander also had a wife. No one questioned the arrangement.

Both Alexander's wife and the Persian boy were treated with the respect due the ruler's favorites, but with little admiration.

As we shall see, any number of prohibitions in both the Old and New Testaments were abandoned long ago. And yet, the one against homosexuality remained because the bias against women remained. That's the first reason homosexuality has continued to be viewed in a negative light long after the practical reason (it doesn't propagate the species) no longer mattered.
<p>
<dd>
The second reason homosexuality is so feared and despised is that homosexuality is too close to home. It's fairly easy for, say, white people to become tolerant of black people because white people are not black. White people seldom think, "I think I'll have black skin for the next two hours." White people and black people are so fundamentally different—in terms of skin color—that white people almost never think, "I wonder if I'm really black?"
<p>
<dd>
This sense of security is not found with homosexuality. On a purely biological level, the human animal responds sexually to lubricated friction. It doesn't much matter whether this lubricated friction is being applied by a man, a woman, a machine, or a well-trained dog; human sexual response on the biological level is automatic.
<p>
<dd>
It is also true that human beings can feel affection—even love—for members of their own sex. Affection is not a tidy emotion. It tends to lap into mental, emotional, physical, sensual, and even sexual expression.

When one first realizes that he or she is actually capable of some kind of sexual and/or emotional response with a member of the same sex, panic ensues. Before children are even aware of their sexuality, they know that homosexuality is bad. Very bad. Among boys eight years or older, the most pejorative name they can call each other is "faggot!" Later, when they become aware of their sexuality and find—even for a moment—that it flashes in the direction of the same sex, there's trouble in River City.
<p>
<dd>
At this point, one has the choice to (a) confront one of the greatest and most pervasive taboos in our culture or (b) deny the inner reaction 
vehemently by supporting the taboo all the more enthusiastically. Invariably, (b) is the choice. It's an old psychological truism: the more you want to taste of the forbidden fruit, the more you condemn it. Shakespeare realized this, and assumed his audience understood the concept so well that he made it a joke: "The lady doth protest too much, methinks."  (Hamlet, Act III, Scene 2, Line 242.) That line has been met by the laughter of recognition for almost four hundred years.

<dd>
By soundly condemning homosexuality outwardly, one avoids facing even the possibility that one might—just maybe—feel love for or be capable of responding sexually to a member of one's own sex.

Hating gays seems to be the only fashionable prejudice left. Maybe that's why it's dying so hard—some people just can't stand to be without at least one unjustifiable hatred. Some stores sell t-shirts with sayings such as "Homophobic and Proud of It" and "Club Faggots, Not Seals." Or the bumper sticker sold at the 1995 National Federation of Republican Women Convention: "THE MIRACLE OF AIDS TURNED FRUITS INTO VEGETABLES." What other minority is subjected to such unchallenged, cruel, and violent hatred?
<P>
<dd>
As with most prejudices, the hatred of gays is based on a series of misconceptions. Our culture seems to have more myths about gays than most. Let's see if we can shine a little light on a few of them.
<p>
<dd>
<I><B>Myth #1: Homosexuality is unnatural</B></I>. In order to see what is natural, we must look to nature. In nature, every mammal has been observed taking part in same-sex activities, affection, and bonding. In some animals, homosexuality increases during times of overpopulation—sort of nature's birth control.
<p>
<dd>
In nature, by the way, what is decidedly not natural is monogamy—especially for life. The only mammals who even sometimes mate for life are foxes, wolves, gibbons, beavers, dik-diks, coyotes, elephant shrews, and geese. Some animals mate for a season; most animals mate and move on.
<p>
<dd>
I stuck to mammals for this example because the lower forms of life—while natural—are positively inhuman. You could say, for example, that the praying mantis "mates for life" only because, while the male shudders in orgasm, the female bites his head off. Then she eats him. The male praying mantis is an animal that comes and goes at the same time. Maybe that's why he's always praying. We all know how the black widow spider becomes a widow and why there is no such thing as a black widower (some animals get so hungry after sex).
<p>
<dd>
Here's how Phyllis Lindstrom explained the birds and the bees—well, at least the bees—on The Mary Tyler Moore Show: "Did you know the male bee is nothing but the slave of the queen? And once the male bee has, how should I say, serviced the queen, the male dies. All in all, not a bad system."

Earthworms have male sexual organs on one end and female sexual organs on the other. They cannot, however, fertilize themselves. To mate, earthworms lie next to each other—how can I say this without becoming numerical?—head-to-toe and simultaneously play both male and female. Amoebas seem to have the best idea—the simplest, anyway: when they've had enough of themselves, they just divide. When one discusses what's natural, then, one has quite a range of behaviors to choose from.
<p>
<dd>
From a purely human point of view, homosexual behavior has been recorded in every culture that kept detailed enough records. Sociologists and anthropologists have documented homosexual behavior in every country on earth—including in tribes that had no contact with outside human beings until the arrival of the anthropologists. Any behavior observed among all races, all peoples, all cultures, and in all countries throughout all recorded time must certainly be considered natural for humans.
<p>
<dd>
<I><B>Myth #2: People are either homosexual or heterosexual</B></I>. Not true. People do tend to specialize—partially because people are conditioned to think they should specialize. (We are addicted to "either/or" in our culture.) Sexual behavior is a continuum with exclusive heterosexuality on one end and exclusive homosexuality on the other. People, however, can be found at any point along that spectrum. A corollary to Myth #2 is:
<p>
<dd>
<I><B>Myth #3: Homosexuality is contagious</B></I>. The myth goes something like this: If you try a homosexual experience and find it even marginally enjoyable, a seed (more like a virus) has been planted, and, eventually, you will wind up a full-fledged, card-carrying, flag-waving homosexual. This is simply not the case. You can't "catch" homosexuality any more than you can "catch" heterosexuality (although the latter myth is supported by the concept that "the love of a good woman" will "cure" a gay man). In either case, even a successful liaison with the gender one is not normally drawn to will have little, if any, lasting effect.

I'm amazed at the power those who propound the you-can-catch- homosexuality theory give to homosexuality—with only a small dose, it suddenly takes over an otherwise robust heterosexual? This myth probably springs from observing some individuals who severely suppressed their homosexuality, but once they got one foot out the closet door there was no stopping them. ("I am not just out of the closet," a greeting card reads, "I am sitting in the living room with my feet propped up watching television.") We pretty much are what we are, and neither homosexuality nor heterosexuality can be "caught." The next myth seems to contradict this myth but, like different aspects of a used-car salesman's pitch, myths don't have to support each other for people to believe them. "The American public," said Pat Robertson, "has a very short memory." And this is a man who knows.
<p>
<dd>
<I><B>Myth #4: Homosexuality is a choice</B></I>. It has been established for some time that one's sexual orientation is part of the basic personality structure and formed before the age of two. The most recent studies, however, both behavioral and biological, indicate one's sexual orientation is genetic—something determined at conception. Whether it happens before birth or it happens by age two, the determination of sexual orientation can hardly be considered a choice. One can, of course, choose not to follow one's natural orientation, but this is not the sort of choice the proponents of this myth mean. They mean that gay people choose to be gay in the same way that they might sit down and choose which program to watch on television, which team to bet on in the Super Bowl, or whether or not they want pepperoni on their pizza.

The idea behind this myth is: a perfectly normal, well-adjusted heterosexual is sitting around one day and just decides to go gay, as one might decide to move to Antarctica or try to flush hockey pucks down the toilet. It is truly aberrant behavior, but it is his or her choice. Implied in this choice, of course, is a certain hostility to God, parents, society, and the American way. It's as though being gay is a pathological act of rebellion.
<p>
<dd>
Gays don't choose to be gay; they discover they're gay. Like heterosexuals, they find themselves increasingly attracted (romantically as well as sexually) to a particular gender. The bisexuals find themselves attracted to both. (Even though, as Woody Allen says, "Bisexuality immediately doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night," discovering one's bisexuality must be more confusing than discovering one is primarily gay or straight.)
<p>
<dd>
Like being left- or right-handed, there is no "choice" to one's sexual orientation. Allow me to give you an example. Clasp your hands together by interlocking your fingers. Is your right thumb on top or your left? Now switch your clasp, so that the other thumb is on top. Feel unnatural? Well, for half the population, this way is natural—it's the way they formed their clasp when first asked. Although one feels "normal" to you and one does not, when did you choose which was which? At what age? Who offered you the choice? The answer to these questions is also the answer to the question, "When do gays choose to be gay?"
<p>
<dd>
Considering the many cultural prejudices, to discover one is (or might be) gay can be traumatic; one can be in denial for some time. With society screaming, "Stay in the closet!" and nature pleading, "Get out! Get out!" one does have the choice of which voice one listens to. Does one choose to use the courage to be oneself? In this way—and in this way only—is homosexuality a choice.

<I><B>Myth #5: Homosexuals recruit others</B></I>. This is a myth that grew out of the evangelical camp where proselytizing, testifying, missionaryizing, and converting are basic tenets of the faith. Evangelicals somehow feel that gays have the same zeal to spread a gay-spell that they have to spread a God-spell. It's a simple matter of evangelicals projecting their recruitment tactics on gays. As with most projections, the image is distorted—and very wrong.
<p>
<dd>
Gays have no desire to "recruit" heterosexuals into becoming homosexual. A gay person may, individually, want to have sex with a heterosexual of the same sex whom he or she finds attractive; the gay person may even make a pass. The gay person is making a personal statement of desire, not fulfilling a recruitment quota. ("If you recruit ten heterosexuals this month, you get this beautiful 26-piece set of Tupperware!") Additionally, gays who are out of the closet may offer support and encouragement to gays who are miserably in the closet, but that's about as far as it goes. Besides, the whole idea of recruitment rests on the concept that homosexuality is a choice, and every homosexual knows that just ain't so.
<p>
<dd>
<I><B>Myth #6: You can spot a gay a mile away</B></I>. In 1985, when Rock Hudson publicly admitted his homosexuality, I was visiting two gay friends in Maine. Both men were in their eighties and had been lovers in 1925. In this rather remote region of Maine (is there any other kind of region in Maine?) the people did not have what you would call a cosmopolitan view of life. They had somehow heard about Rock Hudson's sexual proclivities (an issue of People must have washed ashore in a bottle). They were stunned, numb. Not since the news of Kennedy's assassination (which they found out about in 1971) had the people of this town been so bereft. "Rock Hudson?" "No." "He couldn't be." "He doesn't look . . ." "Rock Hudson was such a man." My two friends and I were visiting the general store (yes, it was called the general store); it was all anyone could talk about. I wondered what this group of shoppers would say if I told them that the dear, sweet, elderly men to whom they were expressing their astonishment had been lovers sixty years earlier. But I figured, no, one Rock crumbling that week was enough.

Some gay men are effeminate; most are not. Some straight men are effeminate; most are not. Some lesbians are masculine; most are not. Some heterosexual women are masculine; most are not. According to the organization that considers itself an expert on homosexuality, the Pentagon, "feminized males make up only a small proportion of homosexuals, perhaps 10 percent. Thus 90 percent . . . display no overt behavioral stigmata." Regarding effeminacy in men, remember the most notorious ladies' man in history, Casanova, could probably not walk into a pool hall today and order a creme de menthe without being beaten silly with pool cues. Casanova was—like many men of his era—foppish. It was something men strived for. It indicated refinement, discernment, taste. All those King Louises of France wore wigs that even Dolly Parton would find too elaborate. And let's not forget our own founding fathers: satin pants, powdered wigs, make-up and all.

Linking effeminacy with homosexuality is primarily an American assumption. In the 1880s, Oscar Wilde toured America and lectured widely on aesthetics. He carried a lily on stage and was as much an aesthete as an Irishman could possibly be. The press ridiculed him, he ridiculed America, his lectures sold out, and everybody loved it. "A man in Leadville, Colorado," Wilde would say, "sued the railroad company because the reproduction of the Venus deMilo he ordered arrived without arms." Wilde would pause for dramatic effect while breathing in the fragrance of his lily. "The man collected on his claim." At the time he was touring the United States, Wilde was a married man with two children. No one linked his studied effeminacy with sexual orientation any more than they linked it to Ireland, lecturers, or playwrights. In 1895, however, when Wilde was found guilty of being a "sodomite" and, in 1897, when Havelock Ellis coined the word homosexuality in his Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Americans linked the two: "There are homosexuals; Oscar Wilde is a homosexual; so that's what they're like." Ironically, had America used as a stereotype one of its homegrown homosexuals of that era—such as the rough and rugged Walt Whitman—we might all have a very different view of how to "spot" homosexuals. (Could Gabby Hayes have lived down the stigma?) The stereotype would be just as inaccurate, but different.

One percent seems low—if it were one percent, that would mean roughly half the nation's gay population traveled to the capital for the 1993 March on Washington. This is unlikely. But the number of gays is unimportant. As the Los Angeles Times editorialized on April 25, 1993,

What does all this mean in regard to current debates about the place of homosexuals in American society? It means exactly nothing.
<p>
Whether homosexuals are 1% of the population or 10% or some figure in between, they are beyond any argument or cavil 100% entitled to the same protection under the law and the enjoyment of the same rights that everyone else is guaranteed. That specifically includes the right to be free from discrimination and intimidation in employment, housing and schooling. It means the right to be protected from hate-inspired physical assaults. It means the right to privacy as that right applies to everyone else.

Gays have been—and continue to be—hidden from view in the media, except in the form of (a) psychotic killers, or (b) effeminate jokes. The first time the word homosexual was uttered in a film was 1961. When plays and novels featuring gay characters were made into movies, those characters turned into heterosexuals who were simply "sensitive." Film biographies completely expunged any mention of a gay hero's true sexual preference. For example, when the story of Lorenz Hart's life was filmed, the movie had him overcoming people's prejudice against him for "being too short." The oddest example was probably Night and Day, in which Cary Grant, a bisexual, played Cole Porter, a homosexual, as a heterosexual. Even today, "sophisticated" films tend to avoid homosexuality. Peter Biskind reported in Premiere that in the novel, Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Caf, "the two main characters engage in a robust lesbian relationship. Where was the lesbianism when the novel was adapted for the screen?"

<I><B>Myth #8: God is opposed to homosexuality</B></I>.  There are basically two Biblical prohibitions cited repeatedly and forcefully by those claiming homosexuality is condemned by God, hence should remain illegal.

It's easy to see that, in context, the always-quoted-out-of-context admonition against homosexuality is hardly God singling out gays for special punishment.

Jesus was tried by Sanhedren, the ruling religious body of Jerusalem, and found guilty of blasphemy. According to the religious powers that were, to claim he was the son of God was blasphemous. The charge of sedition was added so the Romans would approve of and carry out the death sentence.
<p>

Speaking of Romans, let's move on to the New Testament. Paul, in his epistle to the Romans, chapter 1, verses 26–27, describes the fate of Christians who reverted to paganism:

Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.

If we look more carefully into Paul's comments concerning homosexual behavior, however, he does not condemn homosexual behavior itself but "unnatural relations." As an example, he mentions heterosexuals taking part in homosexual behavior. As a regular practice, this would be unnatural. (Curiosity and experimentation, however, are perfectly natural.)
<p>
<dd>
In this light, people who are naturally homosexual would have "abandoned natural relations" if they committed firmly to a life of other-gender joys. This is precisely what many Christian "ministries," such as Exodus, tell gays to do. (By the way, the two men who started Exodus fell in love with each other, were instantly exiled by their brethren, and later married.)
<p>
<dd>
The "indecent acts with other men" most likely were pagan acts that were indecent: human sacrifice springs to mind. Paul was giving the Christians in Rome a laundry list, which included the various examples of unnatural behavior. His message was "Once you know God and you turn from God, woe unto you"—not "Homosexuality is bad."  No doubt Paul could have been more clear. Even Peter, who contributed precious few words to the New Testament, had to defend Paul:

Couldn't that be twisted into an admonition to have only gay relations? Sure. A literal interpretation would cause an end to all Christian marriage. Paul was, in fact, encouraging a focus on spiritual matters rather than worldly ones, such as marriage and family. 
<p>
<dd>
Let's move on to the preachers who don't even quote the Bible but prefer Bible stories. They like to go on and on about "the sin of Sodom and Gomorra," which they incorrectly conclude was sodomy. Hence the sodomites of the world, incorrectly viewed as only homosexuals, must have caused God's wrath to fall upon the city. Let's go to the Bible for the real story.
<p>
<dd>
Sodomy, in fact, is a grab-bag legal term that encompasses anything the legislative moral fathers of a given state find personally disgusting. It can include anal sex between men or between men and women (including married couples); oral sex between men, between women, men and women (including married couples); and sex between humans and animals.
<p>
<dd>
In August 1982, a Mr. Hardwick was in his bedroom engaging in an act of sodomy with another consenting adult male. Sodomy is defined in Georgia (the state where this took place) as when one "performs or submits to any sexual act involving the sex organs of one person and the mouth or anus of another." In this case, it was Mr. Hardwick's mouth and the other man's sex organ. A police officer came in and, without a warrant, arrested them both. Mr. Hardwick took the case as far as the Supreme Court. What did the Supreme Court have to say? "The Constitution does not confer a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy."

The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.

<p>
"No," they answered, "we will spend the night in the square." But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate.
<p>
Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house. They called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them." (Genesis 19:1–5)

Obviously, the sin here about to be attempted is rape, not consensual sex. Further, the sin is inhospitality. In desert regions, not being hospitable—that is, denying a traveler food and water; or, worse, taking advantage of a traveler in a violent way—was a sin second only to murder. Certainly, if travelers come out of the desert looking for water and get raped instead, that's pretty sinful—whether the travelers are men, women, or, in this case, angels. We'll get to other comments made about what the sin of Sodom was in a moment, but let's continue with our story. These are the parts the televangelists never get around to reading on television:
<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him and said, "No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing. Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof." (Genesis 19:6–8)
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<dd>
I don't want to sound like a prude, but isn't Lot supposed to be the hero of this piece? Here he is offering this rowdy crowd his two virgin daughters so that the crowd might "do what you like with them." If Lot had offered himself, that might have been noble. "Take me, but leave my guests and daughters alone." Frankly, in comparing the sins of raping two strangers and offering your two virgin daughters to an unruly mob, I think the latter is worse. Maybe I'm just too old-fashioned for the Old Testament.
<p>
<dd>
When the assembled throng continue to demand divine flesh, the angels blind the nasty mob, pull Lot into the house, send Lot and his family on their way, and destroy Sodom and Gomorrah. After Lot's wife disobeys the angels' instructions and turns to look back at the city and becomes a pillar of salt, the story gets exciting again: Lot's daughters show that kinkiness runs in the family:

So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father. (Genesis 19:34–36)

<B>WHY HETEROSEXUAL MEN SHOULD NOT BE ORDAINED</B>
<p>
1.  According to divorce statistics, fewer than half of them are able to maintain a long-term relationship.
<p>
2.  The literature is full of tales of clergymen becoming sexually involved with women of the congregation.
<p>
3.  Three out of four straight males in the United States admit to being unfaithful to their long-term partners.
<p>
4.  Thousands of straight men are in jail for molesting little girls. A shocking percentage of these victims were their own daughters.
<p>
5.  Straight males are the driving force behind the declar-ation of wars—the only other activity described in the Social Principles as "incompatible with Christian teaching."
<p>
6.  Jesus saved his harshest words for the self-righteousness of groups like the Pharisees and Sadducees—which, if they lived according to the code they promoted, were made up of straight males.

Among the ancient Chinese the most
popular literary expression for gay love
was "the love of the cut sleeve,"
referring to the selfless devotion
of the last emperor of the Han dynasty,
Ai-Ti, who cut off his sleeve
when called to an audience
rather than wake his lover, Tung Hsien,
who had fallen asleep across it.</PRE></TD>

On the other hand, the Bible does give some positive images of male affection. These from the Old Testament:
<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself. From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his father's house. And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt. (1 Samuel 18:1–4)
<p>
After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together—but David wept the most. Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the Lord, saying, `The Lord is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.'" (1 Samuel 20:41–42)
<p>
"Saul and Jonathan—in life they were loved and gracious, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions." (2 Samuel 1:23)
<p>
"I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women." (2 Samuel 1:26)

As to Jesus' relationship with those who vary from today's sexual norms, the incident of Jesus and the centurion is telling:
<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help, "Lord," he said, "my servant lies at home paralyzed and in terrible suffering."
<p>
Jesus said to him, "I will go and heal him." (Matthew 8:5–7)
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<dd>
Matthew uses the Greek word pais, which means "boy," and Luke (7:1–10) uses Doulas, or "slave." That a Roman officer would seek out a Jewish healer for his servant shows a deeper relationship than simply master-servant. We also know the depth of the relationship was not based on the amount of time the servant had spent with him: being a "boy," he would not be, say, the slave who raised the centurion from birth.

The boy-slave was what was often referred to as a body slave, a young man who would wash, groom, and take care of the personal needs of his master—including sexual ones. Body slaves were common among Roman officers—especially while on a campaign or stationed outside Rome. Only the highest officers were allowed to bring their wife (or wives), and, even then, many found a male body slave a more practical traveling companion. Bisexuality was commonplace in Rome, as it had been in Greece. Even Julius Caesar was said to be "every man's wife and every women's husband" by Curio the Elder. He was not being pejorative, but merely mentioning one of Caesar's many accomplishments.
<p>
<dd>
When the centurion arrived (or, in Luke's account, sent emissaries) and expressed concern over the slave-boy, the centurion's relationship with the boy was obvious. It made no difference to Jesus. He agreed to heal the boy. This was remarkable in that Jesus was addressing his teachings to the Jews, not the Gentiles, and the centurion and the boy would clearly be of the Gentile/pagan category. According to Luke, the centurion had helped build a synagogue and was a friend of the Jewish people, but it's doubtful that would have influenced Jesus very much. Jesus was a pushover for faith.
<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
The centurion replied, "Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, `Go' and he goes; and that one, `Come', and he comes. I say to my servant, `Do this,' and he does it."
<p>
When Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said to those following him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith." Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! It will be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that very hour. (Matthew 8:8–10, 13)

Similarly, Jesus had no condemnation for effeminate men or eunuchs. After all, he described himself metaphorically as a eunuch when referring to his own sexuality. Within the Jewish culture, however, eunuchs and effeminate men were outcasts.

Carrying water in Israel was "woman's work." Telling his disciples to look for "a man carrying a jar of water" would be the same as saying today, "Look for a man in a dress, high heels, and a bouffant hairdo." That Jesus would have either a eunuch or an effeminate male lead his disciples to the upper room where the Last Supper would be held is one of Jesus' many statements of acceptance, inclusion, and compassion.

<I><B>Myth #11: Homosexuals can't control their sex drives</B></I>. When you consider how well most homosexuals have controlled not just their sex drives but their conversations, their innuendoes, and even their inferences for so many years, it seems as though homosexuals have remarkable control. If closeted gays have been able to keep their homosexuality secret from friends and co-workers, obviously, should they happen to stumble out of the closet, they can keep their sexual urges under control.
<P>
<dd>
<I><B>Myth #12: Gays are not fit for military service</B></I>. All the reasons why gays shouldn't serve in the military boil down to one: the excessive prejudice of the heterosexuals against homosexuality would make the heterosexuals unfit for combat. The pro-prejudice group argues, "Wouldn't you be uncomfortable if some gay guy kept trying to hit on you?"
<p>
<dd>
What the heterosexuals in the military are afraid of is that the gays in the military—should they be allowed to come out—would start hitting on the heterosexuals with the same levels of determination and deception that the heterosexual men hit on women. The heterosexual men, then, are afraid to be treated the way they treat women. Well, who can blame them? That gay men will behave as disreputably as straight men is an unfair projection on the part of straight men. Give the gays a chance. If some gays treat the straights the way the straights treat women, one can only quote: "What goes around, comes around."
<p>

As to gay women in the military, here's this herstorical tidbit from the June 21, 1993, issue of Newsweek:

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
General Dwight D. Eisenhower received some unsettling news while he was in occupied Germany after World War II. There were, he was told, a significant number of lesbians in his Women's Army Corps (WAC) command. He called in Sgt. Johnnie Phelps and ordered her to get a list of all the lesbians in the battalion. "We've got to get rid of them," he barked. Phelps said she'd check into it. But, she told the general, "when you get the list back, my name's going to be first." Eisenhower's secretary then interrupted. "Sir, if the general pleases, Sergeant Phelps will have to be second on the list, because mine will be first." Dumbfounded, Ike realized he'd lose many of his key personnel if he persisted. "Forget that order," he told Phelps.

<I><B>Myth #13: Homosexuals spread AIDS</B></I>. AIDS is a disease spread by unsafe sexual contact (primarily to the passive partner in intercourse), dirty hypodermic needles, contaminated blood transfusions, and from mother to child before birth. Gays have taken great care to educate their community, practice safe sex, and minister (in the true sense of the word) to those unfortunate enough to have caught the disease. Because most gays have changed their sexual activities and are now practicing safe sex, new infections in the gay community have leveled off. Meanwhile, infections are on the rise in the heterosexual community. The myth, "If you don't go to bed with someone gay you won't get AIDS," is hurting the heterosexual community more severely than it's hurting the homosexual community.
<p>
<dd>
Worldwide, AIDS is primarily a heterosexual, not homosexual, disease. It is a sexually transmitted disease that—for whatever reason—entered the gay community in the United States and stayed fairly contained there for a number of years. It is now spreading through the heterosexual community, and will continue to do so until heterosexuals realize that AIDS is not a "gay disease." Any sexually active person—male, female, gay, straight—can get it. If you have intercourse, use a condom. There's hardly a gay person in the country who does not know this rule of safe sex. Can the same be said of heterosexuals?

Further, 25 percent of the AIDS cases—including almost all cases involving heterosexuals and children—were spread by or directly connected to dirty needles. If heroin or morphine were inexpensive, readily available, and sold in use-once syringes, do you think these 25 percent of AIDS cases would be suffering today?
<p>

<I><B>Myth #14: AIDS is God's curse upon homosexuals</B></I>. Crises bring out the best in people—and the worst. They also bring out the best people—and the worst. What can one say about ignorant, arrogant, politically active people who say things like, "AIDS is God's curse upon homosexuals"? I can remember the words of Jesus: "Forgive them, Father, for they know not what they do," but then I remember Jesus said that moments after he was nailed to the cross.

WE ARE SHOCKED and saddened by the events in Waco, Texas. We grieve with the families on both sides who lost loved ones.
<P>
<DD>
The federal government is conducting investigations to find out what happened at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco to prevent similar occurrences in the future. While we think such an investigation is appropriate, we oppose any attempt to define what is a valid religion or set the parameters of a proper church.
<P>
<DD>
Under the religious liberty provisions of the First Amendment, government has no business declaring what is orthodox or heretical, or what is a true or false religion. It should steer clear of inflammatory and misleading labels. History teaches that today's "cults" may become tomorrow's mainstream religions.
<P>
<DD>
The United States is a religiously diverse country. We treasure its religious pluralism. Such diversity is a natural and expected result of our constitutionally protected religious liberty and is a source of strength, not weakness. These religious contours add to the American landscape, they do not detract from it. In the midst of our national mourning, we must fend off any inclination to shrink from our commitment to religious pluralism or to seek security at the expense of liberty.
<P>
<DD>
This heady freedom is not absolute. It should be exercised responsibly. Religion is no excuse for violent or criminal conduct that harms other people or threatens public safety or welfare. Absent some compelling justification, however, government should not restrict religious exercise. And force—if ever appropriate—must be employed as a last resort.

I didn't write the opening of this chapter. It was taken, verbatim, from a document released just after the events in Waco, entitled "Religious Liberty at Risk," and signed by American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A.; American Civil Liberties Union, Washington Office; American Conference on Religious Movements; Americans United for Separation of Church & State; Association of Christian Schools International; Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs; Church of Scientology International; Center for Theology/Public Policy; Episcopal Church; First Liberty Institute; General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists; Greater Grace World Outreach; National Association of Evangelicals; National Council of Churches of Christ; Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Washington Office; Union of American Hebrew Congregations.

If a religious group is gathering money under false pretenses (telling its followers the cash is going to feed the poor while it really goes to the campaign fund of conservative candidates, or collecting money to build a "retreat center" for the use of all members while the money goes to support the cult leader's forty-some horses with nary a retreat in sight), it may be appropriate for the government to step in. Certainly, religious groups should be subject to the same laws as any other organization or corporation. For the most part, however, facts—not government acts—will keep at bay those who use the name of God to support their own personal mammon.
<P>
<DD>
Organizations such as the Cult Awareness Network (CAN) provide an invaluable service by maintaining open files on thousands of cults and cult-like groups around the world. These files are available to anyone wanting to research the background and methods of any cult.
<P>
<DD>
I owe CAN an apology. In the hardcover edition of Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do, I'm afraid I trashed CAN. This was because (guess why?) I was under the influence of a cult (John-Roger's Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness or MSIA). Had I only read CAN's files on John-Roger and MSIA first.LIFE 102: What to Do When Your Guru Sues You. On the World Wide Web free at http://www.mcwilliams.com.>
<P>
<DD>
But as much as I personally dislike cults, I despise any organization or individual that robs people of their individuality. I still feel the entire Waco incident was the result of an overfed federal bureaucracy gone mad, not an example of "the danger of cults." (William Sessions, the director of the FBI, told Congress, "Were we supposed to stand by and suck our thumbs?") And then we saw what many consider the (admittedly insane) backlash in the Oklahoma City bombing.
<P>
<DD>
Ultimately, cults ain't the law's business. If adults want to destroy their lives by believing a cult leader is God, that is their unfortunate choice. Retribution must come through civil litigation. It is not the government's business to bring Armageddon to their door—even if our government does have God on its side.

THE UNITED STATES constitution is a fascinating document. It has within itself the rules by which it can be changed, modified, or eliminated altogether. This flexibility allows the United States to have one of the oldest continuing governments in the world.
<P>
<DD>
Some people, however, believe that the Constitution needs to be "protected" from even the idea of another system of government. Ironically, those who, in order to "defend the Constitution," suspend people's constitutional right to advocate another form of government are the ones who destroy the Constitution. That the people may someday vote out our current form of government and replace it with another is a risk inherent in our form of government. Those who try to eliminate the risk are, simultaneously, destroying the present system.
<P>
<DD>
It has always amazed me that the people who claim the greatest allegiance to the Constitution and our form of government should trust either so little. Why do people seem to think our system of government is so fragile that it can't stand on its own among other ideas of government? Why do they assume a system of government that's been able to flourish for more than 200 years is some fragile butterfly? It is, in fact, an iron butterfly, a system that becomes stronger by being challenged, just as we become stronger through exercise. When not challenged, our government—like our bodies or our minds—becomes flabby, self-indulgent, and complacent.

Now that the "communist menace" has been safely laid to rest, I trust I can make a few frank observations about communism, the United States' reaction to the "communist threat," and how great a menace or threat there really was. Prior to 1989, as someone accurately observed, the only state-sponsored religion in the United States was anti-communism. One of the tenets of this religion was that if you did anything but denounce communism in the most virulent terms, you were a communist. Now that it's all over, however, and we can use the word communist without prefacing it with dirty or goddamn, let's take a look at the growth of anti-communism—and thus the growth of state-enforced political conformity—in the United States.

We never really hated communism as much as we hated the way communism was practiced in the Soviet Union, which was totalitarianism. Understandably, we especially hated Stalin's brand of totalitarianism.
<P>
<DD>
It was hard not to hate Joseph Stalin. Of few people in history can one say, "He was personally responsible for the death of millions." Countries have been responsible for the death of millions, but individuals who can claim this distinction are few. Stalin's politics in a nutshell: Kill those who oppose you; terrorize those who support you. Using this method, Stalin succeeded, by 1924, in gaining total control of Russia. He rounded up millions of dissidents, put them in prison camps (the Gulags) and, essentially, starved them to death.
<P>
<DD>
That Stalin was a monster may not have been good for the Russian people, but historically, it was good for the United States. If Stalin had been a weaker leader (like Mussolini), he probably would have joined ranks with Hitler in the 1930s (like Mussolini) and Hitler would have won World War II.

Although communal societies have existed throughout history, what we now call communism was first proposed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in the mid-1800s. Suggesting that everything be owned in common was, naturally, a threat to those who already owned everything. Marx and Engels's book, The Communist Manifesto, published in 1848, began:

For the next seventy years, communism made for stimulating political discussion. In 1918, however, the communists won the Russian Revolution—under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin—and the world's first communist state was established.
<P>
<DD>
In the United States by 1918, communism, socialism, anarchism, or any ism other than Americanism was soundly denounced. In early 1920, for example, a national "Red Scare" resulted in the arrests of 2,700 "communists," "anarchists," and other "radicals." The most famous case during this time was that of Sacco and Vanzetti. They were arrested in Massachusetts in 1920, found guilty in 1921, and executed in 1927, primarily because of their unpopular political beliefs. (They were vindicated on July 19, 1977, in a proclamation by the governor of Massachusetts.)

In Russia, along came Stalin. After three years in a seminary, Stalin saw the light and became a politician. By 1922, Stalin was the general secretary of the Communist Party. Even though shortly before his death in 1924 Lenin had written a "testament" urging that Stalin be removed from his post for inappropriate and arbitrary conduct, Stalin succeeded Lenin as leader of the Soviet Union in 1924.

Throughout the remainder of the 1920s and the 1930s, Stalin repeatedly sought European and American support in forming an alliance against Adolf Hitler. England, France, and America, however, were not interested in dealing with a "communist," forcing Stalin to enter into a nonaggression pact with Hitler in 1939. While this did not make Hitler and Stalin allies, each agreed not to interfere with the military aggression of the other. This gave Hitler the green light to attack Poland, which he promptly did. World War II was underway.

In the 1930s, while enacting and administering some of the most sweeping socialistic programs in American history (the New Deal), Roosevelt remained, in speeches, violently anti-communist. While running for presidential re-election in 1936, for example, he made this speech:
<P>

Note "by fair means or foul." What Mr. Roosevelt was saying—and as practiced by American politicians before and since—is that communism should not be tolerated even if it were introduced by "fair means."
<P>
<DD>
In other words, even if the communists were legally voted into office, it would be unacceptable to President Roosevelt. That the successful 1936 presidential candidate (and the liberal candidate at that) could make such hostile statements, indicated the tenor of the times—a tenor which became increasingly shrill as the years went by.

In addition to being the leader of the Soviet communists, financing communist movements in America, murdering millions, and other distastefulness, the former seminary student had also become an outspoken enemy of all religion. When it was suggested he might want to make a political alliance with the pope, Stalin replied, "The pope? How many divisions has he got?" Stalin was responsible for the adjective godless being grafted onto communism, a phrase which did not help Stalin's—or communism's—standing in American popularity polls.

Anti-communism may have been a national religion in the United States before World War II, but it became a national hysteria after the war. During the cold war, the general public labeled Russia, who had been our vital ally only a few years earlier, our vilest enemy. If the American people had remembered some details about World War II and its peace settlement, we might have seen the "communist menace" in a more realistic perspective, and we might not have spent as much money and destroyed as many lives fighting communism.

In the 1930s, the mood of America was isolationist. We had fought the first world war "to keep the world safe for democracy," and here it was, less than twenty years later, and those quarrelsome Europeans were about to go at it again. The conflict was referred to as the coming "European war" and Americans wanted none of it. With the depression, Americans had enough troubles of their own. In 1937, we were about as likely to return to fight in Europe as we would return to Vietnam today. Various politicians attempted to tell the American people that this war was different—there was this man named Hitler, but the American people, for the most part, were not buying.

No less an American hero than Charles Lindbergh visited Germany and returned to inform the American people that there was no comparison between the air power of England and the air power of Germany: Germany would win the European war. Unless we wanted to go over and fight for ourselves, Lindbergh suggested the path of strict neutrality. His voice was persuasive. He was a realist, but did not take into consideration two factors: first, the tenacity of the British people; and, second, their good sense in making in 1940 Winston Churchill their prime minister. 
<P>

Far from being neutral in the European conflict, Roosevelt leaned heavily toward England. Churchill said, "Give us the tools," and Roosevelt did. Through a program known as lend-lease, the United States supplied Great Britain with ships, airplanes, and armaments. The resulting surge in industrial output, more than any other single factor, helped bring America out of its depression. Although America was not sending fighting men into the European conflict, the United States was no longer officially neutral.

Secretly, of course, Churchill was thrilled.

In late 1943, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met in Teheran. Although still holding the weakest hand, Stalin was in a better negotiating position than anyone had previously thought possible: he had received a gift from Mother Russia. As she had done with Napoleon in 1812, the worst Russian winter in recent memory attacked Hitler's finest army with a fierceness Hitler had not anticipated. Although the newsreels sent back to Berlin showed naked German soldiers rollicking in the snow and having a jolly good time, the reality was far more somber. The snows of winter and the mud of spring made either advance or retreat impossible. Tens of thousands died, the army was demoralized, and Hitler was faced with his first defeat in the war. Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin became, if not comrades, certainly allies.

By early 1945, as an allied victory was in sight, all was not so rosy. In February, the "Big Three" gathered in Yalta in the U.S.S.R. Roosevelt had been elected to a fourth term of office. He was very ill. Stalin found Roosevelt's weakened condition disgusting: born rich, well-educated, a lawyer, disabled in adulthood by a disease that struck mostly children, and now in perpetual ill health. That Americans would elect this man as their leader only four months before indicated the pathetic condition of capitalism and the West. Stalin, three years older than Roosevelt, was still robust. A leader, Stalin felt, must be strong, and strength begins with physical power. The very name Stalin—which he chose for himself when he became a revolutionary—meant "man of steel."

Stalin was feeling strong politically, too. What he brought to the conference table was not insignificant: Stalin had lost 20 million people in the war, compared to Roosevelt's 407,000, and Churchill's 378,000. There was no doubt that had Stalin given in to Hitler in 1941, the war would be over and Hitler would be the winner. Stalin considered himself, then, a full partner in the war and, as an equal victor, was entitled to a full share of the spoils.
<P>

Roosevelt and Churchill had other ideas.
<P>

It wasn't that Churchill and Roosevelt wanted to take more of the spoils than Stalin; Churchill and Roosevelt wanted to give them back to the Germans. Stalin was incensed. When you lose a war, you lose your land: that's what wars were about. If you win a war, you win the land—especially when you are the one attacked. Stalin had not lost 20 million Russians for nothing: he had every intention of expanding the Soviet empire, and that was going to include his fair share of Germany and the lands conquered by Germany earlier in the war.

Roosevelt and Churchill had no designs on Europe—particularly Germany. Germany, they felt, still belonged to the German people: had they not been taken over by Hitler and his SS, they would never have gone to war. Besides, argued Roosevelt and Churchill, Stalin was playing by the old rules of war: Stalin wanted material booty; Roosevelt and Churchill were fighting for ideology, not land.

Stalin had never heard such nonsense. He maintained that all Germans seriously opposed to Hitler had left Germany, been eliminated, or were in concentration camps. The vast majority of the people Roosevelt and Churchill wanted to give Germany back to were firmly behind Adolf Hitler, and had been since at least the first military victories. Besides, this is what happened at the end of World War I: Germany was given back to the German people, who, within two decades, had rearmed and started another world war.

Stalin thought Roosevelt and Churchill's claim that the United States and England fought wars for ideological reasons was particularly ironic: America had declared war on millions of Native Americans, taken their land, and built a country using the forced labor of African Americans who were savagely taken from their homeland. Less than a hundred years before the Yalta Conference, the United States had still been actively involved in the "relocation" of millions of Native Americans and the "migration" of millions more Africans. How, wondered Stalin, could Roosevelt—less than fifty years after the last Indian surrender, which happened not just within Roosevelt's lifetime but within Roosevelt's memory (he would have been sixteen at the time)—have the nerve to tell Stalin that the rules of war had now been "civilized"? Only three months before the Yalta Conference, on November 4, 1944, while campaigning in Boston, Roosevelt acknowledged:

And how dare Roosevelt criticize Stalin's prison camps (the Gulags)? Didn't Roosevelt have more than 110,000 American citizens of Japanese descent rounded up and, without trial, sent to prison camps in the United States? And, speaking of Japan, why was Japan in this war?
<P>
<DD>
Until the mid-1800s, Japan was a fiercely isolationist "floating kingdom." It was content to be completely uninvolved with the rest of the world and remain "floating in the middle of the sea." In 1853, Commander Perry arrived with his gunboat diplomacy. He was intent not on conquering, but on opening trade routes. (Much more civilized than war.) If, however, the United States had left Japan in its 1853 feudal, shogun-dominated state, it would have been about as formidable in the 1940s as, say, Guam. Only eighty-eight years after the American gunboats forced Japan to become a trading partner, who was surprised that Japan would take its revenge by dropping bombs on the modern-day American gunboats at Pearl Harbor?
<P>
<DD>
In a speech to the United States Congress nineteen days after Pearl Harbor, Winston Churchill asked indignantly, "What kind of people do [the Japanese] think we are?" They think, Sir Winston, that we are a pushy people who used gunboats to open up trade with a country that wanted nothing more from the world than to be left alone. "They want to be left alone, do they? FIRE!"
<P>
<DD>
And as for England, although Churchill gave speeches which included lines such as, "We do not covet anything from any nation except their respect," Britain was still, in fact, an imperialist nation: England dominated several countries and had absolutely no intention of giving up control of them after World War II. Although by 1945 the sun occasionally set upon the British empire, it was not sundown for long. India was the perfect example. England had occupied and exploited the country for hundreds of years, and it was not about to stop. Let us not forget Winston Churchill's words about the man who would eventually force England to leave: Mahatma Gandhi.

To add insult to injury, Roosevelt and Churchill wanted to bring France in as a full partner in the postwar division of Germany. France! Its "impregnable" Maginot line was a joke: Germany simply took Belgium and went around it. France fell in six weeks. France had refused an alliance with the Soviet Union when Stalin offered it in the 1930s. Why should Stalin give away any of Germany to them? By rights, France should be part of the spoils to be divided: it had lost to Germany, and now Germany was about to lose to the Allies. In Stalin's view, France had surrendered its sovereignty in 1940.

When Truman, Churchill, and Stalin gathered at Potsdam in mid-summer 1945, the chill of the coming cold war was in the air. As at Yalta, Stalin brought the same trump card: war casualties. In terms of the dead, Stalin paid a higher price than all the Allied countries combined. (Roughly half of all World War II casualties were Russian.)

To the Potsdam Conference, however, Truman (whose favorite game was poker) came to the table holding a wild card that would guarantee him the winning hand again and again: the day before the conference began, on July 16, the first atomic bomb was successfully exploded at Alamogordo, New Mexico.

Although Roosevelt may not have been strong physically, he was smart. When Roosevelt took office in 1932, he organized what was called the Brain Trust. He sought the power of intellect, ideas, and creativity to help solve the formidable problems facing the country. World War II was won because, at the beginning of the war, the West, inferior in armaments, had a slight technological advantage. Although Britain did not have the air power (brute force) of Hitler's Luftwaffe, England had radar, giving it information. Before a British plane left the ground, Air Command knew where the German planes had entered English airspace, how many there were, and at what speed they were flying. Without radar, England would have lost the war.

<DD>
Another example of brain over brawn was the British mathematical genius who, early in the war, broke the Nazi code. By intercepting radio communications, Britain knew of German ship and submarine movements, as well as other vital military information. Germany was quite certain it was protected by its "unbreakable" code. One brain unlocked the information without which England would have fallen.
<P>
<DD>
Hitler appreciated brains and technology, too. His "flying bombs" brought untold destruction to British cities. When his rocket bomb, the V-1, was first dropped on England toward the end of the war, the devastation was so great and the potential devastation so awesome that the news was kept from the British people.

Stalin, in direct contrast to the technological West, fought the war in the time-honored tradition of "throw more troops at the enemy." In creating the love of country and fear of retribution necessary for whole towns and regiments to fight to the bitter end, Stalin was unmatched. When it came to ideas, well, let's just say that Stalin would never have been part of Roosevelt's Brain Trust.

With the atomic bomb, the United States no longer needed Russia's support in the invasion of Japan. The atomic bomb also neutralized Stalin's implied threats concerning Europe that "There are 20 million more Russians where those came from." Stalin knew that England and the United States were not willing to risk high casualties in order to have their way on post-war Germany. England and the United States had this funny quirk: they actually cared about how many troops they lost. Stalin found this a weakness in war: as a general, he only cared if there were more troops available. Stalin mercilessly exploited what he saw as the West's weakness. At Yalta it had worked. At Potsdam it did not. The West now had the power to, with one bomb, succeed where both Napoleon and Hitler had failed: to destroy Moscow.
<P>

With the bomb, the West did not just have the winning hand: it owned the casino. Stalin backed off, licked his wounds, and began making other plans. Some say we should have continued the war until Stalin was eliminated; others say Stalin should have been given the Germany he wanted. One side said destroy him; another side said make him a friend. The United States did neither. Stalin left Potsdam humiliated but not weakened.

Truman immediately began a plan to rebuild Europe and give it back to the Europeans—including the Germans. Congress approved the spending of—in today's dollars—the equivalent of $100 billion. This rebuilding of Europe has usually been couched in humanitarian terms and, from one point of view, it was a humanitarian venture. Stalin, however, saw it as a military action against Russia and an insult to him personally. The rebuilding of Europe was even administered by a U.S. general and named after him: the Marshall Plan.

Here was the West, returning German control to Germany. Russia shared a border with Germany. England was across the English Channel, and America was across the Atlantic. Just as Hitler had not invaded England or the United States, Stalin reasoned, so, too, Germany's next leader would invade Russia first.

On a more immediate level, Stalin perceived the United States as "buying" the favor of the European people. These were the enemies. Where was the money for the allies?

The United States was so caught up with its own internal anti-communist witch hunt that it failed to notice the most important event of 1953: the death of its enemy. With Stalin's passing in 1953, the cold war could have been over. All this witch hunting was, apparently, too much fun (and there were darker motives, which we shall get to shortly), so it continued. In 1956, when the Soviet Communist Party denounced Stalin's "policies and personality" (and there's not much more about a political leader you can denounce than that), once again the door was wide open for a warmer relationship with Russia: we could blame the cold war on Stalin, declare the hostilities over, and get on with our lives. Although Stalin's replacement, Nikita Khrushchev, pursued a policy of "peaceful coexistence" and even toured the United States in 1959 (visiting Disneyland and the set of the film Can-Can), he canceled a 1960 Paris Summit Conference when a United States reconnaissance plane was shot down over Russia. The flying of illegal spy planes over Russia was hardly a gesture that would help end the cold war.

Without the threat of communist aggression, the cold-war build-up of the military—with its blank-check policy with industry—would have been entirely unnecessary. If Russia was our friend, who would be our enemy? There was none. A wartime economy, however, is terrific for industry. In a wartime economy, industry makes guaranteed profits with no fear of competition or need for efficiency. The typical defense contract reads: "Spend what you need, deliver it when you can, pay the executives of your company whatever you like, and add a 15 percent profit." What industry wouldn't want that kind of contract rather than competing for profits in a free marketplace? Capitalism is work. Defense Department contracts are play.
<P>
<DD>
Just as a wartime economy does not require industry to follow the precepts of capitalism, so, too, in time of war, the military is not required to follow democratic principles. The military structure, of course, is precisely the opposite of a democracy; the will of the people is not communicated from below: orders are passed down from above. For those who love power, democracy is inconvenient. The military is the power seeker's paradise.
<P>

So, the profit-hungry industrialists and the power-hungry militarists were busy destroying capitalism and democracy in the name of defending capitalism and democracy.

John F. Kennedy knew of the military-industrial complex's power—his father made quite a lot of money with a more primitive form of this economic system. President Kennedy did what he could to work within it. He attempted, for example, to switch from war production to space production. The "space race" was not sold to the American public as a way of advancing humanity's scientific knowledge, but as a way to "beat the Russians to the moon." Kennedy hoped to redirect the anti-communist sentiment into a peacetime activity that would keep the military-industrial complex happy. Alas, a race to the moon was not enough. The military-industrial complex needed a war. The military-industrial complex thought Vietnam held all the delicious possibilities of Korea. Kennedy resisted. Many assassination buffs maintain that this resistance is what got Kennedy killed.

As a staunch pro-capitalist Republican with strong anti-communist credentials, Nixon could do some things that no liberal democrat would dare to do.

After the Vietnam War was lost in 1973, the domino theory fell, too. One country after another in Southeast Asia did not fall to communist aggression. U.S.-Soviet relations entered into a period of detente, which is Russian for, "We're both really tired; why don't we rest for a while?" Presidents Ford and Carter were happy with this policy. So, apparently, were most of the American people. Ronald Reagan was not. He found pockets of subversive communism in South America, Central America, and, of course, North America. The cold war heated up.

But Russia was not ready for another round. It was bankrupt. As the Iron Curtain came crashing down in the late 1980s and early 1990s, what we found was not a political superpower, but a near-third-world country without roads, industry, communications, or a viable economy. If Russia hadn't been Russia, we would have been giving it foreign aid for decades. As it turns out, Russia was just "putting on a show."

The cold war was a necessity when it began, when the Soviet regime posed a genuine threat to democratic governments. It was a necessity at least until Khrushchev put missiles in Cuba in 1962.

If Chancellor's analysis is correct, the Vietnam War was completely unnecessary. Some commentators say after the fall of Vietnam and the failure of communism to spread throughout the Mideast, there was no need for the massive nuclear and military build-up that continued taking place. Looking back, few except the extreme right accept the necessity for the multi-trillion dollar military build-up during the Reagan-Bush years.

<P>
<DD>
What did the cold war cost us? We can start with the 118,000 American military deaths and 256,000 injuries suffered since 1945—most of which resulted from various anti-communist military conflicts. We can add to that a good portion of the accumulated Defense Department budget from 1945 to 1993: a mere $20 trillion. If we hadn't wasted much of this amount in unnecessary defense, the national debt—currently dragging us down—would be a national surplus. In this country alone, the Defense Department has left behind 11,000 sites which are contaminated either by radioactive materials or toxic chemicals. And then there are the all-but-forgotten Vietnam veterans, a disproportionate number of whom fill the ranks of the homeless.

One more thing: these military-industrial people are still in charge. Maybe not the same people, but the same organizations. The Military-Industrial-Complex Playhouse plays on. They're just having a little trouble finding a new leading player: Bush failed. Casting, however, continues in earnest. The religious right keeps the campfires burning, and liberals who worry more about stomping out drug use and gun ownership than preventing others from stomping on the Constitution throw napalm on those campfires.

What may be next is any political thought that doesn't fit into the conservative Democrat/Republican range.

There's a lot more film available for that projector, however, and we must be careful to know a movie when we see one. A consensual crime—drug use—currently monopolizes that projector. Other reels are being edited and, if sufficiently menacing political enemies cannot be found, consensual criminals will have to do. Note the horror films the Pentagon (not to mention Jerry Falwell) had ready when it was suggested the military acknowledge the gays already in its ranks. Films are available for all the other consensual crimes, as well. For them to surface, all it takes is someone in power—or a sufficient number of the American people—to seriously suggest legalization.

Concerning the question of our current military spending—several hundred billion borrowed dollars just to keep this behemoth in place—one fact should by now be obvious: Future American wars will be fought against terrorists, not armies.

THERE  CAN  BE  NO  MORE fundamental statement concerning individual freedom and responsibility than this: Our bodies and our lives belong to ourselves. Our bodies do not belong to the state, to our relatives, or to our friends.
<P>
<DD>
The laws against suicide and assisted suicide run directly counter to this concept. These laws spring from our cultural unwillingness to face the reality of death, and the religious belief that "only God can take a life."suicide based on religious grounds are precisely the ones who support capital punishment. Could we at least have a little consistency here, please?> 
<P>
<DD>
The laws against suicide are obviously the silliest laws in the world: if one is successful, who gets punished? If one does not succeed at suicide, then are we to assume that arresting and locking that person up is somehow going to help? "Where am I?" "You're in a jail cell. You attempted suicide. You're going to spend the next ten years of your life here." Terrific.
<P>
<DD>
When Derek Humphrey's book on suicide, Final Exit, was published, it caused an absolute scandal. You would think he had divulged some great mystical secret; as though we didn't know that the means to our own end is in our hands, and is always at hand. That we can commit suicide at any time is a given. The only thing that laws against suicide force one to do when committing suicide is use techniques that are either messy, painful, dangerous to others—or all three.

<DD>
In attempting suicide, there's always the chance that one will wind up not dead, but a vegetable. It is this fear that causes people to use fail-safe (that is, absolutely guaranteed) methods of suicide that either hurt (hanging, slitting wrists in a warm bathtub), are messy (bullets in the head), or could potentially harm others (jumping off buildings, high-speed car crashes). The standard technique of "taking a bottle of sleeping pills" is uncertain at best. If one takes too few, one may wind up a vegetable. If one takes too many, one may vomit before sufficient medication is absorbed through the stomach and one may wind up a vegetable.
<P>
<DD>
All of this is so unnecessary because, with the proper number of pills, a simple injection, or inhaling carbon monoxide or nitrous oxide, one can peacefully and painlessly die.
<P>
<DD>
When one chooses to die, shouldn't one have the right to do so in the presence of friends and loved ones? In more than half the states (and the number is growing), the law says no. If you invite friends or loved ones to be there, you put them at risk of being charged with "assisted suicide," "accessory to suicide," or even murder (first degree murder in at least two states). So many suicide notes contain messages such as, "I'm so sorry we couldn't be together at the end, but I did not want to endanger you. I thought this way was best."
<P>
<DD>
Note that I haven't said a word about motivation. One's motivation to commit suicide is not the issue here. What is at issue is the fundamental right to make decisions about one's own life. Without government intervention.
<P>
<DD>
Suicidal thoughts are a symptom of emotional depression. Our culture's taboo against suicide often keeps people who are thinking about suicide from talking about it. By talking about it, people can often get the emotional and psychological support they need to see them through a rough time. When people are afraid to talk about it, the pressures can increase to the point that they actually do something about it. If suicide itself were not forced to be—by law—such a lonely activity, we might have fewer suicides. Even if we did not, however, there is no reason for laws that make one's last moments painful and lonely.

Nowhere is the concept of assisted suicide and the cruelty of making it illegal more pronounced than when individuals are unable to take their own lives. People in advanced stages of life-threatening illness, for example, sometimes either don't have the use of their limbs or are unable to gather the proper drugs or paraphernalia by which they might deliver themselves. Here, suicide is only available through assistance. By filling out the proper legal documents ahead of time, people can clearly indicate the point of deterioration after which they choose to no longer live. When this point is reached, death then becomes a medical procedure.
<P>
<DD>
We accept the fact that if one makes a living will, his or her life will not be artificially extended through the use of life support systems. Once the life support systems are removed (an accepted medical procedure), have you considered what death might be like for that person? To find out, exhale completely and do not take your next breath while you continue reading. (Please try this.) If one is taken off artificial respiration, he or she no longer has the ability to inhale. Death may come "within a matter of minutes," but what are those minutes like? "Well, they'll be given painkilling medications, won't they?" To the degree prescribed by law, yes. These are, however, sometimes woefully inadequate. To take a breath (as you probably notice if you are attempting the experiment) is a powerful biologic imperative. The lack of oxygen can sometimes rouse one from the effects of limited legal dosages of medication. This torture may go on for days. One might be able to rouse oneself to, say, two breaths per minute. Or, one's lungs may be filling up with fluids in what the doctors acknowledge will be the inevitable form of death. Here, one is permitted to slowly drown. If intravenous feeding tubes (medically considered a form of life support) are removed, one dies of dehydration; this while one is starving to death.

People who take part in the "death watch," in hospitals when the end is near, often ask the doctors, "Isn't there something you can give [him or her]?" The answer: no. Certainly not by law. That some hospital personnel quietly give larger doses of painkilling medication than legally permitted is a well-known and generally accepted medical fact. The administration of these drugs, of course, must be kept absolutely confidential. The family, then, cannot know the moment of death. (In fact, such medical mercies are usually performed when no one is present.)
<P>
<DD>
The desire to be with loved ones when they die is a strong one. Once a person who is clearly dying has indicated his or her desire to die after a certain point of deterioration, why should being with that person for the final moments be a matter of chance? The days—sometimes weeks—of waiting around hospitals twenty-four hours a day, being afraid to leave even for a moment because that might be when the loved one dies, are an unnecessary torture on friends and relatives.

Human life consists in mutual service. No grief, pain, misfortune or "broken heart" is excuse for cutting off one's life while any power of service remains.

Again, I am not discussing the ethics of when others decide your life is over, but the rights you yourself have to determine when you no longer want to live. If individuals—for spiritual, religious, or any other reasons—choose to hang on until God or nature determines their last breath, they certainly have that right. What I am speaking of here is abolishing laws that prohibit people from taking their own lives, either with or without the assistance of others.

Life is a precious possession. As with all of our possessions, how we use, manage, and eventually say good-bye to life is our own business, not the law's.

IN THIS CHAPTER WE explore a variety of consensual crimes. Each one demonstrates yet again (a) the government does not trust its citizens to take care of themselves; (b) the moralists of our time don't believe in the ancient wisdom, "live and let live"; (c) if we put a bunch of lawyers together, call them "lawmakers," give them a hefty salary, and provide them with nearly unlimited power, they will make laws.
<P>
<DD>
I named this chapter "The Titanic Laws" not because these laws are so gargantuan (they are, in fact, only large in their pettiness). No, this chapter was named after an actual law, passed by the Congress of the United States after extended and expensive debate, and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on October 21, 1986—just in time for Halloween.
<P>
<DD>
The Titanic Maritime Memorial Act of 1985 makes it illegal for any U.S. citizen to buy, sell, or own anything that went down with the Titanic. This flies in the face of international maritime salvage laws written long before the formation of the United States. The Titanic Maritime Memorial Act is yet another unnecessary hindrance to free enterprise and our rights as citizens to buy, sell, or own whatever we choose. The lawmakers wanted to allow the Titanic to rest "undisturbed" on the ocean floor and discourage salvage operations by eliminating the American market. I don't know about you, but ever since hearing about this law I have desperately wanted to own a piece of the Titanic. Call me a rebel without a pause, but anything will do: a rusty bolt, a broken tea cup, an ice cube.

In order for such a nonsensical law to pass, the bill had to discuss such concepts as not disturbing the graves of those brave passengers who sank in mid-Atlantic in 1912. Well, a great many of the bodies were recovered and properly buried. The rest were eaten by fishes long ago. (Perhaps we should pass a law saying that no fishing can take place within 300 miles of the Titanic to make sure we don't eat any of those fish who might be descendants of fish who nibbled on one of those "brave" passengers.)
<P>
<DD>
Speaking of federal laws, death, and the ocean, did you know that "burial of cremated remains shall take place no closer than three nautical miles from land"? This is to make sure that the remains "will have minimal adverse environmental impact." And, did you know that you have to report all such burials "within 30 days to the (EPA) Regional Administrator of the Region from which the vessel carrying the remains departed"?
<P>
<DD>
When a body is cremated, it is exposed to 1800- to 2000-degree heat for 1 to 3 hours. Nothing is left but some brittle bones, which are ground up—one's ashes are not really ashes; they are ground calcium—and placed in a container. What remains is about two quarts of, well, remains.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permits raw sewage, toxic waste, and poisons of various kinds (within certain limits) to be dumped into lakes, streams, and directly offshore. Outrageously sanitized calcium, however, must go outside the three-mile limit. One also wonders, "What does the Regional Administrator do with all those reports? What does he or she need them for? Is it possible that there could be so much ash dumping in a certain section of ocean outside the three-mile limit that the Regional Administrator would be forced to cordon off a segment of the ocean? Give people a job administrating, and they'll create things to administer.
<P>
<DD>
Granted, disturbing the "International Maritime Memorial to the men, women, and children who perished aboard" the Titanic (I was quoting from the law there) and dumping Uncle Nathan's ashes only 2 miles and not 3 miles from shore do not exactly fill the police blotters or jail cells, but let's consider a crime that does: public drunkenness. More than 6% of all arrests in 1994—713,200—were for public drunkenness. This is, simply, being drunk in public—not operating a motor vehicle, trespassing, or disturbing the peace (they each have their own arrest categories). Public drunkenness is someone staggering down the street or leaning against the proverbial lamp post. Like loitering (another 128,400 arrests) or vagrancy (25,300 arrests), public drunkenness is generally considered one of those "discretionary laws": the police make the arrest or not based on their own discretion. Police are not supposed to arrest everyone who appears drunk in public (imagine the jail load on New Year's Eve if that were the case), but those who are, well . . . what?

Here's the problem with discretionary laws: what are the criteria of discretion? Not having specific criteria allows law enforcement officers to write the law, try the case, and enforce it on the spot. Ultimately (and inevitably), this leads to a police state. To protect our freedom, we keep those who make the laws, those who arrest people for breaking the laws, and those who decide whether the suspects are guilty or not in three distinct groups. Any breach of that system invites trouble.
<P>
<DD>
As it is, the public drunkenness, loitering, and vagrancy laws can be used as excuses by unethical law enforcement officers to arrest people they happen not to like. "I smell alcohol on your breath. I'm taking you in for public drunkenness." You won't be convicted, generally, but a night in jail is punishment enough. Sue the officer for false arrest? Right. That means hiring a lawyer. Out of the jail cell and into the fire.
<P>
<DD>
Please keep in mind that if public drunkenness, loitering, or vagrancy become trespassing, disturbing the peace, vandalism, or obstructing traffic, then arrests are in order. Yes, it may be uncomfortable seeing drunks, loiterers, and vagrants staggering, loitering, and being vague on public streets, but that's the price we pay for keeping them public streets and not "Official Police Property."

But—with seat belt laws in particular—there's a lot more than mere paternalism in the works. Here politics, power, and simple greed enter trap door, center. This from Consumer Reports, April 1993:

The single most significant safety improvement is the air bag, an improvement that auto manufacturers fought every step of the way.
<P>
The first air-bag regulations were promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 1970. But when auto makers complained that air bags were too expensive, the Nixon administration quashed the rule.
<P>
An air bag standard was reissued in 1977, under Jimmy Carter, but was revoked again, in 1981, when the Reagan Administration caved in to auto makers' complaints.
<P>
After the Supreme Court ruled that the Administration unlawfully rescinded the rule, a new air-bag standard was issued in 1984. But the auto makers again succeeded in watering it down, so that it required only "passive restraints." Those could be air bags or "automatic" safety belts, or a combination—at the carmaker's discretion.

This is where the seat belt laws came from. The federal government forced states to enact mandatory seat belt laws. (If the states wanted to continue receiving federal highway funding, they had to pass seat-belt laws.) Yes, this was a major intrusion on the rights of drivers—especially drivers who believed they were safer without seat belts. (A minority, but certainly entitled to risk their own lives on their opinion.) The reason for these seat belt laws is that Detroit did not want to include the air bags—which automatically protect the driver and passenger better than seat belts do—and the Nixon and Reagan administrations cooperated with the major-political-campaign-donor auto makers.

Instead of telling the American public the truth, however, Detroit and the federal regulators regaled us with one story after another about how many lives would be saved, how many injuries prevented, and how kind the federal government was to force the states to enact seat belt laws. However, to continue from the Consumer Reports article:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
A driver's-side air bag increases the driver's chance of surviving a crash by 29 percent. That's on top of the margin afforded by wearing lap-and-shoulder belts. Had all cars on the road in 1971 been equipped with a driver's-side air bag, some 4,000 people killed that year would have survived.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DD>
That's 100,000 people over the past twenty-five years—without the mandatory seat belt law. So, really: does the federal government care about us? Not unless we're a major lobby. What's especially galling is the sanctimonious attitude with which the government takes away our personal freedoms and convinces us it's for our own good, while, in reality, the government is allowing people to die unnecessarily every day because it caved in to political and economic pressure from a powerful lobby. To quote again from Consumer Reports:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
Now that safety has become a major selling point, no carmaker wants to mention that air-bag technology was developed in Detroit more than 20 years ago and left unexploited for nearly as long. Neither do the ads touting safety mention the years of delay and lives lost through auto maker opposition.

Laws that require motorcycle riders to wear helmets were passed not due to the lobbying of the motorcycle industry (no motorcycle air bag has yet been perfected), but due to a general public dislike (shared by many law enforcement officers) of motorcyclists. It's not the argument, "Helmet laws will save motorcyclists' lives," that convinces people to favor such laws, but the argument, "People are more severely injured in motorcycle accidents if they aren't wearing a helmet, so insurance rates and the potential financial burdens to society go up." No one seems to worry much about the "cost to society" of cigarettes, alcohol, prescription drugs, or any of the other lethal legal activities. Motorcyclists opposed to helmets claim their vision, hearing, and the mobility of their head are impaired by the helmet; therefore, they feel they are more likely to get into an accident. Further, they claim, if you're going to be killed in a motorcycle accident, you're going to be killed: helmets probably won't help that much. According to the General Accounting Office, of the more than 3,000 motorcycle deaths in the United States in 1990, 45% of the riders were wearing helmets.
<P>
<DD>
But safety is not the issue: personal choice is. The motorcycle rider who is more seriously injured or even killed because he or she is not wearing a helmet hurts himself or herself only. If insurance companies and states want to require special insurance coverage for those who choose to ride without helmets, that's fine: those who take risks should see to it that they are not a financial burden on society. Health insurance companies that offer better rates to nonsmokers are, in effect, charging smokers higher rates. That's fair. Charging motorcyclists a premium to not wear a helmet is also fair. Insisting that a cyclist wear a helmet or else is not fair.

People obviously don't want helmet laws. In 1967, the federal government issued another of its financial ultimatums: if a state didn't enact a helmet law, it ran the risk of losing highway funding. By 1975, all but three states (as diverse as California, Illinois, and Utah) had complied (succumbed?). In 1976, when Congress rescinded the ruling, twenty-nine states repealed their laws. Now the federal government is back with a let's-do-helmet-laws-again attitude.
<P>
<DD>
Allow me for a moment to view with the cold eye of an insurance actuary a motorcyclist's potential for hurting others. A motorcyclist involved in a serious accident becomes a projectile: the rider's motorcycle stops, the rider does not, and we have a human rocket flying through space. If this human rocket hits something or someone, the human rocket is more dangerous wearing a heavy, hard helmet than not. To reduce potential injury to nonconsenting others, then, the law should prohibit motorcycle helmets. Okay. Enough actuarial thinking. Let's return to the question: "Why helmet laws?"
<P>
<DD>
When the California helmet law was passed in 1991(*FN), the California Highway Patrol "lobbied heavily," according to the Los Angeles Times, for the law's passage. Why? What possible business is it of the California Highway Patrol to force its concept of personal safety on motorcycle riders? Wouldn't the California Highway Patrol's precious lobbying time be better spent getting more highway patrol officers, better equipment, or making sure Ted Turner doesn't colorize old episodes of Highway Patrol? Yes, it may be that the Highway Patrol thought it was saving lives, or could it be—as some pro-choice motorcycle helmetists claim—that the Highway Patrol wanted to separate the "bad" cyclists from the "good" cyclists? (The "bad" cyclists don't want to wear motorcycle helmets; the "good" cyclists may or may not want to, but will because "it's the law.") Now the Highway Patrol knows a "bad" cyclist on sight: no helmet.

There's also the matter of fines: a first offense is $100, second offense $200, third offense $250. With enough offenses, "bad" motorcycle riders will lose their licenses. If they ride anyway, they'll go to jail. Just where "bad" motorcycle riders belong. In the first year of California's helmet law, close to $1 million worth of tickets were written. If enough laws like this are enacted on relatively powerless, marginally unpopular groups, the rich, powerful people won't have to pay any tax at all. (Do they anyway?) Well, before I get too cynical about this one, let's move on to a much more exciting topic: public nudity.
<P>
<DD>
By public nudity, I'm not referring to flashers or other aggressive, pseudo-sexual behavior. I'm referring to people who want certain beaches set aside on which clothing is optional. Frankly, I don't think nudity in public should be a major concern for the same reason I don't think we need to concern ourselves about people wearing fried eggs on their foreheads or people heavily rouging their nostrils and skipping down the street singing "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer." I mean, how many people actually want to do it?

Even if something is illegal, if people really want to do it, a certain number of them do it. How many people have you actually seen shopping nude in the supermarket? How many people have confessed to you how satisfying it was to walk in the nude amongst the nude paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art? In the many lists of "secret fantasies" I have read, "walking around Sears Roebuck nude"—or doing anything else nude that didn't involve Tom Cruise or Sharon Stone—did not make the list.
<P>
<DD>
The laws against nudity make no sense. The idea that Jerry Falwell can go topless while Cindy Crawford cannot is an absolute affront to logic, common sense, and the 5,000-year human struggle for aesthetic taste. The reason that women should wear more clothing than men goes back to the old possession concept: "This is my property," sayeth the man, "and you can't even look at it." In the 1890s, for a woman to show an ankle in public was scandalous. By 1910, it was the calf. By the 1920s, it was the knees. By the 1950s, two-piece bathing suits were all the rage (and scandal). Today, in England, women appear topless regularly in magazines, newspapers, and even on television. It's been going on for years. England has not exactly fallen into complete moral collapse because of it.

Other than a spate of streaking in the early 1970s (which was more about playful shock than nudity), the only real social nudity we've been confronted with in our country is at beaches. Some people like more of their fun exposed to the sun than others. The police in Pinellas County, Florida, began locking up nudists who frequented an isolated beach. "Come on, deputies," Don Addis chided them in the St. Petersburg Times, "If that's all you've got to do with your time, go join a Big Brother program or something." Mr. Addis continued,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
A member of the sheriff's marine unit, it says here, came jogging along the beach posing as an average, everyday gawker then pulled a badge. That undercover technique will have to do for now, until the rubber naked-person suits arrive.
<P>
At first the deputies approached the beach from the open sea in their official boats in hopes of catching skinny-baskers unaware. I wonder how long it took them to figure out why that wasn't working. (You'd think they would have learned something from the Normandy invasion. By the time the Allied forces came ashore, the Germans all had their clothes on.)
<P>
Meanwhile, down at the Addis-Holtz Behavioral Research Institute and Sub Shop, laboratory rats are being used extensively in the study of nudity, with the aim of helping humans afflicted with the dread condition. One group of rats was dressed in tiny little polyester suits, complete with shirts, ties, hats, two-tone wingtip shoes, socks and colorfully patterned boxer undershorts. Another group of rats was left unclothed.
<P>
It was found that the rats without clothes mated more readily than those trussed up to the incisors in off-the-rack ratwear. Conclusion: Nudity causes lust in rats.
<P>
The findings have been challenged in some scientific circles on the grounds that researchers failed to take into account the possible effects of (1) embarrassment on the part of rats whose undershorts had trombones printed on them, (2) fear of criticism from Mr. Blackwell and (3) chafing.

"And what about the children?" some ask. In 1920, it was considered scandalous for a man to appear in any public arena other than prize-fighting (with its all-male audience) with his shirt off. Children raised not seeing men with their shirts off were naturally a bit giggly and curious as the first daring shirtless men began appearing on beaches, in magazines, and in movies. Today, because it's what children are raised with, no one thinks of a topless male as a threat to the morality of children. After a similar period with topless women (or even fully nude adults), the children will adjust (a lot faster than their parents, probably), life will go on, and police can go catch real criminals. Remember: children are born naked. They seem to like nothing better than getting naked. It's adults who teach them what parts of their bodies are and are not shameful to expose. A child has no natural guilt about this at all.
<P>
<DD>
The most publicized nudity case of the past several years is the man who padded around the University of California, Berkeley, campus wearing sandals, a bookbag, and nothing else. This went on for months; his fanny appeared in every publication but Christian World (where it might have appeared: I must admit I'm not a regular reader), and the campus did not seem to either disintegrate or lose its academic credentials—although it did lose a bit of its radical chic when it finally banned nude students.

Now why on earth should transvestism be illegal? As a Frenchman accurately observed in the 1930s, "Mae West is the greatest female impersonator in the world!" Somehow in this country, as long as a female impersonator has been a female, it's been okay: Jayne Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, Zsa Zsa Gabor.(*FN)  Just as Charlie Chaplin used to refer to his Tramp character as "the little fellow," so Bette Midler referred to her outrageous stage persona when honoring a male female impersonator who impersonated her: "He did a better Bette than I."

The closest we've come to accepting a male female impersonator is Liberace. Of course, it's hard to tell exactly what he was impersonating. Was he impersonating a Rockette? A Las Vegas showgirl? Wayne Newton? A piano player? Whatever it was, it made him famous, rich ("I cried all the way to the bank"), and adored.
<P>

Liberace followed Quentin Crisp's advice, detailed in Quentin's book, How to Become a Virgin: if what you're doing causes people to cross the street to avoid you, confess every detail of what you're doing on television. This is the act of national cleansing. All your sins are forgiven. You become a virgin again. More importantly, you become a celebrity virgin. People will now cross the street—at great peril to their lives—in order to shake your hand and say, "I saw you last night on the telly!"

I wrote "Englishman In New York" for a friend of mine who moved from London to New York in his early seventies to a small rented apartment in the Bowery at a time in his life when most people have settled down forever. He once told me over dinner that he looked forward to receiving his naturalization papers so that he could commit a crime and not be deported. "What kind of crime?" I asked anxiously.

The crowning moment of her entire career was when she stood up in her box in the opera house in Buenos Aires and made a speech.

When the expensive clatter had died away, her speech began, "We, the shirtless . . .!"

You may not believe in Mrs. Pern, but the Argentinians did. So much so that when she died they petitioned the Pope to make her a saint.

Contrary to popular misbelief, a good number of transvestites—both male and female—are also heterosexual. Just because they want to get dressed up like the opposite sex does not necessarily mean they want to go to bed with the same sex. Some have successful heterosexual marriages and enjoy the most delightful shopping expeditions with their spouses. It must be reminiscent of the scene on an episode of Soap in which the Billy Crystal character is discovered by his mother in one of her dresses. "What are you doing wearing my dress?" she yells, taking a hard look at him. She takes a closer look. "Oh! You wear it with a belt."
<P>
<DD>
Laws against transvestism, obviously, spring from the hatred of women: "Why would a man want to get dressed up like a woman?" The fear of homosexuality that grew out of that same irrational disgust has kept the laws against cross-dressing on the books: "normal" heterosexual men don't want to be "tricked" into falling for a "woman" who's really a man. What a waste of testosterone! And what an embarrassment. Who wants to feel like the Charles Durning character in Tootsie? Falling for Dustin Hoffman in drag. How demeaning. And then he winds up your son-in-law no less! No, there's gotta be a law against this.

IT WAS KNOWN AS THE Enlightenment. Remarkable human beings shined the light of reason on areas of human endeavor that, for centuries, were kept in the darkness of dogma, fear, and prejudice. Philosophy, anatomy, medicine, astronomy, music, physics, and even the most taboo subjects of all—religion and government—were explored anew. It was the time of Bacon, Locke, Descartes, Spinoza, Voltaire, Rousseau, Franklin, Jefferson, Swift, Kant, Sir Isaac Newton, Mozart, and Beethoven. The death of Beethoven—punctuated by lightning—marked the end of the Enlightenment.

One of the Age of Enlightenment's great creations—an experiment that continues to this day—is the government of the United States.  No less than Voltaire's Candide or the Beethoven symphonies, the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution with its Bill of Rights are masterpieces of the Enlightenment.
<P>
<DD>
Helping to lay the foundation of the Enlightenment (also known as the Age of Reason) was John Locke (1632–1704). Locke was an Englishman who, thanks to his "treasonous" thoughts, spent a good deal of time outside England. When he began to explore government, he—like all good thinkers—started at the beginning. He asked, "Why should there be a government? What is the purpose of government?" These questions, in themselves, were considered treasonous. At that time, everyone knew there was a government because God wanted it that way. If God didn't want it that way, there wouldn't be a government. Anyone who questioned further was guilty not only of treason, but heresy. The church and the state ruled together, by Divine Right. Anyone who questioned this arrangement questioned the authority of God. For such blasphemy, the law declared, one should be put to death. Many were. Nonetheless, John Locke asked his question, "What is the purpose of government?"

First, Locke concluded that all human beings are endowed with what he called natural rights. Human beings, individually, belonged to themselves. This notion directly countered the prevailing belief that one's body belonged to the state and that one's soul belonged to the church. One could be granted privileges from the state and purchase indulgences from the church, but the "rights of man," both here and hereafter, belonged to the state and the church.
<P>
<DD>
The idea that humans owned their own lives and had certain freedoms simply because they existed was central to the Enlightenment. The great minds of the period saw the logic and the fundamental reasonableness of individual liberty and natural rights.
<P>
<DD>
If we are free, then, and if we have natural rights, why should we give some of these rights over to a government? The only reason for doing so, Locke explained in his <I>Two Treatises of Government</I> (1690), was that people get more from the government by surrendering some rights than they would by keeping them. Individuals form communities because it serves the individual.

For example, a community might agree that, if bandits come, everyone will join to fight off the bandits. Even if only one person in the community is attacked by bandits, the entire community agrees to rise up and protect that one member. In this way, each member of the community is giving away a natural right (the right not to risk your life to save someone else) for a benefit (protection from invaders).
<P>
<DD>
Another example: Within the community, everyone might agree that what one grows or makes is one's own and cannot be taken away without the owner's permission. Being part of this community, then, means giving up a certain right (taking all you can) in exchange for a benefit (keeping what you've got). You agree not to take things from people weaker than yourself in exchange for knowing that you will not have your things taken by people stronger than you. For Locke, government was
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
for the regulating and preserving of property and of employing the force of the community in the execution of such laws, and in the defense of the commonwealth from foreign injury, and all this only for the public good.

Noticeably absent from this plan is religion. Prior to Locke, religion was used—sometimes for good and sometimes for ill—as the fundamental moral principle behind government. During the 1600s, the Catholic and Protestant monarchs played musical thrones in England, which only led to suffering and waste. Locke saw firsthand the inequity, impracticality, and downright unreasonableness of the state based on the ruler's religion. In his A Letter Concerning Toleration, Locke began the process of separating church and state. A trained physician, he knew this would be a delicate but necessary operation. The letter was first published in 1689 and revised by him several times prior to his death in 1704.

Locke, who trained for the clergy, did not attack religion. He used the arguments of religion to show that both church and state would, in fact, be better off apart. The state has its job; the church has its job; and, when both are left to do their jobs, everything is fine. When the government tries to do the church's job and the church tries to do the government's job, all sorts of mischief arise.
<P>
<DD>
Just as he argued in Two Treatises on Government that an individual's body and property belong to the individual, in A Letter Concerning Toleration Locke argued that the individual's soul belongs to the individual, not the church. "The care, therefore, of every man's soul belongs unto himself and is to be left unto himself." Thus the basis for freedom of religion was established.

But what if a person is clearly off the path and headed for unhappiness in this lifetime and hellfire in the next? Shouldn't we do something to make that person change course? No, argues Locke, if we are compelled to help another, that help must be limited to persuasion. "It is one thing to persuade, another to command," wrote Locke; "one thing to press with arguments, another with penalties." If these wayward souls fail to heed our arguments and continue to harm themselves, placing their afterlife in danger, then should we not physically alter their course? Absolutely not, Locke maintains:

If we can't win people over to our belief in God by reason, we shouldn't ask the government to back up our failure with physical force. This is unseemly, Locke maintains, both in the eyes of reason and in the eyes of God.
<P>
<DD>
But what if we don't insist that people do things to save their souls? What if we only ask them to do things which are good for them in this lifetime? Don't we have the right to make people take good care of themselves in this world? No, says Locke. "No man can be forced to be rich or healthful whether he will or no." To which Locke makes a significant addition: "Nay, God Himself will not save men against their wills." Obviously, God can keep people from doing things that harm themselves in this life but, for whatever reason, does not do so. How dare we, as humans, presume to know more than God? By what arrogance do we interfere with other people's lives by force, when God chooses not to do so? In other words, far from helping God's work by using the force of government to enforce "His laws," government interference may be hindering that work.

Locke's thoughts on the separation of church and state and the purpose of government influenced the minds that shaped the government of the United States. In 1825, while creating the University of Virginia, Jefferson acknowledged the authors who most influenced the American experiment:

The next significant year in the history of consensual crime was 1859. "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times." Charles Dickens first published that in 1859, the opening line of <I>A Tale of Two Cities</I>. (He forgot to complete the thought, however: It is the best of times and the worst of times all the time.) Among 1859's "worst of times," the Supreme Court upheld the Fugitive Slave Act, which said that slaves who escaped to free states had to be returned to their "owners." (In 1857, the Supreme Court had declared that slaves were property and not human beings.) Georgia passed a law in 1859 stating that slaves freed in wills were not free, and that legitimately freed slaves who went into debt would be sold again to satisfy the debt. Nevertheless, the hit song of the year was "I Wish I Was in Dixie's Land." (Away! Away!) Fundamentalists were infuriated by the publication of Charles Darwin's <I>On the Origin of Species</I>, but were comforted by the introduction of "Nearer My God to Thee."

In England, the House of Commons finally seated its first Jewish member, Lionel Rothschild. Although elected two years before, he had been unable to take his seat because the oath of office insisted he proclaim his "true faith of a Christian." In 1859, Parliament reluctantly altered the oath. In Man-chester, England, some were outraged at the opening of the world's first playground. Swings and horizontal bars, they determined, were far too dangerous for children, and should not be permitted. On the drug front, cocaine was first isolated from coca leaves, and the Great Amer-ican Tea Company began selling extra-potent Chinese and Japanese tea at one-third the going rate. The latter venture was such a success, it became the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, and later simply A&P. Fortunately, no one attempted to protect circus performers from themselves. Gravelet successfully crossed Niagara Falls on a tightrope, and, in Paris, Jules Leotard demonstrated his discovery: the trapeze act. "The Man on the Flying Trapeze" was written about him, and the shockingly tight tights he wore were named after him. That women came to see more than his act shocked even Paris.

Is society responsible for the moral good of an individual? No, says Mill. "Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual." Mill writes that one's independence over anything that "merely concerns himself" is "absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign." Mill writes, "Neither one person, nor any number of persons, is warranted in saying to another human creature of ripe years, that he shall not do with his life for his own benefit what he chooses to do with it."
<P>
<DD>
What are the limits to all this free expression? "The liberty of the individual must be thus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance to other people." Is this the loophole through which government can determine that any number of consensual activities are crimes? No, says Mill; there must be genuine "harm," "injury to others."

That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. . . .

What can society do to individuals who practice behaviors that society finds distasteful, but do not physically harm the person or property of another?

And what should be the individual's response to excessive advice, instruction, persuasion, dislike, and disapprobation? Mill suggests that "intrusively pious members of society" be told "to mind their own business."

PROHIBITION (1920–1933 R.I.P.) was known as The Noble Experiment. The results of the experiment are clear: innocent people suffered; organized crime grew into an empire; the police, courts, and politicians became increasingly corrupt; disrespect for the law grew; and the per capita consumption of the prohibited substance—alcohol—increased dramatically, year by year, for the thirteen years of this Noble Experiment, never to return to the pre-1920 levels.
<P>
<DD>
You would think that an experiment with such clear results would not need to be repeated; but the experiment is being repeated; it's going on today. Only the prohibited substances have changed. The results remain the same. They are more devastating now than they were then.
<P>
<DD>
Let's take a look into that not-too-distant-mirror.
<P>
<DD>
Prohibition did not strike suddenly; zap—one day you could get a drink and the next day you could not. It settled on the country gradually, county by county, state by state, for the better part of a century. National Prohibition in 1920 was simply the final turn of the spigot.
<P>
<DD>
Alcohol was consumed in all the colonial settlements in America. No one was particularly against drinking—even the Puritans enjoyed it. What they frowned on was drinking to excess: generally known as drunkenness. This was of practical concern in the smaller communities: there were crops to plant, fish to catch, animals to trap, and a wilderness to be tamed. If one's excessive drinking got in the way of these activities, the community as a whole might suffer; thus, drunkeness was frowned on and this frowning found its way into some early laws.

The first of them, in Virginia in 1619, through New Hampshire's law of 1719 were against drunkenness, not against drinking. The first law limiting liquor sales with a religious base was passed in New York in 1697; it ordered that all public drinking establishments be closed on Sunday because, on the Lord's day, people should be worshiping the Bible not the bottle. In 1735, the religious had a prohibition law enacted for the entire state of Georgia. The law was a complete failure and was abandoned in 1742.
<P>
<DD>
For the most part, however, during the 1700s and early 1800s, those opposing liquor on religious grounds used sermons and persuasion rather than politics and laws to make their point. These persuasive efforts were known as the Temperance Movement, and its goal was to get everyone to voluntarily temper use of spirits.
<P>

By 1820, complete abstinence from all alcoholic beverages was a basic rule of most evangelical churches. The intense revivalism of the 1820s and 1830s preached that alcohol was a tool of the devil and that Satan himself was in every drop. Moral campaigns to spread the truth about "demon rum" and other Lucifer Liquids raised huge amounts of money.

Never mind that Jesus' first miracle was turning water into wine at the wedding feast at Cana. Never mind that Jesus and his apostles drank wine at the Last Supper. Never mind that Jesus promised to drink wine again with his disciples in Paradise.
<P>
<DD>
For anyone who had the impertinence to actually read the New Testament and question why wine (which was obviously not condemned by Jesus) should suddenly become such a wicked, evil thing, the preachers explained that the word for wine in the language Jesus spoke could also mean "grape juice" or "grape jelly." Jesus trafficked only in these, the preachers would say, not in wine. Those who doubted that Jesus turned water into grape juice at the wedding feast or that grape jelly was served at the Last Supper were condemned to the fires of eternal perdition.

The rhetoric about drinking heated and became increasingly sentimental in the 1840s as former drunkards "saw the light," telling in pamphlet—and speech and at financial profit—the harm alcohol did to themselves and to the innocent members of their families. Booklets such as The Reformed Drunkard's Daughter told the heart-rending story of a man who had not seen a sober moment in fifteen years. He perceived the error of his ways when, one cold, wintry day, his little daughter Hannah pleaded, "Papa, please don't send me for whiskey today." Yes, drinking was a crime, not just a crime against God and a crime against decency, but a crime against innocent wives and children.
<P>

By the late 1840s, everyone who was going to be convinced by persuasion or fear of hell fire had already signed a temperance pledge. Some fanatics decided that this was not enough: everyone had to be sober all the time for their own good and the good of all. Temperance turned to prohibition and prohibition meant politics.
<P>
<DD>
For some, alcohol was a problem. Some found the solution to their drinking through God, others through reason, others through medicine (Dr. Benjamin Rush, the Surgeon General of Washington's Continental Army, prescribed complete abstinence). But how to keep alcohol away from the rest? The answer: make it illegal to all. Put the full force of law behind it. Those who did not have a problem with drink, who could take it or leave it, were asked to leave it—permanently—for the glory of God and the greater good of all.

Maine went completely dry in 1851 and, by 1855, so had New Hampshire, Vermont, Delaware, Michigan, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New York. In some states, prohibition was declared unconstitutional; in others, it went virtually unenforced, but the primary setback to prohibition after 1855 was the Civil War.
<P>
<DD>
It's hard to keep alcohol away from troops in time of war. Thanks to the prohibitionists, whiskey in the U.S. Army was eliminated in 1830, but field commanders, at their discretion, could issue a "ration" of whiskey to each man—about four ounces. Private purchase and consumption of alcohol by military personnel, even in dry states, was condoned, and only drinking while on guard duty, on maneuvers, or just prior to battle was punished.
<P>
<DD>
Then there was the aspect of alcohol that, due to its later abuses, we usually laugh about today: its "medicinal value." At the time of the Civil War, alcohol was one of the most frequently prescribed—and most effective—medicines known to doctors. (The Native Americans had some useful herbal concoctions, but the natives were not consulted.) No one quite knew why whiskey worked; they just knew it did. It was poured on external wounds to prevent infection. It cured any number of internal maladies, including one that swept throughout the Northern troops dubbed "the Tennessee Quick Step" (later called "Montezuma's Revenge" by visitors to Mexico and "the Pharaoh's Curse" by visitors to Egypt). Eventually, the germ theory would scientifically explain the antibacterial, antiviral, and antiparasitic nature of alcohol.

During the Civil War, the use of anesthesia was in its infancy. At makeshift battlefield hospitals, ether and chloroform were in short supply. Alcohol was not. Many an operation was performed—and a life saved—while the patient was heavily under the influence. Then there was the basic, overall good feeling produced by spirits, and the healing effect they could have on what we now call psychosomatic illness. If nothing else, in some cases alcohol eased the pain while nature did the healing.
<P>
<DD>
Soldiers returning from the Civil War, many of whom were exposed to alcohol either recreationally or medicinally for the first time during the war, wanted none of this talk about temperance. They had lived through hell and didn't want some "Bible thumper" telling them what they could and could not drink. There were also far more important issues to deal with in both the North and the South than who drank what where. Prohibition was put on the back burner.
<P>

The cause came back to life in the 1880s. Women joined the fight, becoming politically active for the first time. A broad range of social reforms was demanded—banning tobacco, closing all theaters, labor laws, women's suffrage, and even socialism—but the only one that caught on was the proposal to close the saloons.
<P>
<DD>
Saloons were seen as hotbeds of corruption, contagion, and vice. These male-only (except for "dance-hall girls") establishments were, to the pious, positive hell holes. Drinking, gambling, prostitution, tobacco smoking, tobacco chewing (and its natural by-product, spitting), dancing, card playing, and criminal activity of all kinds were all traced to the saloon. Saloons were irresistible temptations to the otherwise righteous and virtuous men of the community. Invited there for a social drink by the "recruiters of Satan," the young men of the community found themselves hopelessly caught in a spider's web of immorality, lust, and depravity. Alcohol (a.k.a. the devil) was the spider at its very center. The Anti-Saloon League was formed, "an army of the Lord to wipe away the curse of drink."

If people were not afraid for their own lives and the eternal damnation of their immortal souls, they should at least fear for the children. "In this age of cities, temptations about our youth increase, such as foul pictures, corrupt literature, leprous shows, gambling, slot machines, saloons, and Sabbath breaking. We are trying to raise saints in hell." To these bulwarks of Prohibition ("Satan is drink" and "save the children"), the evangelical reformers added two familiar fears: racism and fear of "foreigners."
<P>

Stories of newly freed slaves drinking their first alcohol and raping white women were repeated again and again. Meanwhile, prohibitionists exploited the fear and hatred of immigrants felt by many "Americans." The millions of "wretched refuse" and "huddled masses yearning to breathe free" brought with them the drinking habits of their homelands. Irish loved whiskey; Germans loved beer; Italians loved wine. That they were primarily Catholics in this primarily Protestant country only made the prejudice worse. If one could just get the bottle (or the beer stein or the wine glass) out of their hands, the immigrants would have a spiritual awakening, see God's true purpose for them, become Protestants and, ipso facto, good citizens.

By the turn of the century, more than half the state legislatures—dominated by rural Protestants—had declared their states "dry." The wet people within the dry states did not complain too much, however—there were loopholes. The primary loophole was this: since interstate commerce was regulated by the federal government and not by the individual states, one could order liquor by mail. As state after state became dry, the parcel post wagon jingled, jangled, clinked, and sloshed with increasing wetness.
<P>
<DD>
This infuriated the Drys and in 1913, the Interstate Liquor Act, prohibiting the shipment of alcohol into dry states, was passed over President Taft's veto. This was a major coup for the Drys. Still not content, they used the anti-German feelings surrounding World War I and the association of Germans with beer ("the Kaiser's mightiest ally") to press for all-out national prohibition. In 1917, the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution was proposed.

The Prohibitionists got an unexpected boost from a strange quarter: disease. The influenza epidemic of 1918 killed 20 million people worldwide. This was more than twice the number of people killed worldwide during the four years of World War I; 548,000 died of the flu in the United States, the equivalent today of 1,500,000 people dying in a single year. Guess what the preachers blamed for this disaster? Sin, of course. God was punishing a wicked nation for straying from the path of righteousness. Only a great moral crusade could save the nation. Alcohol, as usual, was high on the hit list.
<P>
<DD>
If the evangelicals had simply tempered their intemperance, they might have, over time, gotten more of what they wanted. By 1920, thirty-three states encompassing 63% of the country had already voted themselves dry. The Prohibitionists probably could have closed every saloon outside big cities and, by continuing to control the curriculum in the schools, might have created generation upon generation of teetotalers and moderate drinkers. If they had allowed people their mail-order hooch, beer, and wine, the Prohibitionists would have come closer to controlling alcohol use. But they got greedy.
<P>

As with all reformers who are aiming for "the perfection of mankind," one success is only the foundation for another campaign designed to perfect humans even further. That success leads to yet another campaign, and a series of unbroken successes leads inevitably to excess. Prohibition was one such excess. The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States was ratified by the necessary number of states on January 29, 1919; and, on January 29, 1920, Prohibition became the law of the land. The final turn of the screw came with the Volstead Act.

The Eighteenth Amendment only prohibited "manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors . . . for beverage purposes." Although this was the "supreme law of the land," it still required an Act of Congress to make it enforceable. Enter the super-dry, ultra-religious congressman from Minnesota, Andrew J. Volstead.
<P>
<DD>
Many who supported the Eighteenth Amendment took the term "intoxicating liquors" to mean liquor: whiskey, rum, and other distilled spirits. Most liquors were at least 40% alcohol ("eighty proof"); some, particularly of the "greased lightning" variety, were as much as 90% alcohol. Surely beer, with its three to seven percent alcohol content, and wine, with its less-than-fifteen percent alcohol content, would be permitted—with certain restrictions and regulations, of course.
<P>
<DD>
Much to people's surprise, Volstead, backed by the triumphant evangelicals, defined "intoxicating liquors" as any beverage containing more than one-half of one percent alcohol. Using the momentum of the anti-German, anti-beer bias, Volstead was able to pass his National Prohibition Act over President Wilson's veto. Understandably, many supporters of the Eighteenth Amendment felt betrayed.
<P>
<DD>
Also feeling betrayed were many of the veterans returning home from World War I. Like the Civil War veterans, they had fought a brutal and bloody war. In Europe, particularly in France, they had seen that moderate daily alcohol consumption and ordinary life could co-exist. Many learned that what they had been taught about the inherent dangers of alcohol was simply not true. Although expressed lightheartedly in songs such as "How Ya Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm after They've Seen Paree," the disillusionment over what they had been taught versus what they had experienced ran deep. Coming home to find that the evangelicals, reformers, prudes, and blue noses had won a total victory embittered the veterans even more.

Oblivious to the discontent of many (or simply chalking it up to "the devil's last grumblings" on the issue), the Drys celebrated. "Hell will be forever for rent," declared evangelist Billy Sunday, who looked forward to an America "so dry, she can't spit."

Prohibition began easily enough: the people who drank stocked up on liquor before it was illegal; those who planned to give up drinking treated January 28, 1920 as though it were New Year's Eve, and the following day their New Year's resolutions began. The poor, who couldn't afford to stock up, were catered to by saloon keepers who, rather than closing voluntarily, stayed open until they were shut down. It would take months to close them all down, and, after they were closed, many bought new booze and opened again. In an attempt to keep them from reopening, the federal authorities began destroying not just the liquor, but bars, fixtures and furnishings.
<P>
<DD>
After a year or so, the reserves (and resolves) were depleted, and people got thirsty again—including some people who had never been thirsty before. The fact that alcohol was now prohibited made it somehow irresistible. There's always something tantalizing about forbidden fruit—in this case, the fruit of the vine.

Once people wanted to drink, nothing could stop them. Good old American ingenuity came to the fore. By 1923, finding ways to "beat the feds" had surpassed even baseball as the national pastime.

<LI>The saloons went underground and became speakeasies. There were lots of them. The 16,000 saloons in New York City, for example, became (depending on whose estimate you believe) from 32,000 to more than 100,000 "speaks." Unlike the saloons, which were men-only institutions, the speak-easies welcomed women, and the women came.

<LI>Supplying the speakeasies with the necessary beer, wine, and liquor required organization. It was also a crime. Hence, the birth of organized crime. Paying off the local, state, and federal authorities required some organization too—and no small amount of money.

In one year, Al Capone made $60 million (the equivalent of about $2 billion today) in liquor sales alone—a regular Bill Gates.

In 1919, 97,000 acres were devoted to growing grapes for "juice." By 1926, it was 681,000 acres. In 1929, the U.S. government loaned the grape growers money to expand even further.

<LI>Beer with an alcohol content of less than one-half-of-one percent (named "near beer," although many claimed that those who gave it that name were lacking in depth perception) was legal.

Some organized crime went legitimate, but their sales techniques were not necessarily those Dale Carnegie would approve. After Prohibition, the mobsters had a lot of unused trucks and warehouses. Some got into trucking and warehousing. Try as they might to stay legitimate, once one is used to strong-arm tactics to sell one's products, settle disputes, or wipe out—uh, successfully overcome the challenges of—the competition, it can be difficult not to backslide.

When organized crime takes over even a consensual crime, such as drugs, innocent victims suffer because the mob doesn't observe the same controls or restraints as legitimate businesses. The scene from the movie <I>The Godfather</I> in which the heads of the five families gather to discuss the future of drug distribution (One of them says, "I want it regulated! I don't want it sold near schools or playgrounds.") is, well, fiction. Organized crime is famous for its democratic approach to money: all dollars are created equal and a nicety such as the age of the person bringing the dollars is not a concern.

In short, Prohibition created an organized criminal class which is with us to this day.

<B>4. Prohibition permanently corrupted law enforcement</B>, the court system, and politics. During Prohibition, organized crime had on its payroll police, judges, prosecutors, and politicians. If mobsters couldn't buy or successfully threaten someone in a powerful position, they either "wiped him out" or, following more democratic principles, ran a candidate against the incumbent in the next election. They put money behind their candidate, stuffed the ballot box, or leaked some scandal about the incumbent just before the election (or all three). The important thing was winning, and more often than not, someone beholden to organized crime rose to the position of power.

After more than twelve years of purchases, threats, and elections, organized crime had "in its pocket" the political and governmental power structure of most medium-to-large cities, and several states.
<P>
<DD>
After Prohibition, some organized crime bosses made a fortune wielding this power. As good capitalists, they sold police protection, court intervention, and political favors to the highest bidder. Some of these bidders, it turns out, were guilty of crimes that had innocent victims or received government approval for schemes that victimized many. The police, courts, and politicians didn't differentiate between crimes with or without innocent victims any more than organized crime did—and if an official had a sudden fit of morality, it was too late: after years of corruption, the syndicate added blackmail to its list of persuasive techniques.
<P>
<DD>
A great many famous men—names we recognize and respect today—were said to have "underworld connections." Those men sometimes used organized crime and its connections to obtain certain political favors: favors to help their businesses, conceal family indiscretions, or—spoiled as rich people often are—simply get their way. In addition to those directly under the thumb of organized crime, Prohibition created a class of police, judges, prosecutors, and politicians who were, in a word, buyable. When Al Capone went away in 1931, some of his corrupt elected officials sold their services to the highest bidder. There were, of course, plenty of bidders and, because of Capone's thoroughness, plenty of sellers.

Not only were honest citizens unprotected from schemes the government was supposed to protect them from, but dealing with a dishonest city government—from getting a permit to an unbiased day in court—often required a payoff. In some cities, corruption went from top to bottom, and it was the citizenry who suffered. There were plenty of corrupt politicians before Prohibition, just as there were criminals, but the sheer volume of money (and, consequently, corruption) that Prohibition brought with it created what might be called organized corruption on local and state levels. The new police, judges, prosecutors, and politicians were told to look the other way as the graft passed by, and some succumbed to the easy money they saw being made all around them.  Some popular beliefs (and, in some cases, truths) about law enforcement, politics, and government in general ("You can't fight City Hall." "The rich get away with murder." "You can't change the system.") were not necessarily created by Prohibition's political corruption, but it certainly supported them in people's minds.

Prohibition forced a number of citizens to conclude that government cannot be trusted—an unfortunate point of view with even more unfortunate consequences.

<B>5. Prohibition overburdened the police, the courts, and the penal system</B>. Even with only token enforcement, Prohibition violations overburdened the police, clogged the court system, and filled the jails.

On March 3, 1923, <I>Time</I> reported that "44% of the work of the United States District Attorneys is confined to Prohibition cases." By 1928, there were more than 75,000 arrests per year. In 1932, there were 80,000 Prohibition convictions (not just arrests, but convictions).

<B>6. People were harmed financially, emotionally, and morally</B>. The basic inequity of Prohibition was astounding. Prohibition caused a direct hardship on hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of people. First, there were those who, in 1919, were legitimately involved in the production, distribution, and sale of alcohol. They either lost their jobs or were forced to become criminals. (If what you've been doing your entire professional life becomes illegal and you keep doing it, you become a criminal.) Brewing, distilling, and wine making are arts—professions that have been practiced and refined over thousands of years. What are people to do when their profession, honored and respectable, suddenly becomes a crime? With few options, some turned from brewmaster to bootlegger overnight. Others couldn't stand the idea of being a criminal and took far lower paying and less fulfilling jobs.
<P>
<DD>
And what about the people who owned the breweries, distilleries, and wineries? Many had invested their lives and savings in equipment, research, and good will. Overnight, through no fault of their own, their businesses were destroyed and investments wiped out. If it was a publicly held company, the stockholders, (many of whom were small investors) found their stock suddenly worthless.
<P>
<DD>
Then there were the tens of thousands of workers employed in honest jobs—or who came back from the war looking to be rehired at their jobs—making, bottling, packaging, distributing, selling, delivering, serving, and growing the raw materials for alcoholic beverages. Imagine if the industry in which you worked was declared "immoral" by a powerful religious faction and it suddenly became illegal. What would you do? The negative propaganda—much of it grossly exaggerated or downright dishonest—disseminated by the evangelicals tainted the entire alcoholic beverage industry and everyone who worked in it. It was hard for these people to find jobs in other industries. Saying, "I worked in a brewery" or "I worked in a liquor store" had a tinge of disrespectability. Many of these people, out of economic necessity, were forced into a life of crime, doing precisely what they did before it became a crime.

Then there were the tens of thousands of people who worked in bars, restaurants, beer gardens, hotels, resorts, and related businesses that went out of business as a direct result of Prohibition. Yes, the speakeasies could hire some of these people—if they became criminals. Others, in order to keep their jobs, had to look the other way. Although hotels, for example, had sternly worded signs warning that drinking alcohol in hotel rooms was a federal crime and that violators would be prosecuted, the sight of a bellman carrying a tray with nothing but glasses, ice, and a bottle or two of ginger ale was common. The bellman in this instance, in order to keep his job, had to become an accessory to a federal crime. Such difficult choices corrupted the morals of millions.(*FN)

<B>7. Prohibition caused physical harm</B>. When "safe" alcoholic beverages were no longer available (that is, beverages in which the purity and alcoholic content were regulated by law), people began assembling all sorts of concoctions, either for their own use or for sale. Some worked; some didn't. Some killed. Alcohol made from fruits, vegetables, or grains—either fermented or distilled—tends to be safe. Alcohol distilled from wood products ("wood alcohol") is not. Wood alcohol, nonetheless, smells like alcohol, tastes like alcohol, and gets you high.

Some desperate people tried to find ways of making wood alcohol safe to drink; some despicable people repackaged it and sold it as "the real thing." Some used the less expensive wood alcohol to cut the more expensive grain alcohol to make it go further. During the Noble Experiment, more than 10,000 people died from wood-alcohol poisoning, 1,565 in 1928 alone.
<P>
<DD>
With "cutting" becoming a common practice in bootlegging and tens of millions of people drinking each day, the only reason this figure wasn't higher was because of a peculiar characteristic of wood alcohol: before you died from it, you would go blind—permanently, irreversibly, blind. While drinking, if one's vision began to go, the drill was clear: stop drinking and upchuck as much as you could, as fast as you could. If people acted quickly enough, sometimes they would not end up with complete blindness, but with impaired vision—plus permanent kidney, liver, and brain damage.
<P>
<DD>
Rather than having a little "Christian charity" for these people who, if alcohol had been legal, would have had nothing more than a hangover, the evangelicals proclaimed that people harmed by drinking wood alcohol "had it coming" for breaking both God's law and the law of the land.
<P>
<DD>
In addition, there were the various beatings, stabbings, shootings, and killings between the bootleggers and the feds, the feds and the bootleggers, and the bootleggers amongst themselves. Along the way, any number of innocent people were caught in the crossfire, saw something they shouldn't have seen and were eliminated, or were rubbed out due to "mistaken identity."

<B>8. Prohibition changed the drinking habits of a country—for the worse</B>. Prior to Prohibition, almost all drinking took place outside the home. Some—mostly recent immigrants—had beer or wine with meals; some of the rich had a little brandy or port after dinner; but, for the most part, alcohol consumption in the home was "for medicinal purposes only." Because the public drinking places closed, people (especially the poor: speakeasies tended to be expensive) began drinking at home more and more. With liquor now conveniently stored at home, people could drink more often.
<P>
<DD>
Another phenomenon was drinking to get drunk. Prior to Prohibition, alcohol consumption was secondary to eating or socializing. With Prohibition, people gathered with the primary intention of getting drunk. ("I got a new bottle, just off the boat. Come over tonight and we'll drink it.") Although some speakeasies served food, people didn't go to the speakeasies to eat; they went to drink.
<P>
<DD>
Prohibition also forced people to drink more than they usually would: if caught with a bottle, one could be arrested, so, before traveling, one tended to finish it. This got people into the habit of drinking more. If it was illegal to carry a bottle with you and you weren't sure there would be liquid refreshment at your destination, you might drink enough for the entire evening prior to leaving home. This got Americans in the habit of driving drunk.
<P>
<DD>
The open and increasingly fashionable flouting of Prohibition caused drinking to become a public occurrence. The hip flask became a symbol of rebellion. It was used everywhere: football games, theaters, at work. People carried booze in hollow canes, hot water bottles, even garden hoses wrapped around their waists.

Prior to Prohibition, women drank very little and almost never drank distilled spirits. Some women had a little elderberry wine, some a little sherry. That immigrant women drank beer or wine was considered an outrage to the guardians of (Protestant) morality, and keeping this evil habit from spreading to the pure womanhood of (Protestant) America was one of the Prohibitionists' most persuasive arguments. Prohibition, in fact, had just the opposite effect. Saloons, which were all-male preserves (except for bar maids, entertainers, and ladies of the evening), gave way to the speakeasies, which were decidedly coeducational. Outside the speakeasy, the passing of the flask included women as well as men. At home, men included their wives (and sometimes wives included themselves)in imbibing. Now that alcohol had to be stored at home—an uncommon practice prior to Prohibition—women decided to take a taste and find out what all the fuss was about. They found out.
<P>
<DD>
Another necessary invention of Prohibition made alcohol far more popular: the cocktail. People turned to hard liquors during Prohibition because, drink for drink, it was cheaper to produce and easier to transport than beer or wine. In the same amount of space it took to transport eight ounces of beer, one could transport eight ounces of alcohol, which became the basis for eight drinks. In addition, the quality of unaged distilled alcohol was, to say the least, harsh. ("Sippin' whiskey," brandies, and other liquors designed for direct consumption are aged for years to mellow the flavor and take the edge off.)
<P>
<DD>
The solution? Simple. The cocktail. Prior to Prohibition there were few mixed drinks. Gin and tonic began as a medicinal preparation during the British colonization of India. To protect against malaria, the British consumed a small amount of quinine mixed in water each day and, to take the bitterness from the quinine, they would add some sugar. To this, gin was added, initially for medicinal purposes. Long after returning to England, and with malaria no longer a concern, the Englishman continued consuming gin and tonics recreationally. Scotch mixed with a little soda or water was acceptable, but not terribly popular. And that was about it. The mixing of alcohol with every known sugar-water combination, soft drink, and fruit juice grew directly out of Prohibition's attempt to make bootleg liquor palatable. Millions of people who didn't like the taste of beer, wine, or hard liquors found cocktails irresistible.

<B>9. Prohibition made cigarette smoking a national habit</B>. High on the evangelicals' hit list, second only to alcohol as a substance that had to be prohibited, was tobacco. In 1921, cigarettes were illegal in fourteen states, and anti-cigarette bills were pending in twenty-eight others. The prohibition of cigarettes, promoted by the very people who gave us the prohibition of alcohol, made cigarette smoking almost irresistible. As the experiment of Prohibition failed, the anti-cigarette laws fell. By 1930, they were legal almost everywhere; during Prohibition, the consumption had nearly tripled. Hollywood used cigarettes to indicate independence, sophistication, and glamour.

<B>10. Prohibition prevented the treatment of drinking problems</B>. It was stylish, fashionable, trendy, and daring to be drunk. No one had a drinking problem. ("I drink; I get drunk; I fall down. Where's the problem?") With alcohol illegal, there were no social norms for reasonable, moderate alcohol consumption against which to compare one's own drinking. The official social sanction (enforced by law) was complete sobriety. Anything less—from one drink per month to ten per day—made one a Wet. Anyone who suggested to a friend, "You may have a little problem here," sounded like one of the preachy blue noses whose moralizing started all the trouble in the first place.

With the clearly immoderate act of Prohibition, all moderation was abandoned. The only "therapy" recommended by the Drys was jail and prayer. And how could people go for pastoral counseling for a possible drinking problem? People were thrown out of congregations for drinking only once. Imagine what might happen if one admitted to drinking enough times to cause a problem. Alcoholism, unrecognized and untreated, became an epidemic during Prohibition due to Prohibition.
<P>

Within a few years after Prohibition, some people began to realize that they had personal problems that involved drinking and, by the end of the 1930s, Alcoholics Anonymous was formed—the first of many organizations to point out that drinking for some people is the symptom of an illness, an illness that can be successfully treated.
<P>

<B>11. Prohibition caused "immorality."</B> Far from Prohibition leading to Great Moments in Morality, as the evangelicals had promised, it led directly to an unparalleled explosion of immorality—as immorality was defined by them. As speakeasies were unregulated, outlawed, underground, and co-educational, they tended to breed unregulated, outlawed, underground, and co-educational activities. Because the sexes mingled freely, the sexes tended to mingle freely. A great deal of the increase in unmarried sexual activity during the 1920s can be directly linked to the potent combination of alcohol and an atmosphere of illicit activity and abandon.

In addition to this cost, let's not forget the taxes on alcohol the government lost because of Prohibition, and the profit denied honest business people and diverted into the pockets of organized crime. The artificially increased price of alcohol hit the poor and working classes hardest of all. It was a very expensive experiment.

W.C. FIELDS LAY ON his deathbed, reading the Bible. An old friend came in and said, "Bill! You don't believe in God. Why are you reading the Bible?" Fields responded in his familiar cadence, "Looking for loopholes."
<P>
<DD>
Anyone interested in social change—regardless of religious beliefs or lack of them—should read the Bible for no other reason than it is the book quoted most often to relieve us of our personal freedoms.
<P>
<DD>
I must admit that I initially turned to the Bible "looking for loopholes." I knew I could pull quotations out of context to support my point of view. In planning this, I thought of myself in an adversarial relationship: the religious right has presented its out-of-context quotations, and has done a good job popularizing them. I could do the same, and make my out-of-context quotations support my beliefs. Somewhere between the extremes, perhaps people would discover something approaching the truth.
<P>
<DD>
Along the way, however, I made an astonishing discovery: There was no need to pull quotations out of context. There was no need for me to ignore certain passages and highlight others. The "scriptural basis" for the religious right's claim to righteousness simply did not exist. In order to support my opinion I didn't have to—with a certain degree of guilt—leave out "incriminating" passages: the passages were not there.
<P>
<DD>
Certain quotations were there, of course, but considering the context they were in, no sane human being would take them seriously. (All of the admonitions against "sexual immorality" fall into this category.) Other concepts—promoted loudly by the Bible-quoting moralists of our day—were entirely absent.[*FN]

The Bible can be used to praise or condemn practically any human activity, thought, belief, or practice. As with the works of Shakespeare, if one looks carefully, one can find a quotation, incident, or story to support or undermine anything.
<P>
<DD>
Alas, this practice has been used by many people to justify their own prejudices (by proving that "God thinks this way, too"), as a justification for grabbing and holding power ("It's not what I want, it's what God wants!"), or as the perfect excuse for not taking a fearless look at themselves and making necessary—although admittedly uncomfortable—personal changes in attitude and behavior.
<P>
<DD>
It's not the Bible itself that condemns most consensual crimes, but the misuse of the Bible by petty, fearful, manipulative, or misguided individuals who deceptively quote from the Bible not as an illumination of truth, but as a justification of their own limited point of view.

Allow me to quote Alan Watts at length. He says all I want to say here, and says it much better than I.[*FN]

[*FN]  Some readers may be asking, "Who is Alan Watts?"  Alas, Alan Watts does not have the wide audience, readership, or reputation he deserves.  In my estimation, he was one of the finest philosophers of this century.  Although he had a master's in theology and a doctorate in divinity, he seldom had the pretension of calling himself "Dr. Watts" (although, while an Episcopal priest, he probably tolerated the obligatory "Father Watts").  As fine as his writing is, I find his recorded lectures even more delightful.  (His tapes and several books are available from his son, Mark Watts, P.O. Box 938, Point Reyes Station, CA  94956.)  Although Watts died in 1973, his writings and his lectures are as contemporary, witty, and penetrating as ever.

[The Bible is] an anthology of ancient literature that contains sublime wisdom along with barbaric histories and the war songs of tribes on the rampage. All this is taken as the literal Word and counsel of God, as it is by fundamentalist sects, which—by and large—know nothing of the history of the Bible, of how it was edited and put together. So we have with us the social menace of a huge population of intellectually and morally irresponsible people.
<P>
[The Bible is a] translation of Hebrew and Greek documents composed between 900 B.C. and A.D. 120. There is no manuscript of the Old Testament; that is, of the Hebrew Scriptures, written in Hebrew, earlier than the Ninth Century B.C. But we know that these documents were first put together and recognized as the Holy Scriptures by a convention of rabbis held at Jamnia (Yavne) in Palestine shortly before A.D. 100. On their say-so. Likewise, the composition of the Christian Bible, which documents to include and which to drop, was decided by a council of the Catholic Church held in Carthage in the latter part of the Fourth Century.
<P>
The point is that the books translated in the . . . Bible were declared canonical and divinely inspired by the authority (A) of the Synod of Jamnia and (B) of the Catholic Church, meeting in Carthage more than 300 years after the time of Jesus. It is thus that fundamentalist Protestants get the authority of their Bible from Jews who had rejected Jesus and from Catholics whom they abominate as the Scarlet Woman mentioned in Revelation.

In exploring the Bible, I chose the New International Version (NIV). This is the translation favored by most of the evangelical churches. (I don't want them accusing me of using some "heathen translation.")[*FN] Some evangelicals still use the King James Version because the New International Version is entirely (and dangerously) too clear.

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
[*FN]  The preface of the New International Version shows the fundamentalist influence:  "That [the translation scholars] were from many denominations—including Anglican, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Brethren, Christian Reformed, Church of Christ, Evangelical Free, Lutheran, Mennonite, Methodist, Nazarene, Presbyterian, Wesleyan and other churches—helped to safeguard the translation from sectarian bias."

The Bible is divided into two sections, the Old Testament and the New Testament. Each Testament is a collection of "books" (although the word bible itself means book). Each book has a series of chapters, and each chapter is divided into verses. These chapter and verse citations are uniform throughout all translations of the Bible and are written: BOOK CHAPTER:VERSE. So, "Genesis 24:1–3 and 9" means the book of Genesis, chapter 24, verses 1 through 3, also verse 9.

The Old Testament presents long lists of forbidden activities, some of which most of us do regularly (shaving, getting a haircut, wearing clothing woven of two kinds of material, eating rare meat). These books also present a series of acceptable or even required practices that we wouldn't dream of doing (animal sacrifices, keeping slaves, stoning people to death for infractions such as cursing their parents).
<P>
<DD>
Please understand that, in this examination, I in no way intend to ridicule, question, or even minimize any of the wisdom to be found in the Bible. I simply mean to show that no one follows all the teachings of the Bible. Certainly not a single fundamentalist Christian—not one. Even the most devout Jew has abandoned burnt offerings, keeping slaves, stoning, and a great many other activities which are permitted or required by the biblical Laws of Moses.
<P>
<DD>
The first seventeen chapters of the book of Leviticus, for example, go into great detail as to which animals are to be sacrificed for what sins or celebrations, which skin irritations are diseases and which are sins, and which animals cannot be eaten—or even touched. These animals include rabbit, lizard, pig, shrimp, lobster, clam, scallop, eel, octopus, or squid. You may, however, eat "any kind of locust, katydid, cricket or grasshopper" (Leviticus 11:22–23).
<P>
<DD>
Chapter 18 of Leviticus contains sexual activities that are not acceptable. It's a long list; here's the Reader's Digest version: don't have sex with your stepmother, stepsister, "the daughter of your father's wife," your aunt, "a woman and her daughter," a woman and "her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter"; with any woman while she's having her period; with your neighbor's wife. As verse 29 explains, "Everyone who does any of these detestable things—such persons must be cut off from their people" (18:29).

(His father & mother lived at the same time at Sityate.)  He was this year detected of buggery (and indicted for the same) with a mare, a cowe, two goats, five sheep, 2 calves, and a turkey.  Horrible it is to mention, but the truth of the historie requires it.  He was first discovered by one that accidentally saw his lewd pracise towards the mare.  (I forbear perticulers.)  Being upon it examined and committed, in the end he not only confest the fact with that beast at that time, but sundrie times before, and at severall times with all the rest of the forenamed in his indictmente.  And accordingly he was cast by the jury, and condemned, and after executed the 8. of September, 1642.  A very sade spectakle it was; for first the mare, and then the cowe, and the rest of the lesser cattle, were kild before his face, according to the law, Levit: 20:15, and then he him selfe was executed."

Then the Lord said to Moses: "Take the blasphemer outside the camp. All those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head, and the entire assembly is to stone him.

Chapter 25 introduces the Year of Jubilee. Every seven years—Leviticus instructs—the land is to go fallow. Whatever grows there is to be harvested by the poor. This is the Sabbath for the land. Every seventh Sabbath for the land—seven times seven years—becomes the Year of Jubilee. In the Year of Jubilee, all slaves purchased are to be set free, all houses purchased (except houses within walled cities) are to return to their original owner ("Quick! There's only three months until the Year of Jubilee. Let's build a wall."), and all land sold is to return to its original holder. Nothing, it seems, is sold permanently; it is sold only until the Year of Jubilee; all contracts are good for a maximum of forty-nine years.

In Chapter 27, the last chapter of Leviticus, the price is set for slaves of various ages. A male between the ages of twenty and sixty is worth fifty shekels, and a female between twenty and sixty is worth thirty shekels. "If it is a person between the ages of five and twenty, set the value of a male at twenty shekels and of a female at ten shekels. If it is a person between one month and five years, set the value of a male at five shekels of silver and that of a female at three shekels of silver (27:5–6).

If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as menservants do. If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself, he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, because he has broken faith with her. (21:7–8)

If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with her, he must pay the bride-price, and she shall be his wife. If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he must still pay the bride-price for virgins. (22:16–17)

Whoever sacrifices to any god other than the Lord must be destroyed. (22:20)

More evil and injustice have been done (and continue to be done) "in the name of Jesus" than one could possibly document. Those who have not taken the time to read what Jesus actually said may—mistakenly—blame Jesus for this evil and injustice. Those who take the time to read the first four books of the New Testament will probably be surprised to discover what Jesus himself actually said. Once you've read those books, the next time someone says he or she is doing something "in the name of Jesus," you can say "But he never said that!" or "That's not what he meant at all!"

The first four books of the New Testament—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—tell the story of Jesus' life and teachings. For the most part, they are the only books in the Bible that report what Jesus said while he lived. The remainder of the New Testament contains Luke's account of the early church (Acts); letters (Epistles) written by James and Jude (Jesus' brothers), Peter, John, and Paul to various Christian communities, to set forth doctrine and guidelines for living. The New Testament culminates with the apocalyptic vision for the end of the world (Revelation), which the evangelicals believe is due any day now—just as fervently hopeful believers have predicted for 2,000 years. About half of the New Testament consists of Paul's Epistles.

The first three Gospels—Matthew, Mark, and Luke—are known as the synoptic Gospels. Synoptic means a general view or summary; to give an account from the same point of view. These were written from twenty to fifty years after Jesus' death. The synoptic Gospels seem to rely on each other—the authors of the later two perhaps having read the first—or, at the very least, they relied on similar source material. This material was most likely the written collections of "sayings" circulated, perhaps even while Jesus lived. These "quote books" (scrolls, actually) were quite popular and allowed the essence of a teacher's message to be conveyed in those pre–printing press days.

John wrote his Gospel some time after Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Although it's fair to assume that he read the first three, he did not rely on them, nor the underlying "quote books," as heavily. John accepted the events in the first three Gospels as "given," and added new information. He also wanted to "set the record straight" on a few events—and he does. He was the only disciple at the Crucifixion, and was part of Jesus' "inner circle" (which included John's brother James and Peter). John gives accounts and insights Matthew, Mark, and Luke do not.

The four Gospels give us the same life and the same teachings seen from four different viewpoints. If you think that personal agendas did not affect the Gospels, consider what Mark had to say about a woman: "She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse" (Mark 5:26). Compare that with what Luke, the physician, had to say about the same woman: "And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her" (Luke 8:43). Whether Luke was protecting his profession or Mark had a bias against physicians—or both—is hard to say. Personal filtering—conscious or unconscious—is inevitable when people write about events, especially events that happened decades earlier.

And yet, with all these differences—sometimes in interpretation and sometimes with the facts themselves—there emerges a pattern of a man who, fundamentally, taught love, acceptance, and tolerance. That is the essence of Jesus' teaching. He said it himself, quoting the "heart" of the Jewish faith: "`Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind'" (Matthew 22:37) and he summed up the rest of the Old Testament—the Law of the Prophets—as "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Matthew 22:39). To this, at the very end of his teaching (at the Last Supper), he gave those closest to him a final command. "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another" (John 13:34–35).

And then Jesus made one of the most brilliant moves in the history of human thought. He gave a series of examples that illustrated a being so loving, so giving, and so trusting in God that it was absolutely impossible for a human being to achieve the ideal. He then specifically prohibited any attempts to improve others until you, yourself, were entirely loving, giving, and trusting.
<P>
<DD>
According to Jesus' plan, everyone would be so busy loving, giving, and trusting (or learning to be that way) that there would simply be no time to judge others. If one, however, were tempted to judge others, giving in to the temptation was specifically prohibited by the teachings of Jesu.s

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>
One of the most absurd claims made by the religious right is that their interpretation of "traditional family values" is supported by Jesus. It is not. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth.
<P>
<DD>
Jesus never married. Within the Jewish tradition in the time of Jesus, not marrying was nearly a sacrilege. Jewish males were considered men at thirteen. It was then a boy had his bar mitzvah; he declared to the community, "Today I am a man," and the responsibilities of manhood were upon him. By this time, he knew a trade (which he entered into), and he married. (Marriages, like the son's profession, were almost always arranged by the parents.) The first child was expected within the year.
<P>
<DD>
By not marrying and fulfilling his obligation to God, his family, and his ancestors, Jesus blatantly defied tradition. The pressure on him could hardly have been more intense, and yet he resisted.

Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us like this?

Given his druthers, it's obvious he would rather stay in the house of his Father, where he "had to be."

Not exactly the anything-you-say devotion we have been led to believe Jesus had for his mother.

Jesus is saying, in essence, that he is not yet ready to perform a public miracle, that his mother knows this, and why is she bothering him with this problem of the wine? What does his mother do? Like most mothers, she completely ignores him:

Mary starts involving other people. One can almost hear her saying, "My son will take care of the wine problem. Servants! Come over here! Help my son make some more wine. Do whatever he tells you."

One of the most important passages indicating Jesus' relationship with his family is found in the third chapter of Mark and also in Matthew (12:46–50) and Luke (8:19–21). Concerning "traditional family values," here is one of the most significant—and least quoted—passages in the entire Bible:

If you were teaching and your mother and brothers thought you were out of your mind and came "to take charge of" you, what would you do? That's just what Jesus did: he didn't go near them. He stayed in the house where he was protected by his followers and sent to his mother and brothers his true message concerning "family values":
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him. A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, "Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you."

"Who are my mother and my brothers?" he asked.

Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother." (Mark 3:31–35)

Considering Jesus' relationship with his brothers, this incident from the book of John is telling:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
But when the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near, Jesus' brothers said to him, "You ought to leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples may see the miracles you do. No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world." For even his own brothers did not believe in him. (John 7:2–5)
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DD>
If it wasn't for John's comment, "For even his own brothers did not believe in him," it might sound as though his brothers were encouraging him to make his teachings more widely known. In fact, with the information John provides us, we know that they are, at best, encouraging him to "go public" so he'll get this whole savior thing out of his system, or, at worst, they are taunting him with some sibling, "We dare you! We double dare you!" Jesus handles them as any typical misunderstood sibling might: he deceives them.

After Jesus' childhood, Mary is conspicuous in her absence, except for sometimes being mentioned as one of the women who followed Jesus.

None of this is intended to denigrate Mary. It is merely intended to show that Jesus' relationship with his blood relatives—including his mother—was far closer to normal than we have been led to believe.

Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him. (Matthew 4:18–22)

How did Jesus really feel about sex? It's a hard question to answer because (a) he almost never talked about it, and (b) the one time he did, his answer did not prove very palatable.

For Jesus himself, then, marriage was out of the question—the ideal was celibacy.
<P>
<DD>
The word <I>eunuch</I> in Greek is <I>eunouchos</I>, which means "a castrated person," or "an impotent or unmarried man." It's doubtful that Jesus is recommending all males become castrated. His suggestion for those who "can accept this word" is to abstain from marriage and sexual activity.
<P>
<DD>
Does Jesus expect perfection in the pursuit of celibacy? Hardly. That's why marriage poses a problem. If one is single and "slips," no one is harmed other than the person slipping. If married, however, slipping means breaking one's word with another, and that's not good. Jesus invokes the larger sense of adultery: not keeping one's word; not being faithful to one's promise; adulterating one's integrity. Jesus' message, then, was, "fornication is a lesser sin than adultery, so before you get married be absolutely sure that this is the only person you plan to have sex with for the rest of your life."
<P>
<DD>
How did Jesus treat those who had a sexual orientation or practice different from his own? Without exception, his response was tolerance and acceptance.
<P>

No incident from the Gospels more clearly shows how Jesus wants his followers to behave toward those who have "sinned" sexually than the one in which he saves the adulteress from being stoned.

The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.

If Jesus said, "Don't stone her," he would—according to the law—be as guilty as she. The Pharisees would then have grounds for stoning him, too. On the other hand, if he said, "Go ahead and stone her," he would be betraying his central teaching of love, tolerance, and forgiveness. From a consensual-crimes perspective, it's important to note that adultery was a sexual transgression which Jesus personally and spiritually frowned on. Nevertheless...

But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, "If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her." Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. (John 8:6–8)

Brilliant. Jesus took the responsibility from a faceless crowd self-righteously fulfilling "God's law" and placed it in the hands of each individual, saying, "If you've never made a mistake, go ahead: throw the first stone." It was restating his fundamental teaching: "First, take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye" (Matthew 7:5). He was saying, yet again, "Unless you're perfect, don't judge." Here, in fact, he was taking it a step further: "If you ever have sinned, don't judge." So much for judgment. So much for throwing stones. So much for Jesus' supposed endorsement of laws against consensual activities.

If each elected official, before voting on the next law to take away yet another consensual freedom, would reflect on his or her own personal transgressions, unpopular preferences, and unsuccessful experiments, maybe we'd have a Christian nation after all.

Jesus of Nazareth was clearly in favor of separation of church and state. Few things in the Bible are more certain. His teaching was spiritual: he had no interest in this world. His disinterest in the governments of this world—and the world itself—is profound.

Two of the most famous incidents of the New Testament show Jesus' attitude toward church and state. He was as opposed to state intervention by the church as he was to church intervention by the state.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money. So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. To those who sold doves he said, "Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Father's house into a market!" (John 2:13–16)
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>
Jesus felt so strongly that the temple should be used as "a house of prayer" and not be involved in material matters at all (even though the livestock was being sold for religious sacrifice and the money changers were there so foreigners could pay the temple tax), he resorted to physical violence. This is the only recorded incident of Jesus using physical violence.

There is nothing more intimate to the function of government than taxes. No taxes, no government. Among the Jews in Palestine at the time of Jesus, many (including some of his disciples) believed that if the Jews stopped paying taxes, the Romans would find it no longer profitable to stay in Judea and would leave. Israel would then be restored. Paying taxes, then, was far more controversial than it is even today. Nonetheless, Jesus' stand was firm. When asked whether Caesar's tax should be paid, Jesus answered,

"Show me the coin used for paying the tax." They brought him a denarius, and he asked them, "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?" "Caesar's," they replied.

For more than thirty years, the most heated issue surrounding the separation of church and state has been prayer in schools. The evangelicals would have us believe (as they do) that not allowing prayer in publicly funded schools is "anti-Christian." The religious right is demanding that prayer in schools be reinstated by a constitutional amendment. As a matter of fact, praying in public at all is against the teachings of Jesus:

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you." (Matthew 6:5–6)

When he prayed the Lord's Prayer, he did it as instruction on how to pray, not as a prayer itself. Of the more than sixty times in the Bible the words pray, prayer, or prayed are said by or descriptive of Jesus, only three relate to praying in public.

It's also interesting to note that "so help me God" got tacked onto the presidential oath of office, even though the Constitution specifically does not include it.

The group Jesus attacked most often (almost exclusively, in fact), were the Pharisees. Being political, the Pharisees cared more how they appeared than what they did. They knew how to posture, thus appearing more righteous and, therefore, more worthy to lead than others. They took advantage of every photo opportunity. They were in the right place at the right time doing the piously right thing.

The Pharisees controlled Jerusalem's ruling body, the Sanhedrin. Although Rome's occupation of Jerusalem kept them from having complete power, the Pharisees appointed themselves to maintain "traditional Jewish values" in a time of social upheaval. One of their self-appointed tasks was to separate true prophets from false prophets. They "investigated" all reports of prophets, but it was merely show; the Pharisees knew that a prophet could only rise from within the ranks of the righteous: the Pharisees. Anyone not raised as a Pharisee didn't have the proper credentials for prophecy. The punishment for being a false prophet was death. One holy person after another fell before the judgment of the Pharisees. Said Jesus:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness." (Matthew 23:27–28)

The Pharisees were well versed in Scripture. They could quote chapter and verse to justify whatever behavior they found expedient.
<P>
<DD>
The most dangerous part about the Pharisees, however, was that they believed what they were doing was right. They didn't see themselves as hypocrites; they saw themselves as exemplary spiritual leaders. They didn't see themselves as murdering people for expressing new religious points of view; they saw themselves as keeping the people safe from false prophets. While they certainly felt themselves spiritually superior to "ordinary" men, they were willing to share the benefit of their superior learning and discipline by sacrificing their personal time to take leadership roles in the synagogues. They did what they did because they honestly believed they were the chosen among God's chosen people.

While ordinary people were moved by the miracles of Jesus, the Pharisees denounced them as sorcery—punishable by death. While the people found the teachings of Jesus liberating, the Pharisees found them blasphemous. On the other hand, while the people found the Pharisees ideal role models for achieving righteousness and godliness, Jesus found them "hypocritical vipers."
<P>
<DD>
The Pharisees, then, (a) represented strict adherence to the letter of the law, while violating the spirit of the law; (b) inflicted harsh punishments for violation of the law (such violations as determined by the Pharisees); (c) knew everything and knew they knew everything, therefore could not be taught anything; and (d) were hypocritical in their holier-than-thou attitudes. It wasn't the Pharisees themselves whom Jesus opposed; it was this set of values and behavior.
<P>
<DD>
Let's take a look at the religious right in this country and compare what they do and teach with what Jesus said about the Pharisees. This is not an exhaustive look—that's a book in itself. This discussion limits itself to those hypocrisies that directly affect the laws against consensual activities and the enforcement of those laws today.

The religious right relies on concepts such as "traditional American values," "family values," and "the American way." With great piety, they discuss the "faith of our fathers," "the pride of the pilgrims," and the "Christian nation." They misquote and misrepresent the American founding fathers mercilessly. And all to justify their hatred of anyone who is "different." They use the Bible to justify prejudice, exclusion, and persecution. They contradict Jesus' fundamental message, which is love everyone, not just those who believe what you believe or do what you do.

Since the Civil War, the churches that make up the religious right have not taken a leadership stand on any positive social change.  Quite the contrary, they have opposed social change.

Because the religious right teaches guilt, but not forgiveness, it heaps on its followers responsibilities (blame) for situations they cannot effectively deal with themselves. For example, the religious right teaches that God will hold each person in this country personally responsible for the 30 million abortions (which they categorize as "the murder of innocent little babies") performed since 1972. "If there's anything you could have done you didn't do, then God will hold you responsible." Never mind the 30 million illegal abortions that took place from 1952 to 1972 (and the women who died from them)—as long as it's legal now, you are responsible. That's why anti-abortion protesters are so frantic, why one can shoot and kill a doctor outside an abortion clinic and sincerely believe he is doing "God's work," and why Jerry Falwell can excuse the shooting by saying, "Let's not forget the doctor was a mass murderer."[*FN]

The religious right points with great pride to its "overseas rescue missions," in which the "rescuing" that's going on is not so much feeding hungry mouths (although a little of that goes on because it makes good video) as it is "rescuing" human souls. In America we are supposed to keep our "traditional values," but around the world people are supposed to "cast off" their traditional values in favor of the Americanized version of "Christianity." These converts are then supposed to preach "Christianity," which is, of course, nothing but the religious right's own political conservatism. People in foreign countries are encouraged to become politically active, not for social change and justice within that country, but for policies that will favor the right-wing conservative causes the religious right preaches are one and the same with Christianity. The communists in their heyday never had a group of infiltrators as numerous, organized, and well-financed (by people who think they're feeding the poor of the world) as the standard-bearers of the American political-religious right.

With the religious right, there are no discussions any more. If you don't agree with them on everything, you hate Jesus. Pure and simple. No matter what position you take, if it's not the position they take, your reasoning will be knocked down by one pseudo-scriptural argument after another. That these arguments often contradict each other doesn't seem to matter.

If you do anything that's not "in the name of Jesus," it doesn't count. You can heal the sick, feed the poor, and shelter the homeless, but if you don't do it in the name of Jesus, you're just part of the devil's work. The "secular humanists" (as the evangelicals call them) are some of Satan's greatest warriors. Those humanists go out and do good for the sake of humanity and not for the sake of Jesus. Can you imagine? Sacrilege! The religious right teaches that suffering is good because it leads one to Jesus, and anything that alleviates suffering except in the name of Jesus is bad because it postpones the sufferer's ultimate conversion. So, people who do good without doing it for Jesus are bad. The more effective one is at making positive change, the more one is seen as the agent of the devil.

For Christians, Easter is a day of celebration second only to Christmas. For many Christians, in fact, Easter is a greater day of celebration than Christmas: on Christmas the Christ Child was born; on Easter, Jesus, the man, was resurrected, proving he was not just a prophet or a martyr, but the Christ.
<P>
<DD>
What, however, was the theme for the 1993 Easter Sunday sermon on Jerry Falwell's The Old Time Gospel Hour? The resurrection was never mentioned: there was not one word about Jesus conquering death so that we may all have eternal life. Nor was there a mention of the Crucifixion. I don't know why I was expecting some mention of Jesus on Easter. Perhaps I'm just too old fashioned for The Old Time Gospel Hour.
<P>

Falwell's sermon was exclusively about what has been his pet subject for the past thirty-seven years: What is politically wrong with America? If Falwell dislikes something politically, it is, automatically and without further discussion, both immoral and unchristian. (No, more than unchristian: anti-Christian.) We are under attack. ("We" being "all good Christians," and "all good Americans" [those two being synonymous].)

The show opens with Falwell not preaching, but peddling: he looks directly and sincerely into the camera from what is supposed to be his office (but is obviously a television set) and pitches four of his sermons: "a $100 value!" for "only $35." The set of four sermons is collected under the general title, "Who Killed America?" One of the sermons was today's sermon. If Falwell mentioned Easter in his sermon, you see, it would date the entire video package and make it less salable in the future. All good marketers know not to mention a holiday on a show that you want to sell year 'round, and Falwell is a good marketer.

Jerry Falwell, of course, inspired the Moral Majority, which inspired the bumper sticker, "The Moral Majority Is Neither." The Moral Majority did well by Falwell: it made him famous, rich, and fat. In the late 1980s, he declared "victory," and disbanded the organization. What really happened was that the Moral Majority had stopped making money because Falwell had run out of things to hate. Oh, there was still plenty to hate (from Falwell's perspective); hating just wasn't raising enough money any more. Even the war on drugs didn't raise much money: everyone had declared war on drugs. So Jerry shut down the Moral Majority.

What brought Falwell back out of the closet? Homosexuality, of course.
<P>
<DD>
In the fall of 1992, an obscure fundamentalist church in the California desert began selling a videotape taken at a Gay Pride parade. It was carefully edited by the church to show only what the congregation would find as the most salacious homosexual activity: men kissing, men wearing dresses, lesbians walking about with their hooters out—and all of them not going to church on Sunday. You could get nearly the same footage of heterosexuals by going to Fort Lauderdale during spring break, a Shriner's convention, or any fraternity beer bash. Nonetheless, it was presented as an example of what every town in America would look like twenty-four hours a day if the "Gay Agenda" came to pass. The tape was outrageously successful. It put a struggling church located in the California desert on the map, making it rich, famous, and powerful. Tens of thousands of copies of the tape were sold. Political commentators said it tipped the scales in the Colorado referendum in which voters narrowly decided that gays were not entitled to civil rights, and it was shown to the Joint Chiefs of Staff before they came out against gays in the military.

Falwell must have watched this phenomenon from his church in Lynchburg, Virginia, and chewed his nails (and everything else that wasn't nailed down). He had been against the homa-sex-ya'alls for years. He thought that vein of hatred had been fully mined. He was wrong. There was still gold in that thar homophobia, and damn if some other fundamentalist preacher hadn't struck the Mother Lode! Like the phoenix of old, Jerry girded his loins, put on his girdle, and set out again for the gold rush.

Falwell sent his camera crews to cover the Clinton inauguration. Of the many inaugural balls, it seemed that the gays and lesbians had one of their own (Gasp!). Jerry's crew videotaped hours and hours of men in tuxedos dancing with men in tuxedos, women in formals dancing with women in formals, men in tuxedos dancing with men in formals, women in tuxedos dancing with women in formals, men in formals dancing with men in formals, women in tuxedos dancing with women in tuxedos, women in tuxedos dancing with men in formals, and even (can't these perverts get anything straight?) men in tuxedos dancing with women in formals.

Yes, Jerry put together a video of this, and, over images of men kissing men and women kissing women (which you can buy for "only $35, and charge it to your Visa or MasterCard, so call toll-free now, and it's all tax deductible"), Falwell tells us that President Clinton "is considering" legislation to make homosexuals "a minority." Does this imply gays are currently a majority? No, Falwell explains, once gays are recognized as a minority, they are entitled to equal rights! They would be protected from job discrimination (Horrors!), entitled to equal housing (Terrors!), and might even be permitted to get married (No!) to each other (No! No!).

Then Falwell crosses even his own line between reality and illusion. If we didn't know Falwell better, it might seem like simple paranoia, but, knowing Falwell as we do, we know it's nothing but a good fund-raising technique, one of Falwell's favorites: If he can scare the be-Jesus out of people with dishonest and outrageous statements, he can scare the money out of them too. Falwell explains that the federal government could require a certain number of homosexuals to be hired by private churches. Over videos carefully selected to show gays to be as salacious as possible, Falwell asks, "Do you want gays working in your church, preaching your Sunday sermons, educating your children?" The idea that the federal government is going to shove homosexuality down our throats and down the throats of our children in church is enough to open pocketbooks, purses, and checkbooks all across the country.

But buying a video is not enough—one must also vote. Falwell, you see, has discovered the 900 number. Legitimate network current affairs programs have used 900 numbers to have their audiences vote on controversial subjects for some time. The charge is nominal, usually 50 cents, and any profits are donated to charity. Falwell, too, has 900 numbers; one to call if you support protecting our children from federally imposed homosexuality, the other to call if you're in favor of perverts, perverts everywhere. Either call costs you $1.95 per minute. The money—after the phone company takes its cut—goes to Jerry Falwell. If you oppose homosexual rights, Falwell will send your name to the White House stating your position (which Falwell has kindly worded for you, including biblical citations). Falwell will also be kind enough to add your name to his mailing list, as you are obviously a right-thinking, all-American Christian. (Besides, you might want to buy some of his tapes, books, sermons, or even send your children to his university.) If you support gay rights, Falwell does nothing. No petition to the White House, no mailing list, no solicitations for videos, books, sermons, and your children are not welcome at his university. He keeps your $1.95 per minute anyway.

Speaking of education, Falwell also regularly gives an extended pitch for Liberty University. There—over images of Falwell roughhousing with the guys, talking respectfully to the girls, roughhousing with the guys, talking respectfully to the girls, and roughhousing with the guys—we are told that this institute of higher learning has no co-educational dorms; no drugs; no alcohol; no secular, humanistic, atheistic teachings (such as evolution); no Marxist, Leninist, communist propaganda (the kind you might find at, say, the Democratic National Headquarters); no Godless liberalism; and—most important of all—"no sex outside of marriage." With all these restrictions, it's no wonder that the pitch is directed toward "parents and grandparents" and not at the potential students themselves.

One thing there's obviously plenty of at Liberty University, however, is white people. Of the dozens, perhaps hundreds of students shown in the promotional video, I spotted precisely two students who were darker than Debby Boone. One must suspect from this footage that—at Liberty University—either (a) the term racial minority is given new and vibrantly literal meaning, or (b) Falwell wants the parents and grandparents to think the term racial minority is given new and vibrantly literal meaning.

The whole idea is that your children or grandchildren will be safe at Liberty University—safe from drugs, safe from alcohol, safe from radical politics, safe from homosexuals and other minorities.

As the weeks passed, I continued watching The Old Time Gospel Hour (it's like a traffic accident—can't look at it; can't look away). The videos taken at the gay inaugural ball (under the title "Expos of the Clinton Inaugural Gala") must have been a hit. Falwell sent a camera crew to the 1993 Gay March on Washington, and brought back even more "shocking and disgusting" video of men kissing men, women kissing women, and (prepare yourself) men marrying men and women marrying women.

If Falwell was the Pharisee I believed him to be, I wondered how long it would take me to discover hypocrisy. The rules of my little game were: it had to be his hypocrisy and he had to be hypocritical on his own terms. It didn't take long. In fact, I had my choice. On his show of May 2, 1993, Falwell said seventeen times that this was the absolute last and final week to get a copy of the "Expos of the Clinton Inaugural Gala." Two weeks later, he offered it again. I faxed a letter to Jerry, pointing out his, shall we say, discrepancy, just in case his misrepresentation was inadvertent. No: he meant it. The next week he offered the "Expos of the Clinton Inaugural Gala" again. Again, he said it was the last week. The following week, guess what? Yes, more Clinton Inaugural Galas.  But this time, he actually admitted that he had previously said, "this is the last week," on two other broadcasts, and sure enough, he was offering them again. He freely admitted that he was going to, in his own words, "renege," "change my mind," and "go back on my word." Isn't this commonly known as lying? Well, what had Falwell said about lying and its consequences on recent shows? He had quoted,

Jerry knows he's got to mine this prejudice as quickly as he can. Science has fairly well proven that most homosexuality is not a choice, but something people are born with.

In the twenty or so shows broadcast since then, I have not seen Falwell spend more than one minute per hour "giving the pure Gospel of Jesus Christ" to anyone. It's politics, politics, politics, hate, hate, hate, fear, fear, fear. It's the same anti-gay, anti-women (one of the tapes he sells is "Why True Christian Women Do Not Participate in the Feminist Movement"[*FN]), anti-Clinton (to the sins of communism and onanism, Falwell apparently wants to add Clintonism), anti-choice, and anti-ACLU (which he calls the "American Communist Lawyers Union").

Or, "In the event, young lady, you are being persuaded by some feminist to join the movement, you have to make a major choice in your life.  You must reject the Bible to do it."

Pat Robertson hosts the daily 700 Club (named after his first 700 devoted donors), is the founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), writes bestselling books on what God would do if He only had control of Washington, is the ringleader of the Christian Coalition, and runs for president whenever he is "forced" to. Between Falwell and Robertson, from the standpoint of consensual crimes, Robertson is far more dangerous.
<P>

In 1989, Robertson formed the Christian Coalition, a tax-exempt "social welfare organization" which gathers money from Christians and puts it into political campaigns. Not directly, mind you, but in the form of "voter information pamphlets" which supposedly tell where candidates stand on particular issues in a supposedly fair and balanced way. Of course, the pamphlets are neither fair nor balanced. The conservative candidate (almost always a Republican) is the knight in shining armor for God's righteous forces while his or her opponent is, at best, anti-Christian and, most likely, in league with the devil. The Christian Coalition sent out 40 million such "voter information pamphlets" in support of George Bush during the 1992 presidential campaign. That didn't bring a victory, but sometimes it does. In 1990, the Christian Coalition sent out 350,000 pieces of literature at the last minute to help Jesse Helms win what many thought was a lost senatorial campaign.

The Christian Coalition campaigned heavily in the 1993 Los Angeles mayoral race, sending out 450,000 pamphlets, and its candidate, Richard Riordan, won. The next morning on the 700 Club, Pat Robertson gloated that "Christian-bashing politics and anti-Christian campaign tactics" were no longer going to work. He showed the "Christian-bashing," "anti-Christian" commercial prepared by Riordan's opponent. The commercial was only anti–Pat Robertson. Christ and Christianity were never mentioned. If one criticizes Pat Robertson's role in the political process, then, one is of course bashing Christianity and is anti-Christian. Or so Pat Robertson wants his followers to believe.

That same morning on the 700 Club, Robertson interviewed, via satellite, the gushingly grateful new senator from Texas, also backed by the Christian Coalition. One by one, election by election, Robertson is pocketing elected officials at all levels of government, right up to and including the United States Senate. They owe Robertson political favors, and the political favor Robertson wants is for God's law to become man's law.

The 700 Club has a set format. Robertson chats amiably with Ben, Robertson's obsequious sidekick, who is as devoted to Robertson as he supposedly is to Jesus. Then we go to "CBN News" which, in network-reporting style (on-air reporter, stock footage, interviews, sound bites, and lots of graphics), a news story is told from an unabashedly politically conservative point of view. We then go back to Pat and Ben, who chat about it. In case anyone missed the point (liberals are Godless heathens and conservatives are America's only hope), Robertson calmly lets us know God's point of view on every political and social issue, while Ben leads him on with question after question, as though Robertson were somehow shy—even reluctant—to share his personal point of view. "Ah, shucks, Ben, I don't know. But if I had to take a guess . . ." and then he moves in with an obviously well-prepared kill. After a report on Hurricane Andrew, for example, Robertson revealed its true cause: the fact that God had removed "his blessing" from America. "If we're not a Christian nation," Robertson said, "why should God give us his blessing?" Why indeed? Next news item.

And then there are the Geraldo-like guests designed to keep viewers glued to their sets with personal stories involving tantalizing, even scandalous, twists of fate. An example: "This Christian mother and father of three children have AIDS. Their story later in our show. But now. . . ." It makes for good sound bites. The husband and wife, as it turns out, don't have AIDS, but are infected with "the AIDS virus." They got it through "heterosexual promiscuity" prior to their conversion to Christ. Two and a half years after being "rooted in the Lord" they discovered their condition, but, "praise the Lord," none of their children is HIV-positive. That the 700 Club is telling its viewers AIDS is also transmitted by heterosexuals is good news. The bad news? On the 700 Club Christians are not encouraged to use condoms; children should not be instructed in condom use; and condoms should not be passed out in public schools. The only answer to stop the spread of AIDS is complete and total abstinence until marriage. Period.

This facade of journalistic integrity is reminiscent (and why shouldn't it be?) of Robertson's 1990 book, The New Millennium. In his book, Robertson rattles along just fine outlining, with proper statistical background, some real problems in America (the national debt, violent crime, and so on) and then, suddenly, he makes a sharp turn to the right, another sharp turn to the right, another sharp turn to the right, another sharp turn to the right, and then retraces his ground. Like most commentators who only turn right or only turn left, he winds up going in circles. Violent crime, he claims, is caused by feminists (by destroying the American family, which erodes society, which raises immoral children, who go out and commit violence). The national debt was caused by homosexuals. (I won't torture you with the logic of that one.) The rhetoric harkens back to Hitler, who blamed everything on (a) the International Jewish Conspiracy, (b) communism, (c) the impurity of the Aryan race, (d) homosexuality, or, (e) all of the above.

The 700 Club spends at least two minutes of each hour praying. Good. One can only take so much politics. And then there's fund-raising. That gets a lot more than two minutes each hour, but not as much as politics—except during fund-raising periods. Yes, Robertson loves saving souls. He also loves getting conservative Christian voters on his mailing lists. In 1992, Robertson declared his Christian Coalition's goal:

We want to see a working majority of the Republican Party in the hands of pro-family Christians by 1996 or sooner.

If that comes to pass—and there's not much reason why it should not—by the new millennium, I'll be able to publish a book the size of this one just listing the consensual crimes. But, of course, that book would be banned.

I'm not against Falwell and Robertson because they are politically conservative; I'm against them because they are against fundamental freedoms. They don't believe we, as adults, have the right to do with our person and property as we see fit, as long as we do not physically harm the person or property of another. Why? "Because it's against God's law." Who says? "God does!" Where? "Just read the Bible!" I did, and as this chapter has gone to great lengths to show, "It's not there."  Alan Watts offers his perspective:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
Fundamentalists veer to the extreme right wing in politics, being of the personality type that demands strong external and paternalistic authority. Their "rugged individualism" and their racism are founded on the conviction that they are the elect of God the Father, and their forebears took possession of America as the armies of Joshua took possession of Canaan, treating the Indians as Joshua and Gideon treated the Bedouin of Palestine. In the same spirit the Protestant British, Dutch and Germans took possession of Africa, India and Indonesia, and the rigid Catholics of Spain and Portugal colonized Latin America. Such territorial expansion may or may not be practical politics, but to do it in the name of Jesus of Nazareth is an outrage.

THOSE OF US WHO grew up in the 1950s got an image of the American family that was not, shall we say, accurate. We were told, Father Knows Best, Leave It to Beaver, and Ozzie and Harriet were not just the way things were supposed to be—but the way things were.
<P>

Things were not that way.
<P>

It's probably good that life wasn't like the television shows in the '50s—we wouldn't have many women now. Take a look at the ratio of boys to girls on the most popular family shows. Ozzie and Harriet had two boys, no girls. Leave It to Beaver had two boys, no girls. Rifleman had one boy, one rifle, no girls. Lassie had one boy, one dog (supposedly a girl, but played by a boy), and no girls. My Three Sons had—well, that one's obvious. Bonanza had three grown-up boys. Although Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in real life had one boy and one girl, on I Love Lucy they had one boy. The only shows with daughters were The Donna Reed Show (one boy, one girl) and that lighthouse to womanhood—despite its title—Father Knows Best (one boy, two girls). Grown to maturity, that's a late-1960s dating population of fifteen men to three women.

Almost all the households were mama-papa-kiddies: the nuclear family. (The exceptions were My Three Sons and Bonanza: Steve Douglas [Fred MacMurray] and Ben Cartwright were widowers.) There were no prior marriages, no children from prior relationships, no threat or even thought of divorce, and the closest thing we saw to physical abuse was Ralph Kramden's, "One of these days, Alice, one of these days . . . to the moon!" There were no infidelities, no drinking problems, no drugs (not even prescription tranquilizers), no racism (How could there be? With the exception of Hop Sing and Ricky Ricardo, there was only one race; even the Hispanic gardener on Father Knows Best was named Frank Smith). There was no dropping out of school, no political discussion (much less political differences), no unemployment (except for Ozzie's early retirement), no severe economic problem (except for a crop failure on Lassie, when they had to sell all the livestock, including Lassie; but just before being carted off, Lassie pawed the ground and struck oil, and everything was okay again. Except for Lassie, who looked as though the Exxon Valdez had dumped its forward holding tanks on her). The father was the breadwinner; the mother was the bread maker (the only mother who came close to working was Lucy, becoming the spokeswoman for Vitavita-Vegimen or that afternoon at the candy factory). There was no fear of the bomb (which is what we kids were terrified about in the '50s), and no severe disobedience (although white lies, mischief, and misunderstandings were needed for laughs). Life was wholesome, wholesome, wholesome.[*FN]

[*FN]  As much as the religious right likes to point to 1950s sitcom wholesomeness as the Ideal American Family, these shows, in fact, had a remarkable lack of religion.  What religion <I>were</I> these people? They certainly weren't Jewish. And, other than possibly Ricky Ricardo, none of them was Catholic. They were probably safely mainline Presbyterians. But that was the name of the game: play it safe. In playing it safe, there was less mention of God and religion on these shows than actually took place in American families in the '50s.

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
Pessimists argue that the family is collapsing; optimists counter that it is merely diversifying. Too often, both camps begin with an ahistorical, static notion of what "the" family was like before the contemporary period. Thus we have one set of best sellers urging us to reaffirm traditional family values in an era of "family collapse" and another promising to set us free from traditional family traps if we can only turn off "old tapes" and break out of old ruts. . . . The actual complexity of our history—even of our own personal experience—gets buried under the weight of an idealized image.

Families have always been in flux and often in crisis; they have never lived up to nostalgic notions about "the way things used to be."

The United States has had the highest homicide rate in the industrial world for almost 150 years.

In 1940, one American child in ten did not live with either birth parent. Today the figure is one in twenty-five.
<p><li>
More couples reported their marriage "happy" in 1977 than did in 1957. (The "happy marriage" index dropped slightly by the late 1980s, but still remained higher than it was in 1957.)

A woman over thirty-five has a better chance of marrying today than she did in the 1950s.
<p><li>
In the mid-1950s, 25% of the population lived below the poverty line.
<p><li>
In 1958, 60% of the population over sixty-five had incomes below $1,000.
<p><li>
In the 1950s, one-third of the white, native-born families could not get by with the income of only one working parent.
<p><li>
In the 1950s, racism was deeply institutionalized. 50% of black families lived below the poverty line; migrant workers suffered appalling working and living conditions; people of color were not permitted to take part in the American dream.
<p><li>
In 1952, there were 2,000,000 more wives working outside the home than there were at the peak of wartime production.
<p><li>
Women who failed to conform to the June Cleaver/Margaret Anderson role of housewife and mother were severely criticized. A 1947 bestselling book, The Modern Woman, called feminism a "deep illness," labeled the idea of an independent woman a "contradiction in terms," and explained that women who wanted equal pay and equal educational opportunities were engaged in a "ritualistic castration" of men.
<p><li>
Women were often denied the right to serve on juries, convey property, make contracts (including leases on apartments), and establish credit in their own names (including mortgages and credit cards).

Men who failed to marry were considered immature, selfish, or homosexual. A man without a wife found it difficult finding work or getting promoted.
<p><li>
Unmarried men and women were routinely paid less than married men and women because, it was explained, their needs were less.
<p><li>
The witch hunts against communists extended to homosexuals and other political and social "deviants." During the 1950s, 2,611 civil servants were fired as "security risks"; 4,315 resigned while being "investigated."
<p><li>
In her book, Private Lives: Men and Women of the '50s,</I> Benita Eisler quotes film producer Joel Schumacher: "No one told the truth. People pretended they weren't unfaithful. They pretended they weren't homosexual. They pretended they weren't horrible." The uniformity we sense about the '50s, with everyone happily "fitting in," was, in fact, a great number of frightened people pretending to fit in—and pretending to enjoy it.
<p><li>
A "sure cure" for homosexuality for either men or women was marriage. This myth was propagated not just by popular culture, but by psychologists and psychiatrists as well. When marriage failed to be the "cure," as it always did, having a child would surely take care of the problem. When that didn't work, a second child was "prescribed." When that didn't work, well, the least you could do is pretend to be heterosexual and do your duty—for your children's sake.

Congress discussed nearly two hundred bills to deal with the problem of "juvenile delinquency" in 1955—the year Rebel Without a Cause was released.

A husband raping his wife was not a crime at all, but a sign that the woman was deficient in fulfilling her marital obligations.

Far from Beaver and Wally telling Ward and June carefully edited versions of their daily adventures over the dinner table, more often the evening meal was a TV dinner on a TV tray in front of the TV.

What the TV couldn't numb, tranquilizers could. A New Yorker cartoon illustrated a 1950s couple, floating down the river in a gondola, surrounded by beautiful flowers, singing birds, and playful butterflies. The husband asks the wife, "What was the name of that tranquilizer we took?" In 1958, 462,000 pounds of tranquilizers were consumed in the United States. A year later, consumption had more than tripled to 1.5 million pounds.

Ms. Coontz concludes, "The historical record is clear on one point: Although there are many things to draw on in our past, there is no one family form that has ever protected people from poverty or social disruption, and no traditional arrangement that provides a workable model for how we might organize family relations in the modern world."
<P>
<DD>
Depending on whose statistics you read, today the traditional nuclear family represents anywhere from 6% to less than 50% of the American population. One can fiddle with the statistics endlessly. Should the household have only the male as the breadwinner? Should there be no one living in the household except the mother, father, and children? Should the household be in a single-family house, or will an apartment do? Does a couple living alone without children count? However we look at it, the point is clear: even taking the most generous estimate, today more than half the country lives outside a nuclear family.

An unprecedented economic boom hit the United States in the 1950s that had never happened before and, almost certainly, will never happen again. The United States was almost the only industrial country untouched by World War II. The international competition lay in ruins; the United States was ready to switch from wartime production to peacetime production. It didn't matter what we made—it sold. The gas-guzzler—one of the most inefficient objects assembled by humans—is an icon of that era. (By the late 1950s, Germany was already challenging the American automotive vise-hold with its Volkswagen. Japan made a sneak attack with its transistor radio. American industry would never be as fat and sassy again.)
<P>
<DD>
We will never have the economic domination of the world we had in the 1950s, nor will the white, male, Christian heterosexual be able again to dominate the women, blacks, Jews, Hispanics, gays, and the rest. There's no going back—nor should there be a going back. It never should have happened in the first place.
<P>
<DD>
Families are important because human infants require three years of care before they can manage without the help of an adult. (If three years seems young to be without parental care, it is far from unheard of in third world countries, or in countries torn by war or natural disaster.) But who says the child needs more than one adult? And who says the adult needs to be a birth parent? Only tradition. Long before the nuclear family, tribes raised children collectively—a system that continues in many parts of the world to this day.

<DD>
Our modern concept of two people raising their children under one roof grew out of feudal necessity. The absolute minimum number of people necessary to maintain a plot of land during the Middle Ages was two. As the lord of the land wanted his serfs to "be fruitful and multiply" (thus multiplying the wealth of the lord), it was necessary that one of the two people be a man and the other a woman. Serfs were paired until death did them part. Love had nothing to do with it. (The only people who had time for such luxuries as love were those in the royal court—hence the term courtship.) The man tended the land all his waking hours, and the woman tended the house, livestock, and children. Even if a husband and wife hated each other, all they had to do was wait a little while: what with disease, war, childbirth, and an average life span of about thirty-five years, most marriages lasted less than five years. The departed partner was immediately replaced, and the system continued—not because the serfs liked it, but because it was economically viable for the aristocracy.
<P>
<DD>
The system worked so well and the aristocracy was so pleased, they got the church involved. A marvelous theology developed (marvelously useful to the landowners): work hard in this life (which is but a blink in the eye of eternity), serve your lord (who represented the Lord), and you will have paradise for all eternity—and that's a long, long, time Mr. and Mrs. Serf. Rebel against the lord (Lord), and you will spend all eternity (which is a long, etc.) in hell. Be true to your spouse (not being true to your spouse would take valuable time away from essential serf stuff), work hard, and eternal paradise will be yours.

Today, of course, the idea that two people are the minimum to make one economic unit is no longer true. With labor-saving devices, reduced work hours, and prepackaged everything, one person can make a living and raise a child perfectly well. So can twenty.
<P>
<DD>
So what are these "family values" we want to maintain?
<P>
<DD>
In a 1989 Newsweek survey, only 22% of the respondents believed that family was directly tied to blood lines, marriage, children, and adoption. More than 74% said a family is any group whose members love and care for one another. It's too bad former Vice-President Quayle didn't read this poll before he accused Murphy Brown of destroying traditional family values by having a child without the formality of marriage.

America's "traditional family values" are love, support, tolerance, caring, nurturing, and—if you don't mind my adding my favorite—a sense of humor.

Isn't that what the situation comedy is all about? We find ourselves in a situation (life) and are faced with the fundamental question: do we laugh or do we cry? The choice is up to us—choice being a traditional American value, too.

EVER SINCE THE UNITED States declared war on drugs (poor drugs), "the drug problem" has scored in opinion polls as one of the top five concerns of the American public. During the decade preceding the official declaration of war in 1982, however, America's concern about drug use hovered around #20.[*FN] Interestingly, it was not that public concern grew and a war was declared; rather, a war was declared, wartime propaganda grew (at an alarming rate), and the public concern rose. It's like William Randolph Hearst's reply to the newspaper illustrator who cabled, "NO WAR IN CUBA." Hearst cabled back, "GIVE ME THE PICTURES; I'LL GIVE YOU THE WAR."

[*FN]  For example, in 1974, Dr. Peter Bourne, who later became President Carter's drug policy advisor, called cocaine "the most benign of illicit drugs currently in widespread use."  Today it is widely belived that if you come within even a three-mile radius of cocaine, it will do such immediate and irreparable harm to your mental functioning that you will become one of those people who actually believe that those little buttons you push to change the light at a crosswalk are connected to something.

It's as though someone looked at the deterioration of Soviet communism (a perennial top-five concern) and said, "We need a new war here; let's find a problem." In fact, many of the anti-drug warriors are the same people who were, just a decade ago, fervent anti-communists. They attack drugs with the same rhetoric they used attacking communism.

On another front, gays have served in the United States military ever since General Von Steuben arrived at Valley Forge in February 1778. He was recommended to General Washington by Benjamin Franklin. Von Steuben turned the rag-tag troops into a fighting army by spring; Burke Davis pointed out in his book, <I>George Washington and the American Revolution</I>, "the value of Von Steuben's service could hardly be overestimated." Von Steuben was gay. More than two hundred years later, President Clinton took office and, of all the problems facing the country and its new president, what got most press (and, therefore, seemed most pressing)? Would Clinton honor his campaign pledge to stop throwing people out of the military simply for being gay? You would think he was trying to give Maine to Canada—oh, the furor, the furor.

And so it continues down the list of consensual crimes: Los Angeles seems more concerned about fighting prostitution than pollution; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms ignores the 22,000 alcohol-related traffic deaths, the 500,000 cigarette-related deaths, and the 10,000 handgun deaths in 1993, and instead waged war on 100 Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas; authorized medical practitioners overbill insurance companies to the tune of $80 billion per year while the Food and Drug Administration (the federal agency assigned to watch over the medical community) sees to it that dying people cannot have the most effective painkilling medications, launches armed raids on healers doing anything "unorthodox," and wants to require a prescription for doses of vitamin C larger than 60 milligrams.

This chapter is not designed to support the predictions of doomsday theorists. It also does not purport to offer solutions to any of these problems—this book offers a solution to only one problem, the problem of consensual crimes. Solving the problems in this chapter is going to take commitment, creativity, money, and a lot of work—precisely the resources currently squandered in the futile attempt to regulate individual morality.

In this chapter, we will use two words that have become increasingly popular in recent years, billion and trillion. Because million, billion, and trillion rhyme, we often think of them as roughly the same amount of money: "Oh, a billion is more than a million, but not a whole lot more."
<P>

A billion is a whole lot more.

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
If a million dollars in hundred dollar bills were laid end to end,[*FN] they would stretch approximately 97 miles—roughly the distance from New York to Philadelphia.
<P>
One billion dollars laid end to end would circle the globe at the equator nearly four times; alternatively, they could go two-fifths of the distance to the moon.
<P>
One trillion dollars in one hundred dollar bills, laid end to end, would circle the equator 3,900 times. Or, if you don't want to go around the world that many times, one trillion dollars in hundred dollar bills, laid end to end, would extend from the earth to the sun, and, once there, you would still have $41 billion to burn.
<P>
[*FN]  Every time I hear these end-to-end analogies, I think of Dorothy Parker's remark, "If all the debutantes in New York were laid end to end, I wouldn't be surprised."  Or, as Will Durst asked, "Did you know that if you took all the veins and arteries out of a man's body and laid them end to end, that man would die?"  More to the point of this book, Arther Baer said, "If you laid all our laws end to end, there would be no end."

Speaking of trillion, let's begin our list with the national debt.
<P>
<DD>
<B>The National Debt</B>. Forty-five years of fighting the cold war had devastating economic effects on both the Soviet Union and the United States; the only difference is, the United States had better credit than the Soviet Union—the Soviet Union is bankrupt; the United States is merely in receivership. As a nation, we (as of 1996) owe more than $5 trillion ($5,000,000,000,000.00); that's $19,200 for each man, woman, and child in the United States. The average American family owes more to "the company store" than they do on their house. (The share of the national debt for a family of five is $96,000. If they have a cat, it's $98,000. If they have a dog, it's $99,000. If they have a large dog, it's an even $100,000.) The interest alone on the national debt is somewhere between $240 billion and $355 billion per year (depending upon whom you listen to—the government [$240 billion] or balanced-budget advocates [$355 billion]). More than 40% of personal income taxes go just to pay the interest on the national debt.[*FN]
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
[*FN]  Although I said I wouldn't offer any solutions, here's a fairly obvious one:  between the money we spend every year prosecuting consensual crimes and the revenue lost by not taxing consensual activities, if we did nothing else, the elimination of consensual crimes would wipe out the national debt in twenty years.  As it is, our current policy on consensual crimes will add a trillion dollars to the national debt in the next five years, which will cost us about $6 trillion in interest over the following 20 years.

We also didn't take the suggestion of Thomas Jefferson when in 1789 he warned the electorate: "The principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale." Well, futurity, do you feel swindled? (Futurity. Sounds like one of those prototype automobiles from the 1950s. "Drive into the '60s with the new Ford Futurity.") As Sid Taylor, research director for the National Taxpayers Union, put it, "Deficit spending is bankruptcy pending." But not all world leaders believed that a large national debt was a bad thing. One of the most famous national leaders in this century said, "No country has ever been ruined on account of its debts." The year was 1940. The economic expert: Adolf Hitler.

And where are the crooks who committed the real crime of "misappropriating" all that money (an average of $2,000 for every man, woman, and child in the United States)? We go to Panama to drag "drug lords" to "justice"; where are the indictments against the "S&L lords"? As Senator Richard C.

<B>Other Supposedly Regulated Delights</B>. The same federal regulatory agencies that let the S&Ls get away with financial murder apparently let another endearing financial organization get away with genuine murder. I am referring to that billionaires' social club, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, or BCCI. This multinational "bank" was, in reality, a clearing house for crooks. Here's an excerpt from Senator John D. Kerry's congressional testimony on August 8, 1991:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
You need a Mirage jet to go to Saddam Hussein? BCCI could facilitate it. If you wanted weapons in the Mideast, and possibly even atomic weapons? Who do you call? BCCI. You want drug money to move from cartel to safe haven? BCCI. It gave new meaning to the term full service bank. . . .
<P>
What strikes me particularly is the degree to which this bank thought it could steamroll any obstacles that lay in its path. Certain laws and standards were no barrier. Why? Because BCCI thought it could buy everything. Buy lawyers, buy accountants, buy regulators, buy access, buy loyalty, buy governments, buy safety, buy protection, and even buy silence. . . .

With purchased endorsements from more elected officials than you could wave a laundered checkbook at, BCCI was able to illegally take over several American banks with hardly an investigation. What about murder? It is said that murder (under the more corporately acceptable title, assassination) was part of BCCI's stock in trade. Whereas most banks have departments such as Trust, Savings, Money Orders, New Accounts, Safety Deposit Boxes, and Loans, BCCI had Assassinations, Coups d'tat, Money Laundering, Arms Trafficking, Nuclear Weapons, and Political Destabilization. The BCCI. Lovely people to be in business with; and, while the federal regulators were out regulating consensual crimes, it made American banks part of its empire.[*FN] And what is the next scandal in a supposedly government-regulated industry? I nominate . . .
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
[*FN]  This scandal involved so many people in Washington, and was such a truly bipartisan effort, that we don't hear anything about it anymore—or about all the people running it, who have no doubt set up shop under another name.  When Washington as a whole wants to cover up something, they usually (a) find a scapegoat and (b) step up the "war" on some consensual activity (now that we don't have Russia to kick around anymore). The scapegoat was Clark Clifford, who arranged poker games for Truman and Vietnam for Johnson. For his influence peddling, his law firm over an 18-month period received $33 million from BCCI. Congress (mostly lawyers) can only respond with horror—and envy. Meanwhile, the American public knew more about David Koresh's cult of 100 than how (and who in) the federal government looked the other way while BCCI illegally bought up American banks. Nice spin control.

<B>Health Care Fraud</B>. Insurance fraud is the biggest white-collar crime in the nation, second only to income-tax evasion. Each year, $80 billion is stolen from health insurance companies, Medicaid, and Medicare by the medical establishment. It uses cute terms like "overbilling," but it's really stealing. And much of it is done by doctors and hospitals, the very people and institutions we are supposed to trust with our lives. Overbilling also jacks up medical insurance premiums so that millions of people who otherwise would have health insurance, can't afford it. The average American's share of this real crime last year: $320. However, according to the House Subcommittee on Human Resources, "In some jurisdictions, federal prosecutors may not accept criminal health-care cases involving less than $100,000 because of limited resources. . . . Prosecutorial and judicial resources are limited, necessarily restricting the number of cases that can be legally pursued." With well over half the prosecutor case load made up of drug offenses, it's not hard to guess what's limiting those resources. (From 1982 to 1990, drug-related cases in federal courts increased by almost 400%.) The congressional report goes on to say, "The deterrent and financial benefits of pursuing fraud must be weighed against the considerable legal and administrative costs of doing so." If only the government would use on consensual crimes the logic it applies to the real crime of fraud.

<B>Automobile Insurance Fraud</B>. More than $17.5 billion a year is paid in inflated auto insurance claims. Who pays? Everyone who buys auto insurance—and everyone who can't afford to. Car insurance fraud adds 10 to 30% to every car insurance bill. And what is the government doing to end this crime? Not much. According to a journal of the insurance industry, <I>Insurance Review</I>,

With law enforcement officials mired in murder and drug cases,[*FN] and industry investigators focused on costlier and more sophisticated scams, the odds that an otherwise law-abiding citizen will be caught, much less prosecuted, for his misdeeds are minuscule. The Florida study concluded that as long as policy holders are knowledgeable, and not too greedy, they can "commit fraud with impunity."
<P>
[*FN]  While I certainly don't think that law enforcement time should be taken away from murder investigations to track down insurance fraud, more law enforcement time is spent on drugs than murders—a frightening thought in itself. Here's one example of the ratio between "murder" and "drug cases" in the United States: In 1991, there were fewer than 25,000 arrests for murder and more than 1,000,000 arrests for drug violations. Of these more-than-1,000,000 arrests, 672,666 were for simple possession. Here's an even more frightening statistic: In 1990, the average sentence at U.S. District Courts for first-degree murder was 12.8 years; for "other drug-related statutes," 20.4 years. The drug terms are usually mandatory; by law they must be served.  Murderers, on the other hand, can be paroled at any time.
<P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<DD>
<B>Real Crime</B>. In addition to paying more than you need to for insurance due to fraud, or watching your tax money (which you must pay) bail out savings and loan mismanagement and embezzlement, there are other real crimes to worry about. On the average, every four years you or someone in your household will be robbed, raped, or physically assaulted. (That once-every-four-years statistic does not include murder, manslaughter by drunk drivers, kidnaping, child abuse, or other violent crimes.) Five out of six people living in the United States will be the victims of violent crimes during their lifetimes. For every 133 people you meet, one of them will be murdered. (If you live in a household of five, the chances are 1 in 27 that one of you will be murdered.) Then there are embezzlers, shoplifters, and other "white-collar criminals" who add to the price of everything we buy; a dramatic increase in "hate crimes" (that is, violent crimes against people just because they happen to belong to an ethnic, national, religious, or sexual minority); and so many others. And where are the police? Crimes with real victims (us) are out of control, yet roughly half the law enforcement time is spent investigating consensual crimes. Eliminating consensual crimes would effectively double law enforcement personnel and easily halve the number of real crimes almost overnight. (There I go again: offering solutions.)

<B>Abducted Children</B>. According to the United States Department of Justice, 400,000 children are abducted every year. There are currently 1.4 million missing children in this country. Of the 1.4 million, some of them are runaways, some were abducted by family members, some are simply "missing" (the "lost, injured, or otherwise missing" category lists 440,000). Some children are kidnaped—primarily for rape and torture. When they are no longer young enough to be interesting, they are killed.
<P>
<DD>
Although there is a central clearing house to report all missing children, there is no federal law instructing local law enforcement personnel to send information to this clearing house. Many law enforcement officials don't even know the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children exists. The FBI does not get involved in kidnapings unless a ransom is demanded (which almost never happens anymore) or unless the parents can prove that, after abduction, the child was transported across a state line (good luck proving that). When Project Alert was formed in 1992 to help locate missing children, it had a whopping initial budget of $200,000. This is .0015% of the federal drug enforcement budget, or .0004% of what is spent prosecuting consensual crimes in this country each year.

Those who say that consensual crimes really do have victims—that consensual crimes are a bad influence on children—might want to consider whether the time, money, and effort spent keeping children safe from "bad examples" might be better spent reuniting abducted children with their parents and putting behind bars some of the worst imaginable criminals—people who abduct small children for rape, torture, and murder. Perhaps the people who want to make the entire world as wholesome as Disneyland should consider the anguish of hundreds of thousands of parents who are not only physically separated from their children, but are also tortured by thoughts of the horrors their children are being subjected to.

<B>Terrorism</B>. We don't hear much about terrorism in this country because if we really knew what was going on, we'd all be, well, terrorized. The car bomb (or, more accurately, the mini-van bomb) explosion at the base of the World Trade Center in March 1993 was not only an act of terrorism—it was a warning. "Imagine if this were a nuclear device . . ." If it had been a nuclear bomb, there would be no more Manhattan (an irony, since the code name for the invention of the atom bomb was the Manhattan Project). With Manhattan goes the financial center of the world, the communications center of the United States, and the corporate headquarters of more major U.S. companies than you can rattle off in the time it takes a physics professor to explain E=mc2. One atom bomb in Los Angeles would wipe out the movie industry, what was left of the television industry (much of which went with Manhattan), and could create enough seismic vibrations to set off The Big One. Another atom bomb in Washington, D.C., would wipe out the federal government. And one in Chicago would eliminate the idea that the Midwest was somehow immune to attack. Four atom bombs, and the United States as we know it would cease to be. (I haven't even discussed the lasting effects of radiation, especially if they happen to be "dirty" bombs—which terrorists' bombs almost certainly would be.) The remainder of the country would, however, have 24-hour news coverage of the death of the United States: CNN is located in Atlanta.

The international underground originally set up to sell drugs has decided—with typical big-business logic—to sell anything the customer wants to buy. One of these organizations, the previously mentioned BCCI, has come to light. Many have not. Underground organizations are perfectly willing to sell the parts necessary to make atomic bombs. As Senator John D. Kerry reported during a Senate investigation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
The spread of nuclear weapons, needless to say, creates even greater risks for confrontation and of destruction. When a bank like BCCI moves drug money and big-dollar weapons money and helps terrorists acquire the material to make nuclear bombs . . . while political leaders who are supposed to be protecting them move aside, then governments themselves wind up becoming partners in the enterprise of those criminals.

The only thing Russia had that, for example, Saddam Hussein or the Ayatollah Khomeini did not was a delivery system for its atom bombs. Russia had missiles. With the World Trade Center bombing, however, terrorists proved that, although they don't have missiles, they can rent mini-vans.
<P>
<DD>
The 1995 Oklahoma City bombing proved that terrorists don't need an atomic bomb to make their deadly point, and that the terrorism we need fear is not only foreign inspired. All it takes is someone with a grudge, some fertilizer, some fuel oil, and some way to ignite it.
<P>
<DD>
Meanwhile, what are the FBI, CIA, and United States Customs—our only realistic defense against terrorism—up to? You guessed it: defending us against consensual crimes. Drugs, of course, head the list. Terrorism is a footnote.
<P>
<DD>
And what are customs officials trained to find? Drugs, of course. Do you think one in a thousand customs officials knows what the components of a nuclear bomb look like? But how many know what cocaine looks like or how marijuana smells? And then there are all those drug-sniffing dogs. How about a few plutonium-sniffing dogs? (Some 9,600 pounds of plutonium and highly enriched uranium are missing from U.S. inventories. It takes only 15 pounds of plutonium to make an atomic bomb.)

And where are J. Edgar's best? After an investigation that lasted several years, on June 30, 1992, more than 1,000 FBI agents simultaneously swooped down on doctors and pharmacies in fifty cities, making arrests and confiscating everything in sight, in an attempt to stop prescription drugs from ending up "on the black market." It was called Operation Gold Pill.

The FBI, however, does not just protect us from purloined prescription drugs. On June 23, 1991, after extensive investigation, 150 FBI agents invaded the bankrupt mining town of Wallace, Idaho, and confiscated every video poker machine from every bar in town. It wasn't that these video poker machines accepted bets, like the Las Vegas versions, but that people would bet each other and sometimes the bar owner on who could get more points. Horrors! According to a <I>New York Times</I> article, August 20, 1991,

Federal lawyers are moving in court to take control of the places that were raided, a move that would make the Government owner of every bar in Wallace.

Meanwhile, on September 28, 1992, the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Drug Enforcement Administration revealed "a truly unique joint effort involving the participation of law enforcement agencies on three continents." Was this "truly unique" two-year international effort designed to track down and uncover terrorism? No. Known as Operation Green Ice, its purpose was to terrorize drug dealers. "Operation Green Ice has a message for drug dealers everywhere: the world is mobilized against you. U.S. law enforcement will continue with our colleagues around the world to defeat these purveyors of human misery."

<B>Environmental Disasters</B>. One might expect the flashing electronic billboard above L.A.'s trendy Hard Rock Cafe to provide information about either music or food. Instead, it has two rows of numbers. One is labeled POPULATIONOF THEWORLD and the other, ACRESOFRAINFORESTREMAINING. At a rate of roughly one-per-second, the population number grows, while the rain forest number shrinks. It's a graphic illustration of the collision course we are on: both population growth and the destruction of the rain forest are out of control. The population of the world surpasses six billion. By early in the next century, it will double. Overpopulation is the basis of most environmental problems. The rain forests are not only the lungs of the earth—producing oxygen and removing impurities[*FN]—they are also the medicine chest. Eighty percent of all pharmaceutical drugs come from plant products. Less than three percent of the plants in the rain forest have been identified. Whole species of plants that might contain the cure for current and future diseases are being destroyed forever. Yet, instead of tying U.S. foreign aid to reasonable population growth or preservation of the rain forests, to what do we tie it? The elimination of drug production and trafficking. We are far more concerned about destroying poppy fields in Thailand or cocaine farms in Colombia than preserving the rain forests in Brazil.

When you look at the ozone layer, from outside, from a spaceship, it looks like a pale blue halo, a gentle, shimmering aureole encircling the atmosphere encircling the earth. Thirty miles above our heads, a thin layer of three-atom oxygen molecules. . . . It's a kind of gift, from God, the crowning touch to the creation of the world: guardian angels, hands linked, make a spherical net, a blue-green nesting orb, a shell of safety for life itself.

A few random environmental disasters:  During the summer of 1992, 2,000 U.S. beaches were closed due to toxic levels of water pollution.  In the fifteen major urban metropolitan areas, from 1987 to 1990, there were 1,484 "unhealthy" air days (more than half of them were in Los Angeles).  Acid rain—precipitation containing sulfuric and nitric acids—continues to reign, destroying lakes, forests, and crops.  Global warming—caused, in part, by burning fossil fuels—may melt the ice caps, raising ocean levels and flooding coastal areas. More than 53% of the U.S. population live in coastal areas.  Our planet loses three species per day. By the year 2000, 20% of all species could be lost forever.  An Environmental Protection Agency review of the 1,000 worst hazardous waste dumps revealed that 80% were leaking toxins into ground water.  Due to lead plumbing, one in six Americans drinks water with excessive amounts of lead.  We are running out of landfills. The average American disposes of four pounds of solid waste every day. In a lifetime, the average American will produce 600 times his or her adult body weight in garbage. In 1988, Americans disposed of 14 million tons of plastic, 31.6 million tons of yard wastes, and 180 million tons of other wastes. In addition, there are also tons of nuclear waste, which remains deadly for centuries. How do we dispose of this? Where do we put it? What kind of containers can we store it in? These questions have not been adequately answered, and yet we continue to produce nuclear waste.

The United States is the pollution capital of the world. We are 6% of the world's population, but consume 70% of the world's resources. We also produce far more than our share of the pollutants. The world is not happy with us about this.[*FN] Alan Watts once said that, from the earth's point of view, the human race could be considered nothing more than a bad case of lice. If that's an accurate analogy, the United States is the breeding ground. There is simply no way the entire world can support the lifestyle of even an impoverished American. If every family in China wanted nothing more than a refrigerator, the escaping fluorocarbons just to manufacture them would destroy the ozone. The American dream, infinitely exported, would be a nightmare. Our 6% of the world's population pollutes more than the other 94% put together. Americans, for the most part, are benignly unaware of this, but the rest of the world is not. In the world view, the Ugly American of the 1960s has been replaced by the Arrogant American of the 1990s.

<B>Oil Addiction</B>. America is, quite simply, addicted to foreign oil. Although Nixon, while president, declared that the United States should be energy independent by the end of the decade (which decade was the Nixon decade?), and although Carter gave an executive order stating that the average fuel efficiency of automobiles sold in 1990 should be 40 mpg, Reagan—succumbing to the pressures of the petroleum and automobile lobbies—progressively reduced that minimum standard each year he was in office. Today we have, on average, 27.5 mpg cars. If we had gotten to 40 mpg in 1990, there would be no need to import oil today. We could, in fact, become an oil-exporting nation. The direct result of Reagan's policy came to visit his successor, Bush; it was called, appropriately, the Gulf War. Although Bush was properly outraged when he spoke of one small sovereign nation being overrun by an imperialist, nasty, larger nation, everyone knew the war was about oil. In the words of tell-it-like-it-is Ross Perot: "Does he really want us to believe that we're going in to defend a nation [Kuwait] whose leader has a Minister of Sex, whose job it is to get him a new virgin to deflower each Thursday night?" Although the Gulf War cost us "only" 390 American lives, it could have been far worse; and the anxiety suffered by the troops and their families in the early days of deployment, with rumors of poison gases and prolonged desert fighting, was torture enough. Unnecessary torture.

Our dependence on foreign oil and the hundreds of billions of dollars paid to the Middle East have given enormous power to a group of people who are profoundly anti-American and politically unstable. If it weren't for our dependence on foreign oil, could an Ayatollah afford to casually put a $2 million price tag on the head of Salman Rushdie? Would Israel need $3 billion of U.S. foreign aid per year in order to play keep-up-with-the-Joneses-in-military-equipment with its neighbors? We are also burning a limited resource—petroleum—which we would be better off using to make certain plastics, synthetics, lubricants, and solvents that are derived best or exclusively from oil. The irony is that America is rich in energy resources—both natural in the form of wind, water, and sunlight, and renewable through plant-based ethanol, methane, and diesel-grade vegetable oils. (See the chapter, "Hemp for Victory.") Our oil addiction is unnecessary.

Any number of other practical matters aren't directly taught in twelve years of schooling: how to sew on a button, how to diagnose basic automobile problems, how to set goals and achieve them, how to budget money, how to budget time, what the police will and will not do to protect you, how to file a case in small claims court, how to find an apartment, how to fill out a credit application, how to do one's personal income tax. Junior high school and high school are designed to prepare one for college—which is good for those going on to college; but those who aren't would benefit more by learning a trade. The school system's inability to teach the basics of life and how to make a living leads directly to . . .

(I guess trickle-down economics just didn't trickle down far enough.) Meanwhile, the ratio of the average CEO's salary to that of a blue collar worker in 1980 was 25 to 1; in 1992, it was 91 to 1.

<B>AIDS</B>. There is a myth that AIDS is limited to homosexuals, intravenous drug users, and prostitutes. This myth may end up killing millions of heterosexual, drug-free men and women who wouldn't dream of visiting or becoming a prostitute. The fact is, worldwide, there are more heterosexually transmitted cases of AIDS than all other cases combined. The World Health Organization estimates that, by the year 2000, more heterosexual women in the United States will be newly infected with the AIDS virus than any other group. The Center for Disease Control reports that, in the United States, "the percentage of AIDS cases attributed to heterosexual contact has increased 21% from 1990 to 1991." And yet many continue to believe that, if they avoid sex with homosexuals, intravenous drug users, and prostitutes, they will be safe. The spread of this disease into the heterosexual world in the United States is a direct result of the centuries-old prejudices held against homosexuals, drug users, and prostitutes. It will be a sad irony to watch this prejudice turn, bite, and perhaps devour its keepers. The disease is being spread through the heterosexual world due to the belief, "it can't happen here." Heterosexuals still seem to think the simple advice, "Use a condom when you have intercourse," only applies to "them."

<B>Other Problems</B>. In case you're interested, the Union of International Associations has published a 2,133-page book entitled <I>Encyclopedia of World Problems</I>.

This is up from 10,233 problems in 1986 and a considerable jump from the 2,560 problems listed in 1976. This may be the beginning of a new science—problemology.

THROUGHOUT HISTORY, few behaviors have been condemned more often and more soundly than hypocrisy. Almost 3,000 years ago, Homer wrote, "I detest that man, who hides one thing in the depths of his heart, and speaks forth another." In the sixth century B.C., Lao-tzu said, "To pretend to know when you do not know is a disease." In the fifth century B.C., Confucius said, "Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles," and "[The superior man] speaks according to his actions."
<p>

There seems to be little Jesus of Nazareth hated as much as hypocrisy; he condemned it more than anything else.
<P>

Jesus also claims that hypocrites "have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness" (Matthew 23:23). Peter advised, "Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind" (1 Peter 2:1).

In the fourteenth century, Geoffrey Chaucer called a hypocrite, "The smyler with the knife under the cloke." Shakespeare: "With devotion's visage and pious action we do sugar o'er the devil himself." Molire noticed an interesting consequence of hypocrisy, which is as true today as it was then: "Hypocrisy is a fashionable vice, and all fashionable vices pass for virtue."

One of the most perceptive observers of hypocrisy in our country, Mark Twain, was once told by a blustering tycoon, "Before I die, I mean to make a pilgrimage to the top of Mt. Sinai in the Holy Land and read the Ten Commandments aloud." "Why don't you stay right home in Boston," suggested Twain, "and keep them?"
<p>
<dd>
Which leads us to the problem observed by Andr Gide, "The true hypocrite is the one who ceases to perceive his deception, the one who lies with sincerity." People actually start to believe they are not being hypocritical; they say one thing and do another with impunity—with pride, in fact. They have told themselves so many rational lies about their deception, they deceive even themselves. Those who have lost track of their hypocrisy—especially those who begin to consider it virtuous—are the most dangerous hypocrites of all. Alas, when it comes to consensual crimes, they're the most prevalent form.

More than 500,000 deaths each year in the United States are related to cigarette smoking. According to the American Council on Science and Health, cigarette smoking is the #1 cause of preventable death in the United States. Four of the five leading causes of death are related to cigarette smoking. One in six deaths in this country, 87% of all lung cancer deaths, and 30% of all other cancer deaths are tobacco related. Cigarettes are the #1 cause of heart disease, and heart disease is the #1 cause of death in the United States. Out of 100 regular smokers in the United States, one will be murdered, two will die in traffic accidents, and 25 will be killed by tobacco use.

[*FN]  One of the most virulent supporters of consensual crime prosecution, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, is also one of the most outspoken supporters of the tobacco industry and the federal government's tobacco-grower subsidies.  This comes as no shock:  North Carolina is the #1 tobacco-producing state in the nation.  With towns such as Winston-Salem and Raleigh, who's surprised?  In fact, North Carolina produces nearly 40% of the tobacco grown in this country.  In his book about the tobacco industry, <I>Merchants of Death</I>, Larry C. White tells about a 1986 incident involving government subsidies to tobacco growers in which "it is only the taxpayers who are being shortchanged—for about $1 billion. . . . Jesse Helms is responsible for this boondoggle." Has anyone explained to Senator Helms how much more his state could make growing hemp?

Cigarettes are our country's most serious drug problem. Three thousand teenagers start smoking each day—more than 1,000,000 each year. "A teenager who smokes more than one cigarette," says Andrew Weil, M.D., "has only a 15% chance of remaining a nonsmoker." More than 50% of all smokers start before they are eighteen. According to the American Cancer Society, "The pharmacologic and behavioral processes that determine addiction [to tobacco] are similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine."

If you're wondering whether tobacco harms truly innocent victims, the answer is "Yes." More than 53,000 deaths each year are attributed to secondhand cigarette smoke—the smoke breathed by people near a smoker. A study of nonsmoking women whose husbands smoked a pack or more a day found that these women were twice as likely to develop lung cancer as women married to nonsmokers. Environmental tobacco smoke is the #3 preventable cause of death in the United States (just behind regular smoking and alcohol abuse).

"Well, she can leave the room when he smokes. She's still responsible," some might argue. All right. What about children? This from the American Cancer Society:

Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) poses additional health hazards for unborn and young children. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have increased risks of respiratory illnesses and infections, impaired development of lung function, and [a higher incidence of] middle ear infections. If a woman smokes while she's pregnant, her baby may be born with low birth weight, birth defects, chronic breathing difficulties and learning disabilities. Women who smoke a pack or more a day suffer about a 50% greater risk of infant mortality. Infants born to women who smoked during pregnancy are more likely to die from Sudden Infant Death syndrome.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, more than 9,000,000 children under the age of five are exposed daily to environmental tobacco smoke. People who justify enforcing laws against consensual activities because they may "set a bad example" for children need to look no further than this actual physical harm to which millions of parents expose their children—unborn and born—every day. (At least drug addicts don't keep giving their babies drugs after they're born.)

And then there's the cost. Cigarettes cost the economy $65 billion annually—to treat smoking-related diseases and in lost productivity. That's $2.17 per pack of cigarettes sold.
<p>
<dd>
Meanwhile, we are exporting death. Cigarette exports have increased 200% since 1985. (In the same period, exports to Japan have increased 700%.) The world wants to visit Marlboro Country. Have we bothered to warn them that Marlboro Country is Boot Hill? Worldwide, cigarettes kill 2,500,000 each year.

In addition to causing cancer, the cigarette industry itself is a cancer. Cigarettes are extremely profitable (drug dealing usually is). Cigarette companies take in about $28 billion in cigarette sales each year, and on that make a profit of more than $6 billion. That's a profit margin of 23%. Most companies are thrilled with a profit margin of 10%. (The national corporate average in 1991 was 6.9%.) Forbes magazine commented, "Only the Mint makes money more easily than cigarette companies." Ironically, it's because cigarettes are deadly that competition is low: other companies simply don't want to be involved in peddling death. (Addictions they don't mind; death, they do. Call them old-fashioned.) Six tobacco giants make practically every brand of cigarette sold in the United States. How do they avoid anti-trust or price-fixing proceedings? They simply argue that the more cigarettes cost, the better: fewer people will buy them; therefore, fewer people will smoke. As hypocrites often do, they play both sides of every coin—and they have a lot of coins. Once people are hooked, they're hooked, and they'll pay whatever is necessary for their next fix.
<P>
<dd>
With this money, the cigarette industry hides from the public the simple fact that tobacco is the most addictive substance known (more addictive than even heroin), and that cigarettes kill. Cigarette companies spend a fortune each year on advertising, and they use that clout to eliminate or soften media stories that might be hazardous to the health of the tobacco industry. In the past, only the media accepting cigarette advertisements were vulnerable to this pressure. Over the years, however, the cigarette companies have bought just about every wholesome brand in America.[*FN]  Now they can use their advertising clout to control almost all media—even television, where cigarette ads have been banned for years. When cigarette advertising was allowed on television, the cigarette companies put enormous pressure on all shows to include smoking as one of the "good guy" activities and eliminate smoking as a "bad guy" activity. In other words, they wanted the heroes to smoke and the villains to do something else—playing pool was okay, taking other drugs was fine, arrogantly driving expensive cars purchased with ill-gotten gains was terrific.

Gene Roddenberry told me that while he was creating Star Trek, the network (NBC) and the production company (Paramount) put enormous pressure on him to include cigarettes on the starship Enterprise. Roddenberry pointed out that, considering the health risks known about cigarettes even in 1966, no one would be smoking by stardate 1513.1 (circa A.D. 2264).
<p>
<dd>
The network and studio executives used both pressure and persuasion. They tried to get Roddenberry enthused about how cigarettes might look in the twenty-third century. Maybe they would be square instead of round; perhaps they would come in colors; perhaps cigarettes would light themselves! Roddenberry's creative juices were not stimulated. Finally, the executives gave him an ultimatum: either the starship Enterprise would officially be declared a Smoking Zone, or Roddenberry's other radical idea—to have a woman as an officer of the Enterprise crew—would be abandoned. The executives were clever in offering this choice: Roddenberry's wife was already cast to play the female officer. After quite a bit of soul-searching, Roddenberry came to the only conclusion he could: both cigarettes and his wife did not get an intergalactic boarding pass. The irony was that, in later years, when smoking was less fashionable, Paramount pointed with pride to Star Trek as one of the few shows in syndication that had none of those "distasteful" cigarettes.

The cigarette companies' control extends beyond elected officials and much of the media. In early 1984 (that ominous year), Greg Louganis, a former smoker, was asked by the American Cancer Society to be national chairman of its annual Great American Smokeout. Louganis was excited. He had smoked from junior high until he was twenty-three. One day he saw a twelve-year-old smoking, asked the boy why, and was told, "I want to be just like you!" Louganis stopped cold. He later said, "After I quit, I wanted to tell every twelve-year-old that I had quit." His story, told at the peak of his Olympic fame, could have inspired tens of thousands to quit smoking—or avoid starting in the first place. Alas, it was not to be.
<p>
<dd>
Louganis trained in California at the Mission Viejo pool. His coach, the best in the world, was employed by Mission Viejo. Philip Morris essentially owns the town of Mission Viejo. Philip Morris made it clear: if Louganis became chairman of the Great American Smokeout, he would lose his pool and his coach. Philip Morris also threatened to fire other Mission Viejo employees close to Louganis. Louganis had no choice. He declined the American Cancer Society's invitation, without comment. As Larry C. White pointed out in <I>The Merchants of Death</I>, "The threat of Louganis's being sent away from Mission Viejo, away from his coach, was the sports world's equivalent of saying, `I'll kill your mother.'" The California Department of Health said it best: "Smokers are addicts. Cigarette companies are pushers."

Is all this an argument for banning cigarettes? No. It's education, not prohibition, that makes constructive change.

This chapter is meant to show that we have a deeply ingrained hypocrisy in our culture. It allows cigarette companies to knowingly kill 500,000 people each year and make a profit on it, while we insist that our government arrest consensual "criminals" whose harm, either to themselves or to others, if combined, doesn't even begin to approach the damage done by cigarettes.

In terms of addiction, prescription and over-the-counter drugs run a close second (some say, first) to cigarettes. Tens of millions of Americans can't get through the day without (that is, they are addicted to) tranquilizers or amphetamines, or can't make it through the night without sleeping pills. Each year 125,000 deaths are linked to prescription drugs. In 1989, Tom Kelly, then–Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, said on C-SPAN,

I think it's very obvious that, on the legitimate side of drug use, we have become a totally drug dependent society in this country. That's strictly on the legitimate side. That's what we teach our children in this country today. How bad is it? . . . We have about 30 million people who are regular users of stimulants. We have approximately 20 million who are regular users of sedatives. And we have about 8 million who are chronic users of tranquilizers. And that's all on the legitimate side. Thinking of those numbers, are we not drug-dependent on the legitimate side?

The most widely used recreational drug in this country is, of course, alcohol. A 1990 study by the U.S. Department of Health asked participants which drugs they had used in the past thirty days. It was found that 51% had used alcohol, while only 5% had used marijuana, and less than 1% had used cocaine. A 1991 U.S. Department of Health study asked young people, ages eighteen to thirty, the same question. Almost 71% had used alcohol within the past thirty days; 28% had used cigarettes; 13% had used marijuana; 2% had used cocaine; less than 2% had used stimulants; about 1% had used tranquilizers; and less than 1% had used LSD, inhalants, and steroids. None of the study participants had used heroin and only 0.5% had used other opiates. Of high school students, 2% said they currently used cocaine, 14% said they currently used marijuana, while 59% said they currently used alcohol. (Of high school seniors, 28% smoked cigarettes.)

Alcohol is also the recreational drug most likely to be abused: 43% of college students, 35% of high school seniors, and 26% of eighth grade students (thirteen-year-olds!) said that they had had five or more drinks in a row at some point during the last two weeks. In 1990, more than half of the fatal car accidents in this country were related to alcohol, killing 22,083 people.[*FN]  This is the equivalent of a fully loaded 747 crashing. Three times a week. Every week. An additional 469,000 nonfatal car crashes involved alcohol. Half of all teenage fatalities are alcohol-related. In a confidential survey of high school seniors who had received a traffic ticket in the last twelve months, 10% of them admitted being under the influence of alcohol at the time they received the ticket. Only 3% were under the influence of marijuana or hashish, and 1% under the influence of any other drugs. More than 11 million Americans have witnessed a family member killed or seriously injured by a drunk driver in the last nine years. Society's loss in wages, productivity, medical and legal costs caused by death and injuries in drunk-driving crashes exceeds $24 billion each year. On an average Friday or Saturday night, one of every ten drivers on the road is drunk. In 1991, 13% of all male arrests were for drunk driving.

[*FN]  The old saying, "Statistics don't lie, but liars use statistics" describes perfectly the people and organizations trying to overestimate the "drug problem." I have seen this figure of 22,083 listed as "drug and alcohol-related traffic fatalities." They were, almost entirely, alcohol-related. Another of my favorites is the statistic officially labeled, "Drug Abuse–Related Emergency Room Episodes." It says that 371,208 people were admitted to emergency rooms in 1990 for drug abuse–related reasons. I have seen this figure bandied about as proof that drugs are not safe, and are a horrendous problem ("Almost 400,000 people wind up in emergency rooms every year due to the drug epidemic!"). Further examination, however, shows that 172,815 of the cases—46%—were attempted suicides. To call attempted suicide "drug abuse–related" is absurd. Drugs were the method, not the problem. Just because 1,000 people commit suicide by jumping off tall buildings, does not make tall buildings dangerous. Only 29,817 of the 371,208 total emergency room episodes resulted from "recreational use" of drugs (only 8% of the total) and 74% of those patients were treated and released without being admitted to the hospital. (The figure 29,817 certainly indicates a problem, but compare it with the 500,000 smoking deaths. There are approximately 6,000 "illicit"-drug-related deaths each year—1.2% of the tobacco deaths.)

Alcohol is involved in 80% of fire deaths, 77% of falls, 65% of drownings, 65% of murders, 60% of child abuse cases, 35% of rapes, and 55% of all arrests. According to a 1992 study by the National Center for Health Statistics, "10,500,000 Americans are alcoholics; 76,000,000 more are affected by alcohol abuse, having been married to an alcoholic or problem drinker or having grown up with one."

Is this a call for a new Prohibition? No. As with cigarettes, the key to helping people from hurting themselves is education. There is, however, a great deal more we could do to protect nonconsenting victims of alcohol abuse—such as sober drivers and pedestrians. (Please see the chapter, "Protective Technology.")

There are only two possible actions we, as a nation, can take to remove this deeply ingrained hypocrisy: ban cigarettes, alcohol, and caffeine, then have all drugs—including those currently sold over-the-counter—require a prescription from at least two doctors. Or we can repeal the laws against currently illegal consensual activities. We can no longer afford to maintain the pretense that we really care whether or not people harm their own person and property. If we really cared and if prohibition worked (two of the larger if's in the known cosmos), we'd outlaw all legal evils.

Does removing laws against consensual activities make us an uncaring nation? Not at all.

If we accept this mature stance, then we must legalize all consensual activities. Or continue being hypocrites.

IN ORDER TO MAKE intelligent choices, we must have accurate information about the potential consequences of our choices. Learning about those potential consequences—how to maximize the positive ones and how to minimize the negative ones—is the essence of education. True education is not deciding what is right or wrong and then convincing the student of the wisdom of the decision. That's propaganda. True education says, "Here are the possible rewards; here are the potential risks; here's how to maximize the rewards and minimize the risks; you make the choice."
<p>
<dd>
Nowhere do we need true education more than in the area of consensual crimes: it seems as though all we've had for the longest time is propaganda—both negative and positive. Society teaches us that committing consensual crimes is always bad, wrong, dangerous, and deadly. The indulgers, on the other hand, teach that society is entirely wrong, that there are no risks, no dangers, no down sides. Neither of these polarized points is valid; neither is true education.
<p>
<dd>
Much of what passes for drug education, for example, is not education at all, but simply scare tactics; terrors for children. The idea (as one popular billboard depicts) that snorting cocaine is the same as sticking a pistol in your nose and pulling the trigger is absurd. One famous television commercial shows an egg being dropped into a frying pan heated to at least 3,000 degrees; as the egg fries and burns, a voice-over says, "This is your brain. This is your brain on drugs." Come on. This is not only untrue and misleading; it's a waste of good food.

All this propaganda is as transparently silly as the supposed documentary films from the '30s: Sex Madness, Cocaine Madness, and the ever-popular Reefer Madness. In these films, ordinary, healthy (but, one must admit, terribly boring), young men and women are driven insane by, respectively, sex, cocaine, and marijuana.

One television commercial sponsored by the Partnership for a Drug Free America shows a wholesome young ghetto child having to jump over fences, run down alleys, and hide behind trees in order to make the journey from school to home without being caught by the drug dealers and forced to take drugs.
<p>
<dd>
Another shows photographs of Janice Joplin, John Belushi, and River Phoenix. The announcer pipes in: "We were told celebrity endorsements help sell things." Then the title "Partnership for a Drug-Free America" flashes on the screen. This is an especially irritating commercial because if drugs weren't illegal, these people would not have died of accidental overdoses.
<p>
<dd>
This modern-day misinformation can cause a person to conclude about all education efforts, "I know what they're saying about this is wrong; therefore everything they say is wrong."

<dd>
A government that lies to its people divides itself: some people believe everything they're told and others believe nothing they're told. Both attitudes are dangerous to the health and well-being of a nation. The misinfomercials from the Partnership for a Drug Free America only show those already ignorant of drug use how right their righteous position is, while further alienating those who know that eggs in frying pans and children hiding behind trees have nothing to do with drugs.

Who pays for all this propaganda? Who finances the Partnership for a Drug Free America? Some of its contributors could be said to have vested interests in not making additional drugs legal.

Two 1967 Dragnet episodes are a perfect example. (These weren't the gritty film noir episodes of the 1950s, but the technicolor episodes of the '60s. Film noir was better.)

In one episode, Detective Sergeant Joe Friday takes a night-school class in "sensitivity training." No one in the class knows he's a cop. One of the participants admits to having taken drugs. Friday thinks he sees marijuana in the man's notebook. He arrests his classmate. The man is sent up the river. Meanwhile, the teacher of the class is outraged. People were encouraged to open up, to share, to be vulnerable and honest, and along comes an unannounced policeman who arrests a class member for doing just that. The professor wants to throw Friday out of the class. Friday asks for the class to decide: he'll give his point of view, and then they can vote. What follows is an impassioned speech (well, as impassioned as Jack Webb could get) about the dreadful things that he, as a Los Angeles cop, has seen drugs do to people. The speech goes on and on, one horror story after another. The class, initially hostile, sees the light, and votes to let Friday stay. If this were high school, they probably would have elected him class president.

An even more amazing Dragnet episode tackled another drug. A young man has his head stuck in the sand, one side of his face painted blue, the other side painted yellow. He is carrying a pocketful of sugar cubes. He is babbling about seeing the "pilot light" at the center of the earth and then believes he is becoming a tree. Guess what drug he is on? Based on the cubes in his pocket, it is either a sugar rush or LSD.
<p>
<dd>
Yes, the scientist in the lab confirms it is LSD. The scientist in the lab seems to know a great deal about LSD, although his specialty is forensics. (According to Dragnet, there is precisely one scientist in the entire Los Angeles Police Department. He was played by the same actor, week after week.[*FN]  This scientist could answer every question, from "What kind of gun could make a hole that size in a man?" to "We found this goldfish on the floor of the victim's apartment. Can you check it for fingerprints?")

The scientist, as it turns out, doesn't know that much about LSD after all. Although he looks very authoritative in his white science-coat and is surrounded by the paraphernalia of scientific investigation, not one of the "facts" he reveals in his five-minute lecture on the horrors of LSD is known to medical science. Although we, the audience, now know LSD is a Truly Bad Thing, the boy cannot be arrested: alas, there is no law against LSD. "I sure hope they give you boys something to fight with out there real soon," the scientist says. Friday nods grimly.

The boy is now back to his normal self. He wipes the blue and yellow greasepaint off with his mother's handkerchief. His parents want to take him home. Not so fast: Friday wants to book 'em. "I happen to know there is no law against LSD," says the father. Friday looks frantically at his captain with a look that says, "I want to book him. I already said, `I want to book him.' Please, help me find some way to book him!" The captain, an old hand at all this, says, "Book him on a 601." While the boy is taken to juvenile hall, Friday's voice-over explains a 601. It has something to do with suspicion of intent to commit conspiracy to corrupt your own morals in a way that is particularly disagreeable to Los Angeles police sergeants.
<p>
<dd>
When the boy is released from juvenile hall, he commits the worst sin in Joe Friday's book: disrespect for Joe Friday. The boy has the nerve to call Friday "Sherlock." From his look, it's obvious that Friday doesn't know what the boy is talking about, but Friday knows it's not good.
<p>
<dd>
Meanwhile, two teenaged girls are at police headquarters. They apparently spent the day "tripping." One of them describes how she watched Los Angeles melt; either that, or she stumbled into a movie theater showing The House of Wax. The girls show us what it's like to "come down" from an LSD trip. It looks like a combination of nausea and bad menstrual cramps. Not at all appealing. Oh, by the way, they purchased their LSD from the boy.

Six months pass. The captain comes in and hands Joe Friday a booklet. It is a new law declaring LSD a "dangerous substance." Joe Friday is like a kid at Christmas. The captain is Santa Claus. "When does this law go into effect?" Friday asks, eyes ablaze. "Forty-eight hours," the captain tells him. These men are high, truly high. They've just gotten a fix of the drug they love most: control. Forty-eight hours. Just enough time to roll out the (dum-da-dum-dum) dragnet.
<p>
<dd>
In search of the boy, they visit an LSD party. It looks something like Laugh In's cocktail party, but much slower and without jokes. Friday calls some uniformed police. They arrive within thirty seconds. (Ah, the good old days.) Everyone at the party is arrested. Talk about a bad trip. The boy, unfortunately, is not there. Fortunately, however, a pharmacy calls in: they have just sold 1,000 empty gelatin capsules to a young man fitting the description of the boy. (What happened to his sugar-cube method of distribution? And here Friday has been asking supermarket managers all over Los Angeles to report excessive sugar cube purchases.) Friday goes to the pharmacy. Yes, after being shown mug shots, the pharmacist (who has precisely one shelf with about twelve bottles of pills on it) gives Friday the address of where the capsules were delivered. (Which means the boy came in, ordered 1,000 empty gelatin capsules, which must weigh about five ounces, and then said, "Here, deliver these." Yes, this boy was clearly on drugs—or the scriptwriter was.)

The landlady happily provides Detective Friday with a passkey. Friday enters (apparently having no use for that seven-letter four-letter word: warrant) and finds a friend of the boy, who says of the boy, "He kept taking more and more pills.

Dragnet was famous, of course, for Joe Friday's sardonic and ironic comment just before the final dum-da-dum-dum. In keeping with that tradition, here is my sardonic and ironic comment: Detective Sergeant Joe Friday stoically acknowledged defeat and celebrated victory in precisely the same way. He lit a cigarette. According to the American Heart Association, cigarette smoking is the #1 cause of heart disease. Jack Webb, a life-long smoker, died of a heart attack on December 23, 1982.

A hipper, trendier show for the hipper, trendier '80s was Miami Vice. It was so cool to catch drug dealers.

Yes, it was cool to put the bad guys away, but never forget the most essential American lesson: There is nothing cooler than money.

Films such as The Gene Krupa Story perpetuated the myth that, if you even tried marijuana, within six months you would be hopelessly addicted to heroin, which, as everyone knew, meant an agonizing death in the gutter three months later—but only after pulling everything and everyone you ever loved into the gutter with you.

Cigarettes are readily available, seductively advertised, and you may even be offered one from time to time, and yet, the vast majority of the American public simply chooses to say no. Only the most unbalanced person would respond to the friendly offer of a cigarette with, "What? Are you trying to get me hooked? Are you a recruiting agent for one of the tobacco companies? You should be put in jail!" The answer is simply: "No, thank you," and people go about their business.
<p>
<dd>
Cigarette consumption has dropped dramatically in this country during the past two decades, and it's not due to government restrictions or prohibitions. The kingpins of the tobacco industry were not rounded up. A tobacco czar was not appointed to arrest and prosecute all the tobacco lords. A person caught selling a cigarette to another did not have his or her home confiscated and was not sent to jail for tobacco trafficking. Habitual cigarette users ("nickies") were sentenced neither to jail nor to mandatory rehabilitation programs.
<p>
<dd>
No. Cigarette consumption in this country has dropped thanks to one thing: education.
<p>
<dd>
Education has caused people to think of cigarettes as hazardous, not glamorous. The federal government played only a small part in this educational process (in the person of former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. Dr. Koop was to cigarettes what Ralph Nader was to Corvairs). The educators were, for the most part, nonprofit organizations funded by voluntary donations—the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, the American Heart Association, and several others. Their factual information was picked up by the media, and the attitude of an entire nation changed in a short time.

AND NOW I TURN MY criticism to my own profession, journalism. I consider myself a journalist who happens to write chapters more often than articles. Alas, I am afraid that my media colleagues have been guilty of reporting the party line on consensual crimes rather than investigating and revealing the facts. Nowhere is this more evident than in covering the war on drugs.
<p>
<dd>
To win the war for personal freedoms, however, we must hold the media to its task: to discover and report the facts accurately. To these ends, I have occasionally dropped a line to my fellow scribblers—with no perceivable results whatsoever. Nonetheless, I press on.
<p>
<dd>
Here, for example, is a letter I spent moments slaving over which the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> failed to acknowledge, much less print. It pretty much sums up what I think the media must do to free itself from the inaccuracies perpetrated by the drug war propaganda machine.
<p>

November 15, 1993
<p>

Dear Editor:
<p>
<dd>
Your headline of 11–13–93, "PHOENIX: Drugs Killed Actor, 23," was as misleading as, say, a report of James Dean's death headlined: "DEAN: Porsche Killed Actor, 24." Both brilliant actors died in unfortunate accidents.
<p>
<dd>
But River Phoenix was killed not by drugs, but by the fact that <I>drugs are illegal</I>. When the government gets on its moral high horse and declares something completely prohibited, the government turns all control over to unregulated manufacturers, possibly disreputable distributors, and organized crime. The purity and strength of the banned substance cannot be monitored. The consumer has no protection. Prohibition returns us to the law of the jungle.

According to the DEA, the white powder sold on the streets as "heroin" can be anywhere from 32% to 90% pure heroin. The other famous white powder, cocaine, has a similar potency range. That's quite a range, a deadly range, the range which caused the deaths of River Phoenix, John Belushi, and more than 50,000 other Americans since the war on drugs was declared in 1982. If heroin and cocaine were legal, their potency would be clearly labeled, and most of these people would still be alive.
<p>
<dd>
Let's face it: the war on drugs is over. This year, the federal government admitted that the war has achieved nothing. In the past eleven years, after spending more than three hundred billion dollars; diverting unknown trillions of dollars into international organized crime; arresting more than ten million Americans; overburdening police, courts, and prisons; alienating minorities; creating a rise in crime and a disrespect for the law unseen since Prohibition; the availability, street price, and use of prohibited drugs remains virtually unchanged.
<p>
<dd>
More than fifty federal judges refuse to hear drug cases. There are more people in federal prisons today for drug charges than the total federal prison population in 1982. The Drug Czar, Attorney General Reno, and knowledgeable observers in and out of government state frankly that what we're doing isn't working.
<p>
<dd>
It will be a long time before the war on drugs—like its parallel atrocity, the Vietnam War—will be officially declared over. (We Americans so dislike admitting defeat, and bureaucracies absolutely abhor being dismantled.) The least we can do as journalists, however, is put an end to the wartime rhetoric. In war, the first casualty is truth. Truth, accuracy, balance, fairness, and all the other qualities we worship in our "freedom of the press" were abandoned by the mainstream media as soon as the war began.

The Artillery of the Press
<p>
<dd>
Here are my suggestions for eliminating the now-obsolete wartime propaganda from our nation's media:
<p>
<dd>
1.  <B>Stop using phrases such as "drugs kill."</B> To paraphrase the NRA: Drugs don't kill people; people kill themselves with drugs. To perpetuate the myth that "people are powerless over drugs" only adds to the level of personal irresponsibility that has already grown to fatal proportions in this country.
<p>
<dd>
2.  <B>Stop pretending that illegal drugs do more harm than legal ones.</B> More than 500,000 Americans die prematurely each year due to cigarette smoking and more than 200,000 from alcohol abuse. Meanwhile, all the illegal drugs combined cause approximately 6,000 deaths (mostly accidental overdoes due to the unknown strength and purity of prohibited substances). Growing marijuana—which in 10,000 years of recorded human use has never caused one death—can get you a life sentence without possibility of parole. Growing tobacco can get you a government subsidy.
<p>
<dd>
3.  <B>Stop calling recreational drugs "dangerous."</B> There are no "bad" drugs; there are only bad relationships with drugs. It is the relationship the human being forms with a drug that makes the drug harmful, harmless, or beneficial. The same drug can be good for one person and bad for another, based on the relationship each has established with that drug. Yes, some drugs (generally the ones that are physically addictive) are easier to form bad relationships with than others. Reporting this is both legitimate and necessary. By these standards, the most "dangerous" (physically addictive) recreational drugs are morphine (often consumed as heroin) and cigarettes.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<dd>
4.  <B>Stop referring to recreational drugs as "poison."</B> That's only true about always-lethal substances, which, for the most part, are perfectly legal. For example, no one uses Drano recreationally (although a few desperate people do use Lysol, heaven help them). Drano is so consistently deadly that the only law controlling its sale says it must be labeled "poison." There are no reports of a "Drano problem." Drano smuggling is, I would wager (if wagering weren't illegal), not rampant. Airports have no Drano-sniffing dogs. An Omnibus Drano Bill was never proposed to Congress. "DEA" does not stand for "Drano Enforcement Agency."
<p>
<dd>
5.  <B>Stop perpetuating the myth that "the only way to use drugs safely is not to use them at all."</B> Instead, give the rules for using the drugs with maximum safety. For example, your 11-3-93 article implicating GHB in the death of River Phoenix ("Designer Drug Enters Hollywood's Fast Lane") never told the simple rules for using GHB safely (or as safely as one can use any drug—legal or illegal). The primary rule: never take GHB with any other drug. When people take more than a proper dose of GHB, they fall asleep. If GHB is consumed in higher levels, the person vomits. As long as GHB is not interacting with another drug, not taken with a drug that suppresses nausea, and used in moderation, GHB is relatively harmless. In fact, your article on 11-13-93 stated that the coroner's final report listed an overdose of morphine (probably ingested as heroin) and cocaine as the cause of Phoenix's death. Although you are careful to point out, "No alcohol was detected," you fail to mention that no GHB was detected, either. Why not correct your earlier indictment of GHB—and apologize for any inaccurate or exaggerated reporting? If drugs had lawyers and PR agencies, the nation's press would be heavy with retractions and lawsuits.

All of this comes down to the simple idea: tell us the truth about drugs. Almost anything can be harmful if abused. Tell us what causes abuse and how to avoid it. Educate us as to the possible negative reactions when using a drug, what percentage of users experience these reactions, and what to do if one happens. Children are taught early the potential dangers of and safe use of knives, matches, and yes, even Drano. Please show your readers at least as much respect and have as much confidence in us as parents show their children.

TECHNOLOGY  HAS moved ahead at a rapid pace. At the turn of the century, the consensus in the medical community was that the human body could not withstand traveling at the inconceivable rate of a mile a minute. Today, even though many of us travel daily at speeds once considered humanly impossible, the technology for devices to prevent these mile-a-minute missiles (automobiles) from being operated by incapable drivers is no further along than it was when the first carriage moved without a horse in 1885.
<p>
<dd>
In that same year, 1885, mass communication consisted of newspapers, phonograph cylinders, and illustrated monthlies. Our view of the world came from paintings, etchings, and stereopticon slides. Communication took place by letter or the quaint old custom of visiting people and talking with them. In an emergency, one could send a telegram (by going to a Western Union office), and a handful of people had telephones. The business world gravitated around the ticker tape, and the carrier pigeon was still in use. That was about it.
<p>
<dd>
Today we have radios, telephones, VCRs, computers, mobile telephones, fax machines, movies, televisions (with hundreds of cable channels), Walkmen, boomboxes, home stereos, car stereos, the Internet, as well as all the other communication devices of the earlier days. And yet, those who don't want to be exposed, or their children to be exposed, to certain material must rely on minor variations of the censorship practiced in Victorian times.

It's time technology better served the nonconsenting.
<P>
<dd>
It's hard to imagine the kind of damage a 3,000-pound metal and glass object traveling a mile a minute can do. Hard, that is, until you see a traffic accident. Then we look and look away at the same time. We like to think that degree of devastation is a fluke of nature. (It's not.) We like to think it won't happen to us. (You have a two percent chance of dying in a traffic accident.) Most of these accidents are caused by a driver's <I>not being capable of operating a motor vehicle at the time of the crash</I>.
<p>
<dd>
At the risk of stating the obvious, people who are not capable of operating a motor vehicle—for whatever reason—have no business operating it; not because they may harm themselves, but because there is a very good chance they may harm nonconsenting others. Of this country's 44,000 annual traffic deaths, 22,000 are alcohol related. Of the 22,000 that are not alcohol related, a good many happen because the drivers are too stoned (on drugs other than alcohol), emotionally upset, physically impaired, senile, exhausted, or in some way physically, mentally, or emotionally incapable of driving.
<p>
<dd>
A simple device, installed in each car, could prevent the majority of deaths caused by these impairments.
<p>
<dd>
Let's call this device, for lack of a better name, the "Tester." Imagine a panel on the dashboard with a numeric keypad, like those on touch-tone telephones. Above the keypad is a screen to display numbers and brief messages. There is also a slot, about the size of a credit card. The Tester works like this:
<p>
<dd>
When you want to use the car, first insert your driver's license, which would act and look like a credit card. The Tester reads your driver's license as an automated teller machine reads your credit card, and then asks for your four-digit personal identification number (PIN), much as a teller machine would. Your PIN is known only to you, but is encoded in your license. After your four-digit personal identification number is successfully given, the screen displays seven random numbers—the number of digits in a phone number. You must then, within a certain period of time and with a certain degree of accuracy, enter those numbers on the keypad. Once you complete this procedure, which should take less than a minute, the car is ready to operate normally.

That extra minute will keep a good many unlicensed and incapable drivers off the road.
<p>
<dd>
Driving is not an inalienable right. We must meet certain standards of knowledge, ability, and competence before we receive a license to drive. A great many car accidents are caused by people whose licenses have been revoked or suspended, or people who don't have licenses at all. Without a license, people have no business—and certainly no right—to drive a car. If, potentially, they could only hurt themselves, they would have the right. (They can drive around on their own property, for example, all they want.) The potential for hurting innocent others, however, moves driving into the realm of licensing. Hang gliding, for example, should require no license. The chances of harming anyone but yourself are extremely slim. On the other hand, the chances of an incompetent person hurting someone with a car are very high.
<p>
<dd>
The Tester assures that only licensed drivers are using automobiles. Your PIN means that your license can't be used if it's stolen. Because it's encoded in your driver's license, however, the PIN works in any car. Yes, sophisticated license thieves will have machinery to read PINs, but the average would-be license-and-car thief would find the lack of a PIN a sufficient deterrent.

The Tester can be programmed so that each car will accept only certain licenses. This deters theft and keeps unauthorized family members from "accidentally" using the wrong car. Or, a car can accept any license except those specifically excluded (very handy in recent divorces).
<p>
<dd>
After one has been authorized by the state (through licensing) and by the owner of the car (who has selected which licenses can and cannot operate the car), the randomly generated seven-digit number appears. If one cannot see, read, comprehend, or summon the hand-eye coordination necessary to enter seven randomly generated digits into a keypad within a certain period of time, that person has no right (based on his or her demonstrated lack of ability) to operate a motor vehicle.
<p>
<dd>
If one fails to accurately enter the number, a new number is generated. If the second attempt is not successful, the person gets one more try, and a third randomly generated number appears. As with baseball, three strikes and you're out—at least for the inning. The Tester then displays the message, "TRY AGAIN IN 15 MINUTES," and then keeps track of the time ("TRY AGAIN IN 14 MINUTES," "TRY AGAIN IN 13 MINUTES,"  and so on). During this mandatory waiting period, one can chill out, warm up, breathe deeply, or do whatever one must do to meet the minimum mental and physical standards for operating an automobile. After a driver fails three consecutive tests (nine times in a row failing to enter a seven-digit number correctly), the Tester shuts the car down for two hours and suggests, "CALL A CAB." (The Tester would, however, allow a different license to be entered and the car to be driven by a competent driver.)
<p>
<dd>
The Tester controls the link between the engine and the transmission. The car cannot be put in gear unless the Tester signals its okay. This allows you to start the car and use the heater, air conditioner, radio, tape player, telephone, or any car function other than moving it.

There is, of course, an emergency button, which overrides the Tester entirely and allows one to start the car and drive it immediately. Pushing the emergency button, however, automatically activates the emergency flashers and beeps the horn once every two seconds. This alerts law enforcement officers that you need aid, and they will be happy to supply it. It also alerts other motorists on the road that you have an emergency and, perhaps, they might want to get out of your way.

As with all fail-safe devices, this one has built-in drawbacks, the primary one being that someone else can enter the code for an inebriated, stoned, or otherwise incompetent friend. Yes, this could be made illegal. But, again, the solution lies in education and creating the cultural belief that overriding the fail-safe system for another is neither an act of kindness, friendship, or love. In fact, it could be seen as an act of indifference and dismissal. A true friend would offer a ride, call a cab, or walk the person around the block a few times.

No, this system will not get every incompetent driver off the road.[*FN] It's designed to keep some of the most blatant offenders off the road. We must handle the problem of incompetent drivers at its source: not banning the alcohol or drugs that contribute to the incompetency, but stopping the problem at the point it becomes a problem—when an incapable driver gets behind a steering wheel.

Just to show you how quickly technological changes can take place (an idea whose time has come and all that), in the original hardcover edition of Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do,</I> in a chapter called "Fail-Safe Safety Devices," I proposed something called the Sensor, which would monitor television broadcasts and eliminate those aspects selected as objectionable by the viewer. This was in late 1993. Of all the people I talked to, only one of them had ever heard of such a thing. Most people thought it was a fine idea that had a snowball's chance in a sauna.
<p>
<dd>
Less than three years later, however, the V-Chip is law, all signed, sealed, and legal-like. Astonishingly, it was the broadcasters (short-sighted little money grubbers) who put up the biggest stink. Yes, it may make a little more bureaucratic work to encode all those programs, but what broadcasters gain in exchange is freedom. Don't they remember how the multiple ratings system in the movies (rather than the Hayes Office "approved" or "not approved") gave freedom to the motion picture industry? Both Disney and Deep Throat thrived. Now the same can happen with broadcast television.
<p>
<dd>
There's no reason the Tester shouldn't be installed at once in the cars of each person caught driving under the influence (at the guilty party's expense, of course), and mandated for all new cars within a year. (Cost per new car? Maybe ten bucks.) Traffic accidents and deaths should go down by 50%. And please keep in mind such a device is not to protect the incapacitated driver, but the rest of us.

The ideas behind these fail-safe devices are just an indication of what technology can do to make everyone physically safer—and free people from being exposed to some of the objectionable aspects of other people's freedom. The possibility for using technology—rather than unenforceable, unworkable, unjust laws—to regulate potentially harmful behavior is vast and largely untapped.

YOU MAY FIND THE information in this chapter astonishing, unlikely, fascinating, unbelievable, amazing, and too good to be true. That, at least, was my first reaction.

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
The reasons the pro-marijuana lobby wants marijuana legal have little to do with getting high, and a great deal to do with fighting oil giants like Saddam Hussein, Exxon and Iran. The pro-marijuana groups claim that hemp is such a versatile raw material that its products not only compete with petroleum, but with coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, pharmaceutical, timber and textile companies. It is estimated that methane and methanol production alone from hemp grown as bio-mass could replace 90% of the world's energy needs. If they're right, this is not good news for oil interests, and could account for the continuation of marijuana prohibition.

As we explored, marijuana is the hemp plant (Cannabis sativa), and was one of the primary agricultural products in this country for more than 250 years. We saw how the DuPont Corporation and William Randolph Hearst, working with Federal Bureau of Narcotics Director Harry Anslinger, succeeded in having marijuana prohibited nationally in 1937. On his ABC Radio broadcast, Hugh Downs explored possible reasons why marijuana is still illegal today:
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
When Rudolph Diesel produced his famous engine in 1896, he assumed that the diesel engine would be powered by a variety of fuels, especially vegetable and seed oils. Rudolph Diesel, like most engineers then, believed vegetable fuels were superior to petroleum. Hemp is the most efficient vegetable.
<p>
In the 1930s, the Ford Motor Company also saw a future in biomass fuels. Ford operated a successful biomass conversion plant that included hemp at their Iron Mountain facility in Michigan. Ford engineers extracted methanol, charcoal fuel, tar, pitch, ethyl acetate, and creosote—all fundamental ingredients for modern industry, and now supplied by oil-related industries.
<p>
The difference is that the vegetable source is renewable, cheap and clean, and the petroleum or coal sources are limited, expensive and dirty. By volume, 30% of the hemp seed contains oil suitable for high-grade diesel fuel, as well as aircraft engine and precision machine oil. Henry Ford's experiments with methanol promised cheap, readily-renewable fuel. And, if you think methanol means compromise, you should know that many modern race cars run on methanol.

Jack Herer's book, The Emperor Wears No Clothes, is the bible on industrial uses for marijuana. The subtitle of the book is The Authoritative Historical Record of the Cannabis Plant, Marijuana Prohibition, and How Hemp Can Still Save the World. This is an ambitious subtitle—especially for a book that looks more like the Whole Earth Catalog than a scholarly tome. For the most part, however, Herer succeeds. He may become a little too enthusiastic about the industrial uses of hemp at times, but even if 10% of his information is accurate (and certainly more than that is), marijuana could prove a major boon to the economy, the environment, and humanity.

In addition to oil and fuel, here are some of the industrial uses for the hemp plant:
<p>

<ul>
<LI><B>Paper</B>. Whereas trees—currently our primary source of paper—take twenty years to grow, hemp reaches full maturity in a single growing season. Warm climates can produce three hemp harvests per year. This makes hemp a far more efficient plant for producing paper than trees. In addition, making paper from hemp—unlike wood pulp—doesn't require acid, so all hemp paper is "acid free," thus lasting for hundreds of years. Hemp could supply virtually all of our paper, cardboard, and other packaging needs. (Half the paper used in America is for packaging.) And if you're wondering why books, newspapers, and magazines are costing more and more, it's probably because the worldwide shortage of pulp caused paper prices to double in 1995.
<p>
<LI><B>Textiles and Fabrics</B>. The hemp fiber is very similar to flax—in fact, much of the linen produced prior to the 1930s (including fine Irish linen) was made from hemp, not flax. The hemp plant, then, is an excellent source for textiles. Prior to the invention of the cotton gin, most clothing in the United States was made from the hemp plant. The hemp fiber is stronger, softer, warmer, and more durable than cotton.

<LI><B>Food</B>. The hemp seed is an excellent source of protein. It can be ground, baked into breads, sprouted, and turned into a tofu-like food. In addition, hemp seed makes an excellent oil similar to flaxseed oil. You cannot "get high" eating marijuana seeds or their oil. ("Hash oil," which is highly intoxicating, does not come from the seeds.)
<p>
<LI><B>Medicine</B>. Marijuana (yes, the part that gets you high) is the best medicine for reducing nausea in people being treated with chemotherapy or other medications.[*FN]  Marijuana is also an excellent treatment for glaucoma, which is responsible for 14% of all blindness in America and affects 2.5 million people.[**FN]  Marijuana has also been proven effective in treating asthma, epilepsy, MS, back pain and muscle spasms, arthritis, cystic fibrosis, rheumatism, emphysema, migraines, in reducing tumors, and—as should come as no surprise to anyone who has ever smoked marijuana—in enhancing one's appetite. And yet, as of early 1996, precisely eight people in the United States can legally use marijuana as medicine.
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
[*FN]  Some states allow the psychoactive chemical, THC, to be sold in pill form as a treatment for nausea.  These states, however, do not allow the smokeable form of marijuana to be sold, even to cancer or AIDS patients.  The absurdity of this is immediately evident:  if one is nauseated, he or she would be unable to keep down the pill form of THC long enough for it to be absorbed into the system.  The smokeable form of marijuana, however, acts much more quickly than the pill form and can be inhaled—even on an upset stomach.

[**FN]  Some doctors hint strongly that glaucoma patients obtain marijuana illicitly to use in their glaucoma treatment.

HEMPstead, Long Island; HEMPstead County, Arkansas; HEMPstead, Texas; HEMPhill, North Carolina; HEMPfield, Pennsylvania; among others, were named after cannabis growing regions, or after family names derived from hemp growing.
<p>
Cannabis hemp was legal tender (money) in most of the Americas from 1631 until the early 1800s. You could pay your taxes with cannabis hemp throughout America for over 200 years.
<p>
You could even be jailed in America for not growing cannabis during several periods of shortage, e.g., in Virginia between 1763 and 1767.
<p>
George Washington and Thomas Jefferson grew cannabis on their plantations. Jefferson, while envoy to France, went to great expense—and considerable risk to himself and his secret agents—to procure particularly good hemp seeds smuggled illegally into Turkey from China. The Chinese Mandarins (political rulers) so valued their hemp seeds that they made their exportation a capital offense.

Benjamin Franklin started one of America's first paper mills with cannabis. This allowed America to have a free colonial press without having to beg or justify paper and books from England.
<p>
The United States Census of 1850 counted 8,327 hemp "plantations" (minimum 2,000 acre farms) growing cannabis hemp for cloth, canvas and even the cordage used for baling cotton. (This figure does not include the tens of thousands of smaller farms growing cannabis, nor the hundreds of thousands—if not millions—of family hemp patches in America.)
<p>
In 1942, after the Japanese invasion of the Philippines cut off the supply of manila (Abaca) hemp, the U.S. government distributed 400,000 pounds of cannabis seeds to American farmers from Wisconsin to Kentucky, who produced 42,000 tons of hemp fiber annually for the war effort until 1946. In 1942–43 farmers were made to attend showings of the USDA film Hemp for Victory, sign that they had seen the film and read a hemp cultivation booklet. Farmers from 1942 through 1945 who agreed to grow hemp were waived from serving in the military, along with their sons; that's how vitally important hemp was to America during World War II.

One of the most beneficial aspects of using hemp (or other plants) for fuel is that, as plants grow, the plants take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and replace it with oxygen. This helps solve one of our primary environmental problems: too much carbon dioxide. When a portion of the hemp plant is burned for fuel, it has already "earned" the oxygen it uses by having placed that oxygen in the atmosphere while it grew. Fossil fuels (oil, gas, or coal), on the other hand, come from plant and animal sources that died millions of years ago—whatever carbon dioxide they took or oxygen they left happened millions of years ago. Burning fossil fuels, then, only adds to carbon dioxide and reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere.
<p>
<dd>
The hemp plant has remarkable potential for agriculture, manufacturing, energy, and the environment. And yet, cultivating, using, or even possessing hemp can get you mandatory life imprisonment.

IT HAS ALWAYS STRUCK me as odd that a consensual act should be legal in one state and illegal in another. What is it about stepping over the imaginary line dividing state from state that converts you from a criminal to a noncriminal?
<p>
<dd>
Imagine a bed in a motel room. The state line divides the bed: on one side of the bed you are in one state, on the other side of the bed you're in another. You and your consenting adult partner, lying on either side of the bed, could be committing the same activity, but one of you would be a criminal and the other would not.
<p>
<dd>
If you were on the Connecticut–Rhode Island border, for example, you could be involved in an act of oral sex (either heterosexual or homosexual) and the partner on the Rhode Island side would be breaking the law while the partner on the Connecticut side would not.
<p>
<dd>
On the New York–New Jersey border, if one of you happens to be married to another, you are guilty of adultery on the New York side of the bed, but not guilty of adultery (in the legal sense) on the New Jersey side.
<p>
<dd>
Perhaps the most stunning example of this would be anal sex (again, either homosexual or heterosexual) if you were on the Idaho-Wyoming border. The partner on the Wyoming side of the bed would be committing no crime at all; the partner on the Idaho side would be subject to life imprisonment.
<p>
<dd>
Drug use and unconventional medical practices, thanks to the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Food and Drug Administration, are illegal everywhere.

Full-scale gambling is legal only in Nevada and Atlantic City. Limited forms of gambling (race tracks, card clubs, off-track betting) are usually determined at the local (not state) level, thus too ambitious for our humble chart. If your state has a state-run lottery, you'll know: lotteries tend to advertise more than Coca-Cola.
<p>
<dd>
This leaves us with a state-by-state chart that deals mostly with sex and assisted suicide. What a combination. The "Age of Consent" column applies to sex only, not alcohol—due to federal pressure, alcohol is limited to persons twenty-one and older.
<p>
<dd>
The chart is as accurate as we could make it as of early 1996. The fastest growing category, in terms of illegality, seems to be assisted suicide. This chart is provided as a starting point for political change. Before you take part in any activity within any state, please check with local authorities. End of disclaimer; let's move on to the chart. (Information provided by Thomas Coleman, Spectrum Institute, P.O. Box 65756, Los Angeles, California 90065.)

SIGNING THE DECLARATION of Independence was a dangerous act. To call the king of England a tyrant—especially in such a public and eloquent way—was high treason, punishable by death. Although the signers of the Declaration of Independence had different reasons for doing so, were very different individuals, and had radically different political points of view, the executioner's rope could be equally effective for one and all. John Hancock was bold. He signed his name first and large. "There," he said; "King George should be able to read that without his spectacles." When Benjamin Franklin signed, he was expected to say something witty, pithy, and to the point; he was, after all, the greatest aphorist of his day. Franklin did not disappoint. "We must all hang together," he said, "or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately."

The most popular American flag (prior to Betsy Ross's getting her hands on it) showed a snake divided in parts representing the thirteen colonies. The slogan was: UNITE OR DIE. All of us consensual criminals find ourselves in a similar situation today: we must unite or continue to have our rights denied by our own government. Another popular early flag showed the snake united, with the warning:

The people who oppose recreational drug use for health reasons must realize that the same people who outlaw recreational drugs now are working on outlawing certain vitamins, too. Prostitutes, gays, adulterers, sodomites, and heterosexuals who have sex outside of marriage all violate the same sexual taboo. (If you live in a state where sex outside of marriage, adultery, oral intercourse, or homosexual acts are legal, be assured that there are forces of the religious right who are working diligently right now to correct that legal and moral oversight.) The law that makes adults wear seat belts springs from the same paternalism—and political compromise—that would if it could (and apparently it can) regulate every other aspect of your life; for your own good, of course.

We are all chickens in the same farmer's yard. What would happen if the chickens all got mad at the farmer instead of pecking each other? Remember Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds? There is a reason falcons, lions, and tigers are not raised for their eggs, milk, and meat: chickens, cows, and sheep are far more docile; they don't complain when their eggs are taken, readily cooperate when being milked, and are easily led to slaughter.
<P>
<DD>
There is, of course, the rare animal that does act up. It's branded a renegade, and quickly eliminated. If, however, the entire group of animals—that is, the entire species—is known for acting up when trod upon, these animals are, for the most part, left alone. If consensual criminals stood up not only for their own rights, but the rights of each other, we would have the power to keep the government from treading upon us.

THIS IS A CHAPTER ON what to do if you'd like to see the laws against consensual activities changed.
<P>
<DD>
The single most effective form of change is one-on-one interaction with the people you come into contact with day-by-day. The next time someone condemns a consensual activity in your presence, you can ask the simple question, "Well, isn't that their own business?" Asking this, of course, may be like hitting a beehive with a baseball bat, and it may seem—after the commotion (and emotion) has died down—that attitudes have not changed. If, however, a beehive is hit often enough, the bees move somewhere else. Of course, you don't have to hit the same hive every time. If all the people who agree that the laws against consensual crimes should be repealed post haste would go around whacking (or at least firmly tapping) every beehive that presented itself, the bees would buzz less often.
<P>
<DD>
Also, some people actually start to think when they are asked a question such as, "Shouldn't people be allowed to do with their own person and property whatever they choose as long as they do not physically harm the person or property of another?" Granted, these thinking people are few and far between, but they do exist and, perhaps, some of the people you know or meet may have never been asked that question. It is not a very popular one.
<P>
<DD>
A good follow-up question: "Is it worth putting people in jail for doing these things?" Other possibilities: "Isn't it up to God to punish violations of God's laws?" "Who decides what is and is not `right'?" "Don't we have more important things to worry about?" "Have you ever committed a consensual crime?" If "yes": "Do you think you might feel differently about laws against consensual activities if you had gone to jail for your crime?"

Although it may not seem so, asking such questions and challenging people's misconceptions is a political act. This personal contact is, in fact, the essence of politics. Change begins with individuals, and individuals communicating with individuals is the way attitudes are most often changed. If any of your thoughts or beliefs changed as you read this book, that's because we've been communicating one-on-one. When I write a book, I write to one person. I think of a book as a long letter I might write a friend.
<P>
<DD>
In television, radio, and lectures, the most effective communicators are those who speak directly to individuals, not to a group. People like Larry King and Oprah Winfrey, and even Ross Perot, are effective communicators because they speak to people, not masses.
<P>
<DD>
Changing one mind by talking to one person is more valuable than lecturing at one million people who walk away indifferent. You can make a change; you can make a difference in the thinking of the people with whom you naturally come into contact.
<P>
<DD>
Another effective influence is through the media. Here, too, we can make personal statements. Writing letters to the editor, calling talk shows, asking questions from a studio audience gets your message out to thousands, even millions of people. A certain percentage of those people are going to personally relate to you, what you have to say, and the way you say it. You will probably never know who these people are, but—even if you seem to lose the argument with the host or guest on the show or even if the editor of the newspaper prints your letter with the comment, "Get a load of what the kooks are writing these days!"—a certain number of people will accept what you have to say, and a change will be put in motion.

And then there's traditional politics.
<P>
<DD>
Government is organized at three levels: local, state, and national (or federal). Any action you take on any of these levels counts. The simplest action is to write a letter or make a phone call. Here, of course, one must know whom to call or write.
<P>
<DD>
At the national level, the four most important people to contact are (a) your two senators (every state has two), (b) the member of the House of Representatives who represents your congressional district (we each have one of those), and (c) the president of the United States. While technically senators are there to serve all the people of the United States, their special interest group is the citizens (more particularly the voters) of their home state. Similarly, every member of the House of Representatives is there to serve all the people of the United States, but representatives have a special interest in the needs and opinions of the voters in their congressional districts.
<P>
<DD>
When the mail comes in to a congressional office, it is sorted into two piles: "Constituents" and "Everybody Else." The "Constituent" pile gets preferential treatment. This is not unfair—in fact, it's the way the system was designed: each citizen of the United States has the same number of representatives in Congress (two senators and one member of the House) who consider that citizen a constituent.[*FN] Members of the House of Representatives usually divide the "Everybody Else" pile into "My State" and "Those Other States." A member of Congress, then, will pay attention to, in order, (1) the voters within his or her own congressional district, (2) the rest of the citizens of his or her home state (he or she may run for statewide office one day), and (3) everyone else (he or she may run for president one day). The next group of people to write to, then, on the national level, are all the members of the House of Representatives from your state.

<DD>
State governments are set up with variations, but generally there is a house of representatives (or an assembly) and a senate. Here, you also have elected representatives who consider you their constituents, and these are the people to write first (in addition, of course, to the governor). Start with the state senator and representative from your own senatorial and house (or assembly) districts.
<P>
<DD>
Local government is a hodge-podge of city and county elected and appointed officials. To make change on a local level, however, it's worth your time to find out who runs the show. You might not be able to fight city hall, but you can sometimes influence it, and a call to city hall will get you the names and addresses of those in power.
<P>
<DD>
When writing a public servant, there's no need to be elaborate or eloquent. Usually, your letter will not be read carefully—it will be scanned and summarized. If you're writing about a particular issue in the public debate, your letter will become part of a statistic. ("Today's mail: 673 letters in favor of [the topic]; 2,476 letters opposed.") The same is true of phone calls, post cards, telegrams, and e-mail. Even though you're just a number, you are an important number.
<P>
<DD>
The religious right is well organized and can produce massive mailings (millions of pieces) on key issues within a few days. You can bet that, for the most part, they are going to favor enacting more laws against consensual activities, strict enforcement of the laws we already have, and, in the name of the Prince of Peace, violently oppose repealing or eliminating any oppressive law. No similar network exists for those who favor eliminating laws against consensual activities, and the legislators know this. Each letter, then, that comes in supporting a position not endorsed by the religious right is given special attention—and extra weight—by most legislators. As the religious right can "out-letter" its opposition by a ratio that is sometimes 10 to 1, one letter in favor of our freedom can count for as many as ten letters written by those who think our laws should be dictated by their moral code.

A copy of this book was sent to all members of the United States Senate and House of Representatives, as well as to the legislators and governors of all fifty states, and to the mayors of the top 100 cities (those who held office as of April 1996). If you generally agree with the idea of this book, please write your elected representatives: "Have you read the book, Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do? If not, I certainly recommend it. After you read the book, I would appreciate your thoughts on it."

An amazing number of consensual crimes can be repealed on the local level. In fact, most consensual crimes are enforced on the state and local, not the federal, level. People working at the state and local levels to dismantle the laws against consensual activities—and to keep new ones from being put on the books—could give us a free country in a short time.

At the other end of the spectrum, perhaps the thing to do is to propose a constitutional amendment that restates what is already in the Constitution. The amendment might read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
No citizen of the United States, or the several States, shall be subject to criminal prosecution unless he or she physically harms the person or property of a nonconsenting other.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DD>
That would lay it out clearly, I think. The "or the several States" insures that state governments don't pass restrictive codes in the name of "states' rights."
<P>
<DD>
Proposing a constitutional amendment would stir a national debate, as well as directly counter the religious right's desire to introduce a constitutional amendment declaring the United States a "Christian nation."
<P>
<DD>
Obviously, a lot of work needs to be done. The religious right is well financed, well organized, and big. It is involved in politics as an act of religious faith. Those who do not believe that religion and politics should be one and the same don't seem to have the same fervor when it comes to political action. The religious right has also co-opted every phrase and symbol that those who fought religious oppression once rallied around. Freedom, liberty (Jerry Falwell's institute of higher political learning is called Liberty University), the American flag, the Liberty Bell—even the word American.[*FN]

[*FN]  That the religious right completely took over the word <I>Christian</I> is a given. At one time, phrases such as <I>Christian charity</I> and <I>Christian tolerance</I> were used to denote kindness and compassion. To perform a "Christian" act meant an act of giving, of acceptance, of toleration.

Because there is such formidable opposition, those of us who believe that the laws against consensual activities should be repealed have our work cut out for us. Saying that people should be permitted to do with their person and property what they choose as long as they don't physically harm the person or property of another is not perceived by the religious right as a political statement, but as an attack on God. Those who are not willing to take the heat of the emotional outburst that will inevitably follow will soon leave the kitchen.
<P>
<DD>
Then there are those who want to keep the laws against consensual activities in place due to greed. Lots of people are making lots of money because certain consensual activities are illegal. Naturally, they do not want to lose any meal tickets.
<P>
<DD>
Those who want personal freedom in this country, then, have such interesting and diverse opponents as organized crime on one hand, and law enforcement on the other. Organized crime would practically go out of business if all consensual activities were legal. The politicians and media that organized crime already owns (or has a few favors coming from) will be opposed to legalizing consensual activities—but will oppose it with the highest moral, legal, social, and even scientific justifications. Law enforcement would (a) lose funding (the tens of billions being thrown at it to fight the war on drugs plus all that assets forfeiture money), and (b) have to catch real criminals (who have guns). The big businesses that currently make a fortune on legal (including prescription) drugs don't want any of the currently illegal drugs cluttering up the marketplace. This is a spectrum that has tobacco and alcohol companies at one end and the AMA and pharmaceutical companies at the other.

I cannot point to the Democratic or Republican party and say, "Here, join this party; they support this cause." Neither political party supports this cause; nor do, necessarily, either liberals or conservatives. Take a guess, for example, at the political orientation of the author of the following piece, published in a letters to the editor column of American Heritage magazine, May/June 1993:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
Would you want your son or daughter or spouse to spend their [sic] days smoking crack, or injecting heroin, or hallucinating on LSD? . . .
<P>
I remain convinced that the drugs we outlaw today must remain illegal, because I have personally witnessed the effects of drugs too often and too painfully. I have seen crack babies, trembling, their minds and bodies damaged by their mothers' drug abuse. . . . I have seen innocent victims maimed and murdered by drug addicts. . . .
<P>
Candidly, no society has ever or will ever succeed in abolishing the use of all mind-altering drugs, just as no society in the foreseeable future will succeed in abolishing all cancer. But that doesn't mean we can simply throw up our hands and say we won't even defend ourselves against these plagues. While the cost of prohibiting drugs is high, the cost of legalizing them would be much, much higher.

Drugs are cancer. Trembling crack babies. Sound like some of George Bush's comments? Pat Robertson's? Pat Buchanan's? Rush Limbaugh's? No, these words come from a person some consider to be the prototypical liberal, Governor Mario Cuomo of New York. There is no guarantee that a liberal's bleeding heart is going to bleed for the cause of repealing the laws against consensual activities. (What about all the prisoners, Mario?

Removing the prohibitions from consensual activities will probably take place due to popular opinion within both political parties. When Prohibition was enacted in 1920, both parties strongly favored it. By 1924, the Republicans still strongly favored it, and the Democrats were vacillating. By 1928, the Democrats opposed it, but the Republicans still favored it. By the election of 1932, both parties opposed Prohibition. That's the politics of change. 
<P>
<DD>
In the 1992 election, Ross Perot introduced the urgency of reducing the national debt and, due to the immediate popular support of this idea, it was quickly adopted by both parties. The idea of eliminating the laws against consensual activities will probably gain acceptance along the same lines. (And, I pray, as quickly.)

The political party that supports this concept—in fact, seems to be based on it—is the Libertarian party. Although its political philosophy is interesting and its information educational, I doubt if the majority of the American people are going to switch party affiliations in order to support this one issue. When the idea of eliminating consensual crimes becomes popular enough, one of the major political parties will adopt it, thus removing whatever wind the Libertarian sails might have captured. People, however, may be so fed up with both the Democratic and the Republican parties that they'll switch to Libertarianism just for the hell of it. [*FN]

The people most motivated to change the laws against consensual activities, of course, are those who have been arrested for them, and the "criminals'" friends and families. That includes the 750,000 people currently in jail, the 3,000,000 currently on parole or probation, the 4,000,000 arrested each year, as well as their loved ones. These are people who know, from personal experience, the absurdity of laws against consensual activities. They also know the arbitrary and often cruel ways in which these laws are enforced.
<P>
<DD>
One can only quote Woody Guthrie's advice to union organizers: "Take it easy, but take it." So often, people trapped in the legal system alternate between rage and resignation. Neither emotion will help repeal the laws against consensual activities. A middle ground in which the rage is channeled into constructive action not only provides an effective outlet for one's justifiable frustration; it gives one the satisfaction of, day by day, doing his or her part to change an unjust system.

The laws against marijuana are the most illogical of all drug laws: in 10,000 years of known human use, not one death has been caused by a "marijuana overdose." When you consider that hundreds of thousands of glaucoma suffers, chemotherapy patients, people with AIDS, and others could benefit from the medicinal uses of marijuana, the laws against marijuana are criminal.

Due to mandatory minimum sentencing, drug possessors (not even dealers) often spend more time in prison than murders, rapists, and people who produce infomercials (crimes which do not have mandatory minimums).
<P>
How mandatory are the mandatory minimums? In 1995, U.S. District Court Judge Lyle E. Storm tried to give two crack cocaine defendants a break and sentence them to "only" 20 years each. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered Judge Storm to resentence the defendants to the mandatory minimum: 30 years each.
<P>
"I know it's no justification or solace to you, but I am saying to you there is no justification to this sentence," Judge Storm told the defendants at the sentencing. "I apologize to you on behalf of the United States government." Families Against Mandatory Minimums fight atrocities within absurdities such as this.

Here's a grass-roots way of ending consensual crime prosecution, one juror at a time. The Fully Informed Jury Association promotes a fact that is as true as it is potentially powerful: once twelve jurors go into the deliberation room, when they decide to acquit for whatever reason, the "criminal" walks free. If the jury believes the defendant did take part in a prohibited consensual activity but the activity shouldn't be a crime, it can acquit. In most states, even if one juror feels this way, the worst that would happen is a hung jury, and the state has to start all over again. (With minor consensual crimes, the state sometimes doesn't bother.) Read all about it in FIJActivist, the newsletter of the Fully Informed Jury Association.

The term secular humanism has been so thoroughly trashed by the religious right (it's essentially the religious right's replacement for the F-WORD—with none of the F-WORD's more pleasant meanings), it might be interesting to see what secular humanists really believe. This list of principles taken from the web page of Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism, publishers of Free Inquiry Magazine and Secular Humanist Bulletin:
<LI>
We are committed to the application of reason and science to the understanding of the universe and to the solving of human problems.
<LI>
We deplore efforts to denigrate human intelligence, to seek to explain the world in supernatural terms, and to look outside nature for salvation.
<LI>
We believe that scientific discovery and technology can contribute to the betterment of human life.
<LI>
We believe in an open and pluralistic society and that democracy is the best guarantee of protecting human rights from authoritarian elites and repressive majorities.
<LI>
We are committed to the principle of the separation of church and state.
<LI>
We cultivate the arts of negotiation and compromise as a means of resolving differences and achieving mutual understanding.
<LI>
We are concerned with securing justice and fairness in society and with eliminating discrimination and intolerance.
<LI>
We believe in supporting the disadvantaged and the handicapped so that they will be able to help themselves.
<LI>
We attempt to transcend divisive parochial loyalties based on race, religion, gender, nationality, creed, class, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, and strive to work together for the common good of humanity.
<LI>
We want to protect and enhance the earth, to preserve it for future generations, and to avoid inflicting needless suffering on other species.
<LI>
We believe in enjoying life here and now and in developing our creative talents to their fullest.
<LI>
We believe in the cultivation of moral excellence.
<LI>
We respect the right to privacy. Mature adults should be allowed to fulfill their aspirations, to express their sexual preferences, to exercise reproductive freedom, to have access to comprehensive and informed health-care, and to die with dignity.
<LI>
We believe in the common moral decencies: altruism, integrity, honesty, truthfulness, responsibility. Humanist ethics is amendable to critical, rational guidance. There are normative standards that we discover together. Moral principles are tested by their consequences.
<LI>
We are deeply concerned with the moral education of our children. We want to nourish reason and compassion.
<LI>
We are engaged by the arts no less than by the sciences.
<LI>
We are citizens of the universe and are excited by discoveries still to be made in the cosmos.
<LI>
We are skeptical of untested claims of knowledge, and we are open to novel ideas and seek new departures in our thinking.
<LI>
We affirm humanism as a realistic alternative to the theologies of violence and as a source of rich personal significance and genuine satisfaction in the service to others.
<LI>
We believe in optimism rather than pessimism, hope rather than despair, learning in the place of dogma, truth instead of ignorance, joy rather than guilt or sin, tolerance in the place of fear, love instead of hatred, compassion over selfishness, beauty instead of ugliness, and reason rather than blind faith or irrationality.
<LI>
We believe in the fullest realization of the best and noblest that we are capable of as human beings.

This magazine is both fun and informative. It's hard to determine which is more interesting, the articles or the advertisements. The High Times web begins with this warning, which certainly applies to the magazine as well:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Warning! This HIGH TIMES web site contains information about hemp, marijuana and psychedelic drugs (such as LSD and ecstasy). Some of the subjects covered include cannabis cultivation, drug laws, pot humor, high art, drug tests, legal highs, industrial uses of hemp such as paper, hemp clothing, hemp foods, hemp oil and other hemp products, the legalization of marijuana, the recreational use of marijuana, the medical uses of marijuana, and the worldwide uses of hemp and marijuana . . .
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The information you are about to read is for informational purposes only and is designed for adults only. HIGH TIMES does not promote the use of marijuana or other recreational or illicit drugs, including alcohol or tobacco, by minors. For this reason, we must request that you verify that you are 21 years or older.
<P>
Once the minors are removed and it's just the Haight Ashbury survivors left, the High Times web site lightens up: "Finally! Somewhere you can relax, light a phattie, and enjoy the atmosphere." Phattie? By the context I'm pretty sure I know what that means, but I didn't know before. I'm not even sure how to pronounce it. God, I'm getting old. It reminds me of a Firesign Theater routine in which the police go about arresting all the old farts like me who are no longer cool. "Check out his body paint," says one cop. His partner replies, voice mixed with pity and contempt: "Faded San Francisco art nouveau."

PETER McWILLIAMS has been writing about his passions since 1967. In thatyear, he became passionate about what most seventeen-year-olds are passionate about—love—and wrote Come Love With Me & Be My Life. This began a series of poetry books which have sold nearly four million copies.
<P>
<DD>
Along with love, of course, comes loss, so Peter became passionate about emotional survival. In 1971 he wrote Surviving the Loss of a Love, which was expanded in 1976 and again in 1991 (with co-authors Melba Colgrove, Ph.D., and Harold Bloomfield, M.D.) into How to Survive the Loss of a Love. It has sold more than two million copies.
<P>
<DD>
He also became interested in meditation, and a book he wrote on meditation was a New York Times bestseller, knocking the impregnable Joy of Sex off the #1 spot. Asone newspaper headline proclaimed, MEDITATION MORE POPULAR THAN SEX AT THE NEW YORK TIMES.
<P>
<DD>
His passion for computers (or more accurately, for what computers could do) led to The Personal Computer Book, which Time proclaimed "a beacon of simplicity, sanity and humor," and the Wall Street Journal called "genuinely funny." (Now, really, how many people has the Wall Street Journal called "genuinely funny"?)
<P>
<DD>
His passion for personal growth continues inthe ongoing LIFE 101 Series. Thus far, the books in this series include You Can't Afford theLuxury of a Negative Thought: A Book for People with Any Life-Threatening Illness—Including Life; LIFE 101: Everything WeWish We Had Learned About Life In School—But Didn't (aNew York Times bestseller in both hardcover and paperback); DO IT! Let's Get Off Our Buts (a #1New York Times hardcover bestseller); and WEALTH101: Wealth Is Much More Than Money.
<P>
<DD>
His passion for visual beauty led him to publish, in 1992, his first book of photography, PORTRAITS, a twenty-two-year anthology of his photographic work.

I would like to thank those who contributed ideas, articles, recommended books, sent videotapes, and in other ways supplied support and essential information. These include my mother Mary McWilliams; Norma Jean Almodovar; David Anderson; Bertrand Babinet; Harold H. Bloomfield, M.D.; Adam Blossom; Matthew Childs; Ted Conley; Stuart Elliott; Gene GeRue; Professor Lawrence Kaplan; Dr. Bryan McMullan; Jimmie McWilliams; John Morton; Kristin Onuf; Dr. Pei; Susan Post; Lake Puett; Diane Reverand; Dr. Richard Rockwell; Dr. I.

The Bible research probably could not have been done (at least not completed in this century) without my trusty computer and the Bible-text programs Biblesoft (The PC Study Bible), QuickVerse, and the Bible Library.
<P>
<DD>
While riding around in my car, I especially enjoyed listening to the tapes on Thomas Paine's Common Sense and Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, by Knowledge Products, Nashville, Tennessee.
<P>
<DD>
For copy editing, I would like to thank Debbie Sidell; for much of the desktop publishing, Victoria Marine, who made thousands of picky little comments, without which this book would be a far worse one.
<P>
<DD>
For invaluable editorial comments as well as indexing, my gratitude and appreciation go to Jean Sedillos. For research, transcription, and taking the project over when others abandoned it, my thanks to Chris GeRue (who must transcribe even this, so if she's added words such as ever-faithful, brilliant, or overworked, this would be accurate, but she added them on her own). Without the support of these two women in particular, this book could not have taken place.
<P>
<DD>
Thanks to Paurvi Trivedi, who rearranged schedules with the printers six times while I discovered one invaluable bit of information after another that simply had to be in the book. Thanks as well to the printer of this book, Bertelsmann, for making the six scheduling changes.
<P>
<DD>
I would like to thank my friends—particularly Christopher McMullen and Heide Mintzer-Banks-Smith—who didn't see or hear from me for long periods of time as my obsession (I like to call it "dedication") with this book grew and my personal life shrank. (Come to think of it, they never complained. Maybe they didn't notice I was not around. Hmmmm.)
<P>
<DD>
Thanks to Bessie Smith, a black, drug-using, bisexual whose 1923 recording of "T'aint Nobody's Biz-ness If I Do" inspired the whole book.
<P>
<DD>
And, finally, I'd like to thank Pat Robertson and Jerry ("Jer") Falwell, without whom this book would not have been inevitable.

<p>
<dd>
<dd>Once it was decided that there would be a strong, central (federal) government, many people—most notably, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and, later, John Adams—wanted to make sure that the power of that government was severely limited—especially where the rights of the individual were concerned. They wanted to be certain that the government did what it needed to do, and nothing more. Other than defending the borders, establishing treaties, settling disputes, keeping a level playing field for commerce, and ensuring the free flow of goods and ideas, they wanted to make sure the government left the people blessedly alone. "I am for a government rigorously frugal and simple," wrote Jefferson. "Were we directed from Washington when to sow, when to reap, we should soon want
bread."

<dd>
Jefferson and the others called for a Bill of Rights, a series of amendments to the Constitution which clearly delineated what the government could and, more importantly, could not do to regulate individual thought and behavior.
<p>
<dd>Those who favored the Constitution without a Bill of Rights were not against the ideas propounded in the Bill of Rights, but only argued that such guarantees were unnecessary because they already were contained within the main body of the Constitution. The Enumeration of Powers, they claimed, limited the government to basic functions. None of these enumerated powers infringed on the individual unless that individual harmed the person or property of another. The government could not take on additional powers—such as regulating speech, religion, the press, or anything else—without adding a constitutional amendment. In other words, if the Constitution didn't say that the government specifically could do something, it couldn't. As Alexander Hamilton explained,
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?

<P>
<dd>"No," said those in favor of a Bill of Rights, "we all understand that the intent of the government is not to restrict freedom, but we don't know what some nefarious people twenty, fifty, two hundred years from now might attempt to do with the Constitution. The Constitution is a contract between the government and the people. It is important to spell out clearly not only what the government can do, but what it cannot do as well."
<p>
<dd>
"But," argued those against a Bill of Rights, "if we specifically say that the federal government cannot do certain things, then the implication will be that it can do everything else. The list of what it can't do could go on forever. And what about those things it can't do that haven't been invented yet?"
<p>
<dd>Those in favor of a Bill of Rights responded, "We will make the limitations general enough to cover large areas of freedoms, but specific enough to give a clear indication of what we mean. The basic form of government in the world today is tyrannical and opposed to individual freedoms. We want the people of the United States, all the world, and all posterity to see clearly—without having to read between the lines—the freedoms we believe the government simply cannot take away."
<p>
<dd>The pro–Bill of Rights argument won the day. So those in favor of the Constitution as it was said, "Let's pass the Constitution as it is, and we'll immediately begin working on a Bill of Rights." It was this promise of a Bill of Rights that got the Constitution enough support to become the supreme law of the land. The basic Constitution was submitted to the states for ratification in 1787, and ratified in 1788. In 1789, at the first session of Congress, the Bill of Rights was proposed, and its adoption was certified on December 15, 1791. (The three states that failed to ratify the Bill of Rights—Massachusetts, Georgia, and Connecticut—eventually did so. In 1939.)

<dd>
Let's look at the Bill of Rights in David Letterman order—from ten to one. To the average citizen, the First Amendment—guaranteeing freedom of speech, the press, assembly, petition, and freedom of and from religion—seems the most important. From a legal point of view (many of the founding fathers were lawyers, and the judges in the courts interpreting the Constitution today are all lawyers) number ten is the most significant.

<dd><B><I>The Tenth Amendment</I></B> reads,

<p>
<dd>This affirms what the founding fathers unanimously agreed on at the time—that if the Constitution didn't specifically take away a power (that is, a right or a freedom) from the people, the people kept it. This settled once and for all, the fundamental question, "Does the government inherently have all the power and then dole out rights to the people, or do the people inherently have all the power and—in exchange for certain benefits—surrender specific powers to the government?" Concerning the government of the United States, the answer is clear: the people inherently have the power and turn specific powers over to the government in exchange for certain benefits. These 
powers were detailed in the Constitution (the Enumeration of Powers), and all other powers belong to the people.

<p>
<dd>
Just because the Constitution says you have certain rights does not mean that you don't also have other rights which the Constitution didn't bother to enumerate. This amendment was designed to counter the argument, "If we list certain rights, then it might be supposed that those are the only rights the people have." As in the Tenth Amendment, the people clearly hold all the rights, and just because some of those basic rights are listed in the Constitution does not in any way mean to limit the rights not mentioned.

<dd>To me it seems both cruel and unusual to punish people for doing something that potentially could harm only themselves.

While the government is there to protect us from harm, it cannot protect us from all possible harm, nor can it lock up everyone we feel has harmed us.

<P>
<DD>We can't make everything a criminal matter, the Constitution is saying: we can't lock up every citizen who displeases another citizen. Citizens do, however, harm each other in ways not prohibited by criminal law, and there should be a system for rectifying the harm.

If, for example, I borrow ten dollars from you and do not pay it back when promised, I have physically harmed you (by not returning your property). I have not, however, stolen from you in a criminal way: you did, after all, consent to loan it to me. Implied in the consent to loan is the risk you won't get it back. (A victim of criminal thievery never consents at any point.) Nonetheless, the ten dollars is rightfully yours. While you cannot put me in jail, you can take me to court, and the government's job is to (a) make sure the rules of the court are fair and equally applied to us both, and (b) use force, if necessary, to carry out the judgment of the court. If the court finds in your favor and orders me to pay the money but even then I refuse to pay it (never loan money to a writer), the court can send law enforcement agents to seize my property, sell it, and pay you your ten dollars from the proceeds. It cannot, however, throw me in jail until I pay up.
<p>
<dd>This amendment acknowledges that not every physical harm one person does another is a criminal offense. How much less a criminal offense it must be, then, when people only potentially harm themselves. Not only does the Constitution have no authority to regulate personal morality; it offers no system by which to do so.  This amendment also gives moralists a system by which they can protect themselves without using the full force of the criminal justice system. The moralist groups can take those who offend them to civil court. Let a jury decide. The reason most moral groups don't do this is (a) most of their cases would be thrown out of court for lack of sufficient grounds and (b) most cases that went before a jury would lose.

<dd>Instead, moralist groups threaten—or have elected—legislators, badger police, intimidate the media, and frighten the public into using the criminal arm of the law to punish the very same actions they could not hope to control in civil court. For example, if there were no laws against drug use, can you imagine Pat Robertson taking me to civil court and getting a court order prohibiting me from smoking pot in my own home? Jerry Falwell believes drinking alcohol is a sin. Can you imagine how few liquor stores he could close through the civil courts? (His political-spiritual ancestors, however, closed down all the liquor stores during Prohibition by making possession of liquor a criminal offense.)

One of the requirements for this jury trial in criminal prosecutions is for the accused "to be confronted with the witnesses against him." In a trial for a consensual crime, who are the witnesses against the person accused? In a genuine crime (except murder, of course) the victim can come forth and testify against the accused. If someone pushes you down and takes your money, you can go to court and testify against the person who did it.

<dd>
But if there is no clear-cut victim, who is there to testify "against" you? In trials involving consensual crimes, the witnesses are generally the police ("I broke down the door and after a diligent search of the premises found a small bag containing two grams of  white powder which I believed to be an illicit substance"), friends of the accused who testify against the accused in order to avoid prosecution for the same consensual crime (this is called "turning state's evidence" as well as "turning on your friends"), police lab technicians who proclaim, "Yes, this is pot," and state social workers who proclaim, "Yes, this is a prostitute." None of these people was harmed by the accused. In fact, all of them are being paid by the government in some way to testify.
<p>
<dd>The intent of the Sixth Amendment was that before the government can punish a citizen, the person or persons harmed by that citizen must stand in public court and tell a jury what harm was done to them and how the accused did it. In cases involving consensual crimes, unharmed, government-paid (or government-coerced) witnesses testify against Accused A, who could just as easily be Accused B, C, or D. This system, to which we have become painfully accustomed (it's used for roughly half the court cases in the country), is an obvious perversion of the intent behind the Sixth Amendment's requirement that the accused "be confronted with the witnesses against him."
<p>
<dd><B><I>The Fifth Amendment</I></B> is most famous for the provision that one does not have to testify against oneself in a criminal case—to "take the Fifth." If you were made to testify against yourself, you would often be torn between self-incrimination and perjury. This amendment, too, offers protection against prosecution for consensual activities: since the only clear-cut victim in a consensual crime is the person involved in the crime, and the person involved in the crime is the one who would be accused, the Fifth Amendment says that you don't have to give any information about the crime. Hence, a lot of consensual crimes have—thanks to the Constitution—not been prosecuted as vigorously as they might. Courts can prove possession of drugs, but not necessarily drug use; prostitutes can be convicted for soliciting, but not necessarily having sex; gamblers can be convicted for being where gambling is taking place, but not actually gambling.

Another important guarantee of the Fifth Amendment reads, "Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation." This affirms the sanctity of private property. The government does not own or control our property; we do. If the government takes it "for public use," the government must provide "just compensation." In other words, even if the public—the people—have a pressing need for your private property, they can't have it unless they justly compensate you. This is a clear statement that the government will protect the individual against the majority and even protect the individual against the government itself. As we will explore more fully in the chapter, "Laws against Consensual Activities Are Opposed to the Principles of Private Property, Free Enterprise, Capitalism, and the Open Market," the idea of private property encompasses the idea that we can do with our property as we see fit—use it, sell it, trade it, give it, and, yes, even destroy it. As long as it doesn't infringe on the person or property of another, it ain't no government's business if we do.

<dd>Once again, the Constitution affirms the absolute sanctity of private property. Even a soldier—who may someday risk his or her life to defend your life and property—cannot spend a night in your house without your permission. Second, the amendment shows that, in time of war, things change. In time of war, it is understood that certain sacrifices must be made, but even then a soldier can't stay in a private house unless a law is passed allowing him or her to do so. In other words, the legislature must pass a bill, the president must sign it (or be overriden by a veto), and the courts are available for recourse if someone considers the law unfair. This is one of many safeguards in the Constitution against a police state, against a military body that decides its needs are more important than those of a citizen and takes what it wants by force. In order for this to happen, according to the Constitution, the Congress must first declare war and then, in addition to declaring war, pass a law stating that, for the duration of the war, soldiers may stay in private houses without the owners' permission and (going back to the Fifth Amendment) stating what sort of compensation the owners of the houses shall receive.

<dd>The reasoning behind this amendment turns out to be not the paranoia of a few gun-stockpiling kooks, but the hard-edged pragmatism of the founding fathers; a pragmatism based firmly on historical precedent. People who are not permitted to individually keep and bear arms are relatively easy to conquer and subdue by even a small well-armed group. In taking control of an innocent group of people, a tyrant almost invariably first deprives them of their right to bear arms, making it easier to later deprive them of liberty and life.

Imagine for a moment that you are a tyrant. Town A (Lambsville) has $10,000,000 in wealth spread among an unarmed populace of 10,000. Town B (Lionsburg) has $10,000,000 in wealth spread among 5,000 well-armed, well-trained citizens. Which town would you plunder first? As has been clear to tyrants throughout time, Lambsville will get shorn while Lionsburg sleeps peacefully in the sun.

<dd>Even our own government (and I'm not going to speculate on its position on the benevolent-to-tyrannical scale) pursues unarmed consensual crime quarries far more often than heavily armed ones. If the Branch Davidian compound at Waco had been your ordinary, unarmed weirdo cult, do you think any of us would have heard about what would have been a very uneventful raid? Although it would have made the front page in Waco, the swift round-up and eventual release of a band of odd believers would have been buried in the second section of the Dallas papers and probably never mentioned by Time, Newsweek, the Los Angeles Times, or the New York Times. And although the Branch Davidians died in the mystery inferno, they certainly made their point; I doubt very much if a branch of
the
federal government will be attacking an armed cult again in the near future.

<P>
<dd>
The press is astonishingly biased when it comes to reporting acts of violence performed by individuals using guns. My favorite is the almost universal use of the term assault weapons. In fact, these semi-automatic Gatling guns could be just as accurately called "family and children protection devices." Who is to say that one of those portable bullet-spewing contraptions won't be used to defend innocent would-be victims from the deranged attack of a lunatic armed with merely a .457 magnum? 
<P>
<DD>
Further, those who argue for an unarmed populace do so based on the fantasy that the government can protect us from physical harm. If a burglar is breaking down your door, do you think the police will protect you? The burglar would be in and you'd be out cold before you could get 911 to answer. But if you have a gun, there's no need to wait. Protection is—literally—at hand.
<p>
<dd>We look at the number of hand gun deaths in this country (which is appalling), but who is to say how many crimes of violence were prevented by the potential victim's judicious production of a gun or by a criminal saying, "Let's not mess with him; he keeps a gun." One study showed that for each crime committed with a gun, 67 crimes were prevented with one.
<p>
<dd>The inordinate amount of Americans killing each other is caused not by guns, but by the ongoing psychotic breakdown in our culture. Picking up a gun does not instill in one the urge to kill; people have the urge to kill and then pick up guns. If there weren't a single firearm—antique or automatic—in this country, we would still be murdering each other in astonishing numbers. We would just be offing each other with kitchen knives, poison, bombs, and a few hundred other devices.

Considering these forty-five words, by what authority does Congress dare make laws based on limiting assembly, speech, and religion? The Enumeration of Powers, as we have seen, does not give the government this authority—and even if it did, the First Amendment would take away.

<dd>The freedom of religion is guaranteed to us twice: the freedom from religion and the freedom of religion. Most laws against consensual activities are based on religious beliefs.
<p>
<dd>With the implementation of the Constitution, the United States government broke from almost every other government in the world by not establishing an official state religion ("Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . . ."). In the 1700s, Virginia (the home state of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington) used tax dollars to support the Anglican church. Both Jefferson and Washington saw firsthand how un-free, unfair, and downright unworkable it was. In the next chapter, on the separation of church and state, we'll explore the restriction of freedom, not just by the established state religion, but by the battles fought over which religion would become The One.

The Fourteenth Amendment is our greatest protection against a police state and against the rule by the iron whim of either the majority or a highly vocal minority.

<H2>Wealth Is Loving</H2>
<P>
You may think that we're going to get all gooey here when we talk about loving. We're not. Loving's not gooey. Loving is hard work.
<P>
Loving is not just a feelingsomething we "fall into." Loving is a choice. We must choosesometimes against seemingly impossible odds, with enormous evidence to the contraryto love<I> whatever</I> we encounter.
<P>
First, we must learn to love ourselves. Heavens, is <I>that</I> difficult. Only we know all the nasty things we've done and all the wicked things we've thought. Only we know how often we've failed and how often we've done the right-appearing thing for the wrong reason. And, knowing all this, we are asked to love ourselves?
<P>
Yes. We wish we knew an alternative, but we don't. Loving ourselves is the only real foundation we've found for loving everyone and everything else in the world.
<P>
The good news, of course, is that we also know all the goodness within usall the kind thoughts we've thought, all the compassionate things we've done, all the caring feelings we've had.
<P>
Like life, we are collections of both good and bad. Like happiness, loving is <I>choosing</I> to focus on the good. From the challenge of loving ourselves, it's relatively easy to move on to the challenge of loving everyone and everything else.
<P>
Do we have to love everyone and everything? No, only what's in front of us. If there's something we don't love, and can't seem to find <I>anything</I> positive about it to focus on, we can simply move away from it and place ourselves with something we can love. If we are thinking about something, and can't find <I>anything</I> to love about it, we can think about something else, something we can love.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The most common trait of all primitive peoples is a reverence for the lifegiving earth, and the native American shared this elemental ethic: the land was alive to his loving touch, and he, its son, was brother to all creatures. His feelings were made visible in medicine bundles and dance rhythms for rain, and all of his religious rites and land attitudes savored the inseparable world of nature and God, the master of Life. During the long Indian tenure the land remained undefiled save for scars no deeper than the scratches of cornfield clearings or the farming canals of the Hohokams on the Arizona desert.</I><P>STEWART LEE UDALL
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Why do we practice loving? For the person or thing we love? Oh, a little. For ourselves? Absolutely. As FrancoisLa Rochefoucauld put it, "The pleasure of love is in loving. We are happier in the passion we feel than in that we arouse."
<P>
And as another poet wrote, "The love I give you is secondhand. I feel it first." Or, another: "What do I get from loving you? Loving. You."
<P>
Our loving, of course, is not just for people. "I love it, I love it; and who shall dare," wrote Eliza Cook, "To chide me for loving that old armchair?"
<P>
Loving things feels good, and there are a great many things these days in need of our loving. The planet Earth, for example. "Thank God," wrote Thoreau, "men cannot fly, and lay waste the sky as well as the earth."
<P>
The loving we are talking about expects nothing in return. The joy of loving is a reward in itself. "To love for the sake of being loved is human," said AlphonseAlphonse de Lamartine, "but to love for the sake of loving is angelic."
<P>
So, be angelic. Sure it's hard work. The habit of loving only a few selected things and people is strong, but habits can be broken, and new behaviors learned. Let them say of you, as John Dryden said in 1680, "Large was his wealth, but larger was his heart."
<P>
More important, learn to say that of yourself long before anyone writes your epitaph.
<P>

DON HEROLD</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKWQUOTE>
<H2>Wealth Is Caring</H2>
<P>
Caring is very much like loving, except that it adds the elements of compassion, empathy and action to the loving.
<P>
Loving is unconditional. We find something good about someone or something, and we love it. There is no result required or desired. When we care, we look for a result. We become slightly attached to the outcome.
<P>
If we care for a sick animal, for example, we want the animal to get better. If we care about the environment, we want it to become cleaner. If we care for a wound, we want the wound to heal.
<P>
The trick is not to become <I>too</I> attached to the outcome. When we do, we bring out the second use of the word <I>care</I>, as in "Cast away care; he that loves sorrow / Lengthens not a day, nor can buy tomorrow," (Thomas Dekker, 1656). Here <I>care</I> becomes a synonym for worry. This is not being careful.
<P>
We must be careful that our caring does not become interference, or meddlinga form of thinking that what we want for others is more important than what they want for themselves. "I only did it because I care," has covered a multitude of intrusions. And yet, when a good friend is on a clear course of destruction, sometimes intervention is the caring thing to do.
<P>
The solution? Back to our old friend, balance.
<P>
Somewhere between caring too muchwhich only makes one miserable, dominating and ineffectiveand complete indifferencewhich may be the way of the saints, but we ain't saints yetlies caring enough to make a positive difference, but not so much that it seriously affects our well-being.
<P>
Without caring, we become like Lily Tomlin's Ernestine: "We don't care. We don't have to. We're the phone company." With caring, we can all take part in Hippocrates's advice " to superintend the sick to make them well, to care for the healthy to keep them well, also to care for one's own self"
<P>
If wisdom were offered me with the proviso that I should keep it shut up and refrain from declaring it, I should refuse. There's no delight in owning anything unshared. SENECA FIRST CENTURY A.D.

<H2>Wealth Is Sharing</H2>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Imagine one morning you woke up and found yourself the only person in the worldeverybody else simply gone. Yes, you wouldin a senseown everything, but imagine how dull it would be. You could have anything you wantedexcept that there would be no one to share it with. If this wasn't one of those "Twilight Zone" episodes about what hell is like, it could have been.
<P>
When we talk about sharing what we have, we're talking about physical possessions, sure, but even more, we mean sharing who we <I>are</I>--our warmth, our humor, our ideas, our talents, our joys and, yes, our sorrows.
<P>
"Not what we give, but what we share," wrote Russell James Russell Lowell in 1848, "For the gift without the giver is bare." "Even children followed with endearing wile," Oliver Goldsmith wrote in 1770, "And plucked his gown, to share the good man's smile." And Pythagoras, between theorems, said, "Friends share all things."
<P>
When we visit a friend's house for dinner, it's usually not the food we go for. "It isn't so much what's on the table that matters," W. S. Gilbert wrote, "as what's on the chairs."
<P>
"I think that, as life is action and passion," said Jr., Oliver WendellOliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., "it is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time."
<P>
When we are with those we care about, our ability to share rises from a wellspring deeper than we thought was in us. "Man discovers his own wealth," Rabindranath Tagore observed, "when God comes to ask gifts of him."

<H2>Wealth Is Learning</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Wealth is not in making money, but in making the man while he is making money. </I><P>JOHN WICKER 
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

In the end, it's not what we have or do that matters it is what we take from what we have and do, what we internalize, what we make our own. The process of making something our own is called learning.
<P>
Like the boy eagerly shoveling through the horse manure "because here's got to be a pony in here somewhere," so, no matter how manure-like life can get, there's got to be a lesson in there somewhere. "No matter what happens to me, I'm going to learn something useful from it," is a fundamental attitude of wealth.
<P>
Here we're not necessarily talking about the institutions of higher learning (which, alas, have become for more and more people a place to hide from what they need to know), but the learning we get in that greatest classroom of alllife.
<P>
"The entire object of true education," wrote JohnJohn Ruskin, "is to make people not merely do the right thing, but to enjoy right things; not merely industrious, but to love industry; not merely learned, but to love knowledge."
<P>
Knowledge can be more powerful than money. It's interesting that among the meanings for the word <I>tip,</I> these two are included: first, extra money paid for a job well done, and, second, a bit of important information. If we're willing to learn from the latter (information), we can use it to make much more than the former (money).
<P>
Our willingness to learn and to apply what we've learned in a word, <I>grow</I> is a hallmark of wealth.

<H2>Wealth Is Knowing What You Want</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>If this is coffee, please bring me some tea; but if this is tea, please bring me some coffee.</I><P>ABRAHAM LINCOLN
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

<P>
Many people think wealth is <I>having</I> what you want. We have found, however, that a good many people already have what they wantor at least what they said they wanted at some former timeand <I>still</I> don't feel wealthy. They want more, but they're not sure what "more" is.
<P>
Yes, they have a shopping listwhich usually begins with "a million dollars" and continues with this and this and this and this and this and a little of that, please, if you're not too tired. Theyto quote one of the most absurd terms coined in the past century"want it all."
<P>
As we said beforeand will say againthere is simply too much "all" and not enough time this time around. We c<I>an have anything we want, but we can't have everything we want.</I> (Even if it were practical, the concept of "having it all" is a strange one. As Maurice Sendak pointed out, "There must be more to life than having everything.")
<P>
Knowing what we truly wantnot what other people think would be best for us, or what our family expects of us, or what our culture has programmed us forbut what <I>we</I> truly want, is a significant aspect of wealth.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Unhappiness is in not knowing what we want and killing ourselves to get it.</I><P>DON HEROLD
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

To have our heart's desire clearly delineated and defined, and know that we're moving toward it every day, brings a sense of satisfaction and security that, as they say, even money can't buy.
<P>
Another nice thing about knowing what you want is that, when you get what you want, you know itand can then celebrate. And celebration is certainly wealth.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Wealth Is Opportunity</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>America's best buy is a telephone call to the right man.</I><P>ILKA CHASE</CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Opportunities come in all shapes and sizes. Wealth is knowing opportunities when they come (unwealthy people often mislabel them "problems") and, if opportunities don't come often enough, knowing how to make them happen. "A wise man," wrote Bacon, "will make more opportunities than he finds."
<P>
Like wealth itself, opportunity is not a matter of things or eventsit is an attitude, a way of seeing the world. Opportunity is saying, "No matter <I>what</I> happens to me, I will use it for my upliftment, learning and growth."
<P>
"A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities," wrote Reginald B. Mansell; "an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties."
<P>
A popular myth about opportunity is that some people have more than others. Not so. Like oxygen, opportunity is availablein abundancefor all.
<P>
Alas, Mr. Dooley doesn't agree with us on this point. In 1901 he said of Andrew Carnegie: "Opporchunity knocks at ivry man's dure wanst. On some men's dures it hammers till it breaks down th' dure an' thin it goes in an' wakes him up if he's asleep, an' iver aftherward it wurruks f'r him as a night-watchman."
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>There is no security in this life. There is only opportunity.</I><P>DOUGLAS MACARTHUR
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Another myth is that opportunity only knocks once. Opportunity will, in fact, knock you down. The gift is realizing that what knocked you down was an opportunity, not a bus.
<P>
It is true, however, that if opportunities are ignored, they <I>seem</I> to come fewer and farther between. "Opportunities multiply as they are seized," said John Wicker; "they die when neglected."
<P>
In fact, the opportunities keep coming as regularly as everwe simply fall into the habit of ignoring them.
<P>
To be aware of opportunities one must be, well, <I>aware.</I> "The opportunity that God sends does not wake up him who is asleep," says the Senegalese proverb. (Now, really, when was the last time you read a book that quoted a Senegalese proverb?)
<P>
"Many do with opportunities as children do at the seashore," wrote Thomas Jones, "they fill their little hands with sand, and then let the grains fall through, one by one, till all are gone."
<P>
When we learn to see the wealth of opportunities all around us, all the time, we realize that we can't possibly make use of them all. So, we choose those opportunities we want to pursueas we do at a banquetand let the rest go on to someone else.
<P>
Ecclesiasticus (4:20) reminds us, "Observe the opportunity."
<P>
On with the dance, let the joy be unconfined!" is my motto, whether there's any dance to dance or any joy to unconfine. MARK TWAIN
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Wealth Is Enjoying</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>On with the dance, let the joy be unconfined!" is my motto, whether there's any dance to dance or any joy to unconfine.</I><P>MARK TWAIN
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

We consider enjoyment such an important part of wealth that we have devoted an entire sectionand by far the largest sectionof this book to it. (Part Three: "Enjoying What You've Got.")
<P>
Enjoyment, we have found, is composed of two elements, appreciation and<I> </I><I>gratitude.</I>
<P>
Although we'll explore each in elaborate detail later, let us speak briefly about them here.
<P>
<I>Appreciation </I>is finding something to like about a given person, place, thing or experience. Sometimes it happens spontaneously, sometimes we have to work to find it. Appreciatingvaluing, relishing, cherishing, likingis, well, fun. We all seem to want it, to seek it. And yet, over time, that alone is not enough.
<P>
Something is missing.
<P>
To this, then, we add<I> gratitude.</I> Feeling thankful for whatever it is we're appreciatingand for the feeling of appreciation itselfrounds out the experience of enjoyment. Gratitude adds warmth, depth and a sumptuous quality to appreciation. Gratitude also, interestingly, paves the way for the next round of appreciation.
<P>
The ability to enjoy what we haveboth inside and outside ourselvesis one of the cornerstones of wealth.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Wealth Is Balance</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>
Fortunate, indeed, is the man who takes exactly the right measure of himself, and holds a just balance between what he can acquire and what he can use.</I><P>PETER MERE LATHAM<BR>1789-1875
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

In this admittedly contradictory, paradoxical and conflict-filled world, there is one last element of wealth to consider: balance.
<P>
Is health gained through dynamic activity or deep rest? Answer? Balance.
<P>
Shall we accept things as they are, or change things to how we would like them to be? Answer? Balance.
<P>
Shall we increase what we have, or decrease what we want? Answer? Balance.
<P>
Shall we work to get more of what we want, or slow down and enjoy more of what we already have? Answer? Balance.
<P>
And so it goes with all the dilemmas of life. It's not a matter of which side is right and which is wrong. Each is usually both right and wrong, depending on all the other elements of one's life. That's where balance comes inweighing all sides and choosing the direction that would be the best at that moment.
<P>
Balance is dynamic, ever moving, ever changing. Think of a tightrope walker holding a balance pole. One moment it's steady, the next moment it swings wildly to the right. Then it dips violently to the left. Then it's steady again. There is no "right" place for the pole to bethe only "right" thing to do is stay on the tightrope.
<P>
Balance is an intensely personal thing. What is balance for one person may be utter boredom to a second and extreme bravery to a third.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Wealth to us is not mere material for vain glory but an opportunity for achievement; and poverty we think it no disgrace to acknowledge but a real degradation to make no effort to overcome.</I><P>THUCYDIDES<BR>413 B.C. 
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Balance is so important a concept to the understanding and obtaining of wealth that we've devoted the entire last section of this book to it. Much more on balance, then, later.
<P>
And there we have our definition of wealthhealth, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what we want, opportunity, enjoying and balance.
<P>
Do these sound familiar? Of course they doto one degree or another, they describe a portion of you and your life.
<P>
You already <I>are</I> wealthy.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>That must be wonderful; I don't understand it at all.</I><P>MOLIERE<BR>1622 
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Oh, sure, we'd like to have more wealththat's what the rest of this book is about. Realize, however, that in seeking more, you are going from <I>wealthy</I> to <I>wealthier, </I>not from poor to wealthy.
<P>
It's easier to go from wealthy to wealthier than to go from poor to wealthyand a lot more fun, too.
<P>
Begin to notice the health, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what you want, opportunity, enjoying and balance you already have. Remind yourself, over and over:

<H1>WEALTH 101<BR>Wealth Is Much More Than Money</H1>
<H2>PART TWO: MONEY</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE></CENTER><I>
"I am wealthy." My friends, money is not all. It is not money that will mend a broken heart or reassemble the fragments of a dream. Money cannot brighten the hearth nor repair the portals of a shattered home. I refer, of course, to Confederate money.</I><P>
ARTEMUS WARD</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Let's take a look at that thing most people associate with the word <I>wealth</I>--money.
<P>
This will be a brief look, a few chapters at most. In Part Four, "Getting More of What You Want," we'll look at getting more money if, after Part Three, "Enjoying What You've Got," more money is what you choose to get.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>What Is Money?</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Money is the representative of a certain quantity of corn or other commodity. It is so much warmth, so much bread.</I><P>EMERSON
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Money is a symbol of energy.
<P>
If we were, say, chicken farmers, money would represent so many chickens. We can exchange our chickens for a symbol of the energy chickens represent (money), take the symbol to the pig farmer, and exchange it for pigs. We can also trade the symbol of our chicken energy (money) for other services or commodities, from political favors to fax machines.
<P>
This system of "money" saves us lugging chickens all over town. It also allows us to trade with people who have no interest in our commodity. The pig farmer might not want chickenshe wants pomegranates. In order to get pigs, we would have to find a pomegranate grower who wanted chickens, trade him chickens for pomegranates, then trade the pig farmer pomegranates for pigs.
<P>
The "money" system also helps us know the value of things. Rather than an elaborate system detailing how many chickens every other known item is worth, we simply have to know how much "money" chickens are worth, and how much "money" other things are.
<P>
Money as a symbol also allows the pig farmer to buy a smaller portion of pomegranates than the amount he could obtain for a whole pig. ("For one pig you get 128 pomegranates and two chickens." "But I don't <I>want </I>any chickens!") Money, quite simply, helps keep things simple.
<P>
In addition to all this, money is often used as a way of keeping scoreespecially in the game of business. It's not the <I>only</I> way of keeping score, of course, but it's a way that's very popular. Even so, money is still a symbol.
<P>
That's all money is. Just a symbol. Why, then, is money so powerful? Because, as a symbol, it is more universally recognized than Coca Cola. 
<P>
But how important is money<I> really?</I> In the next chapter we'll explore this oft-debated question.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Point/Counterpoint: How Important Is Money? </H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The chief value of money lies in the fact that one lives in a world in which it is overestimated.</I><P>H. L. MENCKEN
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

MODERATOR: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to "Point/Counterpoint." Tonight's question, "How important is money?" Taking the position that money is the most important thing in the world is Gunther Moneylove. Taking the counterposition that money is not very important at all is Felicity Lovelife. Your opening statements, please. First, Mr. Moneylove.
<P>
MONEYLOVE: It's clear that money is the most important thing in the world. It is the most agreed-upon symbol of energy in the world, hence, the most powerful thing in the world. "Money speaks sense in a language all nations understand," wrote Aphra Behn in 1680. More recently, J. R. Ewing agreed: "money speaks all languages."
<P>
MODERATOR: Ms. Lovelife.
<P>
LOVELIFE: Money is just a symbol. We want what the money can buy, not the money itself. Money is just paper and plastic and metal. For the most part, money itself is not very engaging. Some of the pictures on money might be amusinglike the 1920s car on the back of the U.S. &#36;20 bill, or the holograms on the credit cards, but that's about it. Even George Washingtonwhose face is on more money than almost anyoneonce wrote, "It is not a custom with me to keep money to look at."
<P>
MONEYLOVE: Hardly anyone loves money for <I>itself,</I> of course, but for what it represents.
<P>
LOVELIFE: I thought this debate was about money. Money is paper, plastic and metal. If you agree money is not that important, then I've won the debate and we can spend the rest of the program talking about something more interesting.
<P>
MONEYLOVE: Nothing is more interesting than money. Electricity may not be interesting, but what it can do is. It's what money can do that makes it the most importantand interestingthing in the world. 
<P>

<P>
LOVELIFE: The most important things in the world are things that money can't buy.
<P>
MONEYLOVE: Such as?
<P>
LOVELIFE: Such as love. <I>[Sings]</I> "I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love."
<P>
MONEYLOVE: Who wrote that?
<P>
LOVELIFE: Paul McCartney.
<P>
MONEYLOVE: I rest my case. There's one man who knows the power of an English pound. As Henry Ward Beecher said, "Poverty is very good in poems but very bad in the house; very good in maxims and sermons but very bad in practical life."
<P>
LOVELIFE: <I>[Still singing]</I> "Everybody knows it's true. Can't buy me lo-o-o-o-ve, no, no, no, no-o-o-o-o!"
<P>
MONEYLOVE: Money can buy your loved one flowers and candy and trips to Paris and Lexuses and life-saving operations and head starts in careers and romantic poetry on greeting cards. With all these tokens of appreciation, you don't think someone will eventually love you?
<P>
LOVELIFE: Having money is no guarantee that someone will love you.
<P>
MONEYLOVE: And being poor is? Two thousand years ago, in <I>The Art of Love,</I> Ovid wrote, "Gold will buy the highest honors; and gold will purchase love."
<P>
LOVELIFE: Ibsen said, "Money brings you food, but not appetite; medicine, but not health; acquaintances, but not friends."
<P>
MONEYLOVE: "I'm tired of love, I'm tired of rhyme, but money gives me pleasure all the time." Hilaire Belloc.
<P>
LOVELIFE: "Money is like love" wrote Kahlil Gibran; "it kills slowly and painfully the one who withholds it, and it enlivens the other who turns it upon his fellow man."
<P>
MONEYLOVE: As the Yiddish proverb explains, "With money in your pocket, you are wise and you are handsome and you sing well too."

LOVELIFE: Here's another Yiddish proverb: "Pearls around the neckstones upon the heart."
<P>
MONEYLOVE: Speaking of proverbs, how about this from Proverbs 19:4: "Wealth brings many friends, but a poor man's friend deserts him."
<P>
LOVELIFE: "The love of money is the root of all evil." 1 Timothy 6:10.
<P>
MONEYLOVE: "A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things." Ecclesiastes 10:19.
<P>
LOVELIFE: "Watching for riches consumeth the flesh, and the care thereof driveth away sleep." Ecclesiasticus 31:1.
<P>
MODERATOR: Can we agree that the Bible disagrees on this point? And, for the same reason, can we avoid quoting Shakespeare?
<P>
MONEYLOVE: I had some really nice Shakespeare quotes.
<P>
LOVELIFE: Me, too.
<P>
MODERATOR: Can we just move on, please.
<P>
LOVELIFE: I'd like to continue with Thoreau.
<P>
MONEYLOVE: Oh, no. Thoreau.
<P>
LOVELIFE: Thoreau wrote, "Money is not required to buy one necessity of the soul."
<P>
MONEYLOVE: Give me a break. Camus countered that pretention best: "It's a kind of spiritual snobbery that makes people think they can be happy without money."
<P>
LOVELIFE: "Banks are failing all over the country," wrote Thoreau, "but not the sand banks, solid and warm and streaked with bloody blackberry vines. You may run on them as much as you please, even as the crickets do "
<P>
MONEYLOVE: I think I'm going to Thoreau up.
<P>
LOVELIFE: "In these banks, too, and such as these, are my funds deposited, funds of health and enjoyment. Invest in these country banks. Let your capital be simplicity and contentment."
<P>

MONEYLOVE: If he had bought Walden Pond with real money, not "simplicity and contentment," and put it in a solid trust, not "health and enjoyment," maybe they wouldn't be trying to turn Walden Pond into Walden Condo City.
<P>
LOVELIFE: And, finally, this too from Thoreau: "Good for the body is the work of the body, good for the soul the work of the soul, and good for either is the work of the other."
<P>
MONEYLOVE: What does that mean?
<P>
LOVELIFE: I'm not sure, but Thoreau said it, and he's been on my side so far.
<P>
MONEYLOVE: Okay, you want the Transcendentalists? How about Emerson: "Money, which represents the prose of life, and which is hardly spoken of in parlors without an apology, is, in its effects and laws, as beautiful as roses."
<P>
LOVELIFE: Emerson also said, "If a man own land, the land owns him."
<P>
MONEYLOVE: "The world is his, who has money to go over it."
<P>
LOVELIFE: "My cow milks me."
<P>
MONEYLOVE: I'd like to see that.
<P>
LOVELIFE: Emerson also said, "Money often costs too much." He, of course, was referring to the transcendental qualities of lifefriendship, nature, happinesswhich one must often sacrifice in pursuit of mere money.
<P>
MONEYLOVE: Or maybe he just didn't like the interest rate he was getting on his farm loan.
<P>
LOVELIFE: You're bordering on the sacrilegious, you know.
<P>
MONEYLOVE: Nonsense! Look what's written on money: "In God We Trust."
<P>
LOVELIFE: Oh, so now money is more important than God!

MONEYLOVE: Money is <I>worshiped </I>by more people than God. I'm not saying that's right or wrongI'm simply saying what <I>is.</I> "Some men worship rank, some worship heroes, some worship power, some worship God, and over these ideals they dispute" wrote Mark Twain, "but they all worship money."

LOVELIFE: "Money wasn't that important," said George Foreman. "Money doesn't help you sleep. Money doesn't help your mother be well, money doesn't help your brother stay interested in his studies. Money don't help nothing. Money is only good when you've got something else to do with it. A man can lose everything, family, all your dreams, and still have a pocketful of money."
<P>
MONEYLOVE: Touching, but off the point. "Money is indeed the most important thing in the world," wrote Shaw; "and all sound and successful personal and national morality should have this fact for its basis." <I>That</I> is the point.
<P>
LOVELIFE: The point was made 2,100 years ago by Publilius Syrus in one of his maxims: "A good reputation is more valuable than money." It is a point you obviously have ignored.
<P>
MONEYLOVE: Which maxim is that?
<P>
LOVELIFE: 108.
<P>
MONEYLOVE: Ah-ha! By Maxim 656 he had come to his senses: "Money alone sets all the world in motion." And, while we're on the ancients, here's one from Euripides: "Money's the wise man's religion."
<P>
LOVELIFE: When did he write that?
<P>
MONEYLOVE: 425 B.C.
<P>
LOVELIFE: Ah-ha! Twelve years later he discovered the truth and wrote, "only our characters are steadfast, not our gold."

Both.

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Much work is merely a way to make money; much leisure is merely a way to spend it. </I><P>C. WRIGHT MILLS
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

At times, money is the most important thing in our lives. At other times, it's the least. Most of the time it plays a part, as do other things.
<P>
How much more should we want, and how much should we learn to enjoy what we already have? It's our choice. It's a matter of finding our personal balance between the two.
<P>
That's what the remainder of this book will explore.
<P>
The next section, "Enjoying What You've Got," gives suggestions on, if not one <I>end</I> of the continuum, at least one <I>endish</I> of the continuum.
<P>
The section after that, "Getting More of What You Want," focuses on the other end. (There, by the way, is where we'll explore all those practical suggestions on how to get more money.)
<P>
The final section of the book, "Balance," tells how to discover, use and maintain a personal equilibrium between the two extremes. (This, by the way, can produce some wonderful, unknown results.)
<P>
MONEYLOVE: Sounds good to me.
<P>
LOVELIFE: Let's go.

<H1>WEALTH 101<BR>Wealth Is Much More Than Money</H1>
<H2>PART THREE<BR>ENJOYING WHAT YOU'VE GOT</H2>


<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>There are two things to aim at in life: first, to get what you want; and, after that, to enjoy it. Only the wisest of mankind achieve the second.</I><P>LOGAN PEARSALL SMITH
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

While reading through our definition of wealthhealth, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what you want, opportunity, enjoying, and balance you probably had the thought, "I already have some of those."
<P>
Indeed you have.
<P>
It isn't that we aren't already wealthy in many respectswe areit's that we often forget, take things for granted and overlook enjoying what we already have.
<P>
This sectionby far the longest in this bookis designed to enhance our appreciation of and gratitude for the wealth we already have.
<P>
It is abundant.
<P>
But make no mistake about it: making the changes necessary to enjoy more is hard work. Change may not be hard physical work, but, when the habit of nonenjoyment is strong, it is hard emotional and mental work.
<P>
In other words, when we're miserable, we're being lazy. Most people won't do the work.
<P>
This section of the book outlines the work that is cut out for us. It's full of ideas, concepts, suggestions and exercises, all designed to enhance appreciation of the moment and gratitude for what already is.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>What Is Enjoyment?</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Joy is the feeling of grinning inside.</I><P>DR. MELBA COLGROVE</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
As we mentioned earlier, we consider enjoyment to have two primary componentsappreciation and gratitude. To fully enjoy something, we must first appreciate it, like it, savor it. This is fun, of course, but when we add the second elementgratitudewe add thankfulness to the appreciation and have full, rounded, heartfelt enjoyment.
<P>
"All of the animals except man," wrote Samuel Butler, "know that the principal business of life is to enjoy it." "There is no such thing as the pursuit of happiness," observed Joyce Grenfell, "but there is the discovery of joy." And, as it states in the Chinese proverb (which is a nice way of saying we probably got it from a fortune cookie), "One joy scatters a hundred griefs."
<P>
No amount of material possession produces wealth. Enjoying what we haveno matter how much or how little it may beis what makes us wealthy. "Wealth is not his that has it," wrote Benjamin Franklin, "but his that enjoys it."
<P>
The endless pursuit of things at the expense of enjoying what we already have is often referred to as being caught "on the treadmill." Fred Allen called it "the treadmill to oblivion." "If your capacity to acquire has outstripped your capacity to enjoy," observed Glen Buck, "you are on the way to the scrap-heap."
<P>
The things to enjoy are the things that are in front ofand withinus. The time to enjoy them is now. "We may lay in a stock of pleasures, as we would lay in a stock of wine," wrote Charles Colton in 1825; "but if we defer tasting them too long, we shall find that both are soured with age."
<P>
Too many people postpone the enjoyment of life until some vaguely specified "later," when some goal or person or ability has been obtained. "May we never let the things we can't have, or don't have, or shouldn't have, spoil our enjoyment of the things we do have and can have," cautioned Richard Evans. "As we value our happiness let us not forget it, for one of the greatest lessons in life is learning to be happy without the things we cannot or should not have."
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.</I><P>CICERO
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Enjoyment not only erases past hurts; it is easily stored, ready to dissolve future disappointments before they are even felt. "No enjoyment, however inconsiderable, is confined to the present moment," said Sydney Smith. "A man is the happier for life from having made once an agreeable tour, or lived for any length of time with pleasant people, or enjoyed any considerable interval of innocent pleasure."
<P>
The element of enjoyment that seems to make it linger the longest is gratitude. As the French say, "Gratitude is the heart's memory."
<P>
Enjoyment is not just found in stopping and observing, but also in action, in doing. "There is the true joy of life:" wrote George Bernard Shaw, "to be used by a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; to be thoroughly worn out before being thrown on the scrap heap; to be a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that life will not devote itself to making you happy."
<P>
Life will not devote itself to making you happyor making you joyful. <I>You</I> must devote yourself to that. "Enjoyment is <I>not</I> a goal," wrote Paul Goodman; "it is a feeling that accompanies important ongoing activity." Who decides what is "important"? You, of course.
<P>
Being involved in the worthwhile cause of spreading joy to others seems to rub off on the giver. "The very society of joy redoubles it," wrote Robert South; "so that, while it lights upon my friend, it rebounds upon myself, and the brighter his candle burns, the more easily will it light mine."
<P>
Of course, our best advice is: light your own fire, discover the appreciation and gratitude for whatever is around and within yourself right now.
<P>

<H2>Why It's Amazing We Ever Enjoy Anything</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I wish I knew how customs like this get started; it would make them easier to stamp out.</I><P>MARTIN LANE<BR>"THE PATTY DUKE SHOW"
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Since enjoyment is so healing, nurturing and, well, <I>enjoyable</I> why don't we feel it all the time? Answer: we have a lot of strikes against usdeep-seated biological, cultural and psychological programmingthat are as real as gravity, and as limiting to enjoyment as gravity is to levitation.
<P>
As we explore each, do your best not to get <I>too</I> depressed. Knowing what we're up against in our journey toward more enjoyment is, in fact, a positive thing.
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Our Filtering Brains </H3></CENTER>
<P>
Although our five senses deliver to our brains billions of bits of information each second, we are unaware of most of them. This is because the brain automatically filters them from our conscious awareness. What is and is not allowed to pass into conscious awareness is a matter of programming. Much of the programming is biologicalour brains just came that way. Some of the programming is culturalour parents, teachers and society that shaped us. A bit of it is of our own doing.
<P>
The biological programming of our brain filters out everything that's not changing, not moving, not new. In the days of wild beasts, this biological programming made sensein a landscape worthy of an impressionist canvas, the only thing our ancestors wanted to know was, "Where's the meat?" The meat tended to be on the move (as compared to, say, trees), so what moved was more important than what stood still. In addition, when our ancestors stood the risk of <I>becoming </I>the meat (dinner), the threat was usually in the form of something movingthis time toward our forebears. Filtering out all but the moving, the changing and the new helped our ancestors survive.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Our memories are card indexes consulted, and then put back in disorder by authorities whom we do not control.</I><P>CYRIL CONNOLLY
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

The major problem with this biological programming today is that (A) we don't need it (meat these days just lies there in packages in the supermarket, and wild beasts are for the most part confined to nature documentaries), and (B) we take much of the good in our lives for granted.
<P>
When we consider all that is good in our lives, we notice thatfor the most partit is not changing, moving or new. Sure, some of the good is doing at least one of those, but most of it has been steadily there for a while.
<P>
Take our bodies, for example. If we have a pain in our arm and the pain stops, our arm feels good. After a while, however, the arm feels pretty much like all the other parts of our body that are not in pain, and is again ignored. When we're not in pain, we're seldom aware that our body is free from pain. That our body is free from pain is, of course, a good thing, but a good thing that we, most of the time, take for granted.
<P>
Why? Because the brain is filtering from our conscious awareness signals from our body saying, "A-OK." We don't need to consciously know 10,000 times a second that our middle toe is not hurting, so the information is filtered out. Unfortunately, we also are filtering out the "good" contained in a pain-free middle toe.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>A good memory is one trained to forget the trivial.</I><P>CLIFTON FADIMAN
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

This taking things for granted applies to all the functioning of the body, from digestion to vision to the process of thinking itselfwhen working OK, we're not aware that it's working OK, and therefore not aware of the goodness inherent in that.
<P>
It's also true for things outside ourselves. The new car is so wonderful when it's new. After a few weeks, however, it becomes "the car." It's the same car; we've just become accustomed to it. The same is true of most relationships. At first it's "some enchanted evening," and eventually it's "your week to take out the garbage." It's not that the car or the relationship (or anything else you care to name) is not still good, or that we wouldn't miss it if it were no longer in our life. It's just that we've filtered out all that wasn't changing, moving or new about it.
<P>
We simply aren't<I> aware </I>of the good that is aroundor withinus for any length of time. If we're not aware of it, we don't appreciate it, and if we don't appreciate it, we're not likely to feel grateful for ithence enjoyment is not.

<H3>Childhood Programming</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Dad worked hard for us, he provided for us, and he certainly didn't want to have to talk to us on top of that.</I><P>KEVIN ARNOLD<BR>"THE WONDER YEARS"
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Our minds are also programmed by our parents, teachers, society and all those influences that are generally called "the environment." Some of this programming is intentionalthere are certain things the environment<I> wants</I> us to knowand some of it is unintentionalthe environment doesn't exactly <I>want </I>us to know it, but it gets programmed into us just the same.
<P>
Some common examples of the intentional programming: walk on your feet, speak a certain language, wear clothes, the potty's over here, and so on. Some of the unintentional programming includesfor most peoplestay average, fit in, you can't truly be happy until you love someone who loves you back, don't rock the boat and so on.
<P>
Some of the childhood programming robs us of enjoyment because, after all, "you're getting to be big now and you can't enjoy yourself all the time." We are directly trained to stop enjoying and start behaving. If it's a choice between enjoying ourselves and doing what some authority figure wants, guess what we're programmed to do? Good-bye to<I> lots</I> of enjoyment. 
<P>
Some of the childhood programming robs us of enjoyment because, when we want to do something enjoyable, we've been taught it's not right, not natural, not normalwhich is a way of saying "not average," or, "if you don't conform, we won't know what to do with you, and we want to know what to do with you all the time, so knock it off." And, as there is no such thing as an "average person," we, sooner or later, want to do something unaverage; therefore we can't enjoy it to the full because, after all, "something inside tells me this just isn't right." That something was not "you"; it was just cultural programming.
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Our Own Programming</H3>
<P>
As we go through life, in addition to what we are taughtintentionally or unintentionallyby the outer environment, we also do our own programming. We make decisions about what's going on. Sometimes these decisions are conscious and sometimes they're not, but decisions are made and, through them, we program ourselves.

As a child we might, for example, feel let down or betrayed, so we decide, "Nobody can be trusted. I'm not going to trust anymore." Or, we might tell the truth about something, and get punished for it. "The truth hurts," we decide. "I'm not going to tell the truth anymore." We can program those decisions deep in our minds.
<P>
Most of these decisions are made based upon the relative helplessness and powerlessness of a child. When we grow to adulthoodwith far more ability to help ourselves and considerably more power than childrenwe still abide by these rules. We don't even know they're rules, usually; we don't see them as decisions we made and programming we did on ourselves long ago. It's "just the way I am."
<P>
One of the most insidious decisions most of us make about ourselves to one degree or another is that we're not good enough, undeserving, <I>unworthy.</I>
<P>
Children are, for the most part, raised on the "don't" system. They do whatever they do, and when they do something "wrong," they are corrected. All the "right" things they do are usually not praised as much as the "wrong" things are criticized, so the child can easily conclude, "I can't do anything right," or "I can never get what I want." Eventually a decision is made, "If I can't do anything right and I can't get what I want, I guess I must not be good enough. I'm not worthy."
<P>
This unworthiness is such a fundamental destroyer of enjoyment that it has chapters of its own in this section. For now, however, we'll just include unworthiness as one of the many reasons why it's amazing that we ever enjoy ourselvesever.

<H3>The Fight or Flight Response</H3></CENTER>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>


In addition to the brain automatically filtering out almost all of the ongoing good, the body also has a mechanism that almost always overreacts to any perceived "bad." This mechanism is known as the fight or flight response.
<P>
When we perceive danger, the body automatically prepares to battle the intruding evil (fight), or to run away from it (flight). Although this response can be triggered casually, the body does not respond in a casual way. The fight or flight response prepares the body to fight or flee<I> for its life.</I>
<P>
In days past, this reaction was essential to survival. Our ancestors lived in hostile environments, with carnivorous beasts far more physically powerful than humans. We, as a species, needed an extra edge, and that edge was constantly being <I>on </I>edgeever on the lookout for danger; responding instantly to danger with a full-scale rallying of our biological might.
<P>
Todayin the Western world, at leastthis need to fight or flee <I>for our lives</I> has become both unnecessary and damaging. The very response that kept us alive as a species for millions of years is now killing us. Any number of life-threatening illnesses are caused or assisted in their progress by the repeated triggering of the fight or flight response. (For a further study of this, please see my book <A HREF="http://www.mcwilliams.com/books/luxtoc.html><I>You Can't Afford the Luxury of a Negative Thought:</I></A> <I>A Book for People with Any Life-Threatening Illness Including Life. </I>1-800-LIFE-101)
<P>
More to the purpose of this chapter, however, are not the long-term effects of the fight or flight response on our mortality, but the short-term, daily, almost continual effects the response has upon our well-beingupon our enjoyment of life.
<P>
Almost any perceived negative occurrenceeither real or imagined, within us or outside us, involving us or not involving us, actually happening or merely a possibilitytriggers the fight or flight response. We feel one or both of the emotions most closely associated with the responseanger, the energy to fight; and fear, the energy to flee.
<P>

For the most part, fear and anger are not considered "enjoyable" emotions, although some people have certainly learned to enjoy the "rush" of themthe feeling of "being alive." When we think of enjoyable emotions, however, anger and fear are usually not at the top of our list.
<P>
When the fight or flight response is triggered, the mind begins looking for additional danger, additional things "wrong" with the situation. More so than usual, it filters out any "good" in the environment. It's looking for <I>wild beasts,</I> for heaven's sake, not beautiful sunsets. Remember, our lives depend upon finding the wild beasts long before they find us.
<P>
This, being life, is far from perfect (at least insofar as "perfect" is created in our imaginations), so there's always <I>something </I>that's not right; some portion of our plan is always in danger. Hence, some people live much of their lives in an almost continual angry or fearful (fight/flight) condition. Hardly a conducive condition to enjoying the moment.
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>The Negativity around Us</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The fight or flight response feels right at home in the world created by what is broadly called "the media." Newspapers and newscasts give us news of what? Mostly fresh disasters. It's not really, "What's new?" but "What's new <I>and bad?"</I> that sells papers and gets ratings. Even if it means leaving out facts, or slanting a story, the bad side of any occurrence (or person) is what sells.
<P>
In the more admittedly fictional world, things are not much betterin many cases, in fact, they are worse. By the time a child is ten, he or she has witnessed 100,000 acts of violence and 8,000 murders on television. How many murders does one see in real life? Not that many, probably. And yet, we have the image that people would just as soon kill each other as eat together. For a while, in movies it was difficult to see even a romantic comedy that didn't have murder as part of the plot.
<P>
Then there are all the horror films, slash-and-gash films, psychotic- on-the- loose films, your-babysitter- is-really-a-mutant- serial- killer- robotic- assassin- from- Mars films, and so on.

Then there are the <I>people</I> around us. Gossip, limitation and "Oh, what a cruel, cruel, unfair world this is" seem to be the primary subjects of many people's conversation. In fact, the Ain't-It-Awful Club meets every weekday afternoon from 5:00 till 7:00 in cocktail lounges and bars all over the country. For the price of a drink (and from 5:00 to 7:00 they're two-for-one), you can tell another how terrible your life isproviding you are willing to give the listener equal time to try and top your tragedies with examples of his or her own. For some unknown reason, this period of time is known as The Happy Hour.
<P>
All of this environmental negativity is bound to affect us. It's easy to believe that the world is a much worse place than it actually is. Enjoying ourselves doesn't fit into a world of such profound negativity. We can easily feel when we're enjoying something that (A) we're taking more than our share, as there obviously isn't much enjoyment to go around, so we should feel guilty and somehow "put some back"; or (B) our present-moment enjoyment is just a fluke, a moment of luck, a passing flash of fortune, and cannot possibly last; therefore we shouldn't enjoy it too much, because it will be gone soon and the more we enjoy it now, the more we'll miss it laterand the later is coming real soon. Not very enjoyable.

<H3>Entropy</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Here's a law, like gravity. Although the name of this law is less common, its effects are generally as well known as gravity's. In an oversimplified way, the law of entropy goes like this: if you're not putting energy into something to make it better, it's going to get worse. Nothing stays the same. If we're not actively involved in building something up, it's being torn down.
<P>
In life we see this all around: paint peels, metal rusts (or tarnishes), wood rots, cement crumbles, unattended businesses deteriorate, and people, well, people we leave alone find other people.

This law, obviously, tells us that we have to work hard just to keep in place. No time to enjoy! While I'm enjoying this, that is falling apart. Excuse me, I must run and take care of that.
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>We're Always Recovering from Something</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Most people are trained to postpone enjoyment until everything is taken care of, handled, all better. That's a perfectly rational-sounding idea. In practice, however, it happens to be just another of those "rational lies" we tell ourselves that rob us of enjoyment.
<P>
The fact is, we're always recovering from something. We stub our toe, and just as that's almost better we suffer an emotional loss, and about the time we're over that, the car gets a flat tire, and when the tire's almost fixed, the mechanic tells us we need a brake job, and when we have the money for the brake job, we get a cold, and just as the cold is almost gone, we discover we gained back seven of the five pounds we lost the last time we dieted, and just as we're about to lose the last pound on the new diet
<P>
In other words, it seems as though we always have <I>something</I> to be genuinely worried about. The difficulty is the persuasive cultural myth that tells us: until there's nothing to worry about, we can't (or at least shouldn't) enjoy ourselves.
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>The Glamour Trap</H3>
<P>
Glamour is a cultural conditioning that says simply because something is new, improved, desired by others, popular or in demand, we should want it<I>desperately.</I> Glamour basically tells us that we shouldn't want what <I>we</I> want, we should want what we<I> should </I>want.
<P>
Who decides what we should want? Madison Avenue, fashion mavens, the media. Who decides whether their "should" is a genuine should? Popular opinion. If something is successful, it must be good; therefore we should all want it.
<P>
Glamour makes fertile ground for at least six of the Seven Deadly Sins. (A sin, by the way, is simply missing the mark, a mistake. We are punished by our sins, not<I> for</I> them.)

<P>
About the only Deadly Sin glamour does not directly incite is<I> sloth. </I>(Actually, it does invite a slothful attitude toward the pursuit of our own goalsthe ones that come from our heartso maybe it's seven out of seven.)
<P>
With glamour, what we have is never enough. Who has time to enjoy what we've got when there's so much new, improved and popular yet to get?
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>The Upward Mobility Treadmill</H3>
<P>
A close cousin to glamour (perhaps even an offspring) is upward mobility. Most of us are trained from early childhood that nothing is ever enoughthere is always more to get, more to do, and we must, therefore, get it and do it.
<P>
Humans have a natural desire to always want to do more, become better at what we really love doing and grow more as people.
<P>
Upward mobility, however, says we should want more! better! faster! about not just what we love and are naturally drawn toward, but about everything.
<P>
We're trained to keep up with the Joneses. Why? Don't ask questions! There isn't time! The Browns are gaining on us! Wanting more for the sake of more is a great eliminator of joy. "There's no time to enjoy this successI must immediately move on to the next!"

Anxiety is a form of fear. "Anxiety is the space between the `now' and the `then,'" explained Fritz Perls. Anxiety is an upward-thrusting energy. It demands we do something <I>right now </I>about closing the gap between "now" and "then." The fight or flight response is triggered, and the body wants to take actionproductive, physical action<I>right away.</I> "Getting an idea should be like sitting down on a pin," said E. L.

We can't <I>do </I>anything about the thing we want to do, but the energy to do remains. We can't do anything about it because, for the most part,<I> they won't let us.</I> Grrrrr.
<P>
Along comes the anger side of the fight or flight response. It comes in the form of depression. Depression is a downward-pushing energy. It meets the upward-thrusting anxiety. Our own fight (anger/depression) or flight (fear/anxiety) response has a pushing match inside us. The energies wrestle each other to a standstill. The result is inaction. It's an uneasy peace, but it keeps us from tearing phones off walls, "making a scene," or in some other way "killing the messenger."
<P>
In our swift progression as a species from running from beasts to standing in line at banks, from hunting to hunt and peck (a few centuries of culture thinly layered over millions of years of biological evolution), our inner reactions have not yet caught up with outer realities. Result: anxiety and depression.

We remain animals, but are cut off from nature. We lose our joy, our wonder, our awe. "Joy, interrupted now and again by pain and terminated ultimately by death, seems the normal course of life in Nature," observed Joseph Krutch. "Anxiety and distress, interrupted occasionally by pleasure, is the normal course of man's existence."
<P>
To quote the Japanese proverb: "Every little yielding to anxiety is a step away from the natural heart of man."
<P>
In addition to this, we are trained as children to get good grades, get a good job, get a good spouse, get children, get ahead. In all this getting we get something else: anxiety and depression.
<P>
"He worked like hell in the country so he could live in the city," observed Don Marquis, "where he worked like hell so he could live in the country." This is typical of the hamster wheel on which many people spin their lives.
<P>
We ask ourselves the wrong questions. "How can I get this new and desirable thing?" rather than "How can I more fully enjoy what I already have?" Anxiety-producing questions produce anxiety-producing answers.
<P>
Then the cultural programming that says "Be nice" enters. We use depression to keep the anxiety in check. We postpone action to a more "appropriate" time. This causes more anxiety, which causes
<P>
It's the fight or flight response as experienced in modern, daily life. In its extreme, it's a clinical illness called manic-depression. The extreme elation and severe depression of a manic-depressive are painful to watch. 
<P>
Equally painful is the mirror a manic-depressive holds up to our own lives. We may not have the extremes of mania and depression, but we recognize all too well the anxiety-depression struggle: impatience and resignation, overcommitment, spending more than we make, excess and abstinenceit has many forms. It is also referred to as bi-polar behavior.
<P>
One thing's for sure: swinging radically between the pole of anxiety and the pole of depression is not enjoyable. As Seneca pointed out, "The mind that is anxious about the future is miserable." Or this from Ecclesiasticus 30:24: "Jealousy and anger shorten life, and anxiety brings on old age too soon."

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Adam was human; he didn't want the apple for the apple's sake; he wanted it because it was forbidden.</I><P>MARK TWAIN
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Where did all this come from? Where did we break from the rest of nature? When did we leave the garden? When did we fall? What was the first mistake we humans madethe first sin? (<I>Sin</I> comes from a Roman archery term meaning "to miss the mark.") How did humanity blow it?
<P>
An answer can be found in the story of Adam and Eve. Taken either literally or metaphorically, it does provide an explanation to the age-old question,<I> "What happened?!"</I>
<P>
In the beginning all was well. God made heaven and earth, planted a garden called Eden, made man from the dust of the earth and took him to the garden to tend it. This was Adam. The birds and the beasts were to eat all the green plants, and Adam was given all the seed-bearing plants and seed-bearing fruits as food.
<P>
In the middle of the garden were two trees: "the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" (Genesis 2:9). (All the following chapter and verse references will be from Genesis.)
<P>
In the midst of all this abundance and joy there was only one stipulation: "You are free to eat from any tree of the garden," God told Adam; "but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die" (2:16-17).
<P>
All the creatures were brought to Adam, and he named them. But among them, no suitable helper for Adam was found. So God put Adam to sleep, took a rib from him, and made Eve.
<P>
Everything went along swimmingly until the serpent started talking to Eve. "Did God really say, `You must not eat from any tree in the garden?'" (3:1).
<P>
Eve answered, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, but God did say, `You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'"(3:2-3).
<P>
Ah! The first Communication Breakdown. Either Adam in the telling, or Eve in the listening, or both, got the information not quite right. God was misquoted for the firstand certainly not the lasttime.
<P>
First, there were <I>two</I> trees in the middle of the garden, "the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" (2:9). Second, God never said the humans couldn't <I>touch</I> the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, God said they couldn't <I>eat</I> it (2:17).
<P>

<P><BR>

Back to our story. "You will not surely die," the serpent told Eve, "For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil" (3:4-5).
<P>
So, Eve took a stroll to the middle of the garden. When she "saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it" (3:6).
<P>
Here we come to the first popular misunderstanding concerning the story. Almost any school child, when asked "What fruit did Eve eat?" will answer, "An apple." The child, in almost any school, would be told, "Correct." And yet, it is not.
<P>
The fruit was almost certainly not an appleor any other fruit we know today. Genesis 1:29: "Then God said, `I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.'"
<P>
As an apple is a "fruit with seed in it," it was OK to eat. The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil must have been a seedless variety.
<P>
We mention this because there's a great deal of information people <I>think</I> came from the Bibleand other sources of wisdom, inspiration or authoritythat simply did not come from there. The truth is often the opposite of popular belief. Our suggestion on thisas in all thingsis: check it out for yourself.
<P>
Back again to our story. Adam, who happened to be with Eve, also ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. "Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked" (3:7).
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>He was not made for climbing the tree of knowledge.</I><P>SIGRID UNDSET

<P><BR>

They, of course, had been naked all alongor perhaps we should say they were <I>nude</I> or <I>au natural.</I> Eden was, after all, a clothing-optional garden. What happened was that Adam and Eve <I>realized</I> they were nude, and put the judgment of "good and evil" on it (in this case, "evil") and called themselves <I>naked.</I>
<P>
They <I>realized.</I> It was the first of many "real-lies" that "the knowledge of good and evil" has brought to humanity. Without the "real-lies-ation" that this is good and that is evil, everything simply <I>is.</I> Both this and that can be enjoyed equally. We are not <I>pushing for</I> this and <I>fighting against</I> that. Hence, no anxiety. No depression.
<P>
Sure, there's fear and there's painbut there's no <I>fear</I> of fear, or <I>fear </I>of pain. There's no "I shouldn't feel pain" or "I mustn't feel fear." Should, must, have-to, ought-to, got-toperhaps these are the true fruits of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They certainly are its by-products.
<P>
Having "realized" nakedness was evil, Adam and Eve did what they could to cover themselves by sewing fig leaves together. This must not have worked very well, because when God came strolling through the garden, they hid.
<P>
"Where are you?" asked God (3:9).
<P>
"I heard you in the garden," answered Adam, "and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid" (3:10).
<P>
"Who told you that you were naked?" asked God (3:11). At this point it's hard not to add human qualities to God. One can almost see Him reacting to Adam as a parent might when asked by his child, "If the cat happened to get in the washing machine, would putting it in the drier dry it off again?" or, when the child is older, a phone call that begins, "Is the car insurance paid up?" The whole picture of what happenedand all the ramifications of itcome together in a sudden, painful flash.
<P>
"Have you been eating of the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?" (3:11). (Yes, apparently God does occasionally end a sentence with a preposition, at least in the New International Version.)
<P>
Adam answers, proving he has mastered blame and irresponsibility: "The woman you put here with meshe gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it" (3:12). Not only was it the woman's fault; it was also God's, because, after all, "you put [her] here with me."
<P>
God turned to Eve and asked, "What is this you have done?" and Evetaking her cue from Adamblamed the snake. "The serpent deceived me, and I ate" (3:13).

So God passed out punishmentswhich might have been punishments, or might have been reasonable predictions to a couple of humans who now have the knowledge of good and evil, right and wrong, should and should not, must and must not.
<P>
Adam and Eve were forced to leave the garden because, as God explained to either Himself or some other heavenly beings who might have been with Him, "The man has now become like one of us, knowing good from evil." (Who <I>was</I> He talking to???) "He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever" (3:22).
<P>
We like to interpret this to mean that, knowing good from evil and <I>not </I>being a god is tough enough, but to be caught in that position <I>forever </I>is torture beyond belief. (It's interesting to note that God never forbade them from eating of the tree of life. Living forever without judging everything as either good or evil wouldn't be so bad. They just ate of the wrong tree.)
<P>
Knowing good from evil is the original sinthe original mistakeof humanity. It brought the bitter fruit of should, must, have-to and all the others into the world. Shall we blame God? Adam? Eve? The serpent? Or shall we just accept it as the way things are, as what is?

<H2>The Myth of the Ideal</H2>
<P>
The human imagination is a wonder of creation. In an instant it can transport us from the Eiffel Tower to the Statue of Liberty to the Grand Canyon to a lunar landing vehicle go-carting on the surface of the moonall while we're sitting and reading a book.
<P>
The imagination is also responsible for all the progress made by humanity. It can see a house where there is no house, a light bulb where there is a kerosene lamp, a radio where there is a music box, a television where there is a radio, health where there is illness, peace where there is discord.
<P>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Humans can imagine an improvement for almost every situation or activity they touch, and, with action to back it up, can often make that imagined improvement real. For humanity, the imagination is a powerful source of health, strength, safety, comfort, progress, success, wealth and life itself.
<P>
Alas, it is also the source of most of our miseries.
<P>
Because the imagination can make an improvement on almost anything, it never quite knows when to stop and enjoy the improvements that have already been made.
<P>
Seeing how something can be improved to perfection is often called <I>the ideal.</I> The Germans call it <I>verstang.</I> When our imagination projects its ideal view of what we and others <I>must, should,</I> and<I> ought to</I> be, enjoyment is nowhere to be found. We can't enjoy anything until it's<I> improved:</I> brighter, cleaner, newer<I>better. </I>
<P>
What is, is never enough.
<P>
When what is gets close to the ideal, the ideal changesit improves again; it becomes greater, higher, finer, better. As Josh Billings pointed out, "It ain't so much trouble to get rich as it is to tell when we have got rich." Enough is somehow never enough.
<P>
Now, in a selected area of lifeour specialty, our big dream, our heart's desirethis striving for an ideal may help bring out the best in us. The problem is that we have an ideal about almost <I>every</I> part of life. We think that in career, relationships, romance, religion, social, political, environmental and just about all other areas of life, that just because we imagine how something <I>could </I>be better, it<I> should</I> be better.
<P>
And we suffer for it. At the very least, we don't enjoy what we already have because we're attached to how it should be improved. "Castles in the air cost a vast deal to keep up," Baron Lytton pointed out. Included in the cost is the emotional torment we suffer when we demand that our "should" should be met.
<P>
This "should" is often called <I>expectation.</I> It's another word for the original sin of knowing good from evil. We expect the world to live up to our ideals; we place an emotionally backed <I>demand </I>that it <I>must.</I> When the world doesn't live up to it (which, of course, is most of the time), we're not happy.
<P>
Somerset Maugham explained, "American women expect to find in their husbands a perfection that English women only hope to find in their butlers."
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>We need some imaginative stimulus, some not impossible ideal such as may shape vague hope, and transform it into effective desire, to carry us year after year, without disgust, through the routine work which is so large a part of life.</I><P>WALTER PATER<BR>1885
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

All of this gets worse, of course, when we apply our ideals to <I>ourselves.</I> We seem to be constantly compiling an ideal of how we should behow we should look, what we should accomplish, what we should say, how we should feel and what we should think. We seem to take the best from the bestthe greatest attributes of our greatest heroes, both real and fictionaland strive to make it our own.
<P>
That it can't be done seldom enters our mind. It<I> must</I> be done, and done<I> now!</I> Or else! Or else what? Anxiety and depression. "It is not materialism that is the chief curse of the world," wrote H. L. Mencken, "but idealism. Men get into trouble by taking their visions and hallucinations too seriously."
<P>
Another problem with the ideal is that some ideals are so high, some people might never even begin. The gap between where we are and the best that's been done thus far is so great, we can become discouraged from the start.
<P>
Let's say we wanted to write a poem. Here's what Coleridge had to say in 1817 about the ideal that we, as potential poets, should strive for:
<P>
"The poet, described in ideal perfection, brings the whole soul of man into activity, with the subordination of its faculties to each other, according to their relative worth and dignity. He diffuses a tone and spirit of unity, that blends, and (as it were) fuses, each into each, by that synthetic and magical power imagination."
<P>
If a poet is expected to do all <I>that, </I>why bother trying?
<P>
Ideals rob us of doing things simply for the fun of it. We must do something well at first, and then strive to get better and better. This attitude is not only unenjoyable; it's also exhausting.
<P>
At root, the demands we place against reality are lies. They are not the truth. They are an idealwhat <I>could </I>be, not what <I>must</I> be. "Don't use that foreign word `ideals,'" wrote Henrik Ibsen in 1884. "We have that excellent native word `lies.'" Most of the harm is done when we believe the lies to be true. "The visionary denies the truth to himself," explained Nietzsche in 1879, "the liar only to others." "The truth is what is," said Lenny Bruce, "what should be is a dirty lie."
<P>
The solution? We'll be discussing that in great detail later. For now, be consoled and, perhaps, re-idealized by this from H. F. Hedge: "What we need most, is not so much to realize the ideal as to idealize the real."
<P>
"The true ideal is not opposed to the real," explained James Russell Lowell, "but lies in it; and blessed are the eyes that find it."
<P>

<H2>The Two Primary Barriers to Enjoyment</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>There are joys which long to be ours. God sends ten thousand truths, which come about us like birds seeking inlet; but we are shut up to them, and so they bring us nothing, but sit and sing awhile upon the roof, and then fly away.</I><P>HENRY WARD BEECHER
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

We have found that all of this programmingboth biological and socialreflects itself in two primary barriers to enjoyment. These are <I>unworthiness</I> and <I>ingratitude.</I>
<P>
<I>Unworthiness</I> tells us we're not good enough for what we want, so we don't pursue it, so we don't get it. Further, unworthiness tells us we're not good enough for what we already <I>have.</I> This causes a low-level guilt that permeates our lives. Unworthiness causes our lives to be self-fulfilled prophecies of doom and gloom. "She not only expects the worst," Michael Arlen described it, "but makes the worst of it when it happens."
<P>
<I>Ingratitude</I> takes the opposite position: what we have is not good enough for <I>us.</I> Why be grateful for a one-bedroom apartment when we want a four-bedroom house? "Life is a hospital," Baudelaire observed, "in which every patient is possessed by the desire to change his bed." There's always something to find wrong with anything, and as long as something's wrong, why be thankful? "There was never a banquet so sumptuous," says the French proverb, "but someone dined poorly at it."
<P>
Unworthiness and ingratitude effectively destroy enjoyment and all other forms of wealth in our lives.
<P>

<H2>Unworthiness</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>To avoid criticism, do nothing, say nothing,be nothing.</I><P>ELBERT HUBBARD
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

One of the most unfortunateand probably the most destructivedecisions children can make about themselves is that they are undeserving, not good enough, unworthy.
<P>
It is, however, easy to see how this decision can be madeeven in the best-raised children.
<P>
Childhood is a time of discovery; of unparalleled, intensive learning. All that distinguishes a gooing, gaaing almost totally helpless infant from a walking, talking, remarkably self-sufficient almost-adult of, say, ten must be learned.
<P>
From birth to two years old, in fact, is the most intense learning period of our lives. <I>Everything</I> must be learned. The learning process goes on every waking hour. No wonder infants sleep so much. All that learning is exhausting!
<P>
Children learn, for the most part, by trial-and-error. They have an insatiable curiosity and an innate ability to imitate. If it's in their environment, they want to see it, touch it, fondle it, put it in their mouths and explore it in any way in order to learn about it.
<P>
When children are seeing, touching, fondling, mouthing and exploring things that are all right for them to see, touch, fondle, mouth and explore, the parents stand by and let the process happen. Food and toys seem to be particularly acceptable areas of exploration. (Hence our cultural preoccupation with eating and playthings, perhaps?)
<P>
When children want to see, touch, fondle, mouth and explore things that are <I>not</I> acceptable, they hear about itoften in no uncertain terms. "No." "Stop." "Don't do that." Making something forbidden, of course, only arouses curiosity, and the child tries again with even more determination. The no's get stronger until (A) the object is removed, (B) the child is removed, or (C) a suitable substitute of exploration is offered.
<P>
In a typical day of exploration, the praise for successful learning is usually far outweighed by the "no," "don't," "stop that," "shame," "bad," and "wrong" of correction. Over time, what is remembered is (A) long periods of noninteraction with The Adults; (B) a few moments of praise, and (C) a lot of "don'ts"supported, perhaps, by some sort of punishment.
<P>
As a child grows, the successfully learned behavior that once garnered praise soon becomes expected. "Six months ago I got praise for taking one step; now I'm walking all over the place and they don't even notice." In fact, the very things that were once the cause of praise can become the source of correction. Drawing a picture on paper is great; drawing an even better picture on a wall is not.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>School Principal: I'm sure your children will be very happy here. Gomez: If we'd wanted them to be happy, we would've let them stay at home.</I><P>"THE ADDAMS FAMILY"
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

While repeated successful behavior becomes expected and is soon no longer praised, repeated unsuccessful ("bad") behavior receives ever-increasing scorn. "I do all this stuff right and nothing; then I do this one thing wrong and BOOM!"
<P>
In this environment, it's easy for children to conclude that they are simply unable to do right, that there must be something wrong with them, that they just aren't good enough.
<P>
This set of circumstances usually gets worse when the child starts school. "Mastered printing the alphabet? Now let's try cursive writing." "Got addition down? Let's tackle subtraction. (And wait till we get to long division!)"
<P>
In addition to the learn-everything-fast treadmill, school also exposes children to organized competition and world-class comparisons. "Why aren't you as well-behaved as Suzie? Why can't you spell as well as John? Why don't you excel in history like Janet?" and on and on. We are expected to be as good in each subject as the best person in the class.
<P>
Then there are the taunts and harsh comparisons children make about each other, the "in" groups one is on the out with, the bullies, the gossips, the tattletales, the teacher's petsthe world, it seems, supports our original decision that we somehow aren't good enough.
<P>
This unworthiness limits our enjoyment in two ways. First, it prevents us from getting the things we truly want. We don't feel deserving of our dream, so we accept the programming of anotheror the cultureand pursue some goal not our own. Naturally, we do this without the full enthusiasm we would have for a goal of our own choosing, so we don't even achieve the programmed goal too well. We end up without what we want, and with only a part of what "they" wanted us to have. This is not a joyful situation.
<P>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Second, the good that does come our way is suspect. "If you love me, an unworthy person, there must be something wrong with you," or, as Stephen Sondheim wrote, "Thank you for the present, but what's wrong with the stuff?" or, as Groucho Marx said, "I refuse to join any club that would have me as a member." Unworthiness always has us looking for the catch, the angle, the small print.
<P>
When told of good news, what's the first thing many people say? "Oh, no!" or, "I can't believe it!" Unworthiness won't let us believe it. We even feel guilty that goodness is in the hands of an unworthy being such as ourselves.
<P>
Rather than deal with the underlying unworthiness, many people cover their low self-worth with overconfidencea bravado and a self-assurance that is overwhelming. 
<P>
A sure sign of this false confidence is ingratitude.
<P>

<H2>Ingratitude</H2>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

We have found that almost all our difficulty with other people comes down to one of the following:
<P><OL>
	<LI>People don't do what we want them to do.
	<LI>When they do what we want them to do, they don't do it in the way we want it done.
	<LI>When they do what we want, the way we want it done, they don't do it <I>when</I> we want it.
</OL><P>
When we get what we want, in the way we want it, when we want it, then we are the nicest people in the world. Nobody's nicer. Some may be <I>equally</I> nice, but none nicer.
<P>
Let's face it. We're spoiled.
<P>
When we have too much unshared milk of human kindness, it tends to spoil. Being spoiled is another way of saying we're ungrateful. As far as we can tell, ingratitude comes from three sources.
<P>
First, it seems to be the natural result of a brain that filters out everything that isn't changing. The "good" in our lives is often not changing as rapidly as the "bad." We seem to be biologically programmed to lack appreciation.
<P>
Second, the cultural programming of "more is better" makes what we have only a single step on a long staircase to Utopia. "Don't enjoy each step," we are taught, "save it for one big, eternal enjoyment when you get to the top!"
<P>
Third, ingratitude is a clever cover for unworthiness. In a bold, rebellious reaction to the decision "I can't have anything," the slightly older child decides "I want it all!" Until one has "all," why bother enjoying any of it? There's still so much more "all" to get.
<P>
Whatever the reasonsbe it one of these, a combination of them, or some reasons we've yet to discoverthe habit of ingratitude is a primary inhibitor to enjoyment and wealth.
<P>
Most of us grew up in a time when more was better, and more was inevitable. There may have been gaps in the steadily upward path of progress, but the gapshowever deepwere always understood to be temporary.
<P>

<P><BR>

During the depression of the 1930s, prosperity was always "just around the corner." During World War II, when creature comforts grew scarce, people knew they only had to sacrifice "for the duration." The idea that our material abundance will stay the sameor worse, get worsewith no end in sight is not one we've entertained in the twentieth century.
<P>
We take for granted such basic things as central heating, indoor plumbing, electricity, potable water, uncontaminated food, a certain level of health care, refrigeration, transportation, "free" entertainment from radio, television and libraries, and much more.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
PETER: While writing this chapter, I lost my electricity for a day. I complained to my mother that I couldn't get any writing done because my computer didn't work. She asked, "Why don't you use pencil and paper?" It had never occurred to me! Although I've written twenty books "by hand," the twelve years I've used a computer have spoiled me utterly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
We take things for granted and, therefore, don't feel grateful for them. If it's granted, why should we? That's the norm, that's expected, that's what we're entitled to.&#42;
<P>
What we've mentioned thus far are, of course, external things we often fail to be grateful for. How about our bodies? Of all the things the average, healthy person takes most for granted, his or her body is high on the list. Motion, speech, hearing, seeing, tasting, touch, digestion, assimilationeven relative freedom from painhow often are we grateful for these? 
<P>
 Then there are the thoughts we think without having to think about thinking them, memory, intelligence, wisdom, intuition, our personalities and all the treasures contained thereina sense of humor, kindness, compassion, caring, loving.
<P>
Then there's the gift of life itself.
<P>
Unless one of these bodily functions is taken from us or is severely threatened, we seldom notice it, much less take the time to be grateful for it.
<P>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

And what does all this ingrained ingratitude cost us?
<P>
First, it keeps us from enjoying what we've got. We are not <I>aware</I> of the wealth in each moment. Not even being aware of the wealth, how can we be grateful for it?

Second, ingratitude keeps us from getting more of what we want. Whom do you prefer giving things tothe person who doesn't even bother to acknowledge your gift, or the person who expresses genuine gratitude? Why should the Universe respond any differently? Yes, the squeaky wheel may be the first one greased, but it's also the first one replaced.
<P>
Ingratitude places a barrier on what we receivethe greater the ingratitude, the greater the barrier.
<P>
Some people say, "I hate my life. I hate everything about my life. I need to change." What these people need to change is their <I>attitude </I>of ingratitude. They need to learn to appreciate and be grateful for the life they already have,<I> then</I> work on changing it.
<P>
If they somehow rally all their strength and make the changes they think will make them happy, within a short time they'll hate the new life as much as they hated the oldprobably more. After all, they worked <I>so hard</I> for the new life. They no doubt worked to change the outer, but they did little to change the inner.
<P>
This is a recurring theme in this book, and we'll look at it from many angles: if we're not enjoying what we've got, it's going to be difficult to get the "more" we wantand even if we do get "more," we won't enjoy that either.

<H2>Is It Hopeless? </H2>
<P>
So, here we have our brains filtering out all the good stuff, our external childhood programming telling us to be normal and fit in, our internal decisions from the past telling us we're not good enough, the fight or flight response keeping us fearful and/or angry most of the time, the media and gossip telling us how horrible everything is even in the most remote corner of the Universe; things are falling apart all around us; we're always recovering from something; glamour tempts us with the new and improved; upward mobility demands that we get more whether we want more or notall of which leads to feelings of unworthiness and ingratitude.

<P><BR>

And with all these strikes against us, we're asked to enjoy life? <I>Enjoy life?</I> With all this going on, just staying alive is a major achievement. Enjoy life? Is it hopeless?
<P>
Well, we hope so.
<P>
Hope, so often, is what people use in place of <I>action.</I> They know something isn't right, they know something must change, and instead of <I>doing something about it,</I> they merely <I>hope it will get better.</I>
<P>
Hope as a spark pluga vision of something better to get us goingis fine. Hope as a substitute for actionfor changing what needs to be changed, either inner, outer or bothis, as W. Burton Baldry called it, "disappointment deferred."
<P>
What do your intrepid co-authors think? Do we think life can be enjoyed more fully, year after year? Absolutely. Do we think merely hoping will achieve it? No. Greater enjoyment requires change. We need to change our attitudes (mostly) and our environment (less mostly), and change requires action, not hope.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>It is natural to man to indulge in the illusion of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren, till she transforms us into beasts.</I><P>PATRICK HENRY<BR>1775
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

"Hope is the most treacherous of human fancies," wrote James Fenimore Cooper (1789-1851). "There is nothing so well known as that we should not expect something for nothing," observed Edgar Watson Howe in 1911, "but we all do and call it Hope."
<P>
"Just as dumb animals are snared by food," said Petronius two thousand years ago, "human beings would not be caught unless they had a nibble of hope."
<P>
Caught in what? Caught in the idea that they are powerless, and that hope alone will bring them deliverance from the trap of complacency.
<P>
Earlier, we looked at original sin from the viewpoint of the Bible. Now, let's look at hope from the perspective of Greek mythology. It's the story of Pandora's Box. It fits right in with Adam and Eve as, in Greek mythology, Pandora was the first woman. (We <I>know </I>you bought this book to find out how to get more money and we keep telling you <I>stories</I>[[[Zpatience, dear reader, patience.)
<P>
Pandora, you will recall, against the will of the gods, gave fire (not the knowledge of good and evil) to humanity. She also found a jar that contained all the evils of the world. (Again, popular belief is that it was a box, but it was, in fact, a jar. Why doesn't "60 Minutes" <I>do something </I>about all these misconceptions?)
<P>
Pandora was cautioned not to open the jar, but, curiosity being what it is, this warning only tantalized her. She opened the jar, and all the so-called evils of the world escaped. 
<P>
We say "so-called evils" because in one popular telling, the jar actually contained not evils, but blessings. This version fits right into our way of thinking, as we think all the so-called negative aspects of life can be turned into positives by a simple adjustment of attitude. Much,<I> much</I> more on this later.
<P>
After Pandora opened the jar, and all the evils flew into the world, what was the last thing in the jar? Hope.
<P>
The popular interpretation of this story is, "Isn't it nice that the gods put hope in the bottom of the jar, because we have hope that all the evils of the world will, hopefully, all be cleaned up."

Nonsense. We think that hopein the form of complacencyis one of the greatest evils. Without hope, humanity would have gotten busy and cleaned up all the other evils long ago. Hope provides the environment in which the other evils can flourish. As Nietzsche wrote in 1878, "Hope in reality is the worst of all evils, because it prolongs the torments of man."

Just as discouragement is the biggest obstacle in successfully pursuing our dreams, so hope is the biggest barrier to eliminating evil from the world.
<P>
What is evil? Evil is<I> live</I> spelled backwards. Evil is unnecessary life experience. If cutting off a dog's tail is necessary, so be it. Cutting the tail off an inch at a time is unnecessary, however, and thus evil. If we have to burn our hand once to know that the stove is hot, thus is life. If we fail to learn our lesson and burn our hand over and over again, that's evil.
<P>
"I suppose it can be truthfully said," said Robert G. Ingersoll in 1892, "that Hope is the only universal liar who never loses his reputation for veracity." Robert Frost put it this way: "A man will sometimes devote all his life to the development of one part of his bodythe wishbone."
<P>
Yes, the handmaiden of Hope is Wish. As Alexander Woollcott said, "Many of us spend half of our time wishing for things we could have if we didn't spend half our time wishing."
<P>
Hope has a good reputation in some circles because it has been confused with what we would call "goals" or "inspiration." As long as something<I>anything</I>is combined with <I>action,</I> we're in favor of it. To the degree action is postponed for some vague mystical intervention, well, that's not our styleor our suggested method of gaining wealth.
<P>
Alexander Pope is often quoted as a supporter of hope: "Hope springs eternal in the human breast." In fact, Pope was not for hope. The next line in his<I>Essay on Man</I> continued, "Man never is, but always to be blest." It's that "to be blest" that bothers us. Enough "to be." Let's get on with the blessings by remembering "God helps those who help themselves."
<P>
So often we use hope to avoid or postpone the difficult actions we know we must take. "The illusions of hope," wrote Harry F. Banks, "are apt to close one's eyes to the painful truth." If our eyes are closed, we don't act. It's not that we don't <I>need</I> to act, it's just that we don't act.
<P>
Yes, there is a happy medium between hope as a stimulant for changea way of seeing that success is a possibility for the change we contemplateand the stagnating "I hope, I hope, now I'll wait for success to be brought to me," version of almost-certain failure. "This wonder we find in hope, that she is both a flatterer and a true friend," wrote Owen Feltham (1602-1668). "How many would die did not hope sustain them; how many have died by hoping too much!"
<P>
The spark of hope, if not sustained by successful and satisfying results, will not motivate one for long. "Men cannot for long live hopefully unless they are embarked upon some great unifying enterprise," wrote C. A. Dykstra, "one for which they may pledge their lives, their fortunes and their honor."

"The man who lives only by hope," says the Italian proverb, "will die with despair." And our own Benjamin Franklin, drawing on a gastronomical analogy, wrote in his <I>The Way to Wealth, </I>"He that lives upon hope, dies fasting." (The prestigious <I>Harper Book of American Quotations</I> had one of the most amusing typos we've discovered. It quoted Mr. Franklin as saying, "He that lives upon Hope, dies farting.")

According to Dante, the gates of hell are emblazoned with the motto, "Abandon hope, all ye who enter here."

<P><BR>

When we stop taking life for granted, we begin to see life as a gift. All that we have, all that we are, the very fact that we're alive is a blessing.
<P>
The word <I>blessing</I> is often used in a religious context. We do not necessarily mean it in a religious sense here (although it certainly can be, if that is the way you choose to see it).&#42; We'll use the word blessing to mean "a gift." Whom or what the giftthe blessingis from we'll let you determine.
<P>
Even the sometime cynic Voltaire recognized that life is a blessing: "All is a miracle. The order of nature, the revolution of a hundred million of worlds around a million of suns, the activity of light, the life of animals, all are grand and perpetual miracles."
<P>
JOHN-ROGER: For more than twenty-five years, I have ended almost every lecture I've given, every seminar I've taught and every Discourse I've written with the same ancient phrase <I>Barush Bashan. </I>It means, "The blessings already are."
<P>
Our basic needsair, food, water, clothing, shelter, protectionhave obviously been met, consistently, for as many years as we have been alive. These are blessings.
<P>
Further, we have enjoyed having any number of wants satisfied along the way. Consider your life. Observe all the blessings beyond the basic needs that surround you. Almost everything in your life is a blessing you desired at some earlier pointand now you have it.
<P>
Truly, the blessings already are.
<P>
Have we received all the blessings we are to receive in this lifetime? Well, unless you breathe your last breath before you finish reading this sentence, the answer to that question is obviously no.
<P>
The insanity of humanity is that, just because more blessings are on the way, we fail to appreciate the blessings already at hand. It's insanity because, if we wait until all the blessings for this lifetime are present and accounted for, we can't enjoy them until the moment of our death. 
<P>
There are blessings we obviously acknowledge as blessings, but forget about (for those all-too-human reasons we've already discussed). And then there are blessings that we never quite see as blessings, but are blessings nonetheless.

<P><BR>

We might even venture a radical comment here: <I>everything</I> that happens to us is a blessing.
<P>
If that's <I>too</I> radical for you, then let's modify it to: a great deal of what we initially <I>think</I> are curses become, eventually, blessings ("blessings in disguise").
<P>
There are two primary ways in which seeming-curses are, in fact, blessings.
<P>
First, we need to occasionally experience the polar opposite of what we want in order to appreciate the pole we <I>want</I> to enjoy. Without darkness there is no light, without cold there is no warmth, without pain there is no pleasure.
<P>
"A man is insensible to the relish of prosperity," said Sa'Id in 1258, "till he has tasted adversity." Knowing how bad life can be allows us to appreciate how good life is. In this way, even the so-called negative experiences are blessings, because they give us the ability to appreciate the so-called positive.
<P>
Second, within each seeming-adversity is a lesson. Naturally, we <I>want</I> good, but when bad comes along, we can use it to learnturn it into a blessing, "make stumbling blocks into stepping stones" as the proverb goes.
<P>
This is, of course, ancient wisdom. "When times are good, be happy," encourages Ecclesiastes 7:14, "but when times are bad, consider: God has made the one as well as the other."
<P>
Things were still the same in the first century, when Seneca wrote, "The good things which belong to prosperity are to be wished, but good things that belong to adversity are to be admired."
<P>
And so they seem to be the same today. "When life gives you oranges, enjoy. When life gives you lemons, make lemonade." Enjoy the good in your life, and make blessings from the rest by learning.
<P>

If nothing else, the "slings and arrows" of semi-outrageous fortune keep us from becoming utterly bored. "A reasonable amount of fleas is good for a dog," wrote Edward Westcott; "it keeps him from brooding over being a dog." And Francis Galton had this take: "Well-washed and well-combed domestic pets grow dull; they miss the stimulus of fleas."
<P>
Realizing that the blessings already are is such a reliefit gives us permission to enjoy life right now. We don't have to wait until this list of blessings and that list of desires are fulfilled. We can relax, slow down, take it easy. This in itself is a blessing. "Haste, haste," says the Swahili proverb, "has no blessing."
<P>
"He is richest who is content with the least," said Socrates, "for content is the wealth of nature." Thoreau, of course, agreed: "That man is the richest whose pleasures are the cheapest."
<P>
So much depends on how we see things: some people see the treasures in the chest; others measure how much more room there is in the chest for additional treasures.
<P>
For the former, life is charmed. For the latter, they're never happy until the chest is overflowing. (Then, of course, they complain because they need a bigger chest.)
<P>
Some see the glass half full; others see the glass half empty; and still others see the glass ninety percent full, and worry that someone's going to tip it over.
<P>
Here's an example of seeing blessings as already existing vs. blessings still to be found. It was written in 1933 by Luther Standing Bear:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Only to the white man was nature a "wilderness" and only to him was the land "infested" with "wild" animals and "savage" people. To us it was tame. Earth was bountiful and we were surrounded with the blessings of the Great Mystery. Not until the hairy man from the east came and with brutal frenzy heaped injustices upon us and the families that we loved was it "wild" for us. When the very animals of the forest began fleeing from his approach, then it was that for us the "Wild West" began.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
What we did to the western United States, we are doing to the entire planetbut first we have done it to ourselves. We see blessings as something to come, not something that surrounds us, always has surrounded us, and always will surround us.
<P>
"There's so much speculating going on that a lot of us never get around to living," observed Russell Baker. "Life is always walking up to us and saying, `Come on in, the living's fine,' and what do we do? Back off and take its picture."
<P>
We have lost track of ourselves. We have lost track of the moment. We have lost track of the precious present.
<P>
How did this come to be? And, more importantly, what can we do about it?

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>No time like the present.</I><P>MARY DE LA RIVIRE MANLEY<BR>1696
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

The problem is a well-documented one: we spend so much time regretting the past (depression) and fearing the future (anxiety) that we have no time for the present. Or, perhaps, it's because we spend so little time in the present, we regret the past and fear the future. Whatever the cause, it's a common complaint.
<P>
"No mind is much employed upon the present," Samuel Johnson wrote in 1759; "recollection and anticipation fill up almost all our moments." 
<P>
"If a man carefully examine his thoughts he will be surprised to find how much he lives in the future," Emerson observed in 1827. "His well-being is always ahead. Such a creature is probably immortal."
<P>
One can hear the edge of sarcasm in Emerson's last sentence. To constantly live our lives in the past and future assumes we have an infinite amount of time to spend, well, daydreaming. Of course, we don't. We're all going to die someday; therefore our time here is finite. 
<P>
"We are, perhaps, uniquely among the earth's creatures, the worrying animal," wrote Lewis Thomas. "We worry away our lives, fearing the future, discontent with the present, unable to take in the idea of dying, unable to sit still."
<P>
We postpone our enjoyment of the present. We'll enjoy the moment later, when things are better. We ransom our present happiness to the future. "We are never present with, but always beyond ourselves," observed Montaigne in 1580; "fear, desire, hope still push us on toward the future."
<P>
Ah, the future! "That period of time," wrote Ambrose Bierce, "in which our affairs prosper, our friends are true and our happiness is assured."
<P>
"The supreme value is not the future but the present. The future is a deceitful time that always says to us, `Not yet,' and thus denies us," wrote Octavio Paz. "The future is not the time of love: what man truly wants he wants now. Whoever builds a house for future happiness builds a prison for the present."
<P>
"Those who talk about the future are scoundrels," said Louis Ferdinand CŽline. "It is the present that matters." And Longfellow, using a full year's quota of exclamation marks, agreed:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant! Let the dead Past bury its dead! Act,act in the living Present! Heart within, and God o'erhead!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
We are so frightened of the present. "The word `now' is like a bomb through the window," wrote Arthur Miller, "and it ticks." Another great playwright, Shakespeare, put it thus: "Past and to come seem best; things present worst."
<P>
"Philosophy triumphs easily over past evils and future evils," said La Rochefoucauld, "but present evils triumph over it."
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>They were upon their great theme: "When I get to be a man!" Being human, though boys, they considered their present estate too commonplace to be dwelt upon.

This has been a problem for some time. "It is not the weight of the future or the past that is pressing upon you, but ever that of the present alone," counseled Marcus Aurelius in the second century. "Remember that the sole life which a man can lose is that which he is living at the moment."
<P>
Where did all of this postponement of present pleasures start? 
<P>
We've already looked at two stories of Creation and the early days of humanity. Allow us to tell you a third.
<P>
When the Earth was almost complete, God gathered the best and the brightest of God's helpers to make one very important decision. Something needed to be hidden until humanity was mature enough to appreciate it and use it properly.
<P>
It was the greatest treasure of humankind, the greatest gift, the greatest blessing: it was humanity's true Selfthe Self that was undeniably and experientially linked to the Source of all creation, a direct connection to God and all of Nature.
<P>
But where to hide it? Humans had a peculiar characteristic: if they didn't earn what they got, they didn't much appreciate it, and if they didn't appreciate it, they didn't take very good care of it. Immaturity 101. But when humans appreciated something, they took very good care of it, indeed.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>So, if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?</I><P>LUKE 16:11
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

But how does one "earn" a gift? This Self was a gift from God, not something to be earned. It was decided that this gift would be hidden, and humanity's "earning" of it would be the finding of it.
<P>
"But where to hide it?" God asked the helpers.
<P>
"Let's hide it on the highest mountain," suggested one of God's helpers.
<P>
"No," said God; "eventually humanity will climb the highest mountain."
<P>
"Then let's hide it in the depths of the ocean," suggested another.
<P>
"Humanity will someday plumb the depths of the ocean," said God. "Besides, neither of these hiding places gives all of humanity the same opportunity to find it. The poor and the weak must have the same opportunity as the rich and the strong."
<P>
This caused something of a pause.
<P>
<I>"Where </I>are we allowed to hide it?" asked an astute helper.
<P>
"As with most things," answered God, "you can hide it in space and in time."
<P>
More thinking in the firmament.
<P>
After what seemed an eternity (and it could well have been), one of the helpers finally spoke: "The last space humans would think to look for such a gift would be within themselves."
<P>
"Yes," agreed another, "we can hide it within each of them, equally."
<P>
"That's the last place they'll look," exclaimed another, enthused about the idea.
<P>
"You've found an excellent place to hide it," smiled God, "but<I> when </I>should they be able to find it?"
<P>
"Four A.M. on Tuesday mornings. . ."
<P>
". . .but only if Tuesday falls on a leap year. . ."
<P>
". . .and they have to have fasted and prayed for three days and nights before "
<P>
"We're making up rules for life," said God, "not a Nintendo Samurai Warrior game."
<P>
A thoughtful silence again settled upon God's Council.
<P>

"If we're going to hide it in the most obvious placewithin each of them," said a helper, "why not make the finding of it most possible at the most obvious timeright now."
<P>
"Here and now " considered another. "Yes. That would do it."
<P>
"Humans are so seldom where they are when they are," agreed a third. "We'll put the gift in the most obvious placeinside each of them; and we'll place it in the most available possible timeright now, the moment."
<P>
"And to make matters even more obscure," smiled one helper, "we'll name the gift, and the time when the gift can be found, by the same name."
<P>
"The present," another smiled.
<P>
"Yes, the present." There was a consensus in heaven.
<P>
"Well done," said God. "Now, let's work on The Commandments. How many do we have so far?"
<P>
"Three thousand, eight hundred and seventy-four."
<P>
"Do you think we can work on shortening these a bit?"

So wrote Whittier in 1847. Thoreau made it a commandment: "You must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in each moment." Alexander Martin made it a suggestion: "Take time to enjoy the present."
<P>
"With the Past, as past, I have nothing to do; nor with the Future as future," wrote Emerson. "I live now, and will verify all past history in my own moments."
<P>
"The passing moment is all we can be sure of," observed Somerset Maugham; "it is only common sense to extract its utmost value from it; the future will one day be present and will seem as unimportant as the present does now."

The present is the only time in which we can do anything, feel anything, be anything.
<P>
"For present joys are more to flesh and blood," wrote John Dryden in 1687, "Than a dull prospect of a distant good."
<P>
"The present time has one advantage over every other" wrote Charles Caleb Colton in 1825, "it is our own." And Longfellow, in 1839: "Look not mournfully into the Past. It comes not back again. Wisely improve the Present. It is thine."
<P>
And yet, with all the "good press" the poets, philosophers and sages of old have given the present, why don't we see it? Why don't we spend more time there? (Here?) Why is the present so elusive?
<P>
"Let anyone try, I will not say to arrest, but to notice or to attend to, the present moment of time," wrote William James a hundred years ago. "One of the most baffling experiences occurs. Where is it, this present? It has melted in our grasp, fled ere we could touch it, gone in the instant of becoming."
<P>
Emerson, one hundred and fifty years ago, observed the same phenomenon: "We can see well into the past; we can guess shrewdly into the future; but that which is rolled up and muffled in impenetrable folds is today."
<P>
A clue on living more in the present might be found in this from Jean de la Bruyre: "Children enjoy the present because they have neither a past nor a future."
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I am in the present. I cannot know what tomorrow will bring forth. I can know only what the truth is for me today. That is what I am called upon to serve, and I serve it in all lucidity.</I><P>IGOR STRAVINSKY<BR>1936
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

As Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these." (This quote is found in three books of the New Testament: Luke 18:16, Mark 10:14 and Matthew 19:14, although Matthew quotes Jesus as saying "the kingdom of heaven" rather than "the kingdom of God." Jesus seems to use the two phrases interchangeably.) 
<P>
"I tell you the truth," said Jesus (Matthew 18:3); "unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
<P>
And where is the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God? "The kingdom of God is within you" (Luke 17:21).
<P>
So why aren't we "like little children"? Practical people have a fear that, although children have a good time, they don't seem to <I>accomplish</I> much. Humans always seem to want more, more and more. At a certain point, in order to get more, we learn to defer gratification.
<P>
The habit of deferring gratification, however, has become too strongwe're deferring it, seemingly, forever. Hence, we seldom enjoy what is.
<P>
The solution? Back to our old friend, balance. First, we must admit we're out of balance. As a culture, we have gone too far in the direction of deferring. It's time to get back into balance. The irony is that living more in the present allows us to accomplish <I>more</I> in the future.
<P>
"Real generosity toward the future," wrote Camus, "lies in giving all to the present."
<P>
"There is no moment like the present," said Marie Edgeworth. "The man who will not execute his resolutions when they are fresh upon him can have no hope from them afterwards; they will be dissipated, lost, and perish in the hurry and scurry of the world, or sunk in the slough of indolence."
<P>
"Every tomorrow has two handles," observed Henry Ward Beecher. "We can take hold of it with the handle of anxiety or the handle of faith. We should live for the future, and yet should find our life in the fidelities of the present; the last is only the method of the first."
<P>
When in balance, the past and future become part of a joyful present. "We live in the present, we dream of the future and we learn eternal truths from the past," said Madame Chiang Kai-shek. And Charles Lamb wrote, "My motto is, `Contented with little, yet wishing for more.' "

When we learn to enjoy the present, we know that we will also enjoy the future, for the future inevitably becomes the present without our doing anything about it. "As for the Future," observed Saint-Exupery, "your task is not to foresee but to enable it." 
<P>
Besides, living in the present makes pursuing the future more fun. In the third century B.C., Epicurus noted, "The man least dependent upon the morrow," that is, the person living in and enjoying the moment, "goes to meet the morrow most cheerfully."
<P>
So where do we start? Where do we find this all-important yet seemingly elusive present?
<P>
Where we are right now, of course. And it all starts with a breath.

Take a deep breath. Let it out. Relax. When we breathe, we consciously take control of a bodily process which is usually unconsciousbreathing. We begin to take dominion over our bodies. We give ourselves the message: "Relax. Take it easy. It's OK to enjoy the moment."
<P>
Take another deep breathslower this time, and deeper. Hold it for a moment; then let it go. Relax. Then take another. Focus on the air going in, and the air going out. Let go of the past. Let go of the future. "Be here now," as Ram Dass suggested.
<P>
Three deep breaths may not make you fully enlightened (and then again, it may). You might notice, however, a bit more awareness of the moment than you had before. It's a start. Take your time. Be patient.
<P>
The present's not going anywhere. It will always be here.

Light is one of the most enjoyable, practical and accessible blessings found in the present. Light is a concept that has permeated just about every religion, spiritual practice, growth philosophy and much of literature throughout history.
<P>
In the Bible, light is all over the place. In the Old Testament (the foundation of the teachings of Judaism), there are 137 references to light. Light appears as early as the third verse of the Old Testament: "God said, `Let there be light,' and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness" (Genesis 1:3-4).
<P>
Of this, Francis Bacon wrote, "The first creature of God, in the works of the days, was the light of the sense: the last was the light of reason." John Milton called light "the prime work of God."
<P>
The New Testament (the foundation of the teachings of Christianity), has 93 references to light, including: "Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life" (John 8:12).
<P>
Hinduism, the oldest and currently the religion with the most followers (2.5 billion), equates light to both reality and immortality. Here's a portion of the <I>Brhadaranyka Upanisad </I>(1.3.28):
<P><blockquote>
Lead me from the unreal to the real!<BR>
Lead me from darkness to light!<BR>
Lead me from death to immortality!
</blockquote>
<P>
When Siddhartha Gautama became Buddha, the Enlightened One, Buddhism was born. Buddha is often referred to as "the Light of Asia."
<P>
The holy text of Islam and the Moslems is the Koran. Here is one of the many references in the Koran (this one 24:35) to light: "God is the light of the heavens and the earth light upon light."
<P>
Reasonable thinkers liked light. "Reason is the light and lamp of life," wrote Cicero around 100 B.C. Seventeen centuries later, John Locke picked up the torch: "Reason is a natural revelation, whereby the eternal Father of light communicates to mankind that portion of truth which he has laid within the reach of their natural faculties."
<P>
A half-century later, Louis Brandeis cautioned, "If we would be guided by the light of reason, we must let our minds be bold." Jesus, too, suggested the bold use of the light: "You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you" (John 12:35).
<P>
More on the use of the light later. For now, let's look at what some great minds of literature had to say about light.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Great men are instruments by which the Highest One works out his designs; light-radiators to give guidance and blessing to the travelers of time. </I><P>MOSES HARVEY
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Literature itself Samuel Johnson called "a kind of intellectual light which, like the light of the sun, may sometimes enable us to see what we do not like." Emerson, on the other hand, thought, "There is no object so foul that intense light will not make it beautiful." James Thurber reconciled the two: "There are two kinds of lightthe glow that illumines, and the glare that obscures."
<P>
"Light is the symbol of truth," stated James Russell Lowell. Rabindranath Tagore agreed: "Knowledge is nothing but the continually burning up of error to set free the light of truth." T. H. Huxley defined happiness as "the sense of having worked according to one's capacity and light to make things clear and get rid of cant and shams."
<P>
Oliver Wendell Holmes said that to do right was to be "faithful to the light within." Benjamin Disraeli thought that, ideally, a university should be "a place of light, of liberty, and of learning." It seems we're still working on that one.
<P>
An English proverb defines<I> zeal </I>as "fire without light." Woodrow Wilson suggested that, in life, "the thing to do is supply light and not heat."
<P>

George Santayana said that consciousness itself is "the inner light kindled in the soul; a music, strident or sweet, made by the friction of existence." Jules Renard described dreaming as "to think by moonlight by the light of an inner moon."
<P>
Then there are those who praised light in verseLongfellow, for example:
<P><blockquote>
Out of the shadows of night<BR>
The world rolls into light.</blockquote>
<P>
Or, this from Dylan Thomas:
<P><blockquote>
Light breaks where no sun shines; <BR>Where no sea runs, the waters of the heart <BR>Push in their tides.</blockquote>
<P>
Even the existentialists gave an occasional nod toward light, after their own fashion. Camus, for example, said, "Fortunately there is gin, the sole glimmer of light in this darkness."
<P>
And let's not forget hard science. The hardest sciences of allmath and physicshonor light in Einstein's famous quote: <I>"E=mc2." </I>He never <I>intended</I> it to become a quote, of course, but it became one just the sameeveryone quotes it; very few people understand it, but everyone quotes it. In that, Einstein is something like Shakespearewho said a great deal about light, but we're not going to quote any of it here, because it's time to move on to How to Focus Upon and Use Light.
<P>

The first thing to remember about light is just thatall we have to do is to <I>remember </I>about light. We're not bringing it in from somewhere else, we're simply acknowledging its presence in the moment. If the light weren't already here, we wouldn't be, either.
<P>
The same is true of "sending" the light. We don't really send it. It's already there. Sending light is as silly as sending air. All we do when we "send" light is acknowledge its presence where it already is. 
<P>
We make a choice, a selection, a focus. "Everywhere the human soul," wrote Thomas Carlyle, "stands between a hemisphere of light and another of darkness." That's a grander way of saying what we've said many times: each moment contains both good and bad, light and dark, positive and negative.
<P>
We can choose to focus upon either the negative or the positive. Why not focus on the positive? Focusing on the light that's already present in any situation is an option we always have.
<P>
The best news about this lightother than its existenceis that it seems to respond to human requests. No, the light is not some cosmic bellhop, as the quote on the facing page from Quentin Crisp explains nicely. The light does, however, seem to make a differenceif it's in our best interest that a difference be made.
<P>
That's where "the highest good" comes in. We can ask for the light to be somewhere or do something <I>for our highest good and the highest good of all concerned.</I> That way we know that our highest good and the highest good of everyone else is always foremosteven if it means that we don't get "our way" in every situation, every time.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I simply haven't the nerve to imagine a being, a force, a cause which keeps the planets revolving in their orbits, and then suddenly stops in order to give me a bicycle with three speeds.</I><P>QUENTIN CRISP
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

As Samuel Butler explained, "The highest good; towards this all government, all social conventions, all art, literature, and science should directly or indirectly tend. Holy men and holy women are those who keep this unconsciously in view at all times whether of work or pastime."
<P>
Asking for our highest good and the highest good of all concerned keeps us from becoming sorcerer's apprenticessetting things in motion we have no idea how to control. "If a man could have half his wishes," said Benjamin Franklin, "he would double his troubles." Or, as Oscar Wilde observed, "When the gods choose to punish us, they merely answer our prayers."
<P>
We don't always know what's for our highest good and the highest good of all concernednor should we. How dull it would be if we knew <I>everything </I>that was going to happen to us and everyone else for all time. Life would become not just "Gilligan's Island," but "Gilligan's Island" <I>reruns. </I>Reruns of reruns, in fact. Ugh.
<P>
So, the highest good is our safety net, our insurance policy. If we ask for something and it comes to pass, we know it's for our highest good and the highest good of all concerned. If we ask for something and it doesn't come to pass, we know we got an answerthe answer was "no." Or, at least, "not just yet."
<P>
Or, perhaps our desire changes to acceptor even appreciatewhat already is. That's the light working, too. Either way, we can relax and enjoy the moment. <I>This</I> moment.
<P>
Worrying about things does no goodwe simply lose the enjoyment of the moment and kid ourselves into thinking that worrying has somehow been helpful.
<P>
<I>Doing</I> is helpful. If there's something we can <I>do</I> about a situationand the outcome of the situation is important enough to usthen <I>do it.</I> If it's not important enough, or, if there's nothing we can do, send the light for everyone's highest good, and move on with what can be done.
<P>
Sending the light takes so little timea few seconds at most. It's such a small expenditureand the potential returns are so greatthat we consider it an excellent investment in personal wealth.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
PETER: When I first visited Los Angeles in the early 1970s, I was warned not to drink the water. In the parking lot of a supermarket was a water-vending machine. "Twenty-five cents a gallon," it read. I thought this was a fair price, so I put in my quarter and pushed the button. The machine hummed, buzzed and chugged. Then a gallon of water splattered on my feet. Why didn't they tell me I had to bring my own container? Welcome to L.A.!</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Imagine yourself at a small but abundant waterfall. What would limit your ability to take from that waterfall your wealth of water? The size of your container, right? If you had a cup, you'd have a cup's worth of wealth (water). If you had a gallon jug, you'd have a gallon's worth of wealth. If you had a barrel, you'd have a barrel of wealth. If you had a tank-truck, well, you could supply all those twenty-five-cent water-vending machines in Los Angeles.
<P>
What if the same were true of all the attributes of wealth? What if your ability to experience health, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what you want, opportunity, enjoying and balance were limited only by your ability to receive? What if each of these qualities were available to you in infinite supply, and the only thing limiting you were the size of your container?
<P>
We know it doesn't <I>seem</I> that way. It seems as though, if we have a cup, only a cup's worth of water <I>ever</I> dribbles over the falls. That is, however, an illusiona highly convincing illusion, granted, but an illusion nonetheless.
<P>
If we want to expand our ability to experience health, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what we want, opportunity, enjoying and balance, we must expand the size of our health, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what we want, opportunity, enjoying and balance containers.
<P>
This is done through affirmations. An affirmation is a positive statement about something. With it, we <I>make firm</I> the truth of something, even if the truth is hidden in illusion. You can affirm wealth, even though the current illusion is one of poverty.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>You can't win any game unless you are ready to win.</I><P>CONNIE MACK
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Affirmations are always stated in the present. "I am..." not "I'm going to be..."; "I have..." not "I want...." If we affirm what we're <I>going</I> to have and <I>going</I> to be, what are we affirming? That we're <I>going</I> to have and be that. We want to affirm that we <I>have</I> it and we <I>are </I>that.
<P>
Affirmations gain strength through repetition. With each repetition, we slightly increase the size of our container to receive and hold that which we affirm. Each repetition might only be a drop in a swimming pool, but, if we keep dripping, one of these days we'll be swimming.
<P>
The problem most people have with affirmations is that they stop long before obtaining any noticeable result. Then they say, "See? I told you it wouldn't work."
<P>
Why do people stop? It usually comes down to one reason: discomfort. Enlarging one's container for wealth is uncomfortable. Count on it.
<P>
To accept the idea that we already <I>are</I> healthy, happy, abundant, prosperous, rich, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what we want, opportunity-rich, enjoying and balanced, we must challenge a great many limiting beliefs we hold about ourselves. Limiting beliefs, when challenged, create discomfort.
<P>
Saying an affirmation is like sending clear water, under pressure, into a clogged pipe. All the gunk that's clogging up the pipe surfaces. When we say an affirmation, over and over ("over and over" creates the pressure), all the gunk that's been clogging our pipes (our pipeline to wealth?) surfaces.
<P>
This gunk includes unworthiness, hurt feelings, anger, guilt and fearall the emotions that make up what we call <I>the c</I><I>omfort zone.</I> Who wants to feel all that? Nobody. We become distracted by something that's less uncomfortable than the gunk. We're off on some other line of thinking (often negative because, after all, most of us are more comfortable thinking negatively than positively). The next thing we know, five minutes have gone by and what were we supposed to be thinking about?
<P>
A good way to overcome distractions is to say the affirmation out loud. No matter what we're thinking, at least a <I>part </I>of us is saying the affirmation.
<P>
How many times should we say an affirmation?
<P>
To really get it going, to charge it with our energy, to make the enlargement of our wealth container a major priority in our consciousness, we suggest saying it, initially, at least one thousand times. This may seem like a lot, but repeating a short affirmation one thousand times should take less than half an hour.

You can use toothpicks to keep count. Have one bundle of 100 toothpicks, and one bundle of 10. Hold the bunch of 100 toothpicks in your hand. Place the ten toothpicks in front of you. With each repetition, place one of the toothpicks in your hand into a new pile. When no toothpicks remain in your hand, you have said your affirmation 100 times. Move one of the ten toothpicks into a separate "marker" pile. Then pick up the 100 toothpicks and continue. When all 10 "marker" toothpicks are in the "marker" pile, you have said your affirmation 1,000 times. (When doing money affirmations, you can use cash in place of toothpicks.)
<P>
Another method is to count how many times you say the affirmation in one minute, then figure out how many minutes it will take you to reach 1,000.
<P>
Whatever the method, please give it a try. The affirmation will probably lose all its meaning for a while; the words themselves may lose meaningit may all be just a lot of silly sounds. That's OK. Persevere. By the end of 1,000, you may find a new energy, power and meaning permeating the affirmation.

What are some affirmations? We've already suggested onea sort-of "master affirmation" for this book"I am wealthy." As we go along, we'll be suggesting more. Feel free to create your own, of course. Here are some to get started:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>"I am healthy."
	<LI>"I am happy."
	<LI>"I am abundant."
	<LI>"I am prosperous."
	<LI>"I am rich."
	<LI>"I am loving."
	<LI>"I am caring."
	<LI>"I am sharing."
	<LI>"I am learning."
	<LI>"I know what I want."
	<LI>"I have abundant opportunities."
	<LI>"I am enjoying my life."
	<LI>"I am balanced."
</UL>
<P>

Create the container to receive. Enlarge the container at every possible opportunity (the next line you stand in, think of it as affirmation time). As the container is enlarged, the process of living will fill it to brimming.

<H2>Worthy to Be Wealthy</H2>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

To have wealthand especially to <I>enjoy </I>wealthone must feel worthy of wealth. We may have 100,000 reasons why we're not worthy. Our job is to forget those reasonsthey're not doing us any good.
<P>
When we feel worthy of wealth, wealth comes to us. When we feel worthy of wealth, we can enjoy the wealth we already have. Worthiness is a key to wealth.
<P>
Worthiness is a given. If we have somethinga relationship, a car, a career, life itselfwe are worthy of it. If we don't have it, we're not worthy. If we want it, we must work on our worthiness.
<P>
Let's make the distinction between<I> worthiness</I> and <I>self-esteem. </I>Worthiness is a statement of what we are and have. Self-esteem is how we <I>feel</I> about what we are and have.
<P>
People often confuse the two terms. Becoming more and getting more is a process of enhancing our worthiness. Enjoying what we already have is a process of enhancing our self-esteem.
<P>
We'll work on self-esteem in a later chapter ("Remember the Good"). The technique of self-esteem is simply: do good things, and remember that you've done them. In this chapter, we'll work on worthiness, on enlarging the container of worthiness within ourselves.
<P>
The first thing to realize is how large the container already is. All that you are, all that you have, all that you do is an indicator of your present worth.
<P>
Reflect on the health, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what you want, opportunity, enjoying and balance you already have in your life. That's how worthy you already are. Remember: if you weren't worth all these things, you wouldn't have them.
<P>
To make room for more wealth in our life, we must enlarge the "worthiness container." This we do through affirmations.
<P>
Please don't think using affirmations is some mystical woo-woo process. We all use affirmations all the time, we just may not call it that.
<P>
In daily life, the process of getting what we want goes something like this: We have an idea: "It might be nice to have ," and we think more and more positively about itan affirmation. Then we decide, "I want it," and think still more positively about having itmore affirmations. Eventually, when the container of our worthiness has been expanded sufficiently, we take action and get the thing we have been thinking about.
<P>

The same is true of <I>negative</I> affirmations. We want something, tell ourselves we <I>can't </I>have it, explain all the reasons <I>why</I> we can't have it and, sure enough, we don't get it. We <I>affirmed</I> that our container of worthiness was not large enough to hold the new desire, and, sure enough, it wasn't.
<P>
The master worthiness affirmation, of course, is simply, "I am worthy." In working with wealth, we can include
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>"I am worthy of wealth."
	<LI>"I am worthy of health."
	<LI>"I am worthy of happiness."

<H2>Appreciation</H2>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

As we mentioned earlier, we consider appreciation one of the two primary components of enjoyment. Appreciation is <I>liking</I> somethingadmiring it, being fond of it, having affection for it, perhaps even adoring it.
<P>
The key to appreciation is <I>time.</I>
<P>
"The present is burdened too much with the past," wrote Nathaniel Hawthorne. "We have not time, in our earthly existence, to appreciate what is warm with life, and immediately around us."
<P>
The essence of appreciation is to <I>make </I>the time. Time is a precious commodity. Appreciation requires us to spend some of that preciousness on the object of our appreciation.
<P>
Try an experiment. Find something ordinary in your present environment, something you can hold in your hand. Anything will do. Pick it up. Now spend five full minutes (by the clock) looking at it, feeling it, smelling it, exploring it. Please do that now.
<P>
For those who aren't doing it and are reading on, this must mean you (A) think you already know what the outcome of doing it will be; (B) are reading for information only and not for experience; or (C) are so fascinated by our prose style that you just can't seem to stop reading. If you're in category A, we suggest you try the experiment anyway. If nothing else, you'll find out you were right. If you're in category B, you can turn the page; that's where the information continues.
<P>
And, if you're in category C (God bless you!), here's a quote from Lord David Cecil to tide you over while we're waiting for those who are exploring their objects to return: "The primary object of a student of literature is to be delighted. His duty is to enjoy himself: his efforts should be directed to developing his faculty of appreciation." There. Everybody seems to be back now.
<P>
There. How was that? Did you peek (or peak) after two minutes with your object and think, "I've explored all there is to explore"? Did you get lost for ten minutes? Did you begin to notice things not directly connected to the object? Your hands, for example, or the senses (sight, touch, smell) used to perceive the object.
<P>

<P><BR>

Do you <I>appreciate </I>the object more? Notice we never asked you to appreciate it. We merely asked you to spend time with it, to explore it. The natural result of spending time is appreciation.
<P>
Nowhere is this more true than with people. People love to be appreciated, and it's so much fun to appreciate. "The deepest principle in human nature," wrote William James, "is the craving to be appreciated."
<P>
When we crave other people's appreciation too much, we're asking for trouble. "Lean too much upon the approval of people," Tehyi Hsieh observed, "and it becomes a bed of thorns."
<P>
The answer is not to find others who appreciate us, but to learn to appreciate ourselves more. How? Simple. Spend time on ourselves, spend time <I>with</I> ourselves. Get to know the person we're going to be sleeping with every night for the rest of our lives.
<P>
To appreciate is an act of positive selection. We <I>choose</I> to spend time finding the good in something or someone. It requires discipline and focus. We must look for the good, even through the apparent bad. Our conditioned response might be, "I'm bored with this," or "I don't like it." Through work, we can move beyond the conditioned response to one that's more pleasing, more enjoyable, and, well, wealthier.
<P>
"The sorrow of knowing that there is evil in the best," said Dr. Austen Fox Riggs, "is far out-balanced by the joy of discovering that there is good in the worst."
<P>
How to increase our ability to appreciate? Practice, practice, practice. And what is <I>always</I> around for us to practice on? Why, ourselves, of course. "He only is a great man who can neglect the applause of the multitude," wrote Joseph Addison in 1712, "and enjoy himself independent of its favor."
<P>

As we look more toward ourselves rather than others for appreciation, the most amazing thing happens: others seem to appreciate us more. Not <I>all </I>others, of coursesome will find us "vain, self-centered and conceited." Oh well, we'd probably never get their appreciation anyway. Simply tell these people, "Sackcloth and ashes are simply not my style anymore."
<P>
Those who are, well,<I> aware </I>appreciate self-appreciation. These are the people we'll be getting more appreciation from as we appreciate ourselves more.
<P>
Another way to enhance appreciation isyou guessed itaffirmations. Try some of these on for size:

<P><BR>

Our appreciation of something ripens into true enjoyment when we apply gratitude. Without gratitude, it's so easy to lose track of the goodness in our life.
<P>
An eighteenth-century suicide note read: "All this buttoning and unbuttoning." Granted, life before zippers and Velcro was far more tedious, but whoever unbuttoned his or her life over buttoning and unbuttoning forgot to feel grateful for buttonsand the clothes they went on.
<P>
If this eighteenth-century person had only learned from the writings of fellow-eighteenth-centurion, Sir Walter Scott: "Many of our cares are but a morbid way of looking at our privileges." The way out of such morbidity and into enjoyment is appreciation and gratitude.
<P>
What is the latitude of gratitude?
<P>
"Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues," observed Cicero, "but the parent of all others." "Gratitude is the fruit of great cultivation," said Samuel Johnson; "you do not find it among gross people."
<P>
"Gratitude is a blessing we give to one another," wrote Robert Raynolds, and Ottokar Prohaszka continued: "Gratitude is to thank God for all His infinite goodness with all our heart."
<P>
Not all have such a holy view of gratitude. "I feel a very unusual sensation," said Benjamin Disraeli, "if it is not indigestion, I think it must be gratitude."
<P>
Unfortunately, too many people practice the<I> platitude</I> of gratitude. Gratitude for many has become yet another "should"; for others, it's just another form of manipulation.
<P>
It's easy to see how gratitude became a "should":
<P>
"Have you written your aunt to thank her for your birthday present yet?" "No." "When are you going to?" "Soon." "Do you want me to take the present away until you finish the note?" "No." "Then get busy!"
<P>
The "good advice" about how important it is to be grateful seems to be everywherefrom Chinese proverbs ("When eating bamboo sprouts, remember the man who planted them.") to the Apocrypha ("Let not thine hand be stretched out to receive and shut when thou shouldst repay.")
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Thank-you, music-lovers.</I><P>SPIKE JONES
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

"Do not refuse a wing to the person who gave you the whole chicken," R. G. H. Siu reminds us, and the English take it several steps further: "Don't drown the man who taught you to swim."
<P>
Good advice, all. It becomes mired, however, in the mists of childhood shoulds, musts and have-tos. Thankfulness is for some a solemn duty rather than a pleasurable sensation.
<P>
"There are minds so impatient of inferiority that their gratitude is a species of revenge," explained Samuel Johnson, "and they return benefits, not because recompense is a pleasure, but because obligation is a pain."
<P>
We do not recommend gratitude because we <I>should</I> be grateful, because we're somehow <I>nobler</I> or <I>better humans</I> for expressing gratitudewe recommend it because <I>it feels good.</I> "There is as much greatness of mind in acknowledging a good turn," observed Seneca, "as in doing it." It's not just due to greatness of mind that we express our thanks; it feels great, too.
<P>
For those who threw out the baby of gratitude with the bath water of childhood, recapturing that spirit of thankfulness is relatively easy. For those who have learned to use gratitude to manipulate others, the task may be more difficult.
<P>
People like to be thanked. "I can live for two months on a good compliment," said Mark Twain. Maybe people enjoy compliments because they are so scarce. As Kin Hubbard pointed out, "Some people pay a compliment as if they expected a receipt."
<P>
A few people have learned that others enjoy being thanked so much, that the thanks-giver often gets something in return.
<P>
It begins innocently enough. "Do not neglect gratitude," advised Princess Jackson Smith, "Say thank you." Fine. "Better still, say it in writing." Still fine. "A simple note of thanks is money in the bank and you will be remembered." Oops. Off the deep end. As soon as we look for some reward for our thankfulness other than the warm feeling of gratitude we feel inside, we are skating on thin ice up a creek without a paddle. (Aren't you grateful that<I> you </I>don't mix your metaphors as miserably as <I>we </I>do?)
<P>

This manipulative use of gratitude has given it, in some circles, a bad name. "In most of mankind gratitude is merely a secret hope for greater favors," said La Rochefoucauld, who was obviously in one of those circles.
<P>
When we use gratitude for manipulation, we may get what we want, but we sacrifice the cordial feeling of gratitude in the process. Some are finding that this is too great a price to pay.
<P>
In order to regain the feeling of gratitude, however, we must risk not getting the thing we want. That's scary. What if this "cordial feeling of gratitude" thing isn't worth it? We won't know till we try, will we?
<P>
Some people (often the <I>same</I> people) fall into the reverse trap: when they do something good, they <I>expect</I> gratitudeheaps and heaps of it. Like most expectations, this is not a good ideacertainly not a good idea if enjoyment is the goal.
<P>
Good advice on this habit comes from that master of good advice: "When befriended, remember it," advised Benjamin Franklin; "when you befriend, forget it."
<P>
Even when people we do things for <I>feel</I> grateful, they often have trouble expressing it. "Gratitude is one of the least articulate of the emotions," explained Felix Frankfurter, "especially when it is deep." It's hard to express gratitude. It's easy to let fear stand in the way.
<P>
An interesting aspect of gratitude is that we can feel it when others do for us, <I>and</I> when we do for others. "There are two kinds of gratitude," observed E. A. Robinson, "the sudden kind we feel for what we take; and the larger kind we feel for what we give."
<P>
It feels so good to giveto do good for othersthat we are grateful they accepted our gift. This certainly goes counter to the "get yours while the getting's good and get out" programming of our culture. It is, nonetheless, truewe are so grateful to be able to give.
<P>

If we're having trouble feeling grateful for what we have, maybe a good place to start is feeling grateful for what we <I>don't </I>have: all the miseries and sorrows thatfor the momenthave passed us by.
<P>
"A man should always consider how much he has more than he wants, and how much more unhappy he might be than he really is." said Joseph Addison long after the idea had already become a clich.
<P>
Even Joyce Carol Oates gives the popular version: "Things could be a lot worse."
<P>
This notion has, of course, been challenged. "Every time we tell anybody to cheer up, things might be worse," wrote Franklin P. Adams, "we run away for fear we might be asked to specify how."
<P>
And this penetrating dialogue from "Starsky and Hutch":
<P><UL>
	<LI>HUTCH:At least she's alive.
<P>
	<LI>STARSKY:Hey, I've had it up to here with optimistic views of life.
</UL>
<P>
Nonetheless, we can begin our journey to greater gratitude by being thankful for the evils we've missed. "Every misery I miss is a new blessing," said Izaak Walton, a philosophy that saw him safely to ninety back when the average life span was about forty-five years (1593-1683). 
<P>
"The best medicine I know for rheumatism," said Josh Billings, "is to thank the Lord it ain't the gout." "Some people are always grumbling because roses have thorns," observed Alphonse Karr; "I am thankful that thorns have roses."

One of the surest signs of gratitude is laughter. Humor is a great way to turn gratings into gratitude. "A humorist," said Don Herold, "is a man who feels bad but who feels good about it." When you can give the simple twist of fate one more turn, it's often quite funny.
<P>
"Alas, she married another; they frequently do," sighed Artemus Ward; "I hope she is happybecause I am." "You put up with a few inconveniences," Reverend Jim Ignatowski from "Taxi" observed, "when you live in a condemned building."
<P>
Of course, it's fine to be grateful for all the <I>genuine</I> good in our livesto be grateful for our current wealth. It's pleasant to take some time each day and reflect on the good around us. An interlude of gratitudeespecially for those things we tend to take for grantedcan do wonders for peace, contentment and well-being.
<P>
Naturally, our capacity for gratitude can be increased through affirmations.
<P>

And let's not forget to feel grateful for spontaneous gratitude. As Joseph Wood Krutch observed, "Happiness is itself a kind of gratitude."

When we are joyful, be grateful.

<H2>Rules as Tools</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it --even if I have said it-- unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.</I><P>THE BUDDHA

<P><BR>

Rules are fun. We use rules to live (RULE: Keep breathing!), we use rules to rebel against, we use rules to get what we want, we use rules to keep other people from getting what they want (especially if we want to keep it), we use rules to justify not getting what we want, and so much more. Rules are fun.
<P>
"Most of us, by the time we're up on the rules," lamented Pappy Maverick, "are generally too old to play." That's what this chapter is aboutgetting up on the rules before we're too old to play.
<P>
Fundamentally, rules are tools. As with all tools, they can be used for us or against us, used well or used poorly, used to create or to destroy.
<P>
Rules are generally given either (A) to control or (B) to help. Sometimes it's hard to tell one motivation from another; often it depends on which side of the rule we happen to fall.
<P>
The use of rules to control is best summed up by Thoreau: "Any fool can make a rule, and every fool will mind it." The use of rules to impart wisdom was explained by Kin Hubbard: "There's no secret about success. Did you ever know a successful man that didn't tell you all about it?" The trick, of course, is to separate which rules are written by fools for fools and which are written by the wise for the guidance of the wise.
<P>
The key is our personal experience. "The rules which experience suggests," commented R. S. Storrs, "are better than those which theorists elaborate in their libraries." "Laws are not invented," observed Azarias; "they grow out of circumstances."
<P>
What truly works for us becomes a part of uswe use it and forget it's a rule. We break it at our peril, and are "punished" <I>by </I>breaking it, not <I>for </I>breaking it. "His face was filled with broken commandments," observed John Masefield. The rules that don't work we abandon. (We may<I> tell </I>ourselves and others that we follow rules we've really abandoned, but our actions speak volumes.)
<P>
The world is full of rules, and we can't possibly follow them all. The trick is in giving a rule a chance. It might not <I>seem </I>as though it will work, butsurprise!it does. Or, a rule may sound wonderful and yet not work at all. Once we know whether a given rule works or does not work based upon our personal experience, then we can use it or lose it.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>In reading and writing, you cannot lay down rules until you have learnt to obey them. Much more so in life.</I><P>MARCUS AURELIUS<BR>SECOND CENTURY A.D.
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

"Life is like music, it must be composed by ear, feeling and instinct, not by rule," wrote Samuel Butler. "Nevertheless one had better know the rules, for they sometimes guide in doubtful cases, though not often."
<P>
"You got to know the rules before you can break 'em," said Sonny Crockett on "Miami Vice." "Otherwise, it's no fun." "It's a good idea to obey all the rules when you're young," Mark Twain advised, "just so you'll have the strength to break them when you're old."
<P>
Of course, as Thomas Fuller pointed out, "There is no useful rule without an exception." We must be flexible, or we find ourselves like the man described by Charles Lamb: "His life was formal; his actions seemed ruled with a ruler."
<P>
On the other hand, we can't be completely -- albeit cleverly -- undisciplined. "There are those whose sole claim to profundity," observed Paul Eldridge, "is the discovery of exceptions to rules." Do we hear the counsel of our old friend<I> balance </I>in here?

<P><BR>

Before we give you the rules we suggest you explore (we only have three), we thought it would be fun to look at some of the rules other people have suggested.
<P>
In making lists of rules, ten seems to be the favorite number. This is no doubt in tribute to the original list of rules, the Ten Commandments. (Ah, for the simpler days when there was only one rule: don't eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.)
<P>
As the world seems to like lists of ten, and we seem to like lists of three, we'll compromise: Here are three lists of ten rules.
<P>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

The imagination is a powerful tool. When used against us by creating unrealistic shoulds, musts, have-tos and other judgments, it can destroy our wealth utterly. When used for us, however, it can be one of the most vigorous creators of wealthboth inner and outerin our lives.
<P>
The sanctuary is an inner structure that helps direct the imagination in wealthy ways. (If you have built a sanctuary while reading one of the other books in THE <I>LIFE 101 </I>SERIES, you can use this chapter to review, renew and perhaps add to the sanctuary you already have.)
<P>
We call it a sanctuary. Some call it a workshop, or an inner classroom. You can call it whatever word gives you the sense of asylum, harbor, haven, oasis, sheltera place you can go to learn your lessons in peace and harmony.
<P>
There are absolutely no limits to your sanctuary, although it's a good idea to put some limits on it. In this way, the sanctuary is a transitional point between the limitations of our physical existence and unlimitedness.
<P>
The sanctuary can be any size, shape or dimension you chooselarge and elaborate or small and cozy. It can be located anywherefloating in space, on a mountain top, by an ocean, in a valley, anywhere. (You are welcome to combine all those, if you like.) The nice thing about the sanctuary: you can change it or move it anytime instantly.
<P>
The sanctuary can contain anything you choose. We'll suggest some things here, but consider this just the beginning of your shopping list. Before giving our design tips (you can consider us interior designerswith an emphasis on the word<I> interior),</I> we'll talk about ways in which you might want to build your sanctuary.
<P>
Some people will build theirs by simply reading the suggestions: as they read each, it's there. Others might read them over now for information, and then put on some soft music, close their eyes and let the construction begin. Still others may want to make this an <I>active</I> process. With their eyes closed (and being careful not to bump into too much furniture), they might physically move as each area of the sanctuary is built and used. Allor any combinationof these are, of course, fine.
<P>

While reading through our suggestions, you will probably get ideas for additions or alterations. By all means make notes of these, or simply incorporate them as you go. Have we gotten across the idea that this is <I>your</I> sanctuary? OK, let's go.
<P>
<STRONG>Entryway.</STRONG> This is a door or some device that responds only to you and lets only you enter. (We'll suggest a way to bring others into your sanctuary in a moment.)
<P>
<STRONG>Light. </STRONG>Each time you enter your sanctuary, a pure, white light cascades over you, surrounding, filling, protecting, blessing and healing youfor your highest good, and the highest good of all concerned.
<P>
<STRONG>Main Room. </STRONG>Like the living room of a house or the lobby of a hotel, this is the central area. From here, there are many directions to go and many things to explore.
<P>
<STRONG>People Mover. </STRONG>This is a device to move people in and out of your sanctuary. No one ever enters without your express permission and invitation. You can use an elevator, conveyor belt, <I>Star Trek</I> beam-me-up device, or anything else that moves people. Let there be a white light at the entry of the mover as well, so that as people enter and leave your sanctuary, they are automatically surrounded, filled, protected and healed by that white light, and only that which is for their highest good and the highest good of all concerned is taking place.
<P>
<STRONG>Information Retrieval System. </STRONG>This is a method of getting any kind of informationproviding, of course, it's for your highest good (and the highest good of all concerned) that you have it. The information retrieval system can be a computer screen, a staff of librarians, a telephone, or any other device from which you feel comfortable asking questions and getting answers.
<P>
<STRONG>Video Screen. </STRONG>This is a video (or movie, if you like) screen in which you can view various parts of your life past, present or future. The screen has a white light around it. When you see images you don't like or don't want to encourage, the light is off. When the screen displays images you want to affirm, the light glows. (Those who are old enough to remember Sylvania's Halo of Light television know just what we mean.)
<P>
<STRONG>Ability Suits. </STRONG>This is a closet of costumes that, when worn, give you the instant ability to do anything you want to dogreat actor, successful writer, perfect lover, eager learner, Master of your Universe; any and all are available to you. When you're done with an ability suit, just throw it on the floor in front of the closetability suits have the ability to hang themselves up.
<P>
<STRONG>Ability Suit Practice Area. </STRONG>This is a place you can try new skillsor improve upon old oneswhile wearing your ability suits. Leave lots of room, because there's an ability suit for flying and another for space travel. In your sanctuary, not even the sky's a limit.
<P>
<STRONG>Health Center. </STRONG>Here the healing arts of all the agespast, present, future; traditional and alternativeare gathered in one place. All are devoted to your greater health. The health center is staffed with the most competent health practitioners visualization can buy. Who is the most healing being you can imagine? That's who runs your center.
<P>
<STRONG>Playroom. </STRONG>Here, all the toys you ever wantedas a child or as an adultare gathered. There's lots of roomand timeto play with each. As with ability suits, you never have to worry about "putting your toys away." They put themselves away.
<P>
<STRONG>Sacred Room. </STRONG>This is a special sanctuary within your sanctuary. You can go there for meditation, contemplation or special inner work.
<P>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

<STRONG>Master Teacher. </STRONG>This is your ideal teacher, the being with whom you are the perfect student. The Master Teacher (or MT for short) knows everything about you (has always been with you, in fact). The MT also knows all you need to learn, the perfect timing for your learning it, and the ideal way of teaching it to you. You don't <I>create</I> a Master Teacherthat's already been done. You <I>discover</I> your Master Teacher. To meet your Master Teacher, simply walk over to your people mover, ask for your Master Teacher to come forth, and from the pure, white light of your people mover comes your Master Teacher.
<P>
(We'll leave you two alone for a while. More uses for the sanctuary later. See you both in the next chapter!)

<H2>Using Your Sanctuary for Creating Wealth</H2>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

You can use your sanctuary any time, any place. It need not be used in a "formal" session with incense, candles and closed eyes (although that's fun, too).
<P>
Going to your sanctuary can be as simple and natural as remembering the melody for the words "Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light..." or the color of a banana or the smell of a rose or the taste of an orange. We usually don't have to <I>concentrate</I> to remember the things we knowwe just know them.
<P>
So it is with the sanctuary: once we get to know it and get in the habit of using it, it always seems to be there. We can be in our sanctuary while standing in line, waiting for someone to stop talking, or reading the dull passages of a book. ("When <I>are</I> they going to tell me how to get more money?") In other words, when something else fascinating isn't going on (and, let's face it, that's most of the time), we can be in our sanctuary doing wealth work.
<P>
Here's where your personal creativity comes in. How can your experience of wealth (health, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what you want, opportunity, enjoying and balance) be enhanced by the various tools within your sanctuary? We'll suggest a few ways here, but consider this listing as just a start. The possibilities are as infinite and varied as the experience of wealth itself.
<P>
Always pass through the white light as you enter the sanctuary (it only takes a split second), knowing that only that which is for your highest good and the highest good of all concerned is taking place. 
<P>
Also, feel free to invite your Master Teacher along for any or all of these explorations.
<P>
<STRONG>People Mover.</STRONG> What person or persons can give you advice, counsel, guidance or assistance in gaining greater health, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowledge of what you want, opportunity, enjoying and balance? This can be anyonepast present, future, even fictional. (Sometimes there's a question about wealth that only Yoda or Scrooge McDuck can answer.) As they enter and leave your sanctuary, make sure that they pass through the light for their highest good and the highest good of all concerned.
<P>
<STRONG>Information Retrieval System</STRONG>. What information would help you be more wealthy? If it's for your highest good to know it at this time, you'll find it here. Or, you may be instructed where else to look for it.
<P>
<STRONG>Video Screen. </STRONG>Sit comfortably in front of your video screen. The light around it is off. See yourself on the screen in a situation in which you are unhealthy, unhappy, not abundant, unprosperous, not rich, unloving, uncaring, not sharing, unwilling to learn, not knowing what you want, lacking opportunity, not enjoying or out of balance. Then imagine a paintbrush is in your hand, heavy with black paint. Make a large X across that unwealthy image. The screen clears. The paint fades. The white light around the screen glows. Now see yourself in the corresponding wealthy situation. If you were unhealthy, see yourself glowing with vibrant health, doing healthy things, feeling healthy. If you saw yourself as unhappy, see yourself joyously happy, surrounded by happiness. Do this for all the attributes of wealth.
<P>
<STRONG>Ability Suits and Ability Suit Practice Area.</STRONG> Go to your ability suit closet. Look at the section labeled <I>WEALTH. </I>There you'll find thirteen suits. Can you guess their names? Yes, there's an ability suit for health, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what you want, opportunity, enjoying and balance. Put one on. Now move over to the ability suit practice area and see, feel, hear, smell and even taste yourself living that ability to the full. When finished with that suit, take it off (it hangs itself up, you'll recall) and try another.
<P>
Ability suits are also good to put on before entering a real-life situation. If you're going into a situation that might challenge your balance, for example, put on the ability suit for balance before entering the situation (or even once you're already in itit only takes a split second) and keep it on while the real-life situation continues. Feel free to wear more than one ability suit at a time. The suits for loving, caring and sharing, for example, are "color coordinated and accent each other magnificently," according to the latest <I>Ability Suit Quarterly.</I>
<P>
<STRONG>Health Center. </STRONG>What needs to be healed in youon any level: physical, emotional, mental or spiritualso you can experience more health, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what you want, opportunity, enjoying and balance? Whatever it may be, it can be healed in your health center. If you don't know or aren't sure what needs to be healed, your health center has some of the best diagnosticians in the known Universe. (They tend to diagnose and heal in the same motion, however, so maybe you'll never knowyou'll just be healed.) Also, feel free to invite friends and loved ones into your sanctuary through the people mover and ask them if they'd like a treatment or two in your health center. The health of those we love is part of our wealth, too.
<P>
<STRONG>Playroom. </STRONG>Have <I>fun</I> with your health, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what you want, opportunity, enjoying and balance. Play with your wealth. Enjoy yourself. Invite in people you'd enjoy playing with on the people mover.
<P>
<STRONG>Sacred Room. </STRONG>Spend time here meditating, contemplating, praying and doing spiritual exercises about life, wealth in general, or about each aspect of wealth in particular.
<P>
<STRONG>Master Teacher. </STRONG>One of the most powerful and practical tools in your sanctuary is your Master Teacher. (Do you think a Master Teacher minds being called a "tool"? Probably not. Master Teachers are used to being called <I>a lot </I>of things.) Sit with your Master Teacherperhaps in your sacred roomand discuss your health, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what you want, opportunity, enjoying and balance with your Master Teacher. Ask questions. Listen to the answers.
<P>
In daily life, remember that your MT is always there. Listen for the Master Teacher's voice no matter where you are or what you're doing. It's a direct connection to your wealth.

"My boat sleeps four comfortably," William F. Buckley, Jr., explained, "but five is three too many." And so it seems with life. If we can do four things happily, joyfully and productively within an hour, when we add a fifth, it's three too many. We become hurried, harried and unhappy.
<P>
"We live in a vastly complex society which has been able to provide us with a multitude of material things, and this is good," wrote Euell Gibbons, "but people are beginning to suspect that we have paid a high spiritual price for our plenty."
<P>
That was written about twenty years ago. People no longer <I>suspect</I> we're paying a high spiritual price, people <I>know</I> it. The solution? Slow down. Relax. At least once a day, take some time for meditation, contemplation, prayer, spiritual exercises or just plain taking it easy.
<P>
Make time in the noise and the chatter of life for some silence. "A man is known by the silence he keeps," observed Oliver Herford. "Silence is wonderful to listen to," said Thomas Hardy.
<P>
Silence is so, well, <I>golden </I>that entire philosophies have been based upon it. In fact, some people never seem to shut up about silence. "Carlyle finally compressed his Gospel of Silence," noted John Morley, "into thirty handsome octavos."
<P>
One thing we get from silence is the value of what we might <I>hear.</I> "Learn to listen," advised Frank Tyger. "Opportunity could be knocking at your door very softly."
<P>
Meditation, contemplation, prayer and spiritual exercises help us answer that burning question, "Who am I?" "Prayer gives a man the opportunity of getting to know a gentleman he hardly ever meets," said William Inge. "I do not mean his maker, but himself." Tom Masson pointed out, "The best way to study human nature is when nobody else is present."
<P>
Whenever you meditate, contemplate, pray, do spiritual exercises or "just sits," it's good to ask the white light to surround, fill and protect you, knowing only that which is for your highest good and the highest good of all concerned will take place during your quiet time.
<P>
Before starting, prepare your physical environment. Arrange not to be disturbed. Unplug the phone. Put a note on the door. Wear ear plugs if noises might distract you. (We like the soft foam-rubber kind sold under such trade names as E.A.R., HUSHER and DECIDAMP.) Take care of your bodily needs. Have some water nearby if you get thirsty, and maybe some tissues, too.
<P>

<STRONG>Contemplation</STRONG> is thinking <I>about</I> something, often something of an uplifting nature. You could contemplate any of the hundreds of quotes or ideas in this book. Often, when we hear a new and potentially useful idea, we say, "I'll have to think about that." Contemplation is a good time to "think about that," to consider the truth of it, to imagine the changes and improvements it might make in your life.
<P>
Or, you could contemplate a nonverbal object, such as a flower, or a concept, such as God. The idea of contemplation is to set aside a certain amount of quiet time to think about just <I>that,</I> whatever you decide "that" will be.
<P>
<STRONG>Meditation.</STRONG> There are so many techniques of meditation, taught by so many organizations, that it's hard to define the word properly.
<P>
You might want to try various meditations to see what they're like. With meditation, please keep in mind that <I>you'll never know until you do it.</I> We may somehow like to think we know what the effects of a given meditation will be just by reading the description, and that, in fact, is exactly what happens. We <I>think</I> we know; we don't <I>really</I> know. We suggest you try it, gain the experience, and decide from that more stable base of knowledge what is best for you at this time. And please remember to "call in the light" before beginning. We suggest you do not do these meditations while driving a car, operating dangerous machinery or where you need to be alert.

<P><BR>

<STRONG>Breathing Meditation.</STRONG> Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and simply be aware of your breath. Follow it in and out. Don't "try" to breathe; don't consciously alter your rhythm of breathing; just follow the breath as it naturally flows in and out. If you get lost in thoughts, return to your breath. This can be a very refreshing meditationtwenty minutes can feel like a night's sleep. It's also especially effective when you're feeling emotionally upset.
<P>
<STRONG>Tones.</STRONG> Some people like to add a word or sound to help the mind focus as the breath goes in and out. Some people use <I>one </I>or <I>God</I> or<I> AUM (OHM)</I> or<I> love.</I> Theseor any othersare fine. As you breathe in, say to yourself, mentally, "love." As you breathe out, "love." A few other tones you might want to try:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI><STRONG>HU.</STRONG> HU is an ancient sound for the higher power. One of the first names humans ever gave to a supreme being was HU. Some good words begin with HU: <I>humor, human, hub</I> (the center), <I>hug, huge, hue, humus</I> ("The Good Earth"), <I>humble,</I> and, of course, <I>hula.</I> HU is pronounced "Hugh." You can say it silently as you breathe in, and again as you breathe out. Or, you can pronounce the letter H on the inhale and the letter U on the exhale. You might also try saying HU out loud as you exhale, but don't do it out loud more than fifteen times in one sitting; the energies it produces can be powerful.
<P>
	<LI><STRONG>ANI-HU.</STRONG> This tone brings with it compassion, empathy and unity. You can chant it silently (ANI on the inhale, HU on the exhale) or out loud (ANI-HU on the exhale). It makes a lovely group chant and tends to harmonize the groupin more ways than one.
<P>
	<LI><STRONG>HOO.</STRONG> This can be used like the HU. Some people prefer it. It's one syllable, pronounced like the word who.
<P>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I do most of my work sitting down; that's where I shine.</I><P>ROBERT BENCHLEY
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

<UL>
	<LI><STRONG>RA.</STRONG> RA is a tone for bringing great amounts of physical energy into the body. You can do it standing or sitting. Standing tends to bring in more energy. Take a deep breath and, as you exhale, chant, out loud, "ERRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAA" until your air runs out. Take another deep breath and repeat it; then again. After three RAs, breathe normally for a few seconds. Then do another set of three, pause, then another set of three. We suggest you don't do more than three sets of three at any one time.
<P>
	<LI><STRONG>SO-HAWNG.</STRONG> The SO-HAWNG meditation is a good one to use when your mind wants to do one thing and your emotions another. SO-HAWNG tends to unify the two, getting them on the same track. This tone is done silently. You breathe in on SO and out on HAWNG. Try it with your eyes closed for about five minutes and see how you feel. You may feel ready to accomplish some task you've been putting off for a long time.
<P>
	<LI><STRONG>THO.</STRONG> THO is a tone of healing. The correct pronunciation of it is important. Take a deep breath, and as you breathe out say, "THooooo." The TH is accented; it's a sharp, percussive sound (and it may tickle your upper lip). It's followed by "ooooooo" as an extended version of the word <I>oh.</I> To do the THO meditation, sit comfortably, close your eyes, inhale and exhale twice, take a third deep breath, and on the third exhale, say, "THoooooo." Repeat three times this series of three breaths with THO aloud on the third breath. That's enough. It's powerful. Feel the healing energies move through your body. You can also chant THO inwardly as a formal meditation or any time during the day, even while doing something else. (But, again, as with all meditations, not while driving a car or operating potentially dangerous equipment.)
<P>
</UL>
<STRONG>Flame Meditation.</STRONG> This uses the power of fire to dissolve negativity. Put a candle on a table and sit so you can look directly into the flame, not down on it. Allow your energy to flow <I>up </I>and <I>out</I> into the candle. You may feel negativity or have negative thoughts. Don't pay any attention to their content; just release them into the flame. If you feel your energy dropping back down inside of you as though you were going into a trance, blow out the candle and stop the meditation. The idea is to keep the energy flowing up and out and into the flame. Do it for no more than five minutes to start. See how you feel for a day or so afterward. You may have more vivid dreams. If you feel fine otherwise, you might try it for longer periods. Twenty minutes a day would be a lot.

<P><BR>

<STRONG>Water Meditation.</STRONG> Take some water in a clear glass, hold it between your hands (without your hands touching each other), and simply look down into the glass. Observe whatever you observe. You may see colors. You may see energy emanating from your hands. You may just see yourself holding a glass of water. Observe the water for five minutes, gradually working up to fifteen. Drink the water at the end of the meditation. Your energies have made it a "tonic," giving you whatever you may need at that time. As an experiment, you can take two glasses, each half-filled with tap water. Set one aside, and do the water meditation with the other. Then taste each. Don't be surprised if the one you "charged" tastes different.
<P>
<STRONG>E.</STRONG> The E sound is chanted out loud after meditation to "ground" you and bring your focus back to the physical. It's a steady "Eeeeeeeeeeeee" as though you were pronouncing the letter E. It begins at the lower register of your voice, travels to the upper range, then back down again in one breath. You begin as a bass, go through tenor, alto, onto soprano, and back to bass again. As you do this, imagine that the sound is in your feet when you're in the lower register, gradually going higher in your body as your voice goes higher, finally reaching the top of your head at the highest note of the eeee, and then back down your body as the voice lowers. If you try it, you'll see that it's far easier to do than it is to explain. Do two or three E sounds after each meditation session.

These tones and meditations have worked for many people. We don't ask you to <I>believe</I> they work. We simply ask you, if you like, to try them and see what happens. If they do work, you don't need belief; you've got knowledge. Your results will dictate whether you'll use them often, sometimes, seldom or never.
<P>
Some may work better for you than others; that's only natural. Use the ones that work best for you now and, every so often, return to the others to see if they will offer more.
<P>
Some people think meditation takes time <I>away</I> from physical accomplishment. Taken to extremes, of course, that's true. Most people, however, find that meditation <I>creates</I> more time than it <I>takes.</I> 
<P>
Meditation is for rest, healing, balance and information. All these are helpful in the attainment of a goal. Here's an additional technique you might want to add to your meditation. It's designed to make both the meditation and the time outside of meditation more effective.
<P>
One of the primary complaints people have about meditating is, "My thoughts won't leave me alone." Perhaps the mind is trying to communicate something valuable. If the thought is something to do, write it down (or record it on a tape recorder). Then return to the meditation. This allows the mind to move onto something elsesuch as meditation, for example.
<P>
As the "to do" list fills, the mind empties. If the thought, "Call the bank," reappears, you need only tell the mind, "It's on the list. You can let that one go." And it will. (It is important, however, to <I>do</I> the things on the listor at least to consider them from a nonmeditative state. If you don't, the mind will not pay any more attention to your writing it down than you do, and it will continue to bring it up, over and over.)
<P>
When finished meditating, not only will you have had a better meditation; you will also have a "to do" list that is very useful. One insight gleaned during meditation might save <I>hours,</I> perhaps <I>days</I> of unnecessary work. That's what we mean when we sayfrom a purely practical point of viewmeditation can make more time than it takes.

<H2>Go Fast</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Nothing can be attained without suffering but at the same time one must begin by sacrificing suffering.</I><P>GURUDJIEFF
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

<I>Fast</I> can mean to speed up ("Faster! Faster!") or to grasp tightly ("Hold fast!"). It can also mean to let go, to abstain from ("I'm on a fast"). We're going to discuss <I>fast</I> in the latter sense.
<P>
Fasting usually refers to abstaining from food, but we'd like to expand the definition to also include abstaining from negativity. For some people, the toughest sacrifice of all is to sacrifice suffering.
<P>
Most people think anger, depression, fear, hurt feelings, guilt and all the so-called negative emotions are the "natural" responses to certain situations.
<P>
What if they're not? What if we were programmed to respond that way, and, if we worked hard at it, we could program ourselves to respond in another way?
<P>
It's OK to feel good when things go bad.
<P>
"But," some say, "people who feel good when things go bad aren't <I>normal!"</I> Perhaps, but as R. D. Laing pointed out, "Normal men have killed perhaps 100,000,000 of their fellow normal men in the last fifty years."
<P>
To feel good when things go bad is not just abnormal; it's beyond revolutionary; it's downright<I> radical. </I>
<P>
Fortunately, feeling is an inner process. Most people won't know how abnormal you are.<I> They</I> can all be feeling miserable at the news of fresh disaster in the papers or on television or from gossip, and<I> you</I> can be feeling perfectly wonderful. They probably won't notice. This is good, because martyrdom is so hard on the body.
<P>
Yes, it's a risk to enjoy yourself all the time, but, more than risk, it's a lot of <I>work.</I> "Thinking is hard work," observed Thomas Edison. Fasting from negativity and sacrificing suffering requires not just thinking, but<I> re</I>thinking every negative response you currently hold to be "automatic."

<H2>Turn a Twist on It</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I think it's very important to be positive about everything in your life that's negative. You can turn a twist on it. </I><P>BARBRA STREISAND
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

What if things were neither good nor evil, but simply <I>were? </I> What would life be like if we recaptured the state of original innocence, before the original sin, the first mistake? "We are stardust, we are golden," observed Joni Mitchell, "and we've got to get ourselves back to the garden."
<P>
In the garden, we could see that nothing was good or evil <I>in itself,</I> but that everything had both positive and negative <I>uses.</I> It is not what something <I>is,</I> but how something is <I>used</I> that determines its relative good or evil.
<P>
A knife, for example, is neutral in itself. It can be used to kill or to cure, to harm or to help. What if this were true for <I>everything </I>in our lives? What if each of the "bad" things we wish we could get rid of had a positive side? What if we could, as Barbra Streisand put it, "turn a twist on it"?
<P>
Let's start with <B>childhood.</B> What if all those experiences we didn't like about our childhood are the same ones that made us strong, resilient, determined, funny or any of the other aspects of our character we admire?
<P>
Barbra Streisand again: "I can either complain about my mother not believing in me, or I can tell you it served me in some way to become who I am."
<P>
Without everything<I>everything</I>4<HRthat happened in your childhood, you wouldn't be the remarkable person you are today. Oh, sure, if things had been different, a "problem area" might not be there, but the qualities developed to compensate for that "problem" might not be there, either.
<P>
And what about <B>problems?</B> What if problems were, as Duke Ellington called them, "a chance for you to do your best"? What if even the problems themselves had both a good and bad use, and if we saw them differently, we could use problems for our learning, upliftment and growth?
<P>
We can view problemsand all of life itself, for that matterin a new light by changing two things: our attitude and our altitude. When one lifts, the other lifts, and we see the opportunity hidden behind the problem.
<P>
With the right attitude, we move <I>through </I>the problem. We get on the other side and, lo, there's the benefit. With altitude, we lift above the problem and see the blessing just beyond it. Then we can see the problem as merely a way of delivering the blessing to usa protective covering, if you will. We don't curse the gift wrapping. We remove it with enthusiasm to get to the gift.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>An adventure is only an inconvenience, rightly considered.</I><P>G. K. CHESTERTON
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Sometimes the gift is simply that we're stronger. Sometimes the gift is a lesson. Usually it's both. In this way, problems are a form of exercise and a form of study.
<P>
"Never regard study as a duty," wrote Albert Einstein, "but as the enviable opportunity to learn to know the liberating influence of beauty in the realm of the spirit for your own personal joy and to the profit of the community to which your later work belongs."
<P>
How seldom do we look at problems in <I>that </I>light? It's the advantage of seeing a problem with an elevated attitude and altitude. Here's an example from Ernie Wise and Eric Morecambe on seeing life from the attitude of "no problem."
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
ERNIE:  Is this my bill?
<P>
ERIC:  Yes, sir.
<P>
ERNIE:  I'm terribly sorryit looks as if I've got just enough money to pay for the dinner, but I've got nothing to tip you with.
<P>
ERIC:  Let me add that bill up again, sir.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
"Consider that people are like tea bags," wrote Dan McKinnon. "They don't know their own strength until they get into hot water."
<P>
Let's take a look at some specific "problems" and see how we might be able to turn a twist on them.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Aunt Maggie was every bit as worried as Mother but they'd take turns cheering each other up. Both of them were confirmed pessimists but never at the same time. Whichever one picked up the pessimism first evidently had a claim on it. The other would automatically assume the role of optimist, although always with a certain lack of conviction.</I><P>STEVE ALLEN
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

<STRONG>Fear.</STRONG> This is an easy one: fear is the energy to do your best in a new situation. The feeling of fear (anxiety, nervousness, shyness, or any of its other aliases) is really <I>preparation energy.</I> It's getting you ready to excel, to succeed, to do your best and to learn the most.
<P>
Does this mean we'll do whatever we fear perfectly? Hardly. We'll probably fail any number of times, but that's how we learnone way, at least. "There is the greatest practical benefit in making a few failures early in life," said T. H. Huxley, and Robert Louis Stevenson agreed: "Give me the young man who has brains enough to make a fool of himself."
<P>
<STRONG>Anger.</STRONG> Anger is the energy to make change. We use it to make a change in the outer world. "I suppose I overdo it," said Theodore Roosevelt, "but when I'm mad at a man I want to climb right up his chest." Of someone like that, Thomas Ybarra wrote, "He owned and operated a ferocious temper." The explosive quality of anger may be taking it a bit too farexcept in certain fight-or-flight situations that really <I>are </I>matters of life and death.
<P>
Well-modulated anger, however carefully released over time and in the right situations can be the stimulus to great change. Some of the most important social, political and cultural changes have been made because people were simply angry with the injustices, unfairnesses and absurdities they saw around them.
<P>
Alas, even with anger, the world still does not always give us what we want, when we want it, in the way we want it. What do we do? Usually we just sit and seethe. "His huff arrived," reported Alexander Woollcott, "and he departed in it."
<P>
When we do this, we aren't using the full capacity of anger's energy for change. We can, at that point, use it to change <I>ourselves. </I>We can change the shoulds, musts, have-tos and other judgments making us angry in the first place. It's not what <I>happens </I>to us, but how we <I>respond </I>to what happens to us that matters. When the outer world does not live up to our expectations, we can use the anger to change the response of resentment within ourselves.
<P>

If we <I>do </I>want to change what we find unfair in the world, we do not have to maintain our anger to do so. Usually, that just burns people out. They become embittered by the struggle and give up. Anger is best used as a <I>spark</I> for the will"I <I>will </I>make a change." We can then use the residual anger to change the "should" within ourselves. We can still make the change "out there"and often more effectively.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>His renown has been purchased, not by deeds of violence and blood, but by the diligent dispensation of pleasure.</I><P>WASHINGTON IRVING<BR>1820

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Besides, there's another reason for not getting angry. As reported in the <I>Reader's Digest: </I>"Keep your temper. Do not quarrel with an angry person, but give him a soft answer. It is commanded by the Holy Writ and, furthermore, it makes him madder than anything else you could say."
<P>
<B>Guilt.</B> Guilt is getting angry at ourselveswe didn't live up to our own expectations; therefore we feel guilty. Again, we can use the energy to change the outer action (if we <I>say</I> we're not going to eat the cake, then we can use the energy to <I>not</I> eat the cake), or (since we're probably going to eat the cake anyway) we can use guilt to change the belief that we should, must and have-to behave in a certain way.
<P>
"Regret is an appalling waste of energy," wrote Katherine Mansfield; "you can't build on it; it's only good for wallowing in." Don't waste. Don't wallow. Change. Rather than feel like a bad person, tell yourself that you're a good person, and that good people sometimes eat cake even when they know they shouldn't. The energy for change is there: use it.
<P>
<B>Hurt Feelings. </B>We hurt because we care about something, and it is taken from us or is not behaving the way we want something we love to behave. Under the hurt is the caring. Caring is healing. Move to the caring. Let that caring energy heal the hurt.
<P>
The only thing keeping our caring from healing our hurting is the mistaken belief that someone or something outside ourselves is necessary for our emotional well- being. The caring we feel for another we can just as easily feel for ourselvesmore easily, in fact: it only has to go from one part of our heart to another; not a long journey at all.

<B>Unworthiness. </B>Good news about unworthiness? Sure: unworthiness keeps us on track. Once we choose what we <I>really</I> want in lifewhat we want more than anything elseunworthiness will gladly let us know that we're not worthy of everything else.
<P>
The trick, of course, is to program ourselves to feel worthy of our Big Goal, then let unworthiness have its say on all the other goals in the worldthe goals we're not pursuing anyway because we want our Big One. In this way, unworthiness will keep us on track, on target and on time. (We'll be discussing the "knowing what you want" aspect of wealth shortly.)
<P>
<B>Stubbornness. </B>Stubbornness is really determination. Stubbornness is taking our will power and turning it into won't power. The twist? All we have to do is turn it back again. Be determined you <I>will </I>have what you want, not stubbornly battling what you <I>won't.</I>
<P>
"Like all weak men," observed Somerset Maugham, "he laid an exaggerated stress on not changing one's mind." Or, consider this from Bertrand Russell: <I>"I </I>am firm;<I> you </I>are obstinate; <I>he </I>is a pig-headed fool." When we don't know what we<I> want,</I> but only know what we <I>don't </I>want, will power can easily become won't power.
<P>
All we need to do is will <I>toward </I>our goal, our Big Dream, what we want most. Then stubbornness becomes determination. One additional thought on will: will is to be used <I>within</I> us to move us to greater growth, not <I>without</I> to control others.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Remember that you ought to behave in life as you would at a banquet.

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Getting the hang of this? If we turn a twist on it, see a problem from another altitude or with a different attitude, we can find a positive use for <I>anything</I> that happens to us. Let's try one more.
<P>
<B>Overweight. </B>What an abundant culture we live in to have overweight as a major problem. Let's look at weight for what it is. Weight is fat; fat is stored energy; therefore weight is an excess of stored energy.
<P>
Think, then, about <I>using </I>the weight, not<I> losing</I> the weight. Think of all the things you want to do. Your weight is the energy necessary to do a good many of themperhaps all.
<P>
There's no more reason to resent excess weight than there is to resent an excessively heavy diamond. "This ring weighs too much; I can hardly lift my hand," is a complaint you've probably never heard. So, to say, "I weigh too much," is another way of saying, "I have too much energy." There is no such thing as too much energywith enough altitude and the right attitude. Use it <I>to</I> lose it.
<P>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

It might seem as though this would be a point of major transition: From this point on we stop <I>enjoying</I> and start <I>obtaining.</I> "Abandon all pleasure," you might expect us to say at this point; "there's no time for it!"
<P>
As you've been reading along in the book, however, you may have noticed that we are of the opinion that fulfilling your heart's desire your big dream is not an unenjoyable act.
<P>
Sure, it's a lot of hard work, and yes, of course, it means forgoing a lot of momentary pleasures, but pursuing one's goal and living one's dream have more built-in enjoyment and especially satisfaction than a life devoted merely to pleasure. In fact, a life devoted solely to pleasure, that does not include any portion of one's big dream, is a good working definition of hell.
<P>
In this section yes, finally we are going to discuss how to get more money. This section is full of techniques on how to get more of the spendable stuff. We'll look at the limiting beliefs we have about money in our culture, the expansive beliefs, how to eliminate the former and enhance the latter.
<P>
Let's start by seeing if money is what you <I>really</I> want.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Are You Sure It's Money You Really Want?</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>My father worked for the same firm for twelve years. They fired him. They replaced him with a tiny gadget this big. It does everything that my father does, only it does it much better. The depressing thing is my mother ran out and bought one.</I><P>WOODY ALLEN
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Because money is such a powerful symbol of energy, we often fall into the trap of thinking that if we want something, we need money in order to get it.
<P>
Quite often, when we <I>think</I> we want money, what we really want are either <I>resources</I> or <I>experiences.</I>
<P>
If we want a resource let's say transportation we might automatically think, "Oh, I need some money to buy a car." Yes, money would buy us a car. But by thinking money is the <I>only</I> way to get the transportation we need, we limit not only our thinking and creativity, but also the ways in which our desire for transportation can be fulfilled.
<P>
Someone might, for example, loan us a car. Or, perhaps we learn that public transportation will take us everywhere we need to go and we get to catch up on our reading at the same time. Or, the eccentric next door neighbor puts her chauffeured limousine at our disposal. (Why not?)
<P>
The same is true of <I>experiences.</I> Let's say the experience we want is foreign travel. We might think, "I'd better save my money so that I can travel to foreign countries." Yes, money will pay for foreign travel. Yet there are other ways. You could get a job as a traveling companion, join the Peace Corps, fall in love with a diplomat, or more to the point have a diplomat fall in love with <I>you.</I>
<P>
When we expand the methods by which our desires can be fulfilled including ways we haven't even thought of we also expand the ways in which the Universe can fulfill those desires.
<P>
The Universe has so many, many ways to fulfill desires. Often people limit themselves by saying, "I need money! Money, money and <I>only</I> money will fulfill my needs." That's like saying "Caviar, caviar and <I>only</I> caviar will fill my hunger." Yes, caviar would probably do it, but so would several thousand other foods. Furthermore, caviar is somewhat scarcer than, say, hot dogs. From the standpoint of sheer availability, it's easier to satisfy hunger through hot dogs than caviar.
<P>
The same is true of money. Because so many people <I>think</I> that <I>only</I> money will fill their needs, money is relatively scarce. <I>Resources</I> and <I>experiences,</I> on the other hand, are abundant.
<P>
No, they're not always free you'll probably have to work for them. But you'll probably have to do less work directly pursuing resources and experiences than it would take to get the money and buy them. As they say in those television ads for discount stores, "Eliminate the middle man!"
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The love of money as a possession-- as distinguished from the love of money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of life-- will be recognized for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease.</I><P>JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

When we "eliminate the middle man" (money) and go directly after the resources and experiences we want, it's often easier and less trouble to get them.
<P>
Take a look at your big dream, your heart's desire. Some of it will probably require money, yes, but much of it perhaps more than you originally thought can be fulfilled by going directly after the resources and experiences to fulfill your dream.
<P>
Another way of saying this is that we'll have a lot more <I>opportunities</I> to fulfill our dream if we expand our thinking to include methods other than money. We begin to see opportunities where we never saw opportunities before.
<P>
Opportunity, of course, is one of the attributes of wealth. By looking for <I>opportunities</I> and not just money we begin to realize how much more wealth we already have, how much wealthier we already are. If we remember to appreciate and be grateful for that newly discovered wealth, we continue the cycle of expansion, which allows us to get even more.
<P>
That said, let's take some time looking at how to get more of that <I>specific </I>opportunity money.
<P>

<H2>If You Want More Money . . .</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The only point in making money is, you can tell some big shot where to go.</I><P>HUMPHREY BOGART
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

There are so many cultural beliefs about money pulling on us at any one time, it's no wonder most people feel confused. The amount of money we currently have is a direct result of the limiting (negative) and the expansive (positive) beliefs we have bought about money.
<P>
That <I>we</I> "bought" them is important. Just because the culture has a belief about money, doesn't mean we have to buy it. When we do buy it, however, it's ours until we decide to get rid of it.
<P>
If we want to have more money, there are two fundamental things we must do:
<P><OL>
	<LI>Reduce the number of limiting (negative) beliefs we have about money; and
<P>
	<LI>Increase the number of expansive (positive) beliefs we have about money.</OL>
<P>
We implement these two methods in a variety of ways. Primarily, however, we <I>actively</I> challenge the validity of the limiting beliefs, and we affirm the wisdom of the expansive beliefs.
<P>
Let's start by looking at some of the limiting beliefs we have about money in our culture.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Why It's Amazing We Ever Have Any Money</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I find all this money a considerable burden.</I><P>J. PAUL GETTY
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Take a look at some of these limiting beliefs about money. See if you even to a slight degree "bought" any of them.
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>It takes money to make money.
	<LI>Poor is pure.
	<LI>Money is dirty ("filthy rich").
	<LI>People resent rich people.
	<LI>Wealthy people are snobbish.
	<LI>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
	<LI>Money is the root of all evil.
	<LI>You need training and education to get money.
	<LI>Money can't buy you love.
	<LI>You can't take it with you.
	<LI>Money is too much responsibility.
	<LI>It takes hard work to make money.
	<LI>Money isn't everything.
	<LI>The best things in life are free.
	<LI>Money isn't spiritual or holy. 
</UL
<P>
Whew! It's easy to see how believing even a few of those not only keeps money away from us, but might even make us want to get rid of the money we have.
<P>
Let's challenge those limiting beliefs.

<H2>Challenging the Limiting Beliefs about Money</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Money never made a fool of anybody; it only shows 'em up.</I><P>ELBERT HUBBARD
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Let's take a look at each of the limiting beliefs in the last chapter which represent our culture's primary limiting beliefs about money and ask ourselves one fundamental question about each of them: "Is this true?"
<P>
Something need not be true, of course, to control our lives. It is only necessary that we <I>believe</I> something is true for it to have an effect upon our lives. For centuries, humanity believed the world was flat and behaved as though that were true, limiting exploration and expansion. The world is not flat. The world never was flat. The belief, however, that the world <I>was</I> flat made people behave as though it were.
<P>
The same is true of our beliefs about money if we <I>believe</I> a limiting statement is true, it will limit us. The first step is to find out whether it's true or not. The second step is to stop believing it's true, if it's not. Let's take the first step now.
<P>
In order to prove that something is not true for each person and, consequently, not necessarily true about us we only need to find <I>one</I> exception to every "rule." If someone else was number one, we can be number two.
<P>
<STRONG>It takes money to make money.</STRONG>It takes a dream, a commitment to that dream, and the relentless, passionate pursuit of that dream until it is realized to make <I>anything</I> in this world including money. There is story after story of people who started with nothing and made great sums of money. There are also stories of people who started with large sums of money and wound up on skid row. If you expand your container of wealth and money is the energy you need to make your dream come true money will come to you.
<P>
<STRONG>Poor is pure.</STRONG> Money is dirty. Being poor is intrinsically no purer neither in mind, body, emotions nor physical surroundings than being rich. In fact, money can help make things purer if that's what a person wants. Some of the grinding poverty we've seen has nothing to do with purity. Not that a poor person must be impure or that a rich person can't be impure (on whatever level you define impurity). It's just that one's purity has little to do with the amount of money one has.
<P>

<STRONG>People resent rich people.</STRONG> Sure, some people resent rich people. Some people resent that ">The Star Spangled Banner>[The Star Spangled Banner]>The Star Spangled Banner" is difficult to sing. Some people resent it when it rains. Some people resent people who don't resent anything. Those who want to resent will do so, and they will also find for them the <I>perfect</I> reasons to do so. Because resentful people are often jealous people, being jealous of other people's money is a perfect excuse to resent them. It's not a logical excuse, or a <I>reasonable</I> excuse, you understand, but it is a <I>perfect</I> excuse.
<P>
On the other hand, some people <I>respect</I> rich people. They may have their perfect reasons that are no more reasonable or logical than the reasons of those who resent rich people, but, nevertheless, there are those who worship the rich. Not getting money because others may resent you for having it is a form of worshiping the god of other people's opinion. This is one of the strangest of the "strange gods" people sacrifice their heart's desires to. The fact is, some people are going to resent you no matter <I>what</I> you do or don't do. You might as well follow your dream and be resented for following it rather than being resented for some other reason.
<P>
<STRONG>Wealthy people are snobbish.</STRONG> Some wealthy people are snobby, and some poor people are snobby. Some wealthy people are down to earth, and some poor people are down to earth. Being snobby has to do with complacency, prejudice and unchallenged bad habits not money. Snobby people are punished by their own snobbery, just as those who resent snobs are punished by their own resentment. Snobbishness is certainly <I>not</I> a natural outcome of having lots of money.
<P>

<P><BR>

<STRONG>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</STRONG> This is, of course, a biblical quotation. It is one of those thrice-witnessed events in the life of Jesus, written about by Matthew (19:24), Mark (10:25) and Luke (18:25). In our research, we discovered several explanations as to what Jesus may have meant by a camel going through the eye of a needle. It's clear in all of them, however, that he was not referring to a great big camel and a little teeny needle. Jesus taught in parables, and the following is our favorite interpretation of that parable.
<P>
One of the gates in the walled city of Jerusalem is called the Needle. Within each gate of the city was a smaller gate called "the eye." "The eye of the Needle," then, would refer to the small gate within the larger gate known as the Needle. On holy days, the main gates would be closed, but the eyes would be opened. (Hmmm. That's significant in and of itself.) Going through the eye of the Needle was possible in fact it was done all the time but it required doing three things.
<P>
First, one had to wait in line, as holy days had some of the heaviest traffic in and out of the city, and closing the main gates and opening only the eyes kept traffic nicely congested. Second, one had to unburden the camel of whatever it was carrying. (One got to keep it, but one had to carry it through by hand.) Third, the camel had to go through on its knees.
<P>
As we discussed before, Jesus was very clear about the location of the kingdom of God. "The kingdom of God is within you" (Luke 17:21). Jesus was talking about how difficult it was for someone attached to outer riches to discover the greater wealth within.
<P>
Knowing that his disciples knew about the eye of the Needle and camels passing through it, what might Jesus have been trying to tell them? What do you suppose he was trying to tell <I>us</I> about how to enter the kingdom of God?
<P>
First, we must be patient. We must get in line, and take our turn. It also implies that we must be fair and know how to share.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Lack of money is the root of all evil.</I><P>GEORGE BERNARD SHAW
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Second, we cannot be attached to physical possessions. We can have them, use them when we need them, and learn to let them go when we're done. And sometimes even though it's another's job to carry the burden we have to carry it ourselves. This is another way of saying, "Do the work that needs to be done when it needs to be done."
<P>
Third, we must be humble some might even call it reverent. Being on one's knees is a universal sign of this. It is not a sign of unworthiness or disgrace camels, in fact, <I>enjoy</I> being on their knees. For humans, kneeling is a sign of honoring, and we must honor the greater the more sacred portion of ourselves to enter the kingdom of God within us.
<P>
It's easy to see, then, that although it's difficult for a rich <I>or</I> poor man to enter the kingdom of God, it can be done. Another often misinterpreted quotation from the Bible is
<P>
<STRONG>Money is the root of all evil.</STRONG> This was not said by Jesus, but by St. Paul in a letter to Timothy. The full quotation is "For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil" (1 Timothy 6:10). In the ancient Aramaic and Greek texts, the word <I>love</I> is more accurately interpreted in this context as <I>lust.</I> The sentence would then read "Lust of money is a root of all kinds of evil." In this sentence, "of money" could be replaced by any number of things. The basic idea is "Lust is evil."
<P>
As we mentioned before, <I>evil</I> is <I>live</I> spelled backwards. What makes lusting backwards living? When we lust, we say, "That out there is more important than what's in here, and I want that thing out there very, very badly." Sounds like a perfect affirmation for ingratitude, nonappreciation and not living in the moment, doesn't it? It is. Lusting whether after money, fame, power, sex, having people do it "our way," or any other than here-and-now experience destroys the moment. The moment destroyed is not a wealthy one. We are doing things backwards, hence evil.
<P>
If money were in and of itself evil, the solution would be simple: Get rid of your money. But this is not what Paul counsels: "Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life" (1 Timothy 6:17-19).
<P>
In other words, don't just seek money seek wealth. There is nothing wrong with having money.
<P>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

<STRONG>You need training and education to get money.</STRONG> There are many stories of people who had little or no formal education or who were notoriously bad in school yet went on to great fame and fortune. There are also stories of people who earned so many degrees, they had more letters <I>after</I> their name than <I>in </I>it. These people sometimes ended up working for the people with little or no education. 
<P>
Yes, we have to be "smart" about life (dare we plug our book <I>LIFE 101: Everything We Wish We Had Learned About Life In School But Didn't?</I>), we need certain skills, information, education and knowledge about the area of our big dream, but a sheath of degrees does not guarantee money, and a complete lack of degrees (other than 98.6) is no automatic obstacle to money.
<P>
<STRONG>Money can't buy you love.</STRONG> As someone once said, "Whoever said money can't buy you love doesn't know where to shop." Loving others, expressed through money, can bring love in return.
<P>
<STRONG>You can't take it with you.</STRONG> You may not be able to take it with you but wherever you can't take it, you won't need it anyway.
<P>
<STRONG>Money is too much responsibility.</STRONG> The more money you have, the more people you can hire to shoulder that awful burden of responsibility for you. True, when we are given an ability, it becomes a responsibility. People with lots of money do have more responsibility for certain things in certain areas than people who have less money. Fortunately, you can hire people who will help you "spread it around" where it will do the most good.
<P>
<STRONG>It takes hard work to make money.</STRONG> It takes hard work to be poor, too. Life is full of hard work. The only thing worse than hard work is boredom which is precisely what we get when we aren't working hard. To fulfill a dream any dream takes hard work most of it internal. When the goal is achieved, however, the hard work is forgotten in the pleasure of success. After a brief pause, there follows another goal and more hard work. Such is life. You might as well work hard pursuing <I>your</I> dream than get paid mere money to help other people pursue theirs.
<P>
<STRONG>Money isn't everything.</STRONG> People who use this as the reason not to get money tend to be the same ones who, when cornered in an intellectual discussion, jump levels and say things like, "It's not that important, anyway." No, money isn't everything, but it is something and sometimes it's the only something that will get us one step closer to our dream.
<P>
<STRONG>The best things in life are free. </STRONG>There are some very good things that are free, and some excellent things that come with a price tag. Having the money to buy the things in the latter category doesn't prevent us from enjoying the things in the former.
<P>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

<STRONG>Money isn't spiritual or holy. </STRONG>Did you ever look closely at money? Try the back of the U.S. dollar bill, for example. It is full of more mystical symbols (radiant eyes in triangles over pyramids and such) than you'll find over the altar in most metaphysical churches. In addition, money can buy you the time, environment, training and paraphernalia for whatever religious or spiritual path you choose to pursue. As with most things, money is just one of many methods that can be used to fulfill a dream including the dream of knowing God and Spirit better.

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Now the real work of challenging the culturally ingrained limiting beliefs about money begins. The next time you feel shame, guilt, fear, unworthiness, hurt feelings, or anger regarding money, take the time to explore the belief causing the feeling.
<P>
Perhaps it's simple unworthiness: "I don't deserve it." Perhaps it's one of the limitations listed in this chapter. When you find the limiting belief within yourself, consciously challenge it. Explore it. Dissect it. Have a heart-to-heart talk with yourself. Convince yourself "It just ain't so."
<P>
Use your sanctuary, your Master Teacher, further study, meditation, paraphernalia (get a great big needle and a tiny stuffed camel and spend a few minutes putting the camel through the eye of the needle), or any other tools (we'll be using affirmations extensively in the next chapter) to eliminate the limiting belief from your consciousness.
<P>
As many of these limiting beliefs were ingrained in us very early and are reinforced constantly by the media and the general negativity around us, freeing ourselves from limiting beliefs about money is an uphill climb.
<P>
It's worth the climb.
<P>
The view from the top is wealthier, healthier and happier.

<P><BR>

In addition to the well-worn limiting beliefs about money, our culture is rich in expansive beliefs. Take each of those expansive beliefs you come upon, and make it an affirmation. If the culture doesn't seem to have a positive belief about money to fit your needs, create one.
<P>
In repeating affirmations a thousand times each, rather than using toothpicks, perhaps you'd like to use money. Get 110 bills of the highest denomination that you can muster. Use them in the same way we suggested using toothpicks on page 177.
<P>
Here are some affirmations to get you started.
<P>
"I like money." "I love money." "I use the energy of money to fulfill my dream." "Money is honey. Money is sunny. Money is funny." "I enjoy money." "I appreciate money." "I am grateful for money." "Thank you. I have more money than I need." "With money I do great good for myself and others."

<H2>Metaphor for Money</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>There's always room at the top after the investigation.</I><P>OLIVER HERFORD
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Metaphors and analogies help us imagine things, accommodate concepts and create arenas in which to experience life. The most popular metaphor for the obtaining of money in our culture is that of a <I>struggle</I> or a <I>battle.</I> With those metaphors in mind, it's little wonder that people show a pronounced lack of enthusiasm when it comes time to go out and get some money.
<P>
Earlier, we presented the metaphor that life was an entertainment a movie, television show, concert, book or maybe even an amusement park. We'd like to suggest a metaphor for pursuing your dream in general, and for pursuing money in particular. The metaphor we'd like to present is that of a <I>game.</I>
<P>
Games are activities we take part in not just because they are fun although that's certainly one reason but because they are intriguing, challenging, demanding, expanding, exciting, and require our utmost in skill, focus, concentration and creativity.
<P>
At the end of a game well played, we may be exhausted, but we are also satisfied. If the game is to engross us fully, it must have a degree of difficulty equal to our ability. If a game is too easy, it's no fun. If a game is too difficult, we feel defeated. It's when we know we <I>can</I> win, but have no guarantee that we <I>will</I> win, that games become truly exciting and worthy of our playing.
<P>
In order for a game to be truly interesting, we must become <I>involved</I> in it. We must become engrossed, captivated lose ourselves in the playing. It must seem real, and part of the reality requires that we forget "it's only a game." We must play as though it <I>really mattered.</I>
<P>
While playing a game, we don't appreciate it when people interrupt our illusion. Even if we are losing and they're "only trying to help," we don't appreciate it. If, while we're playing Monopoly, for example, a bystander kept saying, "Those aren't real hotels; they're only pieces of plastic. That's not really Boardwalk; that's just a square on a game board. That's not real money; that's just play money." Before long, we'd throw the person out of the room.
<P>
For a game to be enthralling, there must be an element of risk we'll have something to gain if we win, but something to lose if we don't. The loss has to be big enough to make things interesting (even if we only lose "our pride"), but not so great that we become incapacitated by fear. For this reason, we may do better walking a tightrope two feet above the ground than an identical tightrope twenty stories in the air.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The successful people are the ones who can think up things for the rest of the world to keep busy at.</I><P>DON MARQUIS
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Playing a game requires commitment. There's a big difference between "playing" and "playing around." Players are committed to the game and its outcome. Those just playing around aren't committed to much of anything, except perhaps annoying the other players.
<P>
If you choose to see obtaining more money as a game an engrossing, challenging, dynamic game rather than a struggle or a battle, then the pursuit of money can become exciting, satisfying and fun. Money, then, is just a way of keeping score.
<P>

<H2>What Are You Worth? </H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>If you can actually count your money then you are not really a rich man.</I><P>J. PAUL GETTY
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

In order to know whether you are winning or losing in the game of making more money, you must first have a starting point, a ground zero, a calibrated scale. This starting point is what you are worth right now. At a future point, you can calculate what you are worth and determine whether you are winning or losing.
<P>
There are two basic ways to measure financial worth. The first is <I>net worth.</I> All the money you have, and the monetary value of everything you own, less everything you owe, is your net worth.
<P>
The second way of measuring financial worth is <I>cash flow.</I> This is the amount of money that flows <I>through</I> you. If you make and spend &#36;36,000 per year, you have a cash flow of &#36;36,000 per year, or &#36;3,000 per month.
<P>
Like making a flat map of the round earth, neither system is nor can be completely accurate. Calculating what you're worth works like a map. When trying to understand a portion of the world around us, even a distorted map is better than no map at all.
<P>
We can't recommend one system over another. Our highest recommendation must go to the one you would actually <I>use.</I>
<P>
Some people like the idea of using net worth, but we have met very few people who have actually taken the time to compile a complete net-worth inventory. Doing this seems to fall apart when it comes time to have things appraised. What's the value of that silver tea set Grandma left? &#36;50, &#36;500, &#36;5,000? What about all those records from the 1960s? Most are probably worth 25 cents, yet a few may be worth &#36;250 but which ones?
<P>
For many people, cash flow is the system that's easiest to figure. If most of your money goes directly into your checking account, all you need do to discover your cash flow is add up your deposits for the past year. With your monthly bank statements in front of you, this shouldn't take much time at all. If you work heavily on a cash or barter system, however, determining the cash flow may take additional remembering and calculating.
<P>
Whichever system you use, and however you choose to implement it, the most important thing is to be consistent. You're setting up a scoring system for the game of making money. As you establish your "baseline" score, you're also establishing the rules for calculating future scores.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I started out with nothing. I still have most of it.</I><P>MICHAEL DAVIS
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

If you're using the net worth system, and you estimated the value of all of your books at a certain price, the next time you establish your net worth, don't go through your library on a book-by-book basis. Continue to estimate all of them as a group. If you are on the cash flow system and decide not to include the value of birthday gifts in your determination, if you get a &#36;20 toaster for your birthday one year, and &#36;20 cash from the same person the following year, if you didn't count the toaster, don't count the cash.
<P>
People tend to get tired even <I>thinking</I> about discovering what they're worth either net worth or cash flow. With all the confusing, conflicting and contradictory beliefs about money in our culture, many of us choose to simply go unconscious about money. "What I don't think about won't hurt me." To figure out what we are worth brings the idea of money more into our consciousness.
<P>
As with all endeavors, the only way out is through; therefore, the only way to greater consciousness about money is <I>through</I> the unconsciousness we already have. Go through the motions of calculating your monetary worth even though you are barely conscious while doing so. When you arrive at a bottom-line figure, consciousness should return. An increased awareness of money and your interaction with it will be the long-term benefit.
<P>
Among other things, you'll see how conscious or unconscious you've been about money in regard to how much of it you have. What do you think you're worth? Write it down. After you calculate in black and white your worth, ask yourself: "Am I worth more, less or about the same as what I thought?"
<P>

Whatever the answer, it will tell you something about how you view money and, perhaps, yourself.
<P>
Figuring your financial worth on a regular basis every six months, say not only increases your consciousness of money, but lets you know whether you're winning or losing and by how much in the game of making more money.

<H2>Winning and Losing vs. Grinning and Choosing</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>We are not interested in the possibilities of defeat.</I><P>QUEEN VICTORIA
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Those who view getting money as a struggle or a battle often involve themselves not so much in <I>winning</I> but in at all costs <I>not losing.</I>
<P>
Loss they equate to defeat, devastation, death and annihilation. They spend so much time not losing, they forget almost entirely about what it is they want to win.
<P>
Not losing itself becomes a victory. When you ask these people, "What have you won?" they say often with great pride "I don't know, but at least I haven't lost!" People committed to not losing become rigid, firm, inflexible and dogmatic. They decide that by being "solid" they will get what they want. If what they want is not losing, they often get it. If what they want is winning, however, the essence of winning is found in flexibility, not rigidity.
<P>
Those committed to not losing spend a lot of time <I>deciding</I> rather than <I>choosing.</I> "You think too much, that is your trouble," Zorba told his young friend. "Clever people and grocers, they <I>weigh</I> everything."
<P>
Rather than choosing a method and seeing how it works, the non-losers of life mull it over and over in their minds until they eventually make a <I>decision.</I> Once the decision is made, that's it. "This is the way we'll go, this is how we'll get there, these are the rest stops along the way and what time we'll stop at each and if anyone or anything gets in the way look out!" From that point on, all information of any kind is filtered out, and the non-loser plows ahead dogmatically ignoring, perhaps, signs saying "Road Out," "Detour Ahead" and "Caution."
<P>
The term "the bitter end" was coined for non-losers. In the end, they are bitter. When they lose, it is a death in life. They kill all the wealth within them and around them. They pretend they didn't lose by destroying the game. "I didn't want it anyway," they mope.
<P>
Bitter people make sour grapes.
<P>
A key can be found in the word <I>decide.</I> The <I>cide</I> portion of the word comes from the Latin <I>cida,</I> for killer; <I>cidium,</I> for killing and <I>caedere,</I> for kill. We see <I>cide</I> in such words as homicide, genocide, herbicide, germicide, pesticide, insecticide, patricide and, of course, suicide.
<P>
Decisions are what were made by Mammy Yokum, "I has spoken!" and by the pharaoh from <I>The Ten Commandments,</I> "So let it be written. So let it be done!"
<P>
When we become attached to a <I>method </I>that is, the <I>way</I> we get to our goal as opposed to the goal itself we are in the land of cide. "I don't understand it," the deciders say, "It worked last week."

That's like a quarterback memorizing the path he took across the field to the triumphant touchdown the Saturday before. All week he rehearsed exactly what he did, where he stepped, and how he moved. He feels confident and ready. He takes three steps along his well-rehearsed path, however, and is slaughtered. "I don't understand it," he groans.
<P>
To get to our goal, we need to focus on the goal, be aware of what methods <I>in that moment</I> might get us to that goal and choose one method after another until one works.
<P>
The difference between choosing and deciding is that with choosing, if a choice doesn't work, we let it go and immediately make another choice.
<P>
A rat making its way through a maze to get to the cheese is a perfect example of choosing. It runs down this tunnel, around that bend, over this barrier and "What? No cheese? Oh well. I'm after cheese. I can smell it in here somewhere." And the rat heads off down other tunnels, around other bends, over other obstacles, until the cheese is found. None of the choices was wrong; each was simply a lesson in where the cheese was not. Once the rat knew where the cheese was not, it moved away from there sometimes backtracking in order to reach the cheese. The rat never rested, nor did it stop choosing, until the cheese was found.
<P>

<P><BR>

In laboratory research, there is the phenomenon known as "the smart rat." On the first day in the maze, the smart rat will find the cheese with great speed. On the second day, however, the smart rat will go directly to the point where the cheese was the day before. Finding no cheese there, it looks around, obviously wondering, "The cheese <I>should</I> be here. Where is it?" The rat looks up, down, over and around wondering, "What's wrong with this maze today, anyway?" The rat then sits down and waits for the cheese to be delivered it's obviously late and will wait there until it starves to death. Meanwhile, in the next tunnel over sits the cheese. A few choices and one fewer decision later, and the rat would get what it wants.
<P>
So often we become smart rats. Through trial and error, we find a way that gets us noticeably closer to our goal. Then we <I>decide,</I> "This is the way." "We pointed you the way to go, and scratched your name in the sand," lamented Bob Dylan, "but you thought it was nothing more than a place for you to stand." When "the way" no longer works that is, when it no longer gets us closer to our goal we continue with it. Why? "Because it worked before!"
<P>
If something's not working, have the wit to let it go, no matter how well it worked in the past. We must choose again. Flow with the <I>ooooo</I> in ch<I>oo</I>sing. If that doesn't work, we can grin and say, "Oh well," and move on to another choice another method.
<P>
Those who are involved in winning rather than not losing and winning is defined as getting to the <I>goal,</I> not in getting to the goal in the way we <I>think</I> we should get there don't equate <I>losing</I> with <I>loss.</I> Losing is just another lesson.
<P>
In the heightened emotional state that follows loss, we are conditioned to use that energy to find reasons why the loss <I>shouldn't</I> have taken place whom or what to blame. For the most part, to blame is to be-lame. Whether we blame others, external events, or ourselves, we are using our heightened awareness in the wrong direction.
<P>
Rather, we could use our heightened awareness (which people often mislabel anger, hurt and fear) to find and learn the lesson presented by the loss.
<P>

<P><BR>

Within each loss is a lesson. Sometimes, however, it takes a bit of ferreting out. That's why we're given the extra emotional and mental energy to discover what we need to know to do better next time.
<P>
Sometimes the lesson is, "Be gentler." Other times the lesson is, "Be more forceful." Over time, we learn to find the balance between these two seemingly contradictory lessons and in which situations to apply each.
<P>
Sometimes the lesson is simply, "Well, that won't work" and we move on to something else that may.
<P>
In <I>Singin' in the Rain,</I> Gene Kelly plays a dancer who comes to New York to find fame and fortune. He knocks on an agent's door, the agent opens the door, Kelly does his three-second audition dance, and waits for a response. If the response is not immediately favorable, he shrugs and moves on to the next door. His energy is boundless. He knows his goal, and if this particular agent isn't a method to that goal, oh well, perhaps the next one will be.
<P>
It's important for us to pursue our dreams with that same degree of unbounded enthusiasm. When we don't get what we want, we need only shrug it off and move on to the next method that may work. If it doesn't, we grin and choose again. And again. And again.
<P>
When will we have chosen enough? When we have our goal. Until then, keep grinning and choosing.
<P>

<P><BR>

There is a myth in our culture that says there's only so much "stuff" available, that other people already own it, and in order to get what we want, we have to take it from somebody else.
<P>
For those who believe this myth, fulfilling a dream and especially getting the money necessary to fulfill that dream must, almost by definition, be a battle and a struggle.
<P>
Who wants to let go of what they already have? No one. Obviously, we'll have to wrench it by force from their clutching hands. If that doesn't work, we'll have to trick them out of it. "By hook or by crook," as the saying goes.
<P>
This is known as <I>competition.</I> If this is how people believe wealth is won, no wonder so many people don't want to play. Who wants to enter <I>that</I> arena? It's not that that arena doesn't exist it does. There, experienced gladiators stand atop mole hills playing King of the Mountain while less experienced gladiators battle them unto the death. In the stands, the crowds cheer, and the Emperor decides thumbs up or thumbs down usually thumbs down.
<P>
There is, however, another system, another arena, another metaphor for pursuing our goal, living our dreams and getting what we want including money.
<P>
That method is <I>creation.</I>
<P>
Creation is making something out of <I>seemingly</I> nothing. We say <I>seemingly</I> nothing because although our thoughts and creative energy are certainly <I>something,</I> they don't <I>seem</I> to be something until they have a physical manifestation.
<P>
If we spend a day at the beach and want our own sand castle, we don't have to take the one someone else built. There's lots of sand on the beach. All it takes is vision, commitment, a certain amount of physical energy and we, too, can have a sand castle.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Hello, good evening and welcome to <I>"Blackmail."</I> And to start tonight's program, we go north to Preston in Lancashire and Mrs. Betty Teal. Hello Mrs. Teal! Now Mrs. Teal, this is for fifteen pounds and it's to stop us revealing the name of your lover in Bolton. So, Mrs. Teal, send us fifteen pounds by return of post please and your husband Trevor and your lovely children, Diane, Janice and Juliet, need never know the name of your lover in Bolton.</I><P>"MONTY PYTHON"
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

While building our sand castle, we can be so involved in the process and having so much fun that people may come along and want to join us. This is known as <I>seduction.</I> We don't <I>force</I> others into helping us, we jump in and enjoy the process so much that our enjoyment becomes contagious. Most people don't have a dream of their own. They are more than happy to help push another's dream wagon, to march in another's parade.
<P>
One act of creation can be the spark to a world of other creative acts, springing <I>seemingly</I> out of nothing, but quite real indeed.
<P>
Where was the recording industry before Edison invented the phonograph? Where was the telecommunications industry before Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone? For those who thought our sand castle analogy was too fanciful to be true, take a look at the computer industry: it's based entirely upon the silicon chip and silicon is nothing but sand.
<P>
We only need look at our goal and ask, "How can I create this for myself?" rather than, "Who can I take it from?" If you want a career, you don't need to take someone else's create your own. If you want a marriage, you don't have to take someone else's spouse find your own.
<P>
The perfect attitude of creation and not competition came from film producer Samuel Goldwyn. When asked if he minded that a movie from a competing studio was doing so well, he replied: "Of course not. When people go to see that movie, they'll see the trailer for my next picture."
<P>
If your goal has competition built into it in which you'll be struggling with others over a scarce position or commodity you may want to restructure your goal slightly. You may want to reword it in a way that allows everyone to win.
<P>
Rather than "I am president of <I>that</I> corporation," try "I am president of <I>a</I> corporation that " and give the attributes you admire about the corporation you would like to lead. This leaves room for any number of corporations with attributes you admire to grow, thrive and prosper. If you were president of any one of them, your goal would be met.
<P>
Yes, sometimes on the playing field we will have to "play" with other people who are staunchly set in the combative mode. They will want precisely what we want and feel the need to attack us in order to get it.
<P>

<P><BR>

Whenever possible, avoid those who want to compete with you over a specific method of achieving your goal. If some bullies come along and want your sand castle, let them have it. You can always build a better one.
<P>
If, on the other hand, someone comes along and wants your <I>beach house</I>, well, that's another matter. It's a question of weighing the time and energy it takes <I>not</I> <I>to lose</I> a certain patch of beachfront versus what could be created by applying the same time, energy and commitment in a positive direction.
<P>
As Sting wrote about Quentin Crisp who was frequently taunted for his effeminate appearance "Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can. A gentleman will walk but never run."
<P>
Or, as the Quaker said after being slapped on one cheek, turning the other cheek, and being slapped again, "Now that the scriptures have been fulfilled, I shall proceed to beat the hell out of thee."
<P>
Back to our old friend balance? Absolutely. Fights can usually be avoided provided we are sure <I>we're</I> not the ones looking for the fight.

<H2>The Comfort Zone</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I can say, "I am terribly frightened and fear is terrible and awful and it makes me uncomfortable, so I won't do that because it's uncomfortable." Or I could say "Get used to being uncomfortable. It is uncomfortable doing something that's risky." But so what? Do you want to stagnate and just be comfortable?</I><P>BARBRA STREISAND
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

As we pursue our goal trying on various new behaviors, methods and levels of income we're going to feel uncomfortable. Count on it. That's part of the process.
<P>
The comfort zone is the area of activities that we've done often enough to feel comfortable doing. Anything new, different or untried lies outside the comfort zone in the land of the uncomfortable.
<P>
As we approach the edges of our comfort zone, we feel one or more of five emotions: fear, guilt, unworthiness, hurt feelings and anger. These are generally the feelings people have when they say, "I'm uncomfortable."
<P>
For many people, the explanation, "I'm uncomfortable," is sufficient reason not to do anything new. It's little wonder, then, that these people seldom reach their dreams. They chose comfort over their goal.
<P>
To reach our goal to live our dream we must choose, moment by moment, to take steps in the direction of our dream no matter how uncomfortable we may feel. Reaching one's goal is not comfortable. It is, however, satisfying.
<P>
The subtle ways in which the comfort zone keeps us from our dreams are remarkable. The comfort zone reacts with its "Don't do it!" messages long before we take a physical action. When we even <I>think</I> about doing something new and different, the comfort zone reacts. We have been programmed to do whatever it takes to avoid fear, guilt, unworthiness, hurt feelings and/or anger. So, we think about something 
else something more comfortable.
<P>
At the very foundation of manifestation, at the level of thought, the comfort zone attacks. We often unconsciously follow our programming and focus on what's familiar, what's comfortable.
<P>
In reality, the comfort zone is an important part of our inbuilt success mechanism. As we explored in the earlier chapter, "Turn a Twist on It," all the feelings that make up the comfort zone can be used <I>for</I> us can be used to help us achieve our dream. We've simply been misprogrammed as to their proper use.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>If I repent of anything, it is very likely to be my good behavior.</I><P>THOREAU
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

This programming took place in childhood. For our parents to let us out of their sight, they had to train us, essentially, "Don't do anything new." The limited knowledge of a child can not tell the difference between drinking milk and drinking poison, between playing on the street and playing in a playground, between one neighbor's nice puppy and another neighbor's nasty pit bull. For their own safety, children are taught, "If it's new, don't do it."
<P>
When we are old enough to know the difference between that which is merely new and exciting and that which is genuinely physically harmful, no one draws us aside and says, "Oh, by the way, all those feelings of discomfort that you've been taught to avoid you can start using those as additional tools to get what you want."
<P>
It takes a while to do this reprogramming. Fortunately, on the way to our dreams, we'll have lots of opportunities. Each time fear, guilt, unworthiness, hurt feelings and anger surface and they will, they will we can either choose to run from them, or use them as the energy to take yet another step toward our dream.
<P>
Fear becomes excitement the energy to do our best in a new situation.
<P>
Guilt becomes the energy for making personal change to change our behavior (sometimes) or to change our mistaken beliefs about what our behavior <I>should</I> be (most of the time).
<P>
Unworthiness keeps us on track. We tell ourselves that we <I>are</I> worthy of our dream, and then let the feelings of unworthiness we have about pursuing all the other dreams in the world guide us to success.
<P>
Hurt feelings remind us how much we care. If we didn't care, we wouldn't hurt. Hurt feelings can remind us to return to the caring. We use the energy to care for ourselves, thus healing whatever damage the hurting did. Then we direct the caring toward our goal, our big dream.
<P>
Anger is the energy for change. In a persistent, consistent and determined way, we move toward our goal. It's only when we keep anger bottled up and not directed toward something we really want that it becomes explosive.
<P>

Successfully reprogramming the comfort zone is like learning how to swim. We can study theory and practice as much as we like, but the place of true learning is in the water. We'll sink, swallow water, panic and do all the things we wanted to avoid by learning to swim. It may seem, for a while, counterproductive. If, however, we stick to it, we learn to use the water as a way of getting what we want (fun, exercise, recreation) rather than as an enemy, waiting to do us in.
<P>
In order to use the comfort zone to get what we want, we must feel what we <I>currently</I> call uncomfortable. In a few years, we may automatically call fear excitement. For now, however, it's fear, and it's uncomfortable. Be willing to feel uncomfortable. Feel the fear and do it anyway. Take the next step toward your goal. Along the way, begin seeing the various emotions of the comfort zone as the friends they are.
<P>
One of the "freebie" benefits of pursuing our dream is learning to use the comfort zone as the support system it truly is. The primary benefit is our dream. The secondary benefit which, perhaps, over time, becomes the primary benefit is learning that nothing is truly good or bad within ourselves; that everything can be used for good if we so choose. We learn that the world is not "out to get us." That was just a childhood fantasy a nightmare from our youth from which we can finally awake.

When we are perfectly attuned to our highest good and the highest good of all concerned, we don't need to ask. Everything is given to us. Our needs are met before they become needs. Our wants are more than fulfilled. We feel whole and complete.
<P>
When we are not quite that in tune (and let's face it that seems to be most of the time), we <I>want.</I> When we want and it lies on the path to our dream it's best to fulfill the want. So often, however, even when it <I>is</I> on the path to our big dream, we don't receive what we want.
<P>
Often, we don't receive because we don't ask. We may ask one person who we carefully and thoughtfully considered would be the proper person to help us fulfill a want. If that person says no, we give up. This gives us a sense of deprivation, a feeling that asking only makes it worse. Not only don't we get what we want; we have rejection on top of it.
<P><blockqoute>
PETER: I only hitchhiked once in my life. I stood on a street corner with my thumb out for about two minutes. Five cars passed me by. I took each as a personal rejection. I couldn't take it any more, so I walked.</blockqoute>
<P>
Rather than asking less which we've been programmed to do when we're told "No," we should, instead, ask <I>more.</I>
<P>
Interestingly, when we ask and receive, we begin to realize that the Universe is an abundant place. People who walk into a store and think, "I have enough money to buy anything in here I want," quite often don't buy a thing. Knowing they can have whatever they want, they realize they don't want anything.
<P>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

On the other hand, people who feel so poor that they can't afford anything often want everything. Their consciousness of poverty creates a greater sense of poverty within them.
<P>
It seems paradoxical, but it is nonetheless true: the more we know we can have, the less we want.
<P>
One way to realize it's an abundant Universe is to ask and ask and ask until we get what we want. Even if we don't get the specific thing we're asking for, with each questing we expand our comfort zone and learn one more lesson about how to get what we're asking for.
<P>
Perhaps we learn that asking one person for &#36;10 is less effective than asking ten people for &#36;1 each. Or, perhaps we learn just the opposite: that the more we ask for, the more sincerely our request is considered.
<P>
When we get back in tune, realize the blessings already are and know that we are well taken care of by whoever or whatever it is that has always made sure an abundant supply of oxygen has surrounded us no matter where we've gone or what we've done during our entire lives, we can relax and enjoy the moment, feeling wealthy and content.
<P>
To want, however, is not a bad thing. Wanting just means it's time to learn a few more lessons that school, once again, is in session.
<P>
So, ask.

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Just as we needed to create a container to receive the inner manifestations of wealth, so too we need to make room in our outer environment for the material possessions we plan to receive. We do this by letting go of all the material possessions we are not currently using.
<P>
Letting go of what we are not using has several benefits:
<P><OL>
	<LI><I>It allows energy to flow from us.</I> All of our material possessions are a form of stored energy. If we're not using that energy that is, if we are not regularly using that physical object the energy is stagnated, wasted. By freeing that object for another's use, we take back the energy we have invested in it and can apply that energy to our goal. It's amazing how much money, for example, we have tied up in things we no longer use. If we sell all the things we're not using, we can use it to pursue our big dream.
<P>
	<LI><I>It starts the energy flowing into us.</I> Life is energy. It flows in, it flows out. "In" is not good, "out" is not bad. Both, working together, are essential to life. When we inhale, we receive oxygen. When we exhale, we eliminate carbon dioxide. Both are vital. By breathing out, we make room for the next breath. Letting go of the material possessions we are not currently using is like an exhale: it allows us to take a full, deep breath. Letting go of things we're not using is a "kick start" for the increased flow of giving and receiving we desire.
<P>
	<LI><I>It creates a vacuum.</I> Nature abhors a vacuum and seeks to fill it. Now that we know <I>what</I> we want the paraphernalia necessary for the obtaining and maintaining of our dream eliminating what's not part of reaching our dream creates a vacuum. The vacuum is then filled with what we want. (Although we must be careful to say "No, thank you" to all the non-dream things that will seek to fill the vacuum. Some of them may be quite tempting, too.)</OL>
<P>

<P><BR>

We call this <I>making room for the new.</I> It's a simple process go through all of your material possessions, and of each ask yourself: "Have I used this in the past year?"
<P>
If the answer is no, place the object in the "recycle" pile. If the answer is yes, ask yourself another question: "Will this object be directly helpful in obtaining my goal?" If the answer is yes, you get to keep it. If the answer is no, put it in the recycle pile.
<P>
Letting go of possessions can be difficult. We are, by cultural conditioning, pack rats. We were trained that if we get something, we get to keep it. We forget that material possessions are simply here for our <I>use.</I>
<P>
When we're no longer using them, continuing to hold onto them is as silly and unproductive as holding your breath. "I'm not going to let go of any of <I>my</I> oxygen."

Somebody, somewhere may have a use for this object, just as at one point in the past you had a use for it. Even if no one has a use for it, <I>you</I> have a use for the space that it's occupying. Donate, give away, recycle or discard what you can't trade or sell. Get rid of it.
<P>
The Universe is conservative with its resources. It tends not to give freely to hoarders. Energy was not meant to be hoarded, it was meant to be shared. The Universe loves flow. You take something in, use it, appreciate it, feel grateful for it, and let it go. We hand off that object to the next person in line for it, and turn to greet our next experience.

Plans are funny things: without them, we seldom get to our goal. When we've gotten to our goal, however, we look back and realize we haven't gotten there according to our plan. We must be willing, then, to make a plan, follow it, and when better options arise, let the plan go.
<P>
Keep moving toward the goal by the best methods available, using the best tools available. As you get closer to your goal, the methods and tools will probably change. Nonetheless, it's important to make a plan <I>now</I> with the methods and tools you currently envision.
<P>
Planning may be uncomfortable making choices and putting them down in black and white often is but the process is a simple one. Pick a date by which you want your goal achieved, write that down, and schedule all the things that need to happen between then and now.
<P>
Keep scheduling until you know what you have to do <I>next.</I> Always have a next action step towards your goal ready to take. If you say about your next action step, "I can't take that until next week," there's almost certainly a smaller action step that can be taken <I>now.</I> It might be as simple as a phone call, reading a book or gathering information. It might be planning your next day, writing down the good, or saying an affirmation. Arrange it so that there is always <I>something</I> you can do towards your goal at any given moment.
<P>
Also schedule the "maintenance" activities for what you already have. Maintaining what you have is called "living your dream." Planning for and methodically attaining what you don't already have is called "pursuing your dream."
<P>
Between living your dream and pursuing your dream, there's not much time left for anything else. But so what? Besides living and pursuing your dream, what else is there? It makes for a full day and a full life. Plan it that way.

<H2>How Much Money Do You Want? </H2>
<P>
As with all goals, the more specific and quantifiable your money goals are, the better.

<P><BR>

The question is this: How much money do you <I>need</I> (not <I>greed</I>) to fulfill your goal? If you want to be an actor, for example, you don't need a Rolls Royce. A Honda will do. (Writers, however, <I>do</I> need Lexuses.) (Especially <I>these</I> writers.)
<P>
The question is: How much money do you need to get, by when, to achieve your goal, while maintaining (not indulging, but maintaining) your body along the way? Go through your plan. Begin calculating how much each of the things in your plan will cost.
<P>
Start with fixed expenses those things necessary to keep body and soul in close proximity: rent, car payments, food, clothing, drinking water (don't forget to bring your own container), health care, seeding, tithing, the next book in THE <I>LIFE 101</I> SERIES you know, the basics.
<P>
Then start adding the expenses necessary for pursuing your dream: tools, travel, research, phone calls and all the rest. Add it up and see what your yearly cash flow must be in order to fulfill your dream. Add ten percent to this figure because, well, things happen. We call this the <I>mishigas </I>margin.
<P>
This gives you a specific money goal to affirm. Make it an affirmation: "My cash flow is &#36;_________ per year." Or "I am using my cash flow of &#36;__________ per year to fulfill my dream," or perhaps "I'm grateful for my cash flow of &#36;__________ per year." Say one or all three at least a thousand times using money, rather than toothpicks, to keep count. This charges your money goal and begins attracting cash to you.

<P><BR>

So, enough already with repeating affirmations over and over. Let's try another method of affirming our wealth. We might call this a visual affirmation. It's known as a Treasure Map.
<P>
With your goal in mind, flip through magazines, newspapers, trendy catalogs and so on, finding visual images that illustrate some portion of your dream. Cut them out. You might also see words and phrases in headlines that describe your goal. Cut them out, too.
<P>
When you have a lot of images, go to an art store and buy a large piece of white cardboard or foam core board. While there, pick up some glue. (We don't know what kind of glue to recommend. Just say to the person in the art store, "I'm making a Treasure Map. What kind of glue should I use?")
<P>
Arrange the images and words on the cardboard. If you like, get photographs of your face, cut them out, and glue them over the faces of the people enjoying their dreams. When your arrangement looks exciting and appealing, glue everything down.
<P>
Have fun making this collage of your dreams. When completed, it is your Treasure Map. Hang it in a place where you'll see it often, but where you don't have to explain it. If anyone asks, and you don't wish to discuss it, just casually say, "Oh, that's a collage I made once."
<P>
Making a Treasure Map gets our whole body involved in the process of affirming our dream. It also involves that child inside you who loves to cut, paste and create. Feel free to add to it at any time or make another. Each time you look at it, remember the fun you had making it.
<P>
You can pursue your dream with the same childlike fun and enthusiasm.

One of the favorite reasons people have for not pursuing their dream is "the economy." If the economy is on the rise, they get Inflation Elation Fixation. If the economy is slowing down, they get Recession Depression Obsession. If the economy is stable, they will shake their heads slowly and mutter something about "the stagnant economy."
<P>
No matter where the economy is or is headed those who study poverty (and there are some real experts out there) have the perfect reason for not pursuing their dream. 
<P>
The same people study crime statistics, and can prove unequivocally that you can not walk three blocks in New York City without being mugged, or breathe for three minutes in Los Angeles without being smogged.

Always remember: you're not a statistic, you're a human being. (Didn't the Elephant Man say that first?) Remember, too: during the most depressionary and inflationary times in history, people have fulfilled their dreams.
<P>
Remember Mae West, who, at the age of forty, got off the train in Hollywood, in the midst of the Great Depression, telling the press, "I'm not a little girl from a little town planning to make it in the big town. I'm a big girl from a big town, and I have every intention of making it in this small town." A year later, she was the biggest star in Hollywood. The only person in the United States who made more money than Mae was William Randolph Hearst.
<P>
Even if times are <I>so tough</I> that only one percent of the population is fulfilling their dreams, with the U.S. population at 250 million, that means 2,500,000 people will be fulfilling their dreams. <I>Certainly</I> you can be one of 2,500,000.

<H2>Seeding and Tithing</H2>

<P><BR>

We saved the best news about money seeding and tithing for last. These two elements alone practiced faithfully can bring incredible wealth.
<P>
Seeding is planting the crop.
<P>
Tithing is saying "thank you" when the harvest is in.
<P>
You might say seeding and tithing involve "giving money away." In fact, with seeding and tithing, we are investing in success. When we seed and tithe, we contribute to the organization that represents to us the highest good on the planet. Usually that's our church, spiritual group or the source of our religious or spiritual teachings. (We'll discuss in detail what or whom we seed and tithe to in the next chapter.)
<P>
To seed, we give from one to one hundred percent of what we want to receive (harvest). Seeding is a form of commitment. When we commit to something through words alone, a part of us says, "Oh, that's nice." When we commit to something and put <I>money</I> on the line, that same part says, "Oh, this is real!" and gets busy making it happen. Seeding helps us separate what we <I>really want</I> from what we just think we want.
<P>
Seeding also directly connects our goals to whatever we consider to be the highest source of energy on the planet. God, Spirit, Mother Nature, the Source or whatever we choose to call the representative of the highest energy becomes our partner in that project.
<P>
No, we're not buying God off. No matter how much we seed, if it is not for our highest good and the highest good of all concerned, what we seed for will not come to pass.
<P>
Sometimes, we seed for something and it does not take place, but all our desire for it disappears. Our seeding has come to fruition. What we thought we wanted was not for our highest good, but we were given the next best thing and some would consider it an even better thing the elimination of the desire for it. If you no longer want something, you certainly won't miss not having it.
<P>
When what we seed for comes to pass, it is time for the harvest a time for thanksgiving. We take ten percent of the harvest of our material increase and donate it to the same organization that represents the highest good.
<P>
This is known as tithing.
<P>

It's hard to express gratitude in a more concrete way than <I>money.</I> This is gratitude that goes beyond personal greed, fear of future wants and the "It's mine, I earned it, and I'm going to keep it <I>all"</I> petty attitudes of so many people. Gratitude proves us a worthy steward, and more is given to us.
<P>
Further, giving ten percent away even if we were to throw it out the window is a powerful affirmation. It is saying demonstrating, actually "Thank you. I have more than I need." There are few statements of wealth as powerful as that. By tithing, we aren't just <I>saying</I> that, we're <I>living that.</I>
<P>
As a successful gardener, we set a portion of the crop aside for future seeding, and the process begins again.
<P>
In the next three chapters, we'll look at seeding and tithing more carefully.

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>For too many giving is occasional, spasmodic, ill-proportioned. It depends on what is left over when other things have had their full share.

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

In one sense, it doesn't really matter where our seeding and tithing money goes. As an instruction to ourselves, "I really mean this," seeding works just as well if we throw the money out the window. As an affirmation of abundance, "I have more than I need," tithing works even if we throw the money out the door. (If we use this approach, it means the seeding and tithing of our neighbors is working, too.)
<P>
In another sense connecting to the energy of the highest good, making the energy of creation a partner in our process of manifestation to whom or what we seed and tithe is very important.
<P>
Give to that which represents to you the highest good.
<P>
If you believe in God, the highest good would, of course, be God who is represented by the source of your religious or spiritual teaching. This is usually your church or spiritual group.
<P>
If you don't believe in God, or if you believe in God and don't have an organized group that goes along with your belief, then give to that organization which represents to you the highest good being done on the planet. This may be a charitable group, a nonprofit organization, an educational institution, a social cause, or even an individual whose work represents to you the highest good.
<P>
If no one organization or individual is "it" for you, you can seed and tithe the money to a fund and give the money away to various causes which represent to you individual expressions of the highest good.
<P>
The important thing is not to find <I>the</I> organization which represents the highest good, but which organization does the work that represents to <I>you</I> the highest good. You are connecting yourself with the source of energy. It is important that <I>you</I> feel this is the highest energy available.
<P>

<P><BR>

Whom or what you seed and tithe to is not a once-and-for-all commitment. Over time, you may find another organization that represents to you the highest good. At that point, begin seeding and tithing to that organization. Eventually, you may find another. As we evolve and grow, so does our perception of what is the highest good and who or what is performing that highest good to an outstanding degree.
<P>
If you have any doubts, spend some time in your sanctuary with your Master Teacher discussing it. To what or whom you seed and tithe is less important than <I>that</I> you seed and tithe. Make a choice. Begin the process.

<P><BR>

<I>Seeding</I> is precisely what the word says planting a seed. As with planting most seeds, we, as gardeners, follow a few simple guidelines. Nature takes it from there.
<P><OL>
	<LI><B>Choose specifically what you are seeding for.</B> This is the equivalent of going to the gardening store and selecting which packet of seeds to plant. If you have ever been to a gardening store, you know how overwhelming the selection of seed packets can be.
<P>
You cannot just say, "I think I'll plant some vegetables over here and some flowers over here." The gardening store person will want to know what <I>kind</I> of vegetables. "Uh, well, carrots I think." "What kind of carrots?" "You mean there's more than one kind of carrot?" Indeed, there is. And with flowers, it's not only what kind of flower, but which color. So it is with life. We have lots of choices. But when it comes right down to it, the seed we plant is the plant we'll get.
<P>
You already know your big dream, and you may want to seed for that. If you're not familiar with the seeding process, however, we suggest starting with a smaller, more immediate goal. It might be what you perceive to be one of the first steps toward reaching your goal. By choosing a smaller goal, you'll see not only <I>how</I> the seeding process works, but <I>that</I> it works.
<P>
This way, you'll have confidence in the process of seeding based on your own experience. You will not echo the novice gardener gesturing to a plot of freshly planted soil with a worried expression, "I have &#36;128 worth of seeds in that ground. I hope something comes up."
<P>
You might want to start with a goal that can be realized within a week or two. Then your process of seeding can build from success to success, and you'll see that like gardening and the flowering and fruiting of plants the whole process is fundamentally in the hands of nature. It is, in fact, something of a miracle.
<P>

<P><BR>

As with all goals, make sure your seeding goal is <I>quantifiable.</I> Please reread the chapter "How to Phrase a Goal" if you need to review the process of quantifying goals. There should be no doubt whatsoever when the goal is attained. "I have carrots" is not as good as "I have 100 or more carrots at least six inches long."
<P>
	<LI><B>Write the goal down.</B> This not only helps you remember and review the goal; it also begins the action to fulfill the goal in a physical way.
<P>
Further, seeing a goal in black and white helps reveal any discrepancies or conflicts. W. C. Fields, an atheist his entire life, was asked on his deathbed why he was reading the Bible. "Looking for loopholes," Fields replied. When you see your goal in writing, it sometimes helps point out the loopholes.
<P>
For example, seeing our goal of 100 carrots above pointed out a loophole to us. What if we get our carrots, but the gophers get to them first and we get half-eaten carrots? After seeing our goal in writing, we would now probably rewrite it: "I have at least 100 whole, healthy carrots at least six inches long."
<P>
	<LI><B>Determine what your goal is worth to you.</B> What in real, spendable money is your goal worth? In some cases, this will be easy your goal is a material object with a fair market value. In other cases, determining worth may be more difficult. If your goal is "I weigh a healthy 150 pounds" and you currently weigh 155 pounds, you will have to determine what weighing five pounds less is worth to you.&#42; Here's where your Master Teacher can come in handy.
<P>
Keep in mind what <I>you</I> can afford to pay. Don't automatically say, "That would be worth a million dollars to me!" Do you <I>have</I> a million dollars? If someone came to your door and offered your goal to you right now for a million dollars, would you be able to buy it? If not, it's not worth that to <I>you.</I>
<P>
It's not that you can't have your goal, you understand. It's just that the value you place on it has to be proportionate to your net worth and cash flow. If you're worth &#36;500,000,000 and your cash flow is &#36;50,000,000 per year, then perhaps some things might be worth a million dollars to you. If your net worth is &#36;100,000 and your cash flow is &#36;30,000 per year, then <I>nothing</I> is worth a million dollars to you. No matter <I>what</I> it was, you probably wouldn't be able to gather a million dollars anyway.
<P>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

If, however, the same person appeared at your door and offered you the same goal for &#36;1,000, would you take it? Would you actually, literally, give this person &#36;1,000 for that goal? If yes, then that's what it's worth to you.
<P>
Please keep in mind that establishing the price is not what the item would be worth on the "free market." Just as 150 pounds might be your ideal weight, it may be too light for some and too heavy for others. So, too, weighing 150 pounds may be worth &#36;100 to you, &#36;1,000 to the next person, &#36;10,000 to another, and &#36;100,000 to a multi-millionaire.
<P>
Carrots grow equally well for the rich as for the poor. Don't put off weighing 150 pounds if that's what you really want until you "have enough money to pay for it." If what you can afford to pay is &#36;1 for it, pay that.
<P>
	<LI><B>Plant the seed.</B> You plant the seed by donating from one to one hundred percent of the value of your goal. When should it be one percent? When should it be three percent? When should it be fifty percent? When should it be one hundred percent? That's between you and your higher power (or, if you don't believe in a higher power, between you and your conscience). Some seeds are larger than others. Some seeds cost more than others.
<P>
<I>In</I> <I>general,</I> the sooner you want your goal, the greater should be the seed. If you're ill and say, "My health is worth &#36;1,000" and you want your health back<I> fast,</I> seed one hundred percent. If you want a house, but are in no hurry to get a house, seed less.
<P>
The most important part of seeding is <I>intention,</I> not <I>amount.</I> One percent with clear intention works better than one-hundred percent with weak intention.
<P>
A great deal of seeding has to do with what you believe you need to give in order to receive. If you genuinely believe that by giving &#36;1 you can receive &#36;100, then your seed need only be one percent. If you believe you need to give &#36;10 to get back &#36;100, then your seeding would be ten percent. And so on.

Belief and intention are more than just emotional feelings. They are based upon pragmatic results. Did your seeding work at ten percent? If yes, then ten percent works. Does it work at one percent? If no, then try it at five percent. If it works at five percent, then you can seed at five percent. Watch carefully as your garden grows, and you can adjust your seeding accordingly.
<P>
If yours is a money goal, you might want to seed for a portion of it first. When that portion comes in, seed for the next portion of it. For example, if your money goal is &#36;10,000, you might want to seed for &#36;1,000 first. When the &#36;1,000 comes in, then seed for &#36;2,00. When the &#36;2,000 comes in, seed for &#36;4,000. Continue in this way until you have reached your money goal.

<P>
The same gradual process can be used for any goal. If your ideal weight is 150 and you currently weigh 175 pounds, plant the seed for weighing 170. When you reach that goal, plant the seed for weighing 165, etc.
<P>
	<LI><B>Keep your seeding a secret.</B> What you have seeded for and all the details of your seeding is entirely between you and your higher power. Telling another about it is like digging up a seed. The plant will die. Keep your seeding secret. Keep your seeding sacred. Let the roots grow deep.
<P>
When you have the fruits of your seeding that is, when your goal has been clearly achieved you can invite your friends over for a home-grown, home-cooked meal to celebrate. Then you can give all of your friends copies of this book and say "it's all described on page 465, but read all the stuff that goes before it first."

<P>
Occasionally, doubt may come in. Time for a little gardening. State the goal as an affirmation and say it to yourself a few hundred times. Or, perhaps, a treasure map of that particular goal is in order. Maybe it's time to go to your sanctuary and put on the ability suit connected with that goal, or do some work on your video screen. Or, perhaps, a brief chat with your Master Teacher will take care of any doubts.

As time goes by, you will have page after page of seeds, successfully nurtured to completion. Please remember that seeding can work in one of two ways. First, we can get the thing we seed for or something better. Second, the desire for what we seed for may go away completely. If, as we go down our list of planted seeds, we realize one day, "I don't want that anymore," we can check it off. The seeding has been fulfilled.

At each harvest comes the time of thanksgiving. That's where tithing comes in.

<H2>Tithing</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>"Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this," says the Lord Almighty, "and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it."</I><P>MALACHI 3:10
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

The concept of tithing is an ancient one. By the time of Moses, 1490 B.C., it was already well established. <I>Tithe</I> means "a tenth." "A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees belongs to the Lord; it is holy to the Lord" (Leviticus 27:30).
<P>
In tithing, we give a tenth of our increase. If we make &#36;100, we give &#36;10. If someone gives us a gift worth &#36;100, we give &#36;10.
<P>
You can tithe with money, goods or services. Money is the cleanest. When it's time to tithe, some people kid themselves by going through the garage and donating everything that they no longer need which the organization they tithe to may not need either.
<P>
If something is worth &#36;50 and the organization does not need it, sell the item for &#36;50 and donate the money. If your time is worth &#36;10 an hour and the organization needs your services, let them know you're not volunteering you're working at the rate of &#36;10 an hour to pay your tithe. If the organization says, "We don't pay anyone to work for us, we're an all-volunteer organization," then go out and work for someone else for &#36;10 an hour and donate that money to the organization.
<P>
You tithe only on the increase. This means after taxes but before anything else. ("Render unto Caesar" and all that.) If you work for someone else, and your taxes are automatically taken from your payroll check, you tithe on the amount of your check.
<P>
If you work for yourself, and your business and personal expenses are intermingled, go though each expenditure and ask, "Is this a business or personal expense?" If it's personal, tithe ten percent of that amount. If it's business, there is no need to tithe on that amount that's your business increase. Tithe on <I>your</I> increase. (When you sell the business, however, tithe the full amount, after taxes, you receive.)
<P>
Some expenses such as telephone, may be both business and personal. Determine the percentage, say, twenty percent personal and eighty percent business and tithe on the portion that is personal.
<P>
The attitude behind the tithe is all-important. The tithe made as a sacrifice will return its blessings to us although they will come to us in a sacrificial way. People will begrudgingly give us what is ours because they feel that they have to. We'll get it, but the energy that comes with it will be, "I don't want to, but I have to."
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>You may say to yourself, "My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me."</I><P>DEUTERONOMY 8:17
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>But remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant which he swore to your forefathers, as it is today.</I><P>DEUTERONOMY 8:18
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

If we give from the joy of thanksgiving, with a heart full of gratitude, then we will receive back in joy, thanksgiving and gratitude. People will not just give you what is yours; they will thank you for being in their lives. Tithing is a physical affirmation of both abundance and gratitude. The more abundant and grateful you feel as you give your tithe, the wealthier you will be.
<P>
When should you tithe? As the saying goes, "Pay God first." If you pay your bills every two weeks, let the first check be your tithing check. At least once a month, however, review your increase and tithe accordingly.
<P>
Don't let tithing replace whatever <I>donations</I> you regularly give to the organization of your choice. If you donated &#36;500 to that organization last year, donate at least &#36;500 this year <I>and</I> tithe in addition to that. A tithe is a way of saying, "Thank you for what I have newly received." A donation is a gift from you to materially support the work the organization does. You tithe for yourself; you donate for the organization.
<P>
If you have any further questions about tithing, go to your sanctuary and invite in on the people mover the Prince of Tithes. He'll be able to answer all your questions.
<P>
Tithing is a way of showing gratitude for whoever or whatever you feel is responsible for the gift of life. It's paying your rent to live in this world. It's your share of the air you breathe, the color of the trees, the sun in the morning and the moon at night. It's also a most tangible way of saying, "Thank you. I have more than I need."

<H2>Money Magnet</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity.</I><P>WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

In addition to seeding and tithing, some people like to keep a money magnet. A money magnet follows the same rules as tithing, except that you tithe to yourself. Take ten percent of your increase and keep it in cash, gold, precious stones, land or whatever represents solid material value to you.
<P>
The money magnet is for the child within. This is the inner voice that asks, as we pay our monthly bills, "What's in it for me?" So, you pay God first with your tithe, yourself second with your money magnet, then everyone else.
<P>
As the money magnet grows, the child within feels more and more confident and abundant. That little voice inside sometimes gives us negative affirmations about material wealth those limiting worries and complaints that slow the flow of money out, therefore, slowing the flow of money in. With a money magnet, these become less and less frequent as this inner child worries less and less about money.
<P>
"If it's ten percent for seeding, ten percent for tithing, and ten percent for the money magnet, that's thirty percent," some people figure. "That only leaves seventy percent left for everything else. I can't live on seventy percent of what I make."
<P>
Well, first of all, you probably <I>could</I> live on seventy percent of what you make perhaps not in the style to which you have become accustomed but you could live.
<P>
That, of course, is not the main point. The main point is that seeding, tithing and the money magnet <I>increase</I> one's material abundance quite significantly. Seventy percent of &#36;100,000 is more expendable income than one hundred percent of &#36;50,000.
<P>
Some people ask, "Can't I keep my money magnet in the bank where it will collect interest?" If you put your money in the bank, then the bank has your money magnet. What are banks if nothing more than giant money magnets? They prove the principle of mutual attraction, "Like gathers like."
<P>
The banks that have the most money get more. If there were two banks next to each other, and one had &#36;50 billion in assets and the other one had &#36;238 in assets, which would you put more money into? The child within doesn't understand numbers in a bank book. He or she understands cash, gold, jewels, land. It is <I>this</I> child's interest you want to collect.
<P>
It's not a good idea to put your money magnet into anything that tends to depreciate in value such as automobiles or machinery. It's better to invest in things that tend to appreciate. The child within appreciates that more.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>A lot of people will also urge you to put some money in a bank, and in fact--within reason-- this is very good advice. But don't go overboard. Remember, what you are doing is giving your money to somebody else to hold on to, and I think that it is worth keeping in mind that the businessmen who run banks are so worried about holding on to things that they put little chains on all their pens.</I><P>MISS PIGGY&#42;
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

When you have enough money in your money magnet, however, you can invest up to ninety percent of it in what might be called the "tools of the trade." If you're a writer, this may mean a word processor. If you're raising a family, it may mean a down payment on a house. If you're an actor, it may mean cosmetic surgery or a new set of teeth. Whatever might help you pursue your big dream in a big way would qualify.
<P>
Before making any such investment, however, be sure to get the permission of the child within. Your child may say, "It's about time we got a computer I'm tired of retyping all the time." Or, your child may say, "That means we'll be poor again!" If you get the second type of answer, the time is not yet right for investing the money magnet.
<P>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

As with homemade yogurt or sourdough bread, when investing the money magnet, always keep at least ten percent of it as a "starter."
<P>
For some people, the inner child is so confident in the worth of their spiritual or religious organization that, each year, the child is happy to donate ninety percent of the money magnet to that organization. Again, this is a choice to be made by the child within. Please respect his or her decision.
<P>
As children love to play, so too your inner child loves to play with his or her money magnet. Count it. Spread it around the floor, throw it in the air, have fun with it.
<P>
It's a good idea to count your money magnet before writing the monthly checks. As the balance in the checking account goes down, the money magnet will remind the child within, "We're not poor." It alleviates a lot of worry.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The Pluto-American Anti-Defamation League said it will bring pressure to bear on media to up-grade the image of incredibly rich people.

<P><BR>

(It's also a good idea, with each check you write, to remember the <I>good</I> that came because of that check the food, electricity, medical care, enjoyment or whatever. Too often we look at <I>amounts,</I> not at the <I>experiences</I> that came from those amounts. Check writing can be an exercise in appreciation and gratitude.)
<P>
The money magnet gives the child within confidence, reassurance and joy. It creates a consciousness of wealth that acts as a magnet, pulling more and more material abundance to it. It also makes us feel wealthier.

<H2>Ten Essential Minutes a Day</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I cannot easily buy a blankbook to write thoughts in; they are commonly ruled for dollars and cents.</I><P>THOREAU
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Thus far in this book, we have given you a great many techniques for increasing wealth. If we were to choose one technique to be practiced on a daily basis above all others, it would be the one we're about to present.
<P>
It only takes ten minutes to do; that's why we call it "Ten Essential Minutes a Day." Seeding and tithing we consider essential, too, but they are not necessarily a daily practice.
<P>
To practice the ten essential minutes, get a notebook that's divided into at least six sections. A loose-leaf binder in which you can add and remove pages might be ideal. Get one that's attractive, though one that doesn't cause flashbacks of high school.
<P>
Label the sections: ATTUNEMENT, AFFIRMATION, LONG-TERM GOALS, SHORT-TERM GOALS, APPRECIATION/GRATITUDE and LISTENING.
<P>
During the ten essential minutes, each section will receive from one to two minutes of attention. What to place in each section will become clear as we review, minute by minute, the ten essential minutes of the day:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
ONE MINUTE: ATTUNEMENT Ask for the light, pray, meditate, contemplate. Attune yourself to your highest good. On this page in your notebook, you may want to remind yourself of the definition of wealth. We'll give you our definition again, and you're certainly welcome to adapt it to your own personal definition. "Wealth is health, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what I want, opportunity, enjoying and balance."
<P>
TWO MINUTES: ABUNDANCE AFFIRMATIONS Use this time to review whatever affirmations you've used to enhance your abundance. "I am wealthy," "I am worthy of my wealth," "I appreciate my wealth," "I am grateful for my wealth," and all the others both new and old that you find uplifting and important. Add to this list as you go along.
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>


<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed us, but is always the result of a good conscience, good health, occupation, and freedom in all just pursuits.</I><P>THOMAS JEFFERSON
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
ONE MINUTE: LONG-TERM GOALS Review and visualize the success of your big dream your long-term goal. These are usually goals projected ahead three to five years. Some, however, may be as close as one year away. Use this minute each day to see, heal, hear, smell and taste the joy of living that dream.
<P>
TWO MINUTES: SHORT-TERM GOALS Review the goals you have set to achieve within the next days, weeks, and months. When a goal is achieved, cross it off your list, but cross it off in a way that you can go back and review all that you've accomplished. Feel free, of course, to add new goals at any time.
<P>
TWO MINUTES: APPRECIATION AND GRATITUDE Feel appreciation and gratitude for what you already have. This section could become the "good book" we discussed earlier in which you keep track of all the good things that you do and all the good things that happen to you. Keep adding to this list, but don't remove any pages. This section will become quite thick in time. The full two minutes may be taken just turning pages. Be grateful for the fact that you have so much to be grateful for, it can't even be reviewed in two minutes.
<P>
TWO MINUTES: LISTENING Take the time, with your eyes closed, to listen to whatever inner guidance, ideas, suggestions or lessons you may hear. Keep the notebook on your lap, pen in hand. As each idea comes through, jot it down. These may be things that need to be done steps in fulfilling your dream. You can get a rather complete "To Do" list for the day. The formal part of the process is over in two minutes. You may find, however, that the information you're getting is so valuable and so practical that you'll keep listening and writing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I keep the telephone of my mind open to peace, harmony, health, love and abundance. Then, whenever doubt, anxiety or fear try to call me, they keep getting a busy signal-- and soon they'll forget my number.</I><P>EDITH ARMSTRONG
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

This ten minutes each day is best spent just before going to sleep at night or just after waking up in the morning. If those are not practical times, any time during the day is fine. It is also best to do it at approximately the same time each day. Again, if that's not practical, ten minutes anytime during the day is fine.
<P>
If you find the process so beneficial that you want to spend more than ten minutes at it, two ten-minute periods a day are more powerful than one twenty-minute period. Three ten-minute periods upon awakening, sometime in the middle of the day, and just before going to sleep are ideal. But don't wait until you have time for "the ideal." Start at least one ten-minute period a day <I>now.</I>
<P>
Obviously, keep your notebook where curious eyes cannot see it. This is<I> your </I>process. You should feel free to write anything you want about anything in your life. Wondering who may read it or be looking over your shoulder may inhibit your spontaneity. If necessary, buy a strong box and keep your notebook under lock and key.
<P>
Please give this exercise a try. We're sure you'll find it so valuable that you'll continue doing it with pleasure.
<P>
You'll also probably find it eminently practical. The suggestions during the "listening period" alone are sure to save more than ten minutes each day sometimes they save whole days or weeks.
<P>
Spend time on yourself. Spend time with yourself. You're worth it.
<P>

Next to loving, balance is probably the most important aspect of wealth.

<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>A Question of Balance</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I like work; it fascinates me; I can sit and look at it for hours.</I><P>JEROME K. JEROME
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Balance is a very personal thing. "One man's meat is another man's livestock." Life is full of extremes, an interplay of opposites. One person may like one extreme, another person may like the opposite. Most people find themselves on the continuum between the two.
<P>
The continuums are many. Some of the more important ones are work and play, activity and rest, togetherness and solitude. Let's take a closer look at each.
<P>
<STRONG>Work and Play.</STRONG> Some people enjoy setting goals and achieving them. Once a goal is achieved, they plant their flag upon it and move almost immediately to the next. They enjoy work.
<P>
Conversely, other people like to appreciate what they've got. They enjoy the moment so much they sometimes have difficulty at work. "Would you get back to work!" "Look at that big white cloud over there!"
<P>
<STRONG>Activity and Rest.</STRONG> Some people love being active. They consider sleep a waste of time and spend very little time doing it. The last time they took a hot bath was when they were eighteen months old. If they are not physically doing something, they're bored.
<P>
Other people enjoy rest. Exercise is an anathema to them. The only sit-ups they do are when they sit up in bed. They enjoy sleep, love dreams and always try to get five seats across on airplanes so they can lie down. The last time they perspired was when they took a hot bathwhich was about two hours ago. The last time they perspired <I>outside</I> of a bathtub was in 1972, when the air conditioner broke in the middle of a heat wave.
<P>
<STRONG>Togetherness and Solitude.</STRONG> Some people want to be with at least one other person all the time. Sometimes it's the same person, sometimes it's different people, but people it must be. Cooking, eating, bathing, sleepingthey are never alone. In addition, they often have pets that score high in physical affection and tactile stimulation. While watching a movie on television, if their partner says, "I'm going to the kitchen to get ice cream, do you want anything?" they say, "I'll join you."
<P>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Others enjoy solitude. They like their own company the best. They have trouble falling asleep if someone else is in the same house, much less the same bed. They are often employed as forest rangers, lighthouse keepers and writers.
<P>
Is one end of any continuum "right" and the other "wrong"? Of course not.
<P>
We like to thinkin our more optimistic momentsthat society is catching on to this idea. "It is suddenly all right to be a hairdresser," observed Tony Lang. "No one really knows how this happened."
<P>

<H2>Getting What You Want vs.<BR>Enjoying What You've Got</H2>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>What I dream of is an art of balance, of purity and serenity devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter a soothing, calming influence on the mind, something like a good armchair which provides relaxation from physical fatigue.</I><P>HENRI MATISSE
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

Another important continuumand, obviously, one of the major themes of this bookhas at one end enjoying what you've got and, at the other, getting more of what you want.
<P>
Enjoying what you've got is like sitting inside your house during a winter storm. The room is snug, the fireplace is roaring, the cocoa is hot, the company is congenial (be it other people or a good book). Everything is perfect, just as it is.
<P>
Getting what you want is gathering whatever money you have, putting on your boots, parka, gloves, scarf, hat, and trudging through the snow, praying that by the time you get to the store it will still be open and that the money you have will be enough to buy the thing you want.
<P>
The two processes have nothing to do with each other.
<P>
What's the answer? Balance.
<P>
Sitting in front of the fire for days and weeks eventually gets boring. We develop cabin fever. The best of company becomes irritating.
<P>
"I'm going to run to the store to get something," we say, jumping up and putting on our parka.
<P>
"What are you going to get?"
<P>
"Some milk." Any excuse will do.
<P>
"But we have milk."
<P>
"Some egg nog, then."
<P>
"We have eggs. I can make you some egg nog."
<P>
"Oh, don't trouble yourself. The store's just a few miles away."
<P>
"Wait, I'll come with you."
<P>
"That's okay," we say, opening the door. "I'll be right back." We step outside, close the door, and are gone.
<P>
Ah, freedom! The smell of the cool, crisp air. The beauty of the snow. The cold wind blowing on our face. Refreshing.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>A man of courage never needs weapons, but he may need bail.</I><P>ETHEL WATTS MUMFORD

<P><BR>

We walk through the snow. It grows darker. The cold begins to feel, well, cold. The store is around the next bendand just in time, too.
<P>
Alas, the store is closed. What? What's the purpose of a store if it's going to be closed?
<P>
It is now quite dark. The snow falls, gets blown around, and falls again. Our feet are no longer cold; they are <I>numb.</I> We remember those scenes from <I>Doctor Zhivago</I>1Œ<Heyelashes and moustaches caked with ice. Although we don't have a moustache, there must certainly be ice crystals forming on our upper lip.
<P>
A car pulls up. It is our overly solicitous companion. "I called the store, and they were closed, so I thought you might need a ride."
<P>
"Yes! Yes!" we say, as the ice cracks and falls from our lips. We get in. The car is warm. "Thank you, thank you."
<P>
"I made some egg nog."
<P>
"You are so wonderful. Take me home. I just want to sit in front of the fire. I never want to leave. There's no place like home. There's no place like home."
<P>
How long, sweating before the fire, do you think we'll last before the call of store-bought egg nog becomes, once again, irresistible? An hour? A day? A week?
<P>
This is where knowing our personal balance point comes in. If we know, for example, that after three days we will want to stalk the wild egg nog, then we can plan for it. If we know that two hours of stalking is sufficient, then we can make productive use of the time. Every three days, for two hours, we can plan to get some exercise: take a walk, shovel the walk.
<P>
We can also let others know of our pattern.
<P>
"I'm going out for my walk."
<P>
"Oh. Is it Tuesday?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Have a good time. See you when you get back."
<P>
We know that we want to spend about two hours alone and outdoors approximately every three days. That's our balance point.
<P>

The important thing to note is that's <I>our</I> balance point. Other people may want two hours inside for every three days outside. Still others may only need to <I>look</I> outside every three days.
<P>
Once you know <I>your</I> pattern (not the pattern you're <I>supposed</I> to have, or the pattern the average well-balanced person has, but <I>your</I> pattern), you can plan your life accordingly.
<P>
But how do we find our balance point?

<H2>Finding Your Balance Point</H2>

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>

There's only one way to find our balance point on any given continuum: trial and error. At first, when exploring a continuum, there will be lots of error.
<P>
Finding a balance point in life is like finding the balance point on a tightropeat first, we do a lot more falling than we do walking. Gradually, gradually we find the points of balance within us. We learn to trust them. Our coordination improves, and what was haltering and faltering at first becomes, with enough trial and error, lithe and graceful.
<P>
The <I>trial</I> portion of trial and error doesn't just mean you need to try a lot of things. It also means you'll be <I>on</I> <I>trial.</I> There are any number of people who will think you should live your life the way they think you should live it. They areall in onejudge, jury and executioner. Let them say what they will, but stay away from their execution grounds.
<P>
If these people are judging you based upon their interpretation of Christianity, here are three useful quotes to memorize. You can rattle them offincluding chapter and verse citationsjust before turning and going about your business.
<P>
The first two are from Jesus. "Do not judge, or you too will be judged" (Matthew 7:1). "Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven" (Luke 6:37).
<P>
St. Paul had this to say: "I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself" (1 Corinthians 4:3).
<P>
Along the way, of course, we'll have to deal with our judgment of ourselves. We are a product of our culture. We are trained not to take risks, not to explore new territory, not to try things, not to make our own conclusions. We are trained to toe the mark, fit in, and be normal.
<P>
As we explore our balance points, the natural, predictable reaction will be guilt. Expect this. Be ready to forgive yourself not just seven times seventy, but seventy thousand times seventy thousand. (That's 4.9 billion.)
<P>
Once we find our balance point on a certain continuum, it's good to know where the people we relate with have their balance point on that continuum.
<P>

There is the story of the marriage counselor who was seeing a husband and wife in separate sessions. At the husband's session, the counselor asked, "How's your sex life?" The husband answered, "Terrible! She only wants it two or three times a week!" During the wife's session, the counselor again asked, "How's your sex life?" The wife answered, "Terrible! He wants it two or three times a week!"
<P>
When we find people whose balance points on various continuums are similar or complementary to ours, we say we are compatible.
<P>
When we say "complementary," it's important to realize that people don't have to have the same balance point as we do to complement us perfectly. People on the giving side of the giving/receiving continuum get along better with people on the receiving side than they do with people on the giving side. When two givers get together, too often it becomes, "After you," "Oh no, after you," "Oh no, after you, I insist," "Oh, no, no, after <I>you,</I> after <I>you." </I>
<P>
Explore first the continuums that lead to your big dream. You will probably never find your balance point on every continuum. That's fine. Such is life. You may master the tightrope, but never tame the lions. Such is the circus.
<P>
Finding your balance points takes courage. Courage, you'll recall, means "from the heart." Don't discover your balance points in defiance. Look for them in love.

That we each have different balance points along any continuum is not in and of itself a problem. It's a large world. There's lots of room for variation.
<P>
The problem arises when our culture tries to herd everyone to the middle of the continuum, saying, "Here. This is where you should be to live a balanced life. If you want to live anywhere else, you are abnormal."
<P>
We understand <I>why</I> this happens: the rules of society are made primarily by controllers, andif all people fit into the same cookie-cutter patternthey are easier to control.
<P>
We do not, however, have to listenmuch less obeythe "normal" guidelines set forth by others. Some people throw away the best parts of themselves in a futile effort to be normal.
<P>
As the psychiatrist Harold H. Bloomfield, M.D., pointed out, "The only normal people are the ones we haven't gotten to know yet."
<P>
Normalcy is a myth. And yet the fear of being "abnormal" is so great that some people sacrifice their lives to it. (And we mean this quite literallya large percentage of suicide notes refer to not "fitting in.")
<P>
Trying to live a balanced life by cultural standards, then, can throw one out of balance. Trying to live what is generally considered "a well-balanced life" can lead to being out of balance personally.
<P>
Find the courage (heart) to live <I>your</I> well-balanced life. Love yourself enough to live your life in balance.

Wealth is more than just moneymuch more. Much of what we consider wealth, in fact, has nothing to do with money.
<P>
Wealth is health, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what we want, opportunity, enjoying and balance.

We consider these attributes of wealth as <I>attitudes,</I> not things.

Wealth is a way of looking at life.
<P>
Do these words sound familiar? That's because they were taken from the first section of this book.
<P>
When you read them then, they might not have had the same meaning they have now. When you think of wealth now, you may not think of it as you did before.
<P>
Reading this book might have inspired you. It might even have gotten you "high." Inspirational books, well, inspire. The trouble is, all too soon, the inspiration fades. That's why this book is filled with techniques for <I>achieving</I> wealth.
<P>
Please do not just <I>read</I> this book.
<P>
<I>Do</I> this book.
<P>
Now that you've read all the way through <I>WEALTH 101,</I> we suggest you start again at the beginning. When you come to an exercise, stop and do it. Most people read a book like this without doing the exercises, just to see where the authors are coming from and where they are going. If you like where we're coming fromand especially where we are goingplease take the time to explore your own experience of the book.
<P>
Experience comes from doing the exercisessaying the affirmations a thousand times each, discovering your purpose, choosing a big dream, building a sanctuary, meeting your Master Teacher, learning to meditate, writing down the good, making a treasure map, seeding, tithing, putting together a notebook for the ten essential minutes a day, practicing the ten essential minutes a day, listening to the meditation tape, and all the rest.
<P>
<I>What</I> is there to experience? Why, yourself, of course. Along with health, happiness, abundance, prosperity, riches, loving, caring, sharing, learning, knowing what you want, opportunity, enjoying and balance.
<P>
You know, wealth.

<H2>The Power of Thoughts (Part One)</H2>
<P><BR>
<CENTER><I>Thinking is<BR>an experimental dealing<BR>with small
quantities of energy,<BR>just as a general<BR>moves miniature
figures<BR>over a map<BR>before setting his troops<BR>in
action.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>SIGMUND FREUD</FONT></CENTER><P>
<P>
A simple thought. A few micromilliwatts of energy flowing through
our brain. A seemingly innocuous, almost ephemeral event. And yet,
a thought--or, more accurately, a carefully orchestrated series of
thoughts--has a significant impact on our mind, our body, and our
emotions.
<P>
Thoughts cause responses in the body. Think of a lemon. Imagine
cutting it in half. Imagine removing the seeds with the point of a
knife. Smell the lemon. Now, imagine squeezing the juice from the
lemon into your mouth. Imagine digging your teeth into the center
of the lemon. Chew the pulp. Feel those little things (whatever
those little things are called) breaking and popping inside your
mouth. Most people's salivary glands respond to the very thought of
a lemon.
<P>
For some people, thinking about the sound of fingernails on a
chalkboard is physically uncomfortable. Try this--imagine an emery
board or a double-sided piece of sandpaper. Imagine putting it in
your mouth. Bite down on it. Now move your teeth from side to side.
Goose bumps?
<P>
Thoughts influence our emotions. Think of something you love. What
do you feel? Now think of something you hate. What do you feel?
Now, something you love again. We don't have to change our
emotions--we change our thoughts, and our emotions follow along. 
Now imagine your favorite place in nature. Where is it? A beach? A
meadow? A mountaintop? Take your time. Imagine lying on your back,
your eyes closed. Feel the sun on your face. Smell the air. Hear
the sounds of creation. Become a part of it. Feel more relaxed? 
<P>
Most people who took the time to try these little experiments know
what I'm talking about.
<P>
Those who thought, "This stuff is stupid. I'm not going to try
anything as silly as this!" are left with the emotional and
physiological consequences of their thoughts--perhaps irritability,
impatience, or even hostility. A few--because of their thoughts
about books containing sentences such as "Now imagine your favorite
place in nature"--put this book down, never to pick it up again.
These people (bless their independent hearts!) proved the point as
well as those who followed along with the "suggested" thoughts. The
point: thoughts have power over our mind, our body, and our
emotions. 
<P>
Positive thoughts (joy, happiness, fulfillment, achievement,
worthiness) have positive results (enthusiasm, calm, well-being,
ease, energy, love). Negative thoughts (judgment, unworthiness,
mistrust, resentment, fear) produce negative results (tension,
anxiety, alienation, anger, fatigue).
<P>
To know why something as minuscule as a thought can have such a
dramatic effect on our mind, body, and emotions, it helps to
understand the automatic reaction human beings have whenever they
perceive danger: the Fight or Flight Response.
<P><BR>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>The Fight or Flight Response</H2>
<P>
Human beings have been around for a long, long time. One of the
main reasons the human animal has survived as long and as
successfully as it has is its highly developed, integrated, and
instantaneous response to perceived danger: the Fight or Flight
Response.
<P>
Let's consider our not-too-distant ancestor, Zugg. Zugg is far more
advanced than a simple caveman--he has learned to manipulate tools,
to till the fields, and to build shelters. Zugg is out tilling his
field one day when he hears a twig snap in the underbrush.
<P>
Zugg, because he has a fairly well-developed mind, remembers that
one time when he heard a twig snap, a wild animal came out of the
underbrush and ate his sister, Zuggrina. His mind immediately
associates twig snapping with ravenous wild animals. Without even
having to think about it, he prepares. 
He focuses all his attention on the geographical area of the snap.
His brain concentrates on the input of his senses. His mind whirls
through possible defense strategies and paths of retreat. His
emotions flare: a heady combination of fear and anger. Adrenalin,
sugar, and other stimulants surge into his system. Blood is
diverted from comparatively unimportant functions of the body--such
as digesting food, fighting infections, and healing wounds--and
rushes to the skeletal muscles, especially his arms and legs. The
eyes narrow; the muscles tense.
<P>
He is ready.
<P>
Ready for what? To do battle or to run; to combat or to escape, "to
take a stand and fight or take off out of here," as Joni Mitchell
put it. 
Hence, the Fight or Flight Response. It's an automatic,
physiological response to danger--either real or perceived.
<P>
The Fight or Flight Response has been an essential tool for the
survival of our species. Back in Zugg's time, the more laid-back
humans were, for the most part, eaten. These gentler folk might
hear a twig snap and say, "Hark, a twig snapping. Isn't that a
lovely sound?" The next thing they knew they were dinner. This
group did not, uh, persevere.
<P>
But Zugg and his kind? Victorious. They got through the animal
wars, and then, having seemingly nothing better to do, spent the
last 5,000 years fighting one another in human wars. People with
the most intensely honed Fight or Flight Responses lived to fight
another day, and, more importantly from a genetic point of view,
lived to reproduce another night.
<P>
The Zuggrinas played an important role in all this, too. The
offspring of the women who could defend their young the fiercest
and/or grab their young and run the fastest survived. The most
protected children--who were most likely to make it to adulthood
and reproduce--were the ones with the genetically strongest Fight
or Flight Response.
<P>
In the past few hundred years--in the Western world, at least--the
need for the Fight or Flight Response has, for all practical
purposes, disappeared.
<P>
When was the last time you had to physically fight or flee to save
your life? 
<P>
I'm talking about you, not people you read about in the newspapers
or see on TV.all the time." Yes, but you're not James Bond (etc.).
In fact, nobody is. Please apply everything in this book to your
life, not the fictional lives of television, movies, and novels, or
the almost-fictional lives of "real people" reported in The Press
(both print and electronic). Also, please avoid the temptation to
apply this information to "the average person." There is no such
person, and even if there were, he or she is not you. You are a
unique individual. Use this book to take an honest, perceptive look
at yourself--the good, the bad, the ugly, and the beautiful--and
learn to accept and love it all.
<P>
The Fight or Flight Response, ironically, now works against our
survival in these newfangled civilized times. The veneer of
civilization is thin--a few hundred years papered over millions of
years of biological evolution. The "beast" within is still strong.
<P>
When we are cut off in traffic, are spoken to unkindly, fear that
our job may be in danger, get a rent increase, hear Nostradamus's
revised doomsday predictions, are told the restaurant lost our
reservation, or have a flat tire, the Fight or Flight Response
kicks in with full force as though our lives depended on slugging
it out or running away in that very moment.
<P>
Worse, the Fight or Flight Response is activated whenever we think
about being cut off in traffic, think that our job may be in
danger, think about getting a rent increase, think about
Nostradamus's dire predictions, think about the restaurant losing
the reservation, or think about having a flat tire. 
Even if none of these "disasters" (only one of which could be
genuinely life-threatening) comes to pass, just thinking that any
one of them might happen is enough to trigger the Fight or Flight
Response.
<P>
The Fight or Flight Response is alive and well.
<P>
And it's killing us.
<P><BR>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Negative Thoughts and the Mind</H2>
<P>
When the Fight or Flight Response is triggered, the mind
immediately focuses on the area of perceived danger. It is intent
on finding what's wrong. It's looking for danger, evil, enemies,
wild beasts.
<P>
It's a good bet that our friend Zugg didn't spend too much time
appreciating the color of the sky or the fragrance of the flowers
as he squinted in the direction of the twig snap. No. He was
looking for trouble. His mind automatically filtered out anything
that didn't pertain to the perceived danger. If the evidence wasn't
bad, it was no good.
<P>
The mind is a marvelous filtering mechanism. It shelters us from
large amounts of unnecessary information. If it didn't, we would
probably go mad. We simply cannot pay conscious attention to every
single detail being collected by our five senses.
<P>
Without moving it, be aware of your tongue. Were you aware of it
before I asked? Probably not. The sensation was there, but your
mind filtered it out--you didn't need that information. Look
carefully at the paper on this page. What's the texture like? Had
you noticed that before? Unless you are in the printing or paper
trade, probably not. Are there any smells in the room? How about
noises? Ticking clock? Air conditioner? Feel the sensation of your
body against whatever you're sitting (or lying) on. Have you
forgotten about your tongue again? 
When the Fight or Flight Response is activated, we begin to look
for everything wrong with a situation, person, place, or thing.
And, boy, do we find it! There's always something wrong. We're
living in a material world. Material things are, almost by
definition, imperfect. 
So there's our mind, automatically filtering out the positive while
automatically focusing on the negative. Sounds like the perfect
recipe for misery. 
But it gets worse.
<P>
Zugg's mind, you will recall, also reviewed past moments of his
life in which snapping twigs played a devastating part. There was,
of course, that terrible time with Zuggrina. Poor Zuggrina. Then
there was that time with OggaBooga. Poor OggaBooga.
<P>
Zugg is now looking not just for twig-snap memories, but for
memories of all wild beasts devouring anything. He even thinks back
to times he thought about wild beasts devouring anything. He is
searching his memory for real and imaginary images of mutilation,
and there are plenty to be found.
<P>
We often do the same thing. If someone cuts us off in traffic, our
mind goes reeling back to all the rude and inconsiderate people
we've ever seen driving cars, then to all the rude and
inconsiderate people we've ever seen anywhere, then to all the rude
and inconsiderate people we've seen in movies, on TV, or in the
theater of our imagination.
<P>
If someone is five minutes late for an appointment, we often spend
four minutes and fifty-nine seconds of that five minutes
remembering every other time the person was late, all people who
were ever late, and every situation--either real or imagined--of
being disappointed or feeling unloved.
<P>
The mind--an incredibly perceptive tool--is looking both within and
without for negativity. It finds it. That thought triggers a more
intense Fight or Flight Response, which demands an even more
enthusiastic negative mental search, which discovers even more
hideous evidence, which kicks off a stronger Fight or Flight
Response, which . . . .
<P>
Get the idea? It's known as a temper tantrum or losing one's cool
or an anxiety attack or getting steamed--or life as we know it in
this (and most likely the next) century.
<P><BR>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Negative Thoughts and the Body</H2>
<P>
The Fight or Flight Response puts a body through its paces. All the
resources of the body are mobilized for immediate, physical,
demanding action--fight or flee. 
All the other bodily functions are put on hold--digestion,
assimilation, cell production, body maintenance, circulation
(except to certain fight-or-flee skeletal muscles), healing, and
immunological defenses. 
<P>
In addition, the body is pumping chemicals--naturally produced
drugs, if you will--into the system. The muscles need energy and
they need it fast.
<P>
Zugg was luckier than we are in this respect. Often he would
actually use these chemicals by running them off, climbing them
off, or fighting them off. In our civilized world, we usually
don't. At most we bang our fists or throw stuff (which only hurts
our hands and breaks things).
<P>
Occasionally we yell, but that's not physical enough. Our body has
armed itself to <I>fight or flee for its life</I>--but usually we
just sit and seethe.
<P>
The repeated and unnecessary triggering of the Fight or Flight
Response puts enormous physiological stress on the body.
<P>
It make us more vulnerable to disease (the immune system being
told, "Hold off on attacking those germs--we have wild beasts to
fight!"), digestive trouble (ulcers and cancers at the far side of
it), poor assimilation (preventing necessary nutrients from
entering the system), slower recovery from illnesses (conquering a
disease is less urgent than conquering a wild beast), reduced cell
production, sore muscles, fatigue, and a general sense, as Keats 
put it, "that if I were underwater I would scarcely kick to come to
the top."
<P>
Sound bad? It gets worse.
<P>
The emergency chemicals, unused, eventually break down into other,
more toxic substances. Our body must then mobilize--yet again--to
get rid of the poisons.
<P>
The muscles stay tense for a long time after the response is
triggered--especially muscles around the stomach, chest, lower
back, neck, and shoulders. (Most people have chronic tension in at
least one of these areas.) We feel jittery, nervous, uptight.
<P>
The mind always tries to find reasons for things. If the body's
feeling tense, it wonders, "What is there to feel tense about?"
Seldom do we conclude (correctly), "Oh, this is just the normal
aftereffect of the Fight or Flight Response. Nothing to be
concerned about." Usually we start scanning the environment (inner
and outer) for something out of place. And, as I mentioned before,
there will always be something out of place.
<P>
The mind's a remarkable mechanism. Given a task, the mind will
fulfill it with astounding speed and accuracy. When asked, "What's
wrong?" it will compile and cross-reference a list of grievances
with blinding swiftness and precision. Everything everyone
(including ourselves) should have done but didn't and shouldn't
have done but did is reviewed, highlighted, indexed, and
prioritized. All this elaborate mental labor sparked by a sensation
in the body.
<P>
Naturally, this review of negative events prompts a new round of
Fight or Flight Responses, which promotes more tension in the body,
which promotes more mental investigation into What's Wrong?
<P>
Do you see how this downward mind/body spiral can continue almost
indefinitely?
<P>
It's not surprising, then, that some people make a decision deep
inside themselves that life is just not worth living.
<P><BR>

The primary emotions generated by the Fight or Flight Response are anger (the emotional energy to fight) and fear (the emotional energy to flee).
<P>
Anger and fear--and variations on them--are most often the feelings we call negative.
<P>
Consider these lists:
<P><h3>ANGER</h3>
<P><UL>
	<LI>hostility
	<LI>resentment
	<LI>quilt (anger at oneself)
	<LI>rage
	<LI>seething
	depression
	<LI>hurt (you're usually upset with someone else, or yourslef, or both)
</UL><P><h3>FEAR</h3><ul>
	<LI>terror anxiety
	<LI>timidity
	<LI>shyness
	<LI>withdrawal
	<LI>reticence
	<LI>apprehension
	<LI>grieving (fear that you'll never love or be loved again)
</ul><P>
Any others you'd care to add from your own repertoire could probably be considered a variation of anger or fear--or a combination of the two.
<P>
Zugg, while deciding what to do, probably experienced a good deal of both. Anger ("Win one for Zuggrina!") and fear ("What happened to Zuggrina ain't gonna happen to me!").
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Anger is one of the sinews of the soul; he that wants it hath a maimed mind.</I><P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

The problem with these emotions--in addition to their obvious unpleasantness--is that they tend to mar logical, rational, life-supportive decisions.
<P>
In his passionate anger for sibling revenge, Zugg might wade into the tall grass, spear in hand, and discover a whole gathering of wild beasts. Perhaps the beasts didn't even know Zugg was around. Maybe they were just breaking twigs to roast weenies, but when Zugg appeared they decided on a quick change of menu.
<P>
How often have you waded into a confrontation, only to find that, as the saying goes, you had stirred up a hornet's nest?plus insults! Too much was enough. I stormed over to the local police station and reported the offending public servant to his superior. While listening to my story, the police captain tapped away at his computer. I thought he was taking some sort of formal report. Oh, boy. The nasty policeman was really in trouble now. What the captain was doing, however, was looking up my driving record. He discovered an unpaid traffic ticket from a vacation seven years before. I was placed under arrest. The anger quickly turned to fear. My anger cost me &#36;110 and several hours in the cooler. Now I know why they call it the cooler.
<P>
On the other hand, Zugg could have, at the first sound of a snap, run away. (Remember the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail? Whenever King Arthur's men were in even the slightest danger, their battle cry--as they fled in all different directions--was, "Run away! Run away!") This meant that every time a rabbit snapped a twig or two gophers were going for it in the underbrush, Zugg would abandon his plowing and head for the high country. He would eventually abandon his field, vowing never to return to such a wild and savage place again.
<P>
How many fields have you abandoned in your life? The field of a challenging new career? The field of a more fulfilling place to live? The field of relationships? The field of your dreams?
<P>
Because people are afraid of fear, they give up acre after acre of their own life. Some find the snapping of twigs so uncomfortable that they abandon the territory of life altogether.

<H2>The Addictive Quality of  Negative Thinking</H2>
<P>
For many, negative thinking is a habit which, over time, becomes an addiction. It's a disease, like alcoholism, compulsive overeating, or drug abuse.
<P>
A lot of people suffer from this disease because negative thinking is addictive to each of The Big Three--the mind, the body, and the emotions. If one doesn't get you, the others are waiting in the wings.
<P>
The mind becomes addicted to being "right." In this far-less-than-perfect world, one of the easiest ways to be right is to predict failure--especially for ourselves. The mind likes being right. When asked, "Would you rather be right or be happy?" some people--who really take the time to consider the ramifications of being "wrong"--have trouble deciding.
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

The body becomes addicted to the rush of chemicals poured into the blood stream by the Fight or Flight Response. Some people can't resist the physical stimulation of a serious session of negative thinking. They get off on the rush of adrenalin.
<P>
The emotions become addicted to the sheer intensity of it all. The Fight or Flight Response may not trigger pleasant feelings, but at least they're not boring. As the emotions become accustomed to a higher level of stimulation, they begin demanding more and more intensity. It's not unlike the slash-and-gash movies--too much is no longer enough. Remember when the shower scene from Psycho was considered the ultimate in blood and gore? Now it's Friday the 13th, Part Seven. (Seven?!)

Negative thinking must be treated like any addiction--with commitment to life, patience, discipline, a will to get better, forgiveness, self-love, and the knowledge that recovery is not just possible but, following certain guidelines, inevitable.

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Most people live, whether physically, intellectually or morally, in a very restricted circle of their potential being.They make use of a very small portion of their possible consciousness, and of their soul's resources in general, much like a man who, out of his whole bodily organism, should getinto a habit of using and moving only hislittle finger.Great emergencies andcrises show us how much greater our vital resources are than we had supposed.</I><P>

What I've discussed thus far is pretty much accepted, mainline medical fact. The most "controversial" subject I've presented is the idea that negative thinking is an addictive disease.
<P>
With that possible exception, if your local physician were to read the first chapters of this book, he or she would probably nod knowingly and agree that they are fairly accurate. (Thirty years ago, of course, most of the medical establishment wouldn't admit that thoughts had any causal effect on organic illness. If you mentioned such a notion, physicians would have thought you were nuts. We all live and learn.) Now I'm going to explore some thinking about thoughts they don't teach at Harvard Medical School.
<P>
You can take the next few pages with as many grains of salt as you please. The accepted medical theory--that thoughts contribute to symptomatic illness, and that improving one's thoughts can help improve one's health--is all I need to illustrate the premise of this book.
<P>
The rest is, well, interesting, fun, provocative, stupid, enlightening--use your own adjectives to describe it. Even if it's just the rantings of a Detroit boy transplanted to California by way of New York, it doesn't negate the fact that, in anyone's book--medical or metaphysical--if a life-threatening illness threatens, you can't afford the luxury of a negative thought.
<P><BR>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>The Creative Power of Thoughts</H2>
<P>
Thoughts are powerful. All the spectacular and terrible creations of humanity began as a thought--an idea. From the idea came the plan; from the plan came the action; from the action came the object. Whatever you're sitting or reclining on began as a thought. The room you're in--and almost everything in it--began as a thought.
<P>
All the wars and fighting the world has known began with thoughts. (Usually, "You have it, I want it," "You're doing this, I want you to do that," or "I just don't like you.")
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

All the good, fine, noble, and creative acts of humanity were conceived as a spark in a single human consciousness. The Eiffel Tower, the Mona Lisa, the Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence, movies, books, and television began in the mind. (Granted, some of it should have stayed there. As someone once said, "In every journalist is a novel, and that is precisely where it should remain.")
<P>
Even the creation of a human being begins as a thought. As the old saying goes, "I knew you before you were a twinkle in your father's eye."
<P>
Victor Hugo described it this way: "An invasion of armies can be resisted, but not an idea whose time has come." Often misquoted as "There is nothing so powerful as an idea whose time has come," it has been used so often, it's become a clich. (There is nothing less powerful than a clich whose time has passed.)
<P>
Everything created by humans--both good and bad--began as a thought. (The categorization of "good" and "bad," of course, is just another thought.) The only difference between a thought and a physical reality is time, passion (love or hate), and physical activity.
<P>
The amount of time, passion, and physical activity varies from project to project. Sometimes it's seconds; sometimes it's years; sometimes the thought must be passed from generation to generation. Some of the great cathedrals took a century and four generations of stone cutters to complete. On the other hand, there was the Hundred Years' War.
<P>
Leonardo da Vinci invented the helicopter four hundred years before one ever flew. Two hundred years ago, Thomas Jefferson envisioned a nation free from religious persecution, of people "with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." We're still working on that one.Please see my book,<I> Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do</I>.
<P>

To illustrate the power of thought: Imagine the corner of this page turned over. Let it be an idea in your mind. Now reach up and fold it over. There. A thought was passed from my mind to your mind, and you turned that thought into a physical reality. (If you're not the first person to read this book you might have wondered, "Why is the corner of this page turned over?" Now you know.)
<P>
Some people are particularly good at turning ideas into realities. Edison was one. Imagine: the phonograph, movies, an improved telephone, and the electric light all from one man. Henry Ford wanted to make a cheap, reliable automobile and invented the assembly line to do it.
<P>
Without thoughts, things that involve any sort of human action simply don't happen. Where we are is the result of a lifetime of thinking--both positive and negative.
<P>
If you're pleased with some parts of your life, then your thinking in those areas has been what you would call generally "positive." If you're not pleased with other parts of your life, then your thoughts about those areas have probably not been as positive as they could have been. The good news is that thoughts can be changed, and with that change come changes in your life.
<P>

If you persist in your thoughts of wealth, for example, you focus on wealth--an overall state of being that is open, accepting, abundant, and flowing--and this focus on wealth tends to produce physical manifestations of wealth: houses, cars, cash, and your own special edition of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.
<P>
"But," some protest, "I think about money <I>all</I> <I>the time</I> and I still don't have any." What they mean is that they <I>worry</I> about money all the time. Worry is a form of fear, in this case a fear of poverty. Holding an ongoing series of thoughts about poverty creates a focus on poverty, which creates a lack of everything but bills--which causes more worry, which creates more poverty.
<P>
Our thoughts create our reality--not instantly, necessarily, as in "Poof! There it is"--but eventually. Where we put our focus--our inner and outer vision--is the direction we tend to go. That's our desire, our intention. The way we get there--well, there are many methods.
<P><BR>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Intention vs. Method</H2>
<P>
If I were in New York and wanted to go to Toledo (God knoweth why--a writer has to stretch reality sometimes to come up with examples), what are some of the ways I could get there?
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Plane? Car? Train? Bus? Bike? Walk? Hitch-hike? Pogo stick? Crawl? Roll? Skip? Hop? Somersault? You, no doubt, have some other ways I haven't mentioned. (Somersault. What a strange-looking word.)
<P>
In this example, Toledo would be the intention. The many ways of traveling there are the methods. 
Each intention we have can be fulfilled by any number of methods. The idea is to hold your intention clearly in mind, and then be open to whatever methods appear--even unexpected ones.
<P>
For example, in traveling from New York to Toledo, what general direction should you take? West, right? That would be the generally accepted method--directionally speaking. Some might even argue that it is the only direction that would get you to Toledo. But what if you went east, and kept going east? Could you eventually find yourself in Toledo? Sure.
<P>
As Niels Bohr said, "The opposite of a correct statement is a false statement. But the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth." Some people say the way to get more money is to hoard it. Others say the way to get more money is to give it away. Some say health is gained through more rest. Others say it's obtained by more activity. Be open to all methods, even seemingly contradictory ones.
<P>
Back to Toledo. Which direction is the faster route from New York to Toledo, east or west? It can only be west, right? Not necessarily. If I went west doing somersaults and you went east on the Concorde, who do you suppose would get to Toledo faster? (Hint: I am not listed in Guinness' Book of World Records as Mr. Somersault.)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Again, keep open to various methods and behaviors, and remember: life often offers surprising solutions.
<P>
For the last time, back to Toledo. All silly examples aside, if I really wanted to get from New York to Toledo, which is the right way to go? A westerly course, of course. As you can tell, I'm being trickier than usual in this section. I'm challenging some popular assumptions people have about methods and how to choose them. Is west really a "right" direction and east a "wrong" one? Of course not.
<P>
As methods go, "right" and "wrong" are just opinions. The only valid criterion of a method is whether or not it is workable. In the New York-Toledo journey, both east and west are workable methods and, therefore, acceptable. North and south are not workable; therefore, not acceptable. North and south are not wrong; they just won't <I>work</I> for a journey from New York to Toledo.
<P>
Methods can sometimes indicate intentions. If you were driving west from New York, for example, we could reasonably assume that your immediate intention was not to visit New England. The operative words are sometimes and indicate, because it's not until you land in Toledo and say, "Yes! Eureka! This is it!" that we'll know your intention was truly Toledo.
<P>
Let's say someone has an intention to hide. He (let's make him a he) discovered at an early age that to be spontaneous, outgoing, sensitive, and expressive got him into trouble with some of the authority figures. ("Be quiet! Can't you see we're watching television?" "Settle down." "Be a good little boy and sit still.") He decided to hide the expressive parts of himself.
<P>
If he intended to hide his sensitivity and enthusiasm, what methods might he use? Being withdrawn, not going out, being shy, not participating. He might even start creating some physical methods: stammering, putting on weight, or even developing an illness--such as asthma or a heart problem: perfectly reasonable reasons not to participate. He might generate a need for glasses--which can be great to hide behind. In later years, he may let his hair cover part of his face or grow a beard.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>WILLIAM BLAKE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

And what if life at certain times became too intolerable? What if he decided, time and again, "I can't take it anymore. I don't want to live." If he formed an intention to die, what are some of the methods he might use to fulfill that intention?
<P>
Gunshot, car accident, poison, tuberculosis, leukemia, cancer, drowning, carbon monoxide, knife wound, slit wrist, heart attack, stroke, diphtheria, decapitation, a too-meaningful relationship with Blue Beard, bubonic plague, earthquake, flood, volcano, anorexia, falling, syphilis, wild beasts, cholera, guillotine, hanging, shark, piranha, electric chair, polio, gas chamber, hepatitis, lethal injection, flu, meningitis, or the relative newcomer, AIDS.
<P>
A life-threatening illness is just one of many methods to fulfill an intention to die. It might be that somewhere inside, the person with a life-threatening illness has or did have an intention to die.
<P>
Maybe.
<P>
It's worth a look. Intentions are often unconscious. Once discovered, however, intentions can be changed.

<H2>Where Does Negative Thinking Come From?<BR>Or Why Are We Doing This to Ourselves?</H2>
<P>
Why do we use the power of our mind to create a negative reality? If our mind can generate health, wealth, and happiness as easily as illness, poverty, and despair, why aren't we healthy, wealthy, and happy all the time?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The strangest and most fantastic fact about negative emotions is that people actually worship them.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>P. D. OUSPENSKY </FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

If a genie appeared and offered you a choice--health, wealth, and happiness or illness, poverty, and despair--which would you choose? If the former is the obvious choice, why do we sometimes choose the negative? There must be something else--something deeper--generating the impulse to think negatively.
<P>
Although you may have another word to describe the phenomenon, allow me to call this spring of negative thinking unworthiness. It's more than just a feeling or a passing thought; it's a ground of being, a deep-seated belief that "I'm just not good enough." Other words for it are insecurity, undeservingness, and low self-esteem.
<P>
Unworthiness undermines all our positive ideas and validates all our negative thoughts.
<P>
When we think something good about ourselves, unworthiness pops up and says, "No, you're not." When we desire something positive for ourselves, unworthiness says, "You don't deserve it." When something good happens to us, unworthiness says (often with our own lips), "This is too good to be true!"
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>You have no idea what a poor opinion I have of myself-- and how little I deserve it.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>W. S. GILBERT</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

When we think something bad about ourselves, unworthiness agrees, "Yes, that's true, and furthermore . . . . " When we tell ourselves we can't have or do something we want, unworthiness says, "Now you're being realistic." When something bad happens to us, unworthiness is the first to point out, "See? I told you so."
<P>
Jack Canfield describes unworthiness as a vulture sitting on your shoulder, squawking in your ear an endless stream of "You can't do it!" "You're not good enough!" "Don't even try!" "Who do you think you are?" "You'll never make it!" "Settle down!" "You don't deserve it!" "Somebody better than you should have it!"
<P>
Some people cover their unworthiness with a self-confidence and bravado bordering on arrogance. <I>me</I>.  Their cover-up encompasses a self-indulgence and self-absorption that are, well, selfish. These people (it appears on the surface) could use a healthy dose of unworthiness. But, in fact, they are merely lost in a desperate attempt to hide--from themselves as much as from anyone else--the fact that they just don't feel worth it. They think the unworthiness is real, not just an illusion, and they respond by concealing it rather than laughing at it. (Did you ever try to conceal a vulture? It can be pretty funny to everyone but the person trying to conceal it.)
<P>
If unworthiness is so fundamental, does this mean we're born with it? I believe humans were born to have joy and to have it more abundantly; that the birthright of everyone is loving, caring, sharing, and abundance. All the negative stuff has just been layered on top of our essential core of goodness. (Not that there isn't strong genetic predispositioning--but that's another book.)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The childhood shows the man, As morning shows the day.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>JOHN MILTON</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Where does unworthiness come from? A look at how children are raised might offer a clue.
<P>
Imagine a child--two, three, or four years old--playing alone in a room. An adult, usually a parent, is nearby. What for? To praise the child every five minutes? No. For "supervision." (Did your parents have super-vision? Mine did.) The adult is on hand "in case there's any trouble."
<P>
The child is playing and having a wonderful time. Two hours go by. The child is "behaving" wonderfully. The interaction with the adult world is minimal.
<P>
Suddenly, the child knocks a lamp off a table. <I>CRASH!</I> What happens next? Lots of interaction with the adult, almost all of it negative. Yelling, screaming ("This was my favorite lamp," "How many times have I told you?" "Bad, bad, bad") and probably some form of physical punishment (spanking, no more playing, "go to your room"). Almost the only interaction in two hours from the adult community was: "You are bad. Shame on you."
<P>
As an infant, we get unconditional, almost never-ending praise. Goo-goo ga-ga. Once we grow a little and begin exploring our world, much of our interaction with adults--the symbols of power, love, authority, and life itself--consists of being corrected. Don't do this. Don't do that.
<P>
If we draw a picture, we get praise. If we draw the same picture again, we get less praise. If we draw the same picture five times in a row, we are told to try something new.
<P>
If we pour jam on the cat, we are scolded. If we pour jam on the cat a second time, we are scolded more severely. If we pour jam on the cat five times, we may begin wishing that, like the cat, we had nine lives.
<P>
The more we do something good, the less praise we get for it. The more we do something bad, the more punishment we receive. Some children learn to do negative things just to get attention because they figure (using child-logic) that negative attention is better than no attention at all. To a child, being ignored can seem like abandonment.

Inside, a part of us begins to add up all the times we're called "wonderful" and all the times we're called "bad." The bad seems to outnumber the wonderful.
<P>
We may begin to believe we are bad; that unless we do something new and remarkable and tremendous, we're not going to be thought of as good; that we must strive, work hard, and never disobey if we hope to get even a little appreciation; that our goodness must be earned because we are, after all, essentially bad.
<P>
Bad, unlovable, not good enough, undeserving, unworthy.
<P>
From this fertile ground spring our negative thoughts. Sure, we have a lot of positive thoughts, but we tend to believe the negative ones more. A positive thought, checked against this belief of unworthiness, is labeled "False." A negative thought feels at home. The unworthiness proclaims it true, accurate, right.
<P>
Another reason we don't feel quite as magnificent as we might is technology--the mass communication of sounds and images is a relatively new phenomenon. 
<P>
A hundred years ago or so, if you played a musical instrument or sang with any degree of competence, you would be among the best any of your acquaintances had ever heard. (The phonograph wasn't invented until 1877.) If you danced, juggled, or "play acted," you were in demand for socials and other gatherings. (The first motion pictures weren't shown publicly until 1894.) If you read books or could write more than your name, you were considered a local scholar and called upon to read or write for those who could not--which was the majority of the population, by the way. (In 1880, only 2.5 percent of high-school aged children went to high school.)
<P>
Today, all our achievements are compared with the best of the best. We have become accustomed to the highest form of excellence as our standard to judge everything from intelligence ("Did you read about that three-year-old who memorized the entire Encyclopedia Britannica?") to brute force ("So you can lift car. Big deal. I saw this guy on TV who could pull a jumbo jet--with his teeth!") to absurdity ("You think that's big? I heard about a girl who could blow a bubble bigger than her whole body!")

One wonders, for example, if Beethoven would have been encouraged to follow his musical bent if,as a child, he had been constantly compared toMozart (who was twenty-six at the time of Beethoven's birth). Mozart made a living composing and performing at age five. Beethoven didn't become a professional musician until the ripe old age of eleven. If Mozart's childhood performances had been shown again and again on TV, one can imagine a seven-year-old Beethoven, struggling with a composition, being told, "Mozart did better than this when he was four!"
<P>
With the best-of-the-best as the standard, it's little wonder that our initial inklings of uniqueness, brilliance, and perhaps even genius can be trampled under the crushing hooves of "You think that's good? Well, I saw on TV . . . . "
<P>
In fact, we don't even need the critical "help" of others. We make our own comparisons (in which we lose) long before we dare to share our accomplishments or desires with others. With larger-than-life achievements and achievers on all media fronts, it's little wonder we might think our meager initial offerings--and, perhaps, we ourselves--don't make the grade.
<P>
No matter how good we may be, we just aren't good enough.

<H2>Negative Thinking and Life-Threatening Illness</H2>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

There are as many examples of how negative thinking helps bring about life-threatening illnesses as there are people who have them. We each have our own personal list of disasters--those things that push us "over the edge," that make us decide life isn't worth living.
<P>
For some, it's one or two tragedies, the depth and intensity of which created a desire to die. For others, it's the daily dose of "slings and arrows"--the situations to which we respond: "What's the use?" "Why bother?" "Who cares?" The accumulation of these over the years forms the desire: "Why should I bother anymore?"
<P>
The latest example of a method that many are using in response to the intention "not to bother anymore" is AIDS. Yes, more people are using the "tried and true" methods of cancer, heart disease, and others--but AIDS is a perfect example of how we let negative thinking "win" in the "never-ending struggle for truth, justice, and the American Way." (That's the opening to <I>Superman</I>--a standard no one I've ever met lived up to.)
<P>
I'm not saying negative thinking causes AIDS--or any other life-threatening illness. I am suggesting that negative thinking promotes conditions in the mind, body, and emotions that make it possible for the AIDS virus (or whatever <I>does</I> cause AIDS--there seems to be some controversy on this point) to take root.
<P>
Negative thinking helps provide the opportunity. The illness takes it from there. Once it takes root, how quickly the illness progresses and grows depends a lot on how much fertilizer we give it from that great manure generator--negative thinking.
<P>

Probably the most common negative thought surrounding AIDS is fear. Anyone in the so-called "high-risk group" is a candidate for the epidemic of fear that's spread far faster than AIDS itself. (Actually, the only people in the high-risk group are those who practice high-risk activities.) If you've had a test that indicated the presence of HIV antibodies in your system, you probably are even more susceptible to the dis-ease of fear.
<P>
The epidemic of fear (a subset of the epidemic of negative thinking) is one of the most easily spread. Unlike any viral or bacterial illness, fear can be caught over the telephone, from reading newspapers, or from watching television.
<P>
For those afraid of catching AIDS--especially people who have the antibodies to the HIV virus in their system--every symptom of every disease generates the terror of imminent death.
<P>
A cold? "Oh my God, pneumocystis!" A bruise? "Kaposi's sarcoma!" A sore in the mouth? "Thrush!" A little perspiration because the bedroom is too warm? "Night sweats!" It's hypochondriac heaven: fear enlarges every minor symptom into a fatal illness.
<P>
This fear is the same for every life-threatening illness. There is a certain "high-risk group" for every illness, and the people within that group often torture themselves. For cancer, it's smokers. Thirty percent of all cancer deaths are smoking-related. Smokers may worry so much about cancer that they need another cigarette.
<P>
People with possible genetic predispositions to illness tend to worry. "My father died at sixty-five of a heart attack, my grandfather died at sixty-five of a heart attack, and I'm almost sixty."
<P>
Fear, fear, fear.
<P>
The tragic results of the epidemic are many:
<P><OL>
	<LI>From a medical point of view, negative thinking suppresses the immune system, raises the blood pressure, and creates a general level of stress and fatigue in the body. In short, infections, cardiovascular irregularities, the degeneration of muscles, and the random growth of unwanted cells get more opportunity.

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

	<LI>From a thoughts-are-creative point of view, our worry about a particular disease tends to create that disease. There's an old saying: "What you fear may come upon you." It's old because there's a certain degree of truth in it. Medical students and psychology students will often take on the symptoms of the disease or disorder they are currently studying. In some cases, they produce the disease itself. The thought, "Oh my God, it's cancer!" every time you cough might be misinterpreted by your body as an invitation--or even a directive.
<P>
	<LI>If you're thinking an illness might be AIDS or lung cancer, and it turns out to be just the flu, you might say, "Thank God, it's the flu!" Such enthusiasm and gratitude for the flu may create more flu.
<P>
	<LI>The more people believe they are going to die "within a few years, at best," the less they tend to start long-term projects--career goals, relationships, moving--which, in turn, tends to make life less fulfilling and enjoyable, therefore less livable. After a while, the question, "What have I got to live for?" might not have a satisfactory answer. The desire to die takes root.
<P>
	<LI>It's a miserable way to live. If we had a bomb strapped to our chest and were told it could go off at any time, that might be something, over time, we could learn to live with. (We all live with a similar situation in that we know we're going to die, but we don't know when.) If, however, we were told the bomb would tick precisely 1,243 times before exploding, every time the bomb started ticking we'd stop everything we might be doing and start counting. Some days it might only tick ten times, other days it might get up to 287, but while it ticked--panic. And, after a while, the fear that it might start ticking begins. So, even when it's not ticking, we're scared. It's a miserable way to live.
</OL><P>
Once negative thinking has given the life-threatening illness the opportunity to enter the body, is it too late? Is the progression of a life-threatening illness irreversible? I don't think so. I'm not being hopelessly optimistic about this, however; some things are irreversible.
<P>
Let's say, for example, that negative thinking had you throw yourself from the top of a thirty-story building. Once you were in the air, I would probably say it's too late for a change in thinking to greatly affect the physical outcome.
<P>
But for anything short of the law of gravity, there's a chance. (That's why it's called the law of gravity--levity has no effect upon it.)
<P>
Life-threatening illnesses tend to be either active or dormant. When dormant, they do us no further harm; they just sleep quietly.
<P>
The vital question is: What puts the illness to sleep and what keeps it sleeping? I like to think the gentle lapping of positive thoughts on the shoreline of the mind acts as a virtual Sominex (or Demerol or chloroform or nitrous oxide, as you prefer) to life-threatening illness.

Cardiovascular illnesses are directly related to the general mental-emotional-physical state of ease in the body. The more often the body is at ease, the less the heart must work and the less pressure is exerted on the entire cardiovascular system. (A primary goal of exercise, in fact, is letting the heart work less by becoming stronger.)
<P>
When the pressures caused by negative thinking are released and a natural state of ease returns, the cardiovascular system can heal itself and function as it was designed to.
<P>
Degenerative muscle diseases may be hastened along their course by degenerative thinking. Generating generative (positive) thoughts may help slow the degeneration and, perhaps, even regenerate muscles.
<P>
Cancer is, by definition, cells that are growing out of control. This pattern can be swift, or it can be slow. Cancer can take over a vital organ in a matter of weeks, or it can take decades. The cells can stop growing altogether for indefinite periods of time. When discussing "incurable" cancer (and more than fifty percent of all cancers are now considered curable), the medical establishment doesn't quite know why a cancer would slow, stop, or, more mysteriously still, get smaller.
<P>
It's known as "remission." When it happens because of medical treatment, it is understood. "Your cancer is in remission." When it happens for "no good reason" (the patient's rediscovered desire to live and related changes in lifestyle not being a good enough "reason"), it's called "spontaneous remission." Doctors explain: "It's spontaneous, like lightning or earthquakes. It just happens sometimes. We don't know why."
<P>
Tens of thousands of cancer patients, whose cancers have been in "spontaneous remission" for years, know why. They changed their thinking, and the thinking changed the course of the cancer.
<P>
The same is true of any infection or life-threatening illness you can name. Some of the "miracle cures" were not miracles to the people who experienced them. These people discovered why they desired death, changed that to a desire for life, and got busy changing everything in their lives that was contributing to their physical demise.
<P>
Consider the remainder of this book a lullaby for any infection; a road map on ways to ease your cardiovascular system; lessons in how to heal the hurts of the heart; instruction in generating generative thinking to counteract degenerative illness; a guidebook on creating spontaneity in your commissions and your remissions; and a wake-up call to the worthiness, well-being, and wellness within you.

<H1>YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE LUXURY<BR>OF A NEGATIVE THOUGHT</H1>
<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=80% ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<P>


<P>
This is not a book just for people with life-threatening illnesses. It's a book for anyone afflicted with one of the primary diseases of our time: negative thinking. 
<P>
I come before you a certified expert on the subject: I'm a confirmed negaholic. I don't just see a glass that's half-full and call it half-empty; I see a glass that's completely full and worry that someone's going to tip it over.
<P>
Negative thinking is always expensive-dragging us down mentally, emotionally, and physically-hence I refer to any indulgence in it as a luxury. When, however, we have the symptoms of a life-threatening illness-be it AIDS, heart trouble, cancer, high blood pressure, or any of the others-negative thinking is a luxury we can no longer afford.
<P>
I remember a bumper sticker from the 1960s-"Death Is Nature's Way of Telling You to Slow Down." Well, the signs of a life-threatening illness are nature's way of telling you to-as we say in California-lighten up.
<P>
Be easier on yourself. Think better of yourself. Learn to forgive yourself and others.
<P>
This is a book about getting behind on your worrying. Way, way behind. The further behind on your worrying you get, the further ahead you'll 
be.
<P>
My favorite quote on worry: "Worrying is the interest paid on a debt you may not owe."
<P>
This is not so much a book to be read as it is a book to be used. It doesn't have to be read cover to cover. I like to think you can flip it open at any time to any page and get something of value from it. This is especially true of the second-and longest-section of the book. 
<P>
This book has two sections: <B><I>The Disease</I></B> and <B><I>The Cure.</I></B>
<P>
The disease is not any specific illness, but what I believe to be a precursor of all life-threatening illnesses-negative thinking.
<P>
The cure is not a wonder drug or a vaccinationor The Magic Bullet. The cure is very simple: (1) spend more time focusing on the positive things in your life (Accentuate the Positive); (2) spend less time thinking negatively (Eliminate the Negative); and (3) enjoy each and every moment you can (Latch on to the Affirmative).
<P>
That's it. Simple, but far from easy.
<P>
It's the aim of this book to make the process simple and, if not easy, at least easier.
<P>
Please don't use anything in this book against yourself. Don't interpret anything I say in The Disease as blame. When I use the word responsibility, for example, I simply mean you have the ability to respond. (And you are responding or you wouldn't be reading this book.)
<P>
And please don't take any of the suggestions in The Cure as "musts," "shoulds," or "have-tos." Think of them as joyful activity, creative play, curious exploration-not as additional burdens in an already burdensome life.
<P>
This book is not designed to replace proper medical care. Please use this book in conjunction with whatever course of treatment your doctor or health-care provider prescribes. If you have a life-threatening illness, you will have to take some life-supporting actions, and naturally these include proper medical attention.
<P>
You are far more powerful than you ever dreamed.
<P>
You are a marvelous, wonderful, worthwhile person-just because you are. That's the point of view I'll be taking. Please join me for a while-an hour, a week, a lifetime-at that viewing point.
<P>

Yes, Virginia, there is a cure for the disease of negative thinking--dozens of cures, in fact. Any one of the techniques, suggestions, or ideas in this section may do it for you. Any one may be the key that opens whole new worlds of aliveness, enthusiasm, and health.
<P>
Yours may be a combination lock that requires five keys, or ten, or twenty, or you may need everything in this book--and a hundred more techniques you discover on your own--to open the doors to your inner kingdom of joy, self-confidence, and happiness. Whatever it takes is whatever it takes.
<P>
Whatever it takes, the results will be worth it.
<P>
I'm going to begin by talking about death (eeek!) and the fear of death (eeek! eeek!). After that, luncheon is served. I'm laying out a smorgasbord of positivity.
<P>
Mostly, these suggestions will seem familiar because they're good old-fashioned common sense. I tend to be pragmatic--if something works, I use it; if not, I try something else. What I pass along to you was learned through my own process of trial and error. It is from a firm--and substantial--foundation of mistakes that I offer these suggestions.
<P>
There's no particular order to this gathering of ideas. No &QUOT;Do this first, then this, then this.&QUOT; You are the architect of your cure. Naturally, like all good architects, you'll be consulting with other professionals--but the Master Plan is in your hands.
<P>
Choosing the pathway to your cure is easy--just follow your heart.
<P>
Please don't just read this book; use it. Do some things. Try them. Find out if a technique works for you--if it produces uplifting results. If so, do it some more. If not, throw it away. Try something else. This book contains a lot of things to try.
<P>
And now, The Cure.

<H2>Death 101 (Part One)</H2>
<P>
This is a crash course in death. Why death? Shouldn't we be focusing on positive stuff? Yes, but first we have to explore the motivation behind doing all the positive stuff.
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

If you're going to think more positively because you fear death, then whatever you do--no matter how positive--will be an affirmation of that fear.
<P>
As long as fear is looming large, you will probably continue with the process of improvement. As soon as fear no longer threatens, you may revert to old habits. When, for example, the medical cure for your illness is discovered, there's no need to fear dying of it; therefore, you may feel you can return to your former habits of negative thinking. That will, of course, recreate the intention to die, and another method of death is likely to appear.
<P>
If you use the techniques given in this book because you want to live a fuller, happier, more joyful, and productive life, then you have a foundation that will hold firm. If you undertake these methods as a frantic attempt to outmaneuver the Grim Reaper, the whole venture is, to paraphrase Henry Higgins, &QUOT;doomed before you even take the vow.&QUOT;
<P>
Not that you must be perfectly calm in the face of your own mortality before any of these suggestions will work. Not at all. Fear can be a good motivator to start something. But fear must gradually be replaced with the desire for a positive result if long-term progress is to be made.
<P>
It also feels better--running from something you fear is far less enjoyable than running toward something you desire.
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Running from fear only strengthens fear--you are demonstrating that fear has power over you. Fear must be faced and gone through. The procedure of &QUOT;getting over&QUOT; fear is succinctly stated in the title of the book Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway.  (A book I haven't read, so I can't recommend it, but it does have a great title.) Only then do we learn the truth of fear--that fear is merely an illusion, not a real thing. 
<P>
Before I continue with my short course on death, let's stroll over to the next classroom and overhear a few pointers on fear.

<H2>Fear 101</H2>
<P>
There are some things it's good to have a healthy fear of--drinking poisons, leaping off tall buildings, sex with gorillas--situations in which our physical body is in imminent danger of annihilation, dismemberment, mutilation, or extinction.

All other fears--the ones we face most often every day--are illusions. They should be given no more credence or authority over our actions than television commercials, election-year promises, or people who try to sell us flowers in airports.
<P>
Most people approach a fearful situation as though fear were some sort of wall. Let's say the situation is walking up to someone we do not know and saying, &QUOT;Hello.&QUOT;
<P>
As we think about approaching the stranger, the wall begins to form. As we imagine what the person may say in response, the wall grows denser. (The other person's response is almost always imagined in the negative: &QUOT;Would you leave me alone!&QUOT; Seldom do we imagine the other person looking up at us and singing &QUOT;Some Enchanted Evening.&QUOT;) If we begin to move in the general direction of the person, the wall becomes almost solid. It seems an impenetrable barrier. We turn away, humming a chorus of &QUOT;If I Loved You.&QUOT;
<P>
But the wall of fear is not real.
<P>
Fear as a barrier is an illusion. We have, however, been trained to treat this illusion as though it were real. This belief served us well in our childhood years. Our parents taught us to be afraid of <I>everything</I> new. This was--at that time--good advice. We were too young to know the difference between the legitimately dangerous and the merely exciting.
<P>
When we grew old enough to know the difference, however, no one ever taught us to take risks, explore new territories, and treat fear as energy for doing and learning new things. Fear as a reason <I>not</I> to do should be tucked away with all those other cozy childhood myths--Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy. (The Tooth Fairy was particularly hard to let go of.)

If fear is not a wall, what is it? It's a feeling, that's all. It will not (cannot) keep you from physically moving toward something <I>unless you let it.</I> It may act up and it may kick and scream. It may make your stomach feel like the butterfly cage at the zoo. But it cannot stop you. You stop you.
<P>
The fear of meeting people, for example, is a particularly silly fear. Given that it's in a place where they're not going to slug you (Hell's Angels bars are not recommended), the worst that can happen is that someone will reject you. You are left with rejection. If you don't try, however, you have rejected yourself, and are left with exactly the same thing as if you had tried and failed--nothing.
<P>
If you do try, however, you may get what you want.
<P>
Even if you get rejected, you'll learn more from the experience than if you had never tried. You may learn, for example, that certain ways of approaching certain people in certain situations work better than others. We can learn as much (sometimes more) by what doesn't work as by what does. If we don't explore all the ways that really do and don't work, we are left with only the untested techniques from our imagination and what seems to work in the movies.
<P>
As Dr. Melba Colgrove once said: &QUOT;Anything that's worth having is worth asking for. Some say yes and some say no.&QUOT;
<P>
To overcome a fear, here's all you have to do: realize the fear is there, and do the action you fear anyway. Move--physically--in the direction of what you want. Expect the fear to get worse. It will. After you do several times the thing you fear, the fear will be less. Eventually, it goes away.
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face.

Fear is something to be moved through, not something to be turned from. In fact, if you feel carefully, you'll discover that the only difference between fear (a supposedly negative emotion) and excitement (a reputedly positive emotion) is what we choose to call it. The sensation is exactly the same. We just add a little &QUOT;Oh, no!&QUOT; to fear and a little &QUOT;Oh, boy!&QUOT; to excitement, that's all.
<P>
Fear, then, can be seen for what it truly is--the energy to do your best in a new situation.
<P>
So, with that in mind, let's return to death.
<P>
(&QUOT;Oh, no!&QUOT; &QUOT;Oh, boy!&QUOT;)

If you think about it, the fear of death is one of the most useless fears we have. Dying is one of the few things that all of us will, sooner or later, do.
<P>
If we're going to be afraid of death, we might as well be afraid of breathing or gravity or I Love Lucy reruns or any of the other inevitabilities of life.
<P>
Unless we fully accept the inevitability of death, it's hard to enjoy this interval called life. (&QUOT;This strange interlude,&QUOT; as Eugene O'Neill called it.) In other words, unless we get over our fear of death, we'll never really appreciate life. Unless it's okay to die, we'll never really live.
<P>
Someone I know was captured during a war and sentenced to death. He was put in a cell with a window facing the execution ground. Day after day, hour after hour, he watched his comrades marched before a wall and shot. He had no idea when his turn would come. It went on for six weeks. The war ended and he was released. Although he's one of the busiest people I know, he's also one of the calmest. He knows that, no matter what, the worst thing that can happen to him is that he'll die, and he's already faced that fear and come to terms with it.
<P>
Take a good look at your fear of death. Let yourself experience the fear. Find out what the fear's all about. Explore the many beliefs humans have about what happens after death. Are these really so terrible? There are, in fact, only three primary beliefs in our culture about what happens to us after death. Let's explore each of them.
<P><blockquote>
<STRONG>DEATH IS IT, THE END, FINITO.</STRONG> As soon as the blood stops flowing to the brain, we have no more experience. Our time here on Earth--which is wholly biological and nothing else--is over.</blockquote>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Death is nothing to us, since when we are, death has not come, and when death has come, we are not.</I><P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>I CORINTHIANS<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

If this is what happens after death, we have nothing to worry about. Everything we experience is bioelectrical-chemical reactions, and when it stops, it stops. Our fear of death makes no more sense than the glow in a light bulb worrying about when the power is switched off. When the light is out, the light is out. Period. The end. Nothing.
<P><blockquote>
<STRONG>IT'S HEAVEN OR HELL (OR MAYBE PURGATORY) FOREVER.</STRONG> When we die, we are judged by God and placed in one of three places: heaven (good), hell (bad), or (in at least one popular belief) purgatory (certainly not as good as heaven, but not as bed as hell).</blockquote>
<P>
If this is your belief, then you might consider life-threatening illness as a loving message from God: &QUOT;Prepare yourself for Paradise.&QUOT; You may prepare yourself so well, in fact, and become so close to God, that God might ask, &QUOT;Do me a favor?&QUOT; and you'll say, &QUOT;Sure. What?&QUOT; and God may say, &QUOT;Stick around another eighty years and continue to share the joy of Spirit with everyone.&QUOT;
<P><blockquote>
<STRONG>WE KEEP COMING BACK UNTIL WE LEARN WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW.</STRONG> The Soul (who we really are) never dies; only the physical body dies. If the Soul has not learned all it needed to learn in one body, it picks up another (at birth) and continues with its education. This is generally known as &QUOT;reincarnation&QUOT; and is the most popular belief about life and death worldwide--although not so popular in the United States.</blockquote
<P>
If this is the way things are, we have nothing to worry about. Death is like going from one room to another in a house, or taking off a suit and putting on a bathrobe (silk, with Alfred E. Newman's and my personal motto, &QUOT;What? Me Worry?&QUOT; embroidered on the pocket). Death is then a rest stop, a changing room, a summer vacation between semesters.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Either death is a state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness, or, as men say, there is a change and migration of the soul from this world to another.

Some say death is such a wonderful experience that the news must be kept from us or we'd all be killing ourselves just to get there. Of course, if we could fully perceive the joys of The Other Side, then we'd also know why we're here in the first place, so we wouldn't kill ourselves after all.
<P>
Take the time to conquer your fear of death. You can still live to be a hundred, and the years between now and then will be happier, healthier, and more exciting. And when it comes time to die, well, bon voyage.

I know accentuate is not spelled &QUOT;act-centuate.&QUOT; I just wanted to stress the need for act-ion.

<P>
I'll pull out songs from the forties, too--such as &QUOT;Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive,&QUOT; a song written by Johnny Mercer (lyrics) and Harold Arlen (music) during the darkest days of World War II.

As you may have gathered from what you've read thus far, I am obviously against negative thinking. So, if I'm against negative thinking, I must therefore be in favor of positive thinking.
<P>No.<P>No?!<P>No.<P>
Positive thinking, as taught and practiced by many people, is not as dangerous as negative thinking, but it has its downside.
<P>
Thoughts are powerful, more powerful than most people give them credit for being. They are not, however, all-powerful. There is more to reality than just thoughts.
<P>
For example, try to turn a page in this book without doing anything physical. Don't touch it ormove it; just hold the book still and try to turnapage with your thoughts. Or try to think a glass of water to your mouth, or pick up the phoneand think-dial a number. You see what I mean? Thoughts are powerful, but not all-powerful. There's a lot of power in our physical abilities, too.
<P>
When some people first discover how powerful thoughts are, they begin worshiping the mind. They deny the truth of what's actually happening for a mental image they find more pleasant. This creates a separation between the positive thinker and reality. This separation can be the cause of disorientation, confusion and, eventually, illness.
<P>

As an example, suppose you had a small cut on your forehead. The positive thinker might say, &QUOT;Your head is fine. The cut is only an illusion. Think of your forehead as healed. Imagine your forehead perfect.&QUOT;
<P>
I would probably say, &QUOT;Oh, you cut your forehead. Let's wipe the blood off, put on some antiseptic, and bandage it.&QUOT; While I was physically taking care of what needed to be done, I might suggest you hold a positive image of the cut healing quickly. But most likely I'd ask, &QUOT;What happened?&QUOT; because there's a certain therapeutic quality in talking about the incident. Also, I'd be curious to know.
<P>
And, there may be a lesson in the accident--if nothing else, the way to keep it from happening again.
<P>
If I'm not in favor of positive thinking, what am I in favor of? If I'm not in favor of negative thinking, I must be in favor of something positive.
<P>
I am.
<P>
I recommend focusing on the positive.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Focusing on the Positive</H2>
<P>
In any given moment, there is ample evidence to prove that life is a bed of thorns or a garden of roses. How we feel about life depends on where we place our attention, that is, what we focus upon.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Why is it no one ever sent me yet One perfect limousine, do you suppose? Ah no, it's always just my luck to get One perfect rose.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>DOROTHY PARKER</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Did you ever notice that every time you are given a rose, the stem is covered with thorns? (If you take the thorns off, the flower wilts more quickly. Florists know this, which is why they leave the thorns on.) Do you say, &QUOT;Why are you giving me this stick with thorns on it?&QUOT; Of course not. You admire the beauty of the rose. Even if you prick yourself in your enthusiasm, it never seems to hurt--you are too engrossed in appreciating the rose and the person who gave it to you.
<P>
Right now, in this moment, without moving from where you are, you can find ample evidence to prove your life is a miserable, depressing, terrible burden, or you can find evidence to prove your life is an abundant, joyful, exciting adventure.
<P>
Let's start with the negative. Look at all the imperfections around you. No matter how good anything is, it could be better, couldn't it? Look for dirt, disorder, and dust. See all the things that need cleaning, repairing, and replacing? An endless array of clutter, chaos, and catastrophe assaulting your senses. And all those <I>damn</I> alliterations in this paragraph. Dis-gusting.
<P>
Now, explore the same environment with an attitude of gratitude and appreciation.
<P>
Look around the same area you just surveyed and find the good. You can start with whatever you're sitting or lying on. It's probably softer than aconcrete floor. Look at all the other objects you use but take for granted--glasses (both seeing and drinking), tables, windows, the walls and ceiling sheltering you from the elements. Consider the wonder of the electric light. A hundred years ago, you would have to have been very rich or very lucky to have had even one. And you probably have more than one--and a TV and a radio and many other electronic marvels.
<P>
What around you do you find aesthetically pleasing? A painting you haven't really looked at in years? The detail work on the clothes you're wearing? A flower? A vase? Wallpaper? Carpet? When was the last time you took a moment to appreciate colors?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>One should sympathize with the joy, the beauty, the color of life-- the less said about life's sores the better.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>OSCAR WILDE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Did you notice that you tended to feel better when you focused on the positive things in your surroundings? The process of focusing on the positive to produce more positive feelings works the same with things even more intimate than your surroundings--your body, for example.
<P>
If you look for all the things wrong with the body, boy, are you going to find them. Pains here, bumps there, rough spots here, too much fat there--the list goes on and on (and, as we get older, goes on and on and on and on).
<P>
But take a look at all that's right with your body. Even if you have a pain in your left foot, you can be thankful there's not one in your right. How about all those processes we take for granted? Digestion, circulation, respiration, assimilation, thinking-- yes, we think without having to even think about it. And let's not forget the five senses. Some people take them so much for granted they can't name all five without thinking, &QUOT;Let's see, what's the fifth one?&QUOT;
<P>
It's as though there were two attorneys in your mind, one gathering evidence for &QUOT;Life is Awful&QUOT; and the other gathering evidence for &QUOT;Life is Wonderful.&QUOT; You're the judge and can rule out any evidence you choose. Your decision is final. Which judicial ruling do you suppose would lead to more joy, happiness, peace, ease, and health?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Try thinking of love or something.</I><P>

To focus on the positive is not to disregard certain warning signals of a negative nature that, if ignored, eventually lead to inconveniences at best and disaster at worst. (If we use these &QUOT;negative&QUOT; signals to avoid disaster, then they're not so negative after all. Some even call them guardian angels.)
<P>
Let's say you're driving down the freeway and the little light goes on, telling you you're running out of gas. I do not suggest ignoring that bit of &QUOT;negativity&QUOT; and focusing on how wonderful it is that none of the other warning lights is on. I suggest you get some gas.
<P>
Here, by the way, is where negative thinking comes in. The negative reality is that you're low on gas. Negative thinking begins the litany, &QUOT;I wonder if I'm going to run out of gas before I reach the next station. What will I do if that happens? I'm in the middle of nowhere. What if some highway robbers get me? If I do get to a gas station, will it be the kind I have credit cards for? I bet it will be more expensive than in town. I bet it will be self-service and the pump will be dirty and my hands will smell funny after. I knew I should have filled up in town. Why am I so lazy and stupid?&QUOT; Etc., etc., etc.
<P>
During this inner tirade (which, for accomplished negative thinkers, takes place in under five seconds) the driver, in his or her anxiety, usually speeds up, which only wastes gas.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>NORMAN COUSINS</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

What I suggest is this: take note of the negative information, decide what to do about it (whatever corrective action seems to be in order) and return to focusing on the positive (in this case the music, the scenery, the passengers) while working on eliminating the negative.
<P>
With medical conditions, it's good to keep track of symptoms, but it does no good to dwell on them. The positive thinker might deny the early symptoms of a disease, making a cure more difficult. The negative thinker might turn every mosquito bite into a killer bee sting.
<P>
Positive focusers take a middle road. They note symptoms accurately so they can be reported to their health-care provider. They make an appointment. Beyond that, there's no point in dwelling on the symptoms, so they turn their attention to things more positive.
<P>
While we're considering the idea that there is sufficient evidence in any given moment to prove that life is wonderful or that life is terrible, let's take a look at how this works even closer to home: in our memories of the past and our anticipation of the future.
<P>
Here, too, we can muddle in the negative: &QUOT;Tommy wouldn't play with me when I was six.&QUOT; &QUOT;I have to go to the dentist next week, and I hate the dentist.&QUOT;
<P>
Or, we can do positive thinking: &QUOT;I'm winning the Oscar this year,&QUOT; when we've never been in a movie. &QUOT;I'm going hiking and camping next week,&QUOT; when we've just had major surgery. &QUOT;I have so many wonderful friends,&QUOT; when the phone hasn't rung in two weeks.
<P>
Or, we could try focusing on the good memories that actually happened and on realistic plans we look forward to with pleasure. &QUOT;That movie on TV last night was so good.&QUOT; &QUOT;Helen's coming to visit tomorrow; that will be nice.&QUOT; &QUOT;The book I ordered should be arriving any day.&QUOT;
<P>
Yes, it's good to &QUOT;live in the moment,&QUOT; but who does that all the time? As long as you're living in memories of the past and projections of the future, you might as well make them happy memories and joyful projections.
<P>
I will be giving some techniques later in which you can let your imagination run positively wild. There can be great value in this. What I'm talking about here is day-to-day, ordinary thinking. In my view, negative thinkers need to get their minds out of the sewer and positive thinkers need to get their heads out of the clouds.
<P>
Have I made a clear distinction between positive thinking and focusing on the positive? It's a subtle but important difference. Positive thinking imagines any wonderful thing at all, no matter how unrelated it is to the actual events of one's life. Focusing on the positive starts with what's real, what's actually taking place, and moves from there in a joyful direction.
<P>
If you spend all your time in a positive future, when will you appreciate the present? The present is the future you dreamed of long ago. Enjoy it.

<H2>The Case against &QUOT;Positive Thinking&QUOT; (Part Two)</H2>

There is a story told of a Master who saw a dead dog decaying in the road. His disciples tried to keep the unsightly animal from him, but the Master saw the unfortunate animal and said, &QUOT;What pearly white teeth.&QUOT; Even amid stench and decay, there was still something beautiful to behold.
<P>
The Master did not--as some positive thinkers might--say the dog was &QUOT;only sleeping.&QUOT; The Master did not throw a stick and say, &QUOT;Here, Rover, fetch!&QUOT; The Master first perceived the reality and then found something good about it.
<P>
Positive thinkers sometimes use positive thinking to justify their inability to accept the moment. They have a long list of &QUOT;shoulds,&QUOT; and, unless reality measures up to their imagined state of perfection (which it almost never does), they retreat into positive thoughts, affirming that, thanks to their thoughts, the future conditions of the world will be better for everyone.
<P>
In other words, some people use positive thinking as a holier-than-thou-sounding form of denial.
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

A major problem with positive thinking and illness--especially life-threatening illness--is: what about the illness? If you are told to positively think yourself healthy and then get sicker, you may add personal blame to the worsening illness. &QUOT;If I had only thought more positively, I would be well by now. Where did I fail?&QUOT;
<P>
This is especially true of positive thinkers who tell stories of miracle cures. &QUOT;If only you think positively, and believe, you, too, can have a miracle cure.&QUOT; Well, maybe, or maybe not.
<P>
It took a lot of negative thinking--decades in some cases--to bring on a life-threatening illness. Why should a week or two of positive thinking get rid of it?
<P>
Now, I'm all for miracles, and I've seen my share, but miracles can't be counted on. If they could, by definition, they wouldn't be miracles. I tend to follow the Pragmatic Creed: &QUOT;Hope for the best, prepare for the worst, and shoot down the middle.&QUOT;
<P>
If you have a miraculous healing, wonderful! Take all the credit for it. If you have a slow, progressive recovery, great! If you have the usual series of ups and downs that life-threatening illnesses often go through, find something to be grateful for every day, every hour, every minute. Each time you find something, it will make you smile in your heart.
<P>
Positive thinking only puts a gap between where you are physically and where you think you &QUOT;should&QUOT; be. There are no &QUOT;shoulds&QUOT; to a life-threatening illness. You'll be happier, and probably heal faster, if you let go of as many &QUOT;shoulds&QUOT; as you can. (More on this later.)
<P>
Now I'd like to explore an area in which I take fundamental issue with positive thinkers--how to respond to loss. Positive thinkers might say, &QUOT;There is no loss, only the opportunity for new experiences. Rejoice!&QUOT; I say: loss hurts. It also infuriates. That's natural. That's human. To deny the pain and anger with an attitude of platitudes may do more harm than good.

This is a lifetime of good-byes. As the years go on, you'll say good-bye to both people (through moving, change, or death) and things (youth, that semi-tight body you once had, hair, prized possessions). Eventually, you'll say good-bye to it all with your own death.
<P>
Learning to mourn, to grieve, to say a good good-bye, is an invaluable tool.

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

When a loss takes place, the mind, body, and emotions go through a process of healing as natural as the healing of a physical injury. Know that feeling lost, sad, angry, hurt, fearful, and tearful at good-byes is a natural part of the healing process.
<P>
We recover from loss in three distinct but overlapping phases. The first phase of recovery is shock/ denial/numbness; the second, fear/anger/depression; the third, understanding/acceptance/moving on.
<P>
No matter what the loss--from a missed phone call to the death of a loved one--the body goes through the same three phases of recovery. The only difference is the time it takes to go through each stage and the intensity of the feelings at each point along the way.
<P>
When we first hear of a loss, our initial reaction is shock/denial/numbness. Often we say, &QUOT;Oh, no!&QUOT; We can't believe what we've heard. We go numb.
<P>
This ability to deny and go numb is a blessing. Catastrophic losses are too hard to take all at once. It has been suggested that the reason some people have slow, terminal illnesses as their method of dying is because it's going to take them a long time to say good-bye, and they want to do it right.

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

The next phase, fear/anger/depression, is the one most commonly associated with loss. We think we'll never love or be loved again (fear). We wail against the situations, people, things, and unkind fates that &QUOT;caused&QUOT; the loss (anger). We cry, we feel sad, we hurt, we don't want to go on (depression).
<P>
One of the toughest feelings to accept is anger at the one who is dying (even if it's yourself). &QUOT;Why are you leaving me?!&QUOT; a voice inside wants to know. To feel angry at someone for dying, or angry at yourself over your own death, is perfectly normal. It's a natural stage of recovery that one must pass through. (Pass through--not remain in.)

<FONT SIZE=-1>MARCEL PROUST</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Finally we come to understanding/acceptance/ moving on.
<P>
We understand that loss is part of life. We accept the loss we suffered, and begin to heal. When healing is well under way, we move on to our next experiences.<I>How to Survive the Loss of a Love</I> by Melba Colgrove, Ph.D., Harold H. Bloomfield, M.D., and me explains theprocess of healing in detail. Available at bookstores or call 1-800-LIFE-101.
<P>
I put this information on grieving in the section &QUOT;Act-centuate the Positive&QUOT; because mourning is a positive human ability. It allows us the flexibility to adapt to change. It is not &QUOT;negative&QUOT; to feel pain, fear, and anger at loss. It's a natural, human response. The negativity enters when the process of healing is suppressed, glossed over, and denied.
<P>
Accept the process. Accept the numbness, the fear, the pain, the anger, the sadness, the tears, and, eventually, accept the healing.
<P>
Accepting the healing can be difficult. People may expect you to mourn longer than you find necessary, or they may want your mourning to &QUOT;hurry up.&QUOT; People often offer comfort to ease their own discomfort. &QUOT;There, there,&QUOT; they say, &QUOT;everything's all right,&QUOT; when, in fact, everything is not all right.
<P>
Grieving must be done in its own time.
<P>

To deny the reality that pain hurts only delays the healing process. Take the time to grieve, to mourn, to say a good good-bye. At the point of genuine understanding and acceptance of your own death (not just a mentally constructed understanding and acceptance) lies the ability to understand and accept the magnificence of life.

<H2>E-LIM-I-NATE THE NEGATIVE</H2>
<P>
I sandwiched this section on eliminating negativity between two sections on adding positivity. I did this for a reason. I firmly believe that the way to more health, wealth, and happiness is to focus on health, wealth, and happiness. This may sound simplistic, but many people try to obtain health, wealth, and happiness only by trying to eliminate disease, poverty, and unhappiness.
<P>
But the lack of disease is not necessarily health, the lack of poverty is not necessarily wealth, and the lack of unhappiness is not necessarily happiness. Sometimes we successfully eliminate a negative and discover we still don't have what we want. &QUOT;After all that work!&QUOT; we sigh. And, discouraged, sometimes we return to the negative.
<P>
Another problem with trying to get rid of something negative is that we must pay attention to the negative we're trying to eliminate. This attention gives it more energy--our energy--and sometimes makes the negativity seem too great to overcome.
<P>
Doing nothing besides eliminating negatives to get what you really want can be the long way `round. If there were one hundred objects on a table, and I wanted you to pick up object 27, I could tell you, as you randomly selected items, &QUOT;No, don't pick up object 34. No, don't pick up object 29. No, don't pick up object 63.&QUOT;
<P>
Eventually, you would get to object 27, and I wouldn't say anything. You might, however, after twenty or thirty &QUOT;Don'ts,&QUOT; give up. I could hardly blame you. It would have been much easier if I had simply said, &QUOT;Pick up object 27.&QUOT;
<P>
That's why I asked you earlier to make a list of the things you want in life (your Top-Ten List). Going directly for what you want is a much easier and more effective way of getting what you want than eliminating what you don't want.
<P>
You may, however, find &QUOT;negative&QUOT; parts of your life opposing your goal--these must be sacrificed in order to get what you want. If you want happiness, for example, you must sacrifice unhappiness. Some of these opposites may be easy to give up; others may have become bad habits.
<P>
When eliminating the bad habits, always keep in mind why you are eliminating them. Focus on your goal. Rather than saying, &QUOT;I want to give up negative thinking,&QUOT; tell yourself, &QUOT;I want to enjoy all the positive things in my life.&QUOT; Rather than, &QUOT;I want to get rid of this illness,&QUOT; say, &QUOT;I want vibrant, radiant health.&QUOT;
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>ST. AUGUSTINE<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Breaking bad habits can be difficult, but it's easier if you remember that what you're adding to your life (the goal) is more valuable than what you're eliminating (the habit).
<P>
In releasing yourself from the bondage of bad habits, don't try to eliminate all of them at once. That's just inviting failure. Take them one or two at a time, starting with the ones that will be easier for you to change. When these are under control, take on a few others that may be a bit more challenging. Build on the strength of each victory.

We're not responsible for every thought that wanders through our brain, only the ones we hold there. The thought, &QUOT;What an inconsiderate person,&QUOT; may float through our mind and probably do little harm. It's when we add to that thought (&QUOT;And furthermore . . . &QUOT;) that we get into trouble.
<P>
Maybe the person was being inconsiderate. That might 
be an accurate observation. We start the cycle of negative thinking when we add &QUOT;and I don't like that&QUOT; to what we observe.
<P>
It's important to keep this distinction in mind when breaking the habit of negative thinking. Merely noticing that something is a certain way, and that that way might fall on the negative side of life, is not a &QUOT;negative thought.&QUOT;
<P>
To notice a houseplant is withering is an observation, and not a positive one. From that observation, we have options.
<P>

One, the negative-thinking route: &QUOT;Oh, the plant is dying. How many times have I told so-and-so to water the plants? Plants always die on me. I must have some plant-killing energy.&QUOT;
<P>
Two, the positive-action route: &QUOT;I'd better water the plant. Apparently I'm not doing enough to impress upon so-and-so the importance of watering the plant; I'll write a note now. Plants don't seem to do well in that location. Maybe I should get a hardier plant.&QUOT;
<P>
Every time we see something and think it might be better another way, we are not necessarily having negative thoughts. We get into trouble when we get negative and demand that things and people be different than they are.
<P>
If you're not willing to invest the time, activity, and money in making something the way you want it (assuming it's even possible), then you might as well accept it. Acceptance takes less than a second, consumes almost no energy, and costs absolutely nothing.
<P>
We live in a negative-feedback world. Often, the signal that tells us something needs attention is a negative one. Noticing these signals is not negative thinking. Doing something corrective about them is positive action. Getting upset about them is negative thinking.
<P>
The latter is what I'm suggesting you keep to a minimum.

Does all this negative thinking produce depression; or are we depressed, and the depression causes negative thinking? Which became depressed first: the chicken or the egg?
<P>
Here I'm discussing medical depression, <I>biological</I> depression, not the sort of depression we feel when we say, &QUOT;The popcorn at the snack bar has too much cholesterol. I'm depressed.&QUOT;
<P>
Many negative thinkers can't help it. They have a physical illness known as depression. It's an imbalance in the chemical functioning of the brain. A depressed brain cannot hold a positive focus for any meaningful length of time. Negative thoughts, on the other hand, flourish.
<P>
I know whereof I speak: I was depressed from at least the age of three, but I didn't discover it until I was forty-three. (That must be some sort of record for non-self-awareness. Or denial. Probably both.) All those wonderful techniques and ideas I taught others in books, tapes, seminars, and PR appearances didn't work for me. Yes, they helped a little, but considering the time I had put in, I should have been happier than Mary Poppins. (Come to think of it, maybe Mary Poppins was a little depressed herself.) People would bump up against my anger or pain and exclaim, &QUOT;I thought you wrote a book about not having negative thoughts!&QUOT;
<P>
Shortly after I started treatment for depression (in 1993), the depression lifted like the proverbial veil. I felt good just being alive. I felt worthy for the first time in my adult life. Further, all the self-help stuff actually started helping. Not that life is now suddenly perfect. When I think and do negative things, I feel negative. When I think and do good things, however, I finally feel good.

There are three primary kinds of depression: major depression, chronic depression, and manic depression.
<P>
Major depression has a beginning, a middle, and an end--like the flu. Unlike the flu, however, major depressions often last for months.
<P>
Chronic depression (also called dysthymia) is a long-term, low-grade depression that can go on for years. (Yes, you can have both chronic depression and major depression at the same time. This stunning state of affairs is known as double depression.)
<P>
Manic depression is the unpredictable mood swing between irrational, anxiety-ridden highs <I>(mania)</I> and cavernous, often-immobilizing lows (depression).
<P>
There are many misconceptions about depression--mostly negative. Unfortunately, because depressed people think negatively about depression and its treatment, they don't get help, which allows the depression to worsen, which leads to more negative thinking, which produces a vicious cycle of suffering.
<P>
Allow me to clear up some of the most popular myths.
<P><OL>
	<LI><B>Depression is a mental illness.</B> Depression certainly affects the mind and emotions, but depression is a physical illness--like diabetes, high blood pressure, or low thyroid. Specifically, depression is the body's failure to maintain the proper level of neurotransmitters in the brain. Neurotransmitters are the fluid through which the brain communicates with its many cells. When the level of neurotransmitters is too low, communication falters, brain functioning becomes inharmonious, and depression results. It is thought the manic (hyper) phase of manic depression occurs when the level of neurotransmitters is too high.
<P>
	<LI><B>Depression cannot be easily treated.</B> That was true just a few years ago, but medical breakthroughs since 1987 make depression among the most easily and successfully treated of all major illnesses. The two major forms of treatment are antidepressant medication and short-term therapy (usually just fifteen to twenty sessions).
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>M. KATHLEEN CASEY</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

	<LI><B>Antidepressants are &QUOT;happy pills&QUOT; that change your personality.</B> Think of depression as a headache. If you've had a headache for months, years, or as long as you could remember, taking an aspirin and alleviating the headache will certainly make you feel better. It is, however, the same you feeling better. Antidepressants only remove depression. If you take an aspirin and don't have a headache, you won't feel much of anything. If you take an antidepressant and you don't have depression, you won't feel much of anything, either. Unlike, say, tranquilizers or pep pills, antidepressants have no mood-altering effect. When people say they're happier taking antidepressants, they are referring to the relief one naturally feels when the pain of depression lifts.
<P>
	<LI><B>Antidepressants are dangerous.</B> In fact, antidepressant medications are among the safest of all prescription drugs. Prozac, the most popular antidepressant, has had unparalleled negative press (more people know the side-effects of Prozac than know the symptoms of depression). This is because the Church of Scientology, for whatever reason, decided to attack Prozac with a great pile of falsehoods. More than ten million people regularly take Prozac worldwide; five million in the United States. Naturally, a handful of these people have displayed some aberrant behavior. A handful of any group of five million people will, at one time or another, display aberrant behavior. (Statistically, I'm sure it can be shown that a high percentage of mass murderers drank milk when they were growing up.) All medications have potential side effects, of course, and antidepressants are no exception. A relatively small percentage of people taking the new generation of antidepressants, however, experience any side-effects at all.
<P>
	<LI><B>Antidepressants are unnatural and unhealthy.</B> Not so. Antidepressants simply balance the level of neurotransmitters already in the brain. The positive effect of antidepressants comes from allowing naturally produced neurotransmitters to return to natural levels. That's all. Further, the misery of enduring depression is far more unhealthy--on all levels--than any known antidepressant side-effect.

<FONT SIZE=-1>NATHAN S. KLINE, M.D.</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

	<LI><B>Healing depression means years of psychotherapy.</B> The two forms of therapy shown to work best in healing depression (Cognitive Therapy and Interpersonal Therapy) are both short-term, closed-ended therapies--usually lasting just fifteen to twenty sessions. Both are more &QUOT;retraining&QUOT; and educational than they are lying on a couch and rhapsodizing on a therapist's traditional opening line: &QUOT;Tell me about your childhood.&QUOT; The reason some people perceive, think about, and do depressing things is that no one ever taught them a better way. These therapies are about learning a better way.
<P>
	<LI><B>If I have depression, I'm unusual.</B> Hardly. More than fifteen million Americans currently suffer from depression. The sad fact is that ten million of them don't know it. These ten million go about blaming this and overreacting to that, but the true cause of their suffering, poor relationships, failure, and ill health is a biochemical imbalance in the brain (depression). The chances are one-in-five that you will have a depression at some time or another in your life.
</OL><P>
A few additional thoughts on depression:
<P><UL>
	<LI>People are more likely to be depressed the older they get. Those over sixty-five are four times more likely to have a depression than the general population.
<P>
	<LI>Depression is usually inherited, although the stress of life or chronic illness can cause depression, too. When I looked around my family tree and saw all the nuts growing on it, I realized I was <I>not</I> the product of the passion fruit bush (as I had always supposed).
<P>
	<LI>Many people with depression don't &QUOT;feel depressed.&QUOT; One can suffer from depression and not feel sad, blue, or emotionally down.
<P>
	<LI>Untreated depression is the #1 cause of alcoholism, drug abuse, and other addictions.
<P>
	<LI>Depression is often an underlying cause of overeating, chronic fatigue, insomnia, headaches, bulimia, digestive disorders, aches and pains, and other physical disorders.
<P>
	<LI>Some people think they're depressed because they have difficult relationships. Perhaps they have difficult relationships because they are depressed.
<P>
	<LI>Depression inhibits the functioning of the immune system, increasing the incidence of illness and shortening life.
</UL><P>
<H3>How to Tell if You Have Depression</H3>
<P>
According to the National Institutes of Health, if you have four or more of these symptoms for two weeks or longer, you may have depression. A diagnosis from a psychiatrist or other physician who specializes in depression is in order.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>It's been troubling me. Now, why is it that most of us can talk openly about the illnesses of our bodies, but when it comes to our brain and illnesses of the mind we clam up and because we clam up, people with emotional disorders feel ashamed, stigmatized and don't seek the help that can make the difference.</I><P>

Negative thinking is a bad habit. For many people it's an addiction. An addiction means some behavior is on automatic--it has control over you; you do not have control over it.
<P>
If you think you're not addicted to negative thinking, challenge yourself--put the book down, go about your life, and don't think a negative thought for the next hour. Starting now. Not one negative thought. Go.
<P>
ONE HOUR LATER . . . 
<P>
How did you do? Now don't kid yourself by saying, &QUOT;Oh, I only noticed the negative. You said that was okay.&QUOT; Is that <I>all</I> you did? Did you start to get upset about any of the negativity you noticed? If you did, you were doing more than noticing. You were adding to the noticing. What you were adding was negative thinking.
<P>
If you were unable to meet that challenge, you might want to take a good, honest look at how much control negative thinking has over your life.
<P>
Breaking addictions is not an easy process. If it were, they wouldn't be addictions. For the nonsmoker to give up cigarettes is easy; for the pack-a-day smoker, it's not. One is addicted; the other isn't.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>If at first you don't succeed you're running about average.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>M. H. ALDERSON</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

For some, giving up negative thinking may be a snap. They're not addicted--they've been thinking negatively just because they thought they should, that there was some good to be gotten from it. On learning they can get alongmarvelously without negative thoughts, these people just walk away from them. All they needed was permission.
<P>
For others, moving from automatic negative thinking to manual positive focusing is going to be a challenge--maybe the greatest challenge of their lives. And perhaps the challenge of life itself.
<P>
It's going to take time, perseverance, patience, forgiveness, determination, discipline, fortitude, enthusiasm, support, endurance and, above all, love. Love for yourself, love for the process, love for what you're creating in place of the addiction and, yes, even love for the addiction itself.

Now we're ready for the really good stuff--the affirmations of living, loving, health, wealth, happiness, and joy.
<P>
I'm not sure what Johnny Mercer meant by &QUOT;latch on to&QUOT; in the lyric of his song. I doubt if he meant &QUOT;become attached to.&QUOT; I certainly don't mean it that way. If joy, loving, and happiness become new &QUOT;shoulds,&QUOT; &QUOT;musts,&QUOT; and &QUOT;have-tos,&QUOT; we are, once again, &QUOT;doomed before we even take the vow.&QUOT;
<P>
Humans have a natural ability to want, desire, aspire, yearn, and long for. Any attempt to diminish this natural desire I find (a) counterproductive, (b)frustrating, and (c) so improbable it borders on the impossible.
<P>
Some people desire desirelessness with such a passion that it actually increases their ability to desire. What we do we become stronger in, and these people yearn so much and so often to have no more yearning that their ability to yearn becomes astronomical.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, Or what's a heaven for?.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>ROBERT BROWNING</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


I see nothing wrong with the human trait to desire. In fact, I consider it integral to our success mechanism. Becoming attached to what we desire is what causes the trouble. If you must have it in order to be happy, then you are denying the happiness of here and now.
<P>
If, however, you're focusing on the positive aspects of the reality around you while traveling in the direction you want to go, I see no problem with that at all. In fact, it sounds to me like a pleasant, productive way to live.
<P>
Rather than trying to diminish desire, I suggest you desire what you really want more of. Desire happiness. Aspire to gratitude. Long for health. Crave compassion. Seek satisfaction. Lust after God (however and whatever you perceive God to be). Want to love yourself, others, and everything around you more and more each day.
<P>
These are laudable goals. They're also fun, challenging, exciting, and not only within your grasp, but also within your reach.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>A Is for Acceptance</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>All nature is but art unknown to thee, All chance, direction which thou canst not see; All discord, harmony not understood; All partial evil, universal good; And, spite of pride, in erring reason's spite, One truth is clear, Whatever is, is right.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>ALEXANDER POPE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Acceptance is such an important part of happiness, contentment, health, and growth that some people have called it &QUOT;the first law of personal growth.&QUOT;
<P>
The world goes on, people do what they do, events come and go, and, for the most part, our only choice in all this is, &QUOT;Do I accept it or not?&QUOT; If we accept it, we flow with it. We allow life to do what it's already doing.
<P>
If we refuse to accept it, we usually feel pressure, pain, frustration, anxiety, and dis-ease. We struggle with what is. The struggle, for the most part, takes place within us--where it also does the most harm.
<P>
Acceptance is not the same as liking, or being happy about, or even condoning. It is simply seeing something the way it is and saying, &QUOT;That's the way it is.&QUOT; It's seeing what's going on and saying, &QUOT;That's what's going on.&QUOT; It's looking at something that's happening and saying, &QUOT;That's what's happening.&QUOT;
<P>
Acceptance is realizing that to do other than accept is (a) painful and (b) futile. Through nonacceptance we try to control the world. We want our &QUOT;shoulds,&QUOT; &QUOT;musts,&QUOT; and demands to rule the world.
<P>
It doesn't work. It simply does not work.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The more the marble wastes, the more the statue grows.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>MICHELANGELO </FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


To prove how futile the struggle to control the world, get up tomorrow at 4 a.m. and try to keep the sun from rising. Do everything you can to keep it from coming up. Struggle madly. Use all your power, influence, money, friends, and political connections to help. You won't be able to delay its scheduled ascension for so much as a millisecond.
<P>
Maybe you don't want to control the turning of the earth; you just want to control the world around you. Good luck on that one, too. The truth is, we sometimes can't even control ourselves--that part of the universe we have the most direct influence over. If we can't control our own thoughts, feelings, and physical reactions, how can we hope to control others?
<P>
Nature goes on being nature in its own natural way. We have very little control over it. What do we have control over? The space within the skin of our body. We can work to make that environment as loving, joyful, peaceful, and delightful as we like. That in itself is a lifelong project--and a worthy one, too.
<P>
The rest--the outer environment--does what it does. There's not much more to do than say, &QUOT;It's doing what it's doing.&QUOT;
<P>
When we set out to change a small fraction ofthe outer universe we <I>do</I> have some ability to change, one of the best starting points is acceptance. The sculptor begins by accepting the block of marble as it is, and then removes everything that isn't a statue. When asked how to sculpt a horse, one artist explained, &QUOT;I see the horse in the stone; then I take away everything that is not the horse.&QUOT;
<P>
Michelangelo's David was carved from a flawed block of marble. Another sculptor had begun work on the block and abandoned it. There was a deep gash in the side, making the stone &QUOT;unacceptable&QUOT; to sculptors for decades. Michelangelo, however, accepted the marble--gash and all--and created one of the marvels of humanity.
<P>
We begin with acceptance and move from there. This includes acceptance of ourselves. We are, please remember, a part of nature. We can be as contrary as a thunderstorm on a picnic. That &QUOT;natural&QUOT; part of us has its own rhythms, its own timelines, and its own agenda. While bringing this &QUOT;animal&QUOT; under control, we must learn to accept it.
<P>
This &QUOT;natural&QUOT; part of us most people call the body, and that's accurate, providing that you remember the body includes the brain that thinks the thoughts and the nerves that feel the feelings. Thoughts and feelings are a necessary part of the human animal.
<P>
The &QUOT;natural&QUOT; part of us thinks the Fight or Flight Response is terrific. Eons of genetics have told it so. We now must gradually convince &QUOT;it&QUOT; that the Love and Acceptance Response is more valuable for our survival as an animal.
<P>
This &QUOT;convincing&QUOT; we call education. The source of the word is educare, &QUOT;to lead forth from within.&QUOT; It's the gradual process of leading from within rather than being led from without.
<P>
In that process of teaching acceptance, we must practice acceptance. Set a good example for yourself. Learn to accept whatever you do. This, of course, is not carte blanche to run roughshod over others or to hurt yourself. It's just a realization that, being human, we're going to do things we're not going to like (and by &QUOT;doing,&QUOT; I mean all levels of doing, including thoughts and feelings), and we might as well accept those, too.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>There is no good in arguing with the inevitable. The only argument available with an east wind  is to put on your overcoat.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Learn to accept even your lack of acceptance. When you're not accepting something, accept your nonacceptance of it. Can't accept your nonacceptance? Then accept the fact that you can't accept your nonacceptance. If the bad stuff like guilt can pile up in layers (feeling guilty about feeling guilty about feeling guilty), so can the good stuff (accepting the fact that you can't accept your nonacceptance).
<P>
Yes, it gets funny, and it certainly can be fun. That's one of the keynotes of acceptance: a sense of lightness. As you accept the heaviness, you begin to feel &QUOT;the unbearable lightness of being.&QUOT; Accept that, too. No: welcome it.
<P>
With acceptance, you can't set some things aside and say, &QUOT;I'll accept these, but not those.&QUOT; Acceptance is unconditional. You can like one thing more than another--that's preference--but acceptance means not excepting anything. Actually, it's easier that way. You don't have to remember what to and what not to accept. If it is, accept it. Simple.
<P>
Schedule acceptance breaks throughout the day. Give yourself an acceptance break right now. Accept everything around you, everything inside you, everything about everything. Accept your thoughts. Accept your thoughts about your thoughts. Accept your thoughts about your thoughts about your thoughts. Accept whatever feelings you have, the sensations in your body. Don't try to change any of it--trying to change is a form of nonacceptance.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>CHRISTOPHER FRY</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Accept your surroundings, your physical environment. Accept your room, its furnishings, the smells, the sounds, and the occupants. Accept your thoughts about what's there and about what's not there. Accept your memories, fantasies, demands, and opinions about how it should be.
<P>
Accept all the things you did but wish you didn't do and all the things you didn't do but wish you did. Notice that these decisions about what's hot and what's not about an activity (or inactivity) are thoughts, too. Accepting thoughts--including the negative ones--is an important step toward greater joy.
<P>
And greater health.
<P>

<H2>Observe</H2>
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Observation is a pathway to acceptance. To observe is to think, feel, taste, smell, see, and hear without attachment, without attempting to manipulate the outcome, without taking sides.
<P>
All you do is observe. Simply &QUOT;be with&QUOT; whatever information your senses present to you. If your mind goes off on judgments and evaluations, observe that. Don't get involved with the thoughts; don't try to change them; just observe them.
<P>
As you learn to observe, you become more in touch with that part of you that's you. When you stand back and observe, you'll begin to experience a you that isn't your mind and its thoughts, isn't the emotions and their feelings, and isn't the body and its sensations.
<P>
This existence of <I>you</I> is hard to communicate, because I have to use words, which are decoded by the mind, and the mind does not like to relinquish its authority or to admit that there's something more basic to you than it.
<P>
You'll understand by doing. After fifteen or so minutes of consciously observing, you may begin to notice the part that's doing the observing.
<P>
Give yourself a period of time in which you won't be disturbed. Decide for that period of time to do nothing but observe. Sit or lie comfortably. Now, be still and be.
<P>
The mind will present &QUOT;good ideas&QUOT; to do something else. Don't do anything about them; just observe them. The feelings will want something more exciting to feel about. Don't fulfill them; observe them. The body will demand attention. Don't attend to it; just observe the demands.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>CHRISTOPHER ISHERWOOD</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


If you want to change positions, don't. Just observe the desire to change positions. If you have an itch, don't scratch it. Observe the itch. Your mind, body, and emotions may throw little--and sometimes not so little--temper tantrums. Observe the tantrums. Observe the inner kicking and screaming. These (or the fear of these) may be what has controlled you for some time. Gain authority over them. You gain authority by doing none of the actions they demand you do. Just sit and observe.
<P>
The game is this: The mind, body, and emotions say, &QUOT;I'm going to get you to move before the fifteen minutes (or whatever time you set for yourself) is over.&QUOT; You say, &QUOT;No, I'm not.&QUOT; And the game begins. You may say, &QUOT;Oh, it's easy not to move for fifteen minutes.&QUOT; Most games look easy from the sidelines. Play the game and see.
<P>
If it's easy, congratulations! If it's not, don't be surprised. The things that trouble you during this process are probably the same things that trouble you in life: the &QUOT;shoulds,&QUOT; &QUOT;musts,&QUOT; &QUOT;have-tos,&QUOT; and demands of your mind, body, and emotions.
<P>

The solution? Observation. Simply observe. You'll learn a lot about yourself. And, you'll learn a lot about the parts of yourself that aren't your self.
<P>
You can, if you like, extend the &QUOT;sitting observation&QUOT; to &QUOT;moving observation.&QUOT; As you move through life, observe it. Observe your reactions.
<P>
Observation is a primary tool of awareness. The more you observe what you're now unaware of, the more aware you become.
<P>
Behold: consciousness.

There is a saying that has found its way onto plaques, posters, buttons, bumper stickers, mugs, T-shirts, and balloons. Any idea with such universal appeal must have more than a modicum of truth. This saying does.
<P>
Be patient. God isn't finished with me yet.
<P>
Patience is our compassion for the distance between what we are now and what we know we can be.
<P>
Because we have such fertile imaginations, we can envision ourselves scaling mountains one moment and swimming oceans the next. To get from the mountaintop to the beach, however, takes a certain amount of time. If we're on the mountain and want to go to the ocean, that's fine. But if we strike against ourselves for not being at the ocean right now, we're being impatient.
<P>
Most people reading this book have already formed a mental image of what the &QUOT;perfect, healthy, positively focusing&QUOT; person &QUOT;should&QUOT; be. You may have formed such an image, and you also may have cast yourself as the star of the production. Great! (Or, in show-biz terminology: Bravo!) The only minor challenge, then, is how we get from where we are to where we want to be.
<P>
But if you're putting undue pressure on yourself to achieve these goals of perfection, health, and positivity--impatience has crept in.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>No thing great is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig. If you tell me that you desire a fig, I answer you that there must be time. Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then ripen.</I><P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Relax. Life is a lifelong journey. You'll never get out of it alive. You'll never be &QUOT;done.&QUOT; You're fine just as you are. You're not finished with yourself, and never will be. I've yet to meet a person who hasdeclared, &QUOT;I'm done!&QUOT; Humans have desires, dreams, and goals beyond their current reality, no matter how magnificent that reality might be. It's part of the human condition.
<P>
Realize, then, that the journey from here to there will never be completed. Such is life. Have compassion for the distance between where you are now and where you're going next. (Where you are now, remember, is the goal of a former moment in time.)
<P>
Patience is enjoying the journey. It's not climbing the mountain to get to the top; it's climbing the mountain to enjoy the climb. Enjoy the process of your life. The travel ads claim, &QUOT;Getting there is half the fun,&QUOT; and as Robert Townsend corrected: &QUOT;Getting there is <I>all</I> the fun.&QUOT;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Dear God, I pray for patience. And I want it right now!.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>OREN ARNOLD</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Besides, if you don't have fun while getting there, you probably won't have much fun when you arrive. Your joy muscles will have atrophied. You will have learned to postpone fun so well that you'll postpone it until your next destination. (&QUOT;I can't wait to go on vacation.&QUOT; &QUOT;I can't wait to get home.&QUOT;)
<P>
Another popular saying is &QUOT;Let go and let God.&QUOT; Letting go is relaxing. Letting God is being patient. Relax and be patient. What a great prescription for enjoying life.
<P>
When you learn patience with yourself, it's easy to extend it to others. When you learn patience with others, be sure to extend it to yourself.
<P>
Realize that, right now, everything is the way it &QUOT;should&QUOT; be, and when later comes, everything will be &QUOT;perfect&QUOT; then, too.
<P>
What is patience? Enjoying the moment. How does one enjoy the moment? By being patient. An endless loop? Sure. And you can jump in at any point.
<P>

<H2>Suicide</H2><H3>(an optional chapter)</H3>
<P>
In time, life takes care of death; we don't need to help it along. That's why this is an optional chapter. Still, a discussion of suicide can be useful--as much to point out its life-affirming aspects as its death-hastening ones.
<P>
We can consciously end our life almost any time we choose. This ability is an endowment--like laughing and blushing--given to no other animal. Although suicide gives us the power of personal destruction, it also provides the power of personal life affirmation.
<P>
In any given moment, by <I>not</I> exercising the option of suicide, we are <I>choosing</I> to live.
<P>
Many people have put suicide in a forbidden-under-any-circumstances category because they were taught to, not because it was thought through. Blind obedience to custom robs these people of the option to <I>choose</I> life. (I am not referring, of course, to those who have made a religious, spiritual, or philosophical decision based on extensive soul-searching, but to those who thoughtlessly accept this cultural taboo.)
<P>
As this is an optional chapter, please allow me to state my personal views on suicide. In so doing, I do not wish to challenge your views on the subject. Something as precious as our life must be an individual, personal, and carefully considered choice. I'm just chatting with you here, friend to friend.
<P>
First, I think suicide should never be used to escape the pain of loss. I have been through enough losses to know the feeling that life is no longer worth living; the anger, when I was certain only my death could adequately punish those who hurt me; and the hurt that made me believe: &QUOT;I can't take this one moment longer!&QUOT; And yet, I held in there--and I survived. Now I can't even remember the <I>names</I> ofsome of the people who had me contemplating suicide.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I don't think suicide is so terrible. Some rainy winter Sunday when there's a little boredom, you should always carry a gun. Not to shoot yourself, but to know exactly that you're always making a choice..</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>LINA WERTMULLER</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Since writing (with Drs. Colgrove and Bloomfield) <I>How to Survive the Loss of a Love</I> in 1976, I have received thousands of letters telling me of losses so tragic I cannot even comprehend the pain the people went through. Yet each of them survived, and each took the time to write a letter saying so, asking me to pass on the message that has been passed on from one survivor to another throughout history: you <I>will</I> survive.
<P>
I am reminded of the dialogue between Zorba and his young friend, a writer:
<P>
<B>ZORBA:</B> Why do the young die? Why does anybody die?
<P>
<B>WRITER:</B> I don't know.
<P>
<B>ZORBA:</B> What is the use of all your damn books, then? If they don't tell you that, what the hell do they tell you?
<P>
<B>WRITER:</B> They tell me of the agony of men who cannot answer questions like yours.
<P>
Often we don't know <I>why</I> a loss happens--especially when it happens to the young or innocent--but we can hold firm to the truth (often forgotten in times of loss) that we <I>will</I> survive.
<P>
Following a loss, <I>thoughts</I> of suicide are a <I>naturalpart</I> of the healing process. <I>Acting</I> on those thoughts, however, is never advisable, even when the losses cause inevitable and perhaps permanent changes in one's life--such as major financial loss or physical disability. Just because we won't have the <I>same</I> life as before is, in my estimation, no reason to end life.
<P>
When, then, would I consider suicide? When death is inevitable and the quality of life has become unbearable.
<P>
Please understand that, even at this point, I do not <I>recommend</I> suicide to others; I am simply saying this is the point at which I would <I>consider</I> it for myself. Whether I would do it or not I do not know.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Human life consists in mutual service.  No grief, pain, misfortune or "broken heart" is excuse for cutting off one's life while any power of service remains.  But when all usefulness is over, when oneis assured of an unavoidable and imminent death, it is the simplest of humanrights to choose a quick and easy death in place of a slow and horrible one.</I><P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Does considering suicide under these particular circumstances run counter to the message of this book? I think not. We all must die some time, and some of us will die from diseases. This is not a book promising (or even recommending) physical immortality. This is a book for those who may have found life painful at some point and created an intention to die, an intention that may now be manifesting in a life-threatening illness. Facing death in all its forms--including at one's own hand--can help us live more fully <I>now.</I> Living more fully now can help reverse an intention to die, and the method of death (the disease) can thus be reversed along with it.
<P>
Hearing that we have a life-threatening illness is a loss--even if we are quite certain we can overcome it. Overcoming takes work--work that we had not anticipated or planned for. Some of our best-laid <I>other</I> plans, then, will have to go <I>a-gley</I>.<I>A-gley</I> means, essentially, &quot;down the toilet.&quot; But merely <I>getting</I> the news of a life-threatening illness is no reason to go shopping for a tank of carbon monoxide.
<P>
In 1988, I was &quot;spiritually diagnosed&quot; by a charlatan named John-Roger as having not one but <I>two</I> life-threatening illnesses: tuberculosis <I>and</I> AIDS. Alas, at the time I believed John-Roger actually had some spiritual connection and could accurately predict such things. He gave me nine months to live. (Generous of him, huh?)
<P>
As it turns out, he was just manipulating me (using my belief in his spiritual sovereignty) into putting his name on books I was writing (such as an earlier edition of this book) and giving him all the money. He told me he would keep me alive and healthy as long as the books kept rolling out and the money kept rolling in (to him).

His diagnosis (thankfully false--I have neither tuberculosis nor AIDS) allowed me to see how I would react to hearing I had nine months to live. My reaction? I seriously considered committing suicide <I>that day.</I>
<P>
The diagnosis itself was a loss, and I was responding to the pain and fear of <I>that.</I> I had no symptoms, naturally, because I didn't even have the diseases. But I <I>thought</I> I did, and that thought produced a loss which I responded to with thoughts of suicide. I am glad I did not follow through on those thoughts. I see now it would have been a mistake.
<P>
Even if the diagnosis had come from a competent medical doctor--or series of them--I would still not consider that a reason to end my life. (Change it, certainly; end it, no.) As we'll explore later in the book, no diagnosis is foolproof, and predictions of &QUOT;time remaining&QUOT;--even from the most knowledgeable experts--are just &QUOT;best guesses&QUOT; based on statistical averages. They may or may not apply to you or me. Only time will tell.
<P>
Whatever <I>my</I> views on suicide are, however, I donot want to force them on someone else, nor do I want someone else's views enforced upon me-- especially by law.
<P>
Laws that prohibit the terminally ill from obtaining a peaceful, painless death are barbaric. That early death, of course, must <I>always</I> be the patient's choice--or the choice of someone designated by the patient (in writing and witnessed) to make that choice for the patient should he or she become mentally incapacitated. To force people to die slow, agonizing deaths when they are ready to die, willing to die, and wanting to die--but cannot do it themselves due to physical incapacity--is inhuman. And yet, that's the law in almost every state in this country.
<P>
Many people do not so much fear death as the <I>pain</I> of dying. If we choose to consider suicide an option, we know that the length and degree of our suffering will be--as it always has been--our personal choice.

The final lesson in my crash course on dying is ten suggestions on how to die. You can file these away until you need them.
<P><OL>
	<LI>Get things in order. Things you don't want people to see? Destroy them. Things you want people to have? Give them away. (&QUOT;Let the season of giving be yours and not that of your inheritors&QUOT;-- Gibran, The Prophet.) Pay debts. Make notes of what you've done. Make it easy for whomever you choose to take care of things after.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>If you don't go to other men's funerals they won't go to yours.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>CLARENCE DAY</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

	<LI>Make a will. Of things that weren't given away, decide who gets what. Put it in writing. Make it legal. Choose an executor. Do you want to be cremated or buried? Decide what kind of funeral--if any--you want. Bette Davis said, &QUOT;I don't want donations made to any charities in my name. I want lots and lots of flowers!&QUOT; If that's how you feel about it, say so. In writing. And don't forget to make out a &QUOT;living will&QUOT; if you don't want extraordinary medical measures used to prolong your life.
<P>
	<LI>Say good-bye. Good-byes don't all have to take place on your deathbed. You can say good-bye to people, and then see them every day for the next fifty years. Tell people what you would want them to know if you never saw them again. Give them the opportunity to do the same. Usually, it boils down to simply, &QUOT;I love you.&QUOT;
<P>
	<LI>Don't spend time with people you don't want to spend time with. When people hear someone is dying, they all want to make a pilgrimage. Many of these people you haven't seen in years and, if you lived another hundred years, would probably never see again. Say good-bye on the phone. Tell them you're just not up to a visit. You don't owe anyone anything.
<P>
	<LI>Spend time alone. Reflect on your life. Make peace with it. Come to terms with it. Forgive yourself for everything. Learn what you can from what's happened, and let the rest go. Mourn the loss of your life. Come to a place of understanding and acceptance. You may be surprised how quickly you get there.
<P>
	<LI>Enjoy yourself. Make a list of all the movies you want to see or see again. Rent them. Watch them. Read the books you never got around to. Listen to your favorite music.
<P>
	<LI>Relax. Sleep. Do nothing. Lie around. Recline. Goof off.
<P>
	<LI>Pray. Listen. It is said people are closest to God at birth and at death. If you missed God the first time around, catch the diety on the return. Whatever inspirational or spiritual beliefs you hold dear, hold them even closer. You are being held close, too.
<P>
	<LI>Enjoy each moment. Appreciate what is, here and now. That is where eternity is found. You may only have a few here-and-now moments, but it's a few more than most people will ever have.
<P>
	When it's time to go, go. Let go. Say one last good-bye and mean it. Say good-bye so completely that you'll never want to come back, you'll never even look back. All the good you take with you. The rest is good-bye and moving on.
<P>
Do most of these sound more like suggestions for living than for dying? That's because they are. The best way to die is to live each moment fully. Then, when the time for death comes--be it next week or fifty years from now--it's just another event in an already eventful life.</OL>
<P>

<H2>Choose by Doing</H2>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

It's time for you to make a choice. The choice I'm talking about is The Big Choice--to live or to die (&QUOT;To be or not to be&QUOT;).
<P>
The problem is, there's a Catch-22 in making that kind of choice.
<P>
If deep down inside you no longer want to continue living--for whatever reasons--consciously knowing this can help you avoid a great deal of confusion, torment, and anguish. If you've put yourself on a plane headed for Cleveland, there's no point complaining to yourself and others, &QUOT;I don't want to go to Cleveland.&QUOT;
<P>
If you have chosen to die, avoiding negative thinking is still important. Negative thinking contaminates &QUOT;the moment,&QUOT; and between now and your death, you might as well enjoy every moment.
<P>
The irony is that when people finally &QUOT;give up&QUOT; and do appreciate the moment, they often realize that life can be a wonderful place. They see it wasn't life itself, but their reaction to life that was causing the dis-ease.
<P>
Then they sometimes begin a negative-thinking pattern of &QUOT;I don't want to die after all,&QUOT; which, once again, pollutes the moment, which makes life less livable, so why live anyway, so I might as well die.
<P>
Other people, when asked, &QUOT;Do you want to live or die?&QUOT; say--at once and with great emotion--&QUOT;I want to live!&QUOT; These people may then spend so much time struggling against death that life becomes an agonizing battle, and some part of them again says, &QUOT;Why bother?&QUOT;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice; it is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Can you see, then, the Catch-22 involved in a once-and-for-all decision to live or to die?
<P>
The decision to live or to die is not one that can be made once, and that's that. It is to be made in each moment. And that decision is demonstrated by action.
<P>
If you are taking part in life-destroying activities, wallowing in misery, and indulging in negative thinking, then--no matter what you <I>say</I>--I'd say you were, in that moment, choosing to die.
<P>
If you are actively involved in life-enhancing activities and do them with a positive focus and enthusiasm,<I>enthusiasm</I> comes from the Greek en-theos, which means &QUOT;one [en] with God [theos]&QUOT; or &QUOT;inspired by God.&QUOT; I like to think of it as being &QUOT;one with the energy of the Divine.&QUOT;> I'd say in that moment you were choosing to live.
<P>
If you ask yourself in this moment, &QUOT;Do I want to live or die?&QUOT; I say, &QUOT;Look at what you're doing, feeling, and thinking for the answer.&QUOT;
<P>
Are you doing all you can for your health, happiness, and positive focus? And are you doing it with an attitude of, &QUOT;This will make me healthier, happier, and more positive,&QUOT; or are you moaning, &QUOT;If I don't do all this damn healthy stuff I'm gonna die and I don't want to die so I'll do it&QUOT;?
<P>
Take a frequent look at your thoughts, feelings, and activities. Set an alarm to go off at regular intervals--every hour, say. No matter what you're doing when the alarm goes off, stop and take an honest look at where you are and what you've been doing--mentally, emotionally, and physically--since the last alarm sounded.
<P>
If it's been life-supporting, joyful, and positive--congratulate yourself. If it hasn't you can &QUOT;course-correct.&QUOT; Commercial aircraft, flying over water, are off course 95 percent of the time. Nevertheless, they still get to where they're going. The onboard navigational system is continually making infinitesimal course corrections. You can get to your goals this way, too--even if you're &QUOT;off course&QUOT; the vast majority of the time.)
<P>
If your evaluation of the interval between alarms indicates some negativity--don't be surprised, don't get upset, just change it.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove lid again and that is well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one any more.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>MARK TWAIN</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Being negative about being negative is one of the slickest traps negativity has. It seems as though you're agreeing that negative thinking is bad--so bad, in fact, that it's worth getting upset about it whenever it happens. Then when you discover you've been feeling bad about feeling bad, you feel bad about that. And on and on--or should I say down and down?
<P>
Let it go. Forgive yourself. Make whatever corrections seem necessary. Move on. (I'll be giving specific techniques for all of these later.)
<P>
As Woody Guthrie once said, &QUOT;Take it easy, but take it.&QUOT;
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Commit to Life</H2>
<P>
No matter what you think your decision about living or dying is, commit to life.
<P>
By committing to life, I don't mean committing to live another so many years. (How many years &QUOT;should&QUOT; we live anyway?) I mean, commit to living each moment fully, productively, joyfully. Commit to health, wealth, and happiness--not as a distant dream, but as a here-and-now reality.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation) there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: That the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamed would have come his way. I have learned a deep respect for one of Goethe's couplets:  "Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.".</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>W. H. MURRAY <I>THE SCOTTISH HIMALAYAN EXPEDITION</I></FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

You may not know fully how to do that yet, but &QUOT;hows&QUOT; are just methods. When the commitment is clear, an intention rises from that commitment, and the methods appear.
<P>
Rather than tell yourself, &QUOT;I don't know how to fully live my life, so I can't commit,&QUOT; commit yourself to life and then set about discovering how to live.
<P>
All this can be summed up in one of my favorite phrases: &QUOT;The willingness to do creates the ability to do.&QUOT; Be willing to live your life fully. The ability, methods, behaviors, and opportunities to do this will appear.
<P>
Then <I>do</I> them!
<P>

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Live Your Life <I>Now</I></H2>
<P>
Don't put off living until you are &QUOT;better.&QUOT; That's probably just the latest in a series of perfect reasons why you haven't fully lived up until now. (&QUOT;I'll do it when I'm older.&QUOT; &QUOT;I'll do it when I've learned more.&QUOT; &QUOT;I'll do it when I have more money.&QUOT; &QUOT;I'll do it when I find my soul mate.&QUOT; &QUOT;I'll do it when I have the time.&QUOT; &QUOT;I'll do it when . . . &QUOT;)
<P>
Start doing what you've always wanted to do now. Start enjoying each moment (by finding something enjoyable in it) now.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Never put off till tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>MARK TWAIN</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

I'm not talking about executing every grand scheme your imagination has ever created. (&QUOT;I've always wanted to be Ruler of the World.&QUOT;) I'm talking about overcoming the tendency to say, &QUOT;When my life is better, then I'll be able to start focusing on positive things.&QUOT;
<P>
Start now.
<P>
We often form a habit of procrastination. Yes, we put off unpleasant activities, but we also tend to put off the enjoyable ones, too. We dole out pleasure, contentment, and happiness as though they were somehow rationed. The supply of these is limitless (as, by the way, is the supply of misery, pain, and suffering). We do the rationing ourselves.
<P>
If you look, you'll find all the perfect reasons why you shouldn't enjoy your life, why you should postpone enjoyment until certain things are different.
<P>
I say, the only thing that has to be different for you to enjoy your life is where you focus your attention. Look for all the positive things taking place in and around you right now. As you find them, naturally you'll feel more joyful.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap; the being a force of nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>GEORGE BERNARD SHAW</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

In life we have either reasons or results. If we don't have what we want (results), we usually have a long list of reasons why we don't have the results. We tend to rationalize (pronounced &QUOT;rational lies&QUOT;). All this is (a) a waste of energy and (b) a convincing argument that we can't have what we want, which becomes (c) another reason not to live.
<P>
I suggest that when you don't get what you want, rather than waste time and energy explaining why you don't have it, find another way to get it. If you can't find something positive about your environment, look again--with &QUOT;fresh eyes.&QUOT; Try another point of view. Be creative. What good are you taking for granted? If you can't find anything, hold your breath. Within a few minutes, you'll really appreciate breathing.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Strengthen Your Intention to Live</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>NORMAN COUSINS</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

The intention to live can be strengthened. You obviously have some intention to live, or you wouldn't be alive. (When people completely lose the intention to live, they fade very fast.)
<P>
Beyond that, you have gotten this far in a book that obviously affirms life. There is a self-selection process that takes place with personal-growth books: the people who aren't ready for them don't read them. Their intention not to grow is stronger than their intention to grow; therefore, the book is put down--literally and verbally--and not picked up again. So, since you've gotten this far in the book, I'd say your intention to live is rather strong.
<P>
The intention to live can be made stronger by a simple, but often uncomfortable, technique.
<P>
The technique is this--go to a mirror, look into your eyes, and say out loud, over and over: &QUOT;I want to live.&QUOT;
<P>
What generally happens is that the many thoughts, feelings, and attitudes that created the intention not to live begin to surface. You may feel awkward, scared, unworthy, foolish, stupid, embarrassed, angry, tearful, enraged, or depressed. These are not easy to feel. The tendency is to avoid them, to stop the process.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>NIETZSCHE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

I suggest you persevere. Behind all the fear, anger, unworthiness, and frustration is the natural intention to live--the love you feel for yourself and your life. When you connect with this love and affirm your intention to live, that intention becomes strengthened. Your will to live comes more alive.
<P>
You can do this process as often as you like, but start slowly. Set a timer and do it for, say, one minute. The next time, if one minute wasn't too bad, do it for two minutes. Then three. Then four.
<P>
Before you start, I suggest you ask a white light to surround, fill, and protect you, knowing only that which is for your highest good can take place while you do this process. (More on using the light later.)
<P>
Although uncomfortable at times, saying &QUOT;I want to live&QUOT; will give you not only a strengthened intention to live, but also a diagram of your negativity. Is it mostly angry or mostly fearful? How do you convince yourself you're not worth it? What feelings and thoughts make you want to run from life? This process will answer those questions in a short period of time.
<P>
The goal of the process is to strengthen your intention to live--not necessarily to live for a certain numbers of years, but to live life fully in each moment.
<P>
If you take good care of the moment, the years will take care of themselves.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>The Willingness to Change</H2>
<P>
&QUOT;The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it.&QUOT; Does that sound like some radical New Age thought to you? It wasn't even new when Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (121-180 A.D.) said it.
<P>
Conquering negative thinking may require some major changes, not just mental ones, but emotional and physical ones as well--what is generally known as your lifestyle. You may have to change your job, where you live, the city in which you live, friends, clothes, habits, all sorts of things. As the Koran (13:11) states, &QUOT;God changes not what is in a people, until they change what is in themselves.&QUOT;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>In spite of illness, in spite even of the archenemy sorrow, one can remain alive long past the usual date of disintegration if one is unafraid of change, insatiable in intellectual curiosity, interested in big things, and happy in small ways.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>EDITH WHARTON</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

If you want to get better, be willing to change, be open to change, welcome and invite positive changes into your life. Remember, &QUOT;There is nothing so permanent in life as change.&QUOT; More metaphysical psychobabble? Heraclitus said, &QUOT;Nothing endures but change,&QUOT; around 500 B.C.
<P>
If you're in a rut, if you've grown accustomed to tolerating intolerable situations, change may not be comfortable and change may not be easy. It takes courage to take an honest look at one's life, discover what's no longer working, and then change it. Mark Twain reminds us, &QUOT;Courage is mastery of fear--not absence of fear.&QUOT;
<P>
If you're faced with a life-threatening illness, you, frankly, have little choice. (I am assuming you have made the decision to live.)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Courage is the price that life exacts for granting peace. The soul that knows it not, knows no release From little things; Knows not the livid loneliness of fear, Nor mountain heights where bitter joy can hear The sound of wings.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>AMELIA EARHART</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

What you have right now in life is the result of what you thought, felt, and did up to this time. If you want things to be different, to be better, you will have to change what you think, feel, and do.
<P>
It's as simple as that. Simple, but not necessarily easy. Not necessarily easy, but necessary. As Anais Nin noted, &QUOT;Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage.&QUOT;
<P>
Take a good, honest look at your life. Decide which things, situations, and people you tend to think most negatively about. Get rid of them. Yes, that one. The one about which you thought, &QUOT;If I could only get rid of _____________, but I don't dare.&QUOT;
<P>
That one. Dare.
<P>
Throw it out, send them packing, walk away.
<P>
In other words, change.
<P>

Whatever you do, do it because you choose to do it, not from any misguided sense of duty, or obligation.
<P>
Sometimes people need to be pushed to the brink before they realize that this life belongs to them, not to the demands and desires of others. If you have a life-threatening illness, you're on that brink. If you learn that this is your life, you can more effectively take the necessary steps toward de-brinking yourself.
<P>
Try saying this out loud: &QUOT;I don't have to do anything.&QUOT; Say it a few times. Feel the sense of release, of freedom, of unburdening?
<P>
To this you can add: &QUOT;And what I choose to do, I can do.&QUOT;
<P>
Together they make a nice (and, perhaps, necessary) affirmation: &QUOT;I don't have to do anything, and what I choose to do, I can do.&QUOT;

Those things, people, situations, and experiences you don't like--avoid them. Stay away. Walk away. Do something else.
<P>
Some might call this cowardly. I call it smart. The world is brimming with things, people, and experiences. We will never experience all of them if we live to be 10,000. So why not associate with the ones that naturally please you?

Yes, in some situations you will really want C, and in order to have C you must pass through A and B. In those cases, keep your eye on C. Keep reminding yourself why you're messing with A and B. Tell yourself that soon you'll be at C, and that C will be worth it.
<P>
Some examples of what to avoid: parties you don't want to go to, people you don't want to see, TV shows you don't want to watch (but think you should), movies everybody else has seen but hold no appeal for you, and so on.
<P>
This idea goes contrary to the &QUOT;Confront It All&QUOT; attitude of some self-help books. These books claim you grow through confrontation.
<P>
Yes, this is true. Tribulation and confrontation are great teachers. There is, however, quite enough tribulation presented to you naturally. You don't have to seek it. It will seek you, and some of it will be unavoidable. That's the time to practice acceptance, patience, and forbearance.
<P>
But if you can avoid the unpleasantness in the first place, by all means do so.

<H2>Don't Worship the God of Other People's Opinion</H2>
<P>
Some people (let's face it: most people) do things they don't want to do (or don't do things they want to do) because they're afraid of what others might think or say about them.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Its name is Public Opinion. It is held in reverence. It settles everything. Some think it is the voice of God. Loyalty to petrified opinion never yet broke a chain or freed a human soul.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>MARK TWAIN</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

I call this &QUOT;worshiping the god of other people's opinion.&QUOT; The opinion of another becomes more important than our own wants, needs, and desires. As Charles Dudley Warner put it, &QUOT;Public opinion is stronger than the legislature, and nearly as strong as the Ten Commandments.&QUOT;
<P>
We sacrifice much to the Great God of Opinion--happiness, self-worth, freedom. And that opinion is often inaccurate. &QUOT;Truth is one forever absolute,&QUOT; wrote Wendell Phillips, &QUOT;but opinion is truth filtered through the moods, the blood, the disposition of the spectator.&QUOT;
<P>
If your faith in yourself is strong, the opinion of others (which, often, they got from the opinion of others, who got it from the opinion of still others) is not so influential. As Thoreau said, &QUOT;Public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own private opinion. What a man thinks of himself, that is what determines, or rather, indicates, his fate.&QUOT;
<P>
And Emerson:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Or, as George John Whyte-Melville stated more simply, &QUOT;In the choice of a horse and a wife, a man must please himself, ignoring the opinion and advice of friends.&QUOT;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>You may talk of the tyranny of Nero and Tiberius; but the real tyranny is the tyranny of your next-door neighbor. Public opinion is a permeating influence, and it exacts obedience to itself; it requires us to think other men's thoughts, to speak other men's words, to follow other men's habits.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>WALTER BAGEHOT</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Of course, if you live in the freedom of your own thoughts and desires, you must also give the same freedom to others. Learn to accept the behavior of others that doesn't fit <I>your</I> opinions. (Such as the opinion that other people shouldn't have opinions about you.)
<P>
When you find yourself disapproving of someone, examine your opinions. Explore your list of &QUOT;shoulds&QUOT; and &QUOT;shouldn'ts.&QUOT; See your opinion as merely opinion, not truth, and therefore not worth getting upset about.
<P>
Others' opinions of you and your opinions of others are the cause of a great deal of unnecessary negative thinking. (All negative thinking is unnecessary, but the guilt, fear, and resentment generated by opinions are particularly unnecessary.)
<P>
Learn, in fact, to relish the differences between people. Imagine how dull the world would be if we all thought, spoke, and acted the same. (Spend a summer in Maine sometime and see what I mean. On second thought, just take my word for it.)
<P>
&QUOT;It were not best that we should all think alike,&QUOT; Mark Twain tells us. &QUOT;It is difference of opinion that makes horse races.&QUOT;
<P>
Applaud freedom wherever it may appear. Learn to praise the idiosyncrasies, the eccentricities, the quirks, and the singularities of others.
<P>
It will help you to praise your own.
<P>

<H2>Take It Easy, but Take It</H2>
<P>
Going &QUOT;cold turkey&QUOT; on negative thoughts may be too much for some people. The nature of their thinking may be so negative that trying to stop all at once would leave them nothing to think about.
<P>
In such cases, replacing negative thoughts with a positive focus can be done more gradually, in two phases--first, taking the new steps and, second, maintaining the progress of the previously taken steps.
<P>
The following is not a definitive plan--it's more of a sample outline. You can modify the ideas here to suit your personal recovery program.
<P><OL>
	<LI>Start by simply noticing when you are thinking negatively. You don't have to do anything about it; just observe when it's going on. Rather than saying, &QUOT;I'm justifiably upset over what's happening,&QUOT; say, &QUOT;I'm really reacting negatively to this.&QUOT; Begin to notice that it's not what's happening but how you're reacting that's causing the problem.
<P>
	<LI>Pause before thinking negatively. When you notice yourself starting to get agitated, tell yourself, &QUOT;I'm going to wait two minutes before getting upset.&QUOT; Think about something else--something uplifting--for two minutes, then get flustered. Gradually work up to three minutes, then four, then five. Even if you start by putting just a few seconds between your automatic reaction and your postponed reaction, you are starting to take conscious control over the response. (It helps to have a prepared list of uplifting thoughts to focus on. Keep your &QUOT;book of good things&QUOT; close at hand.)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Perseverance is more prevailing than violence; and many things which cannot be overcome when they are together, yield themselves up when taken little by little.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>PLUTARCH<BR>
46-120 A.D.</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

	<LI>Declare &QUOT;negative-free zones&QUOT; throughout the day. Plan two-minute segments throughout the day in which you entertain not a single negative thought. For these moments, focus so intently on the positive that negative thoughts have no place to exist. Increase the duration and frequency of these positive periods.
<P>
	<LI>Pick minor areas you won't think negatively about anymore. Choose certain categories of thought you simply refuse to think negatively about. Start with areas that are not of critical importance to you. If you only occasionally get upset about, say, television commercials, tell yourself, &QUOT;No matter how dumb, stupid, boring, condescending, or misleading I find a television commercial, I will not get upset about it.&QUOT; Gradually expand your list until it includes all nonessential areas of your life. Make lists. If you find yourself thinking negatively about an area on your list, stop.
<P>
	<LI>Increase the duration of &QUOT;negative-free zones.&QUOT; Add a minute each day to your positive periods so that, eventually, you only have to think negatively a few times per day.
<P>
	<LI>Save negative thoughts for certain times in the day. Set aside, say, four periods of fifteen minutes each in which you will think only negatively. Postpone all negative thinking until one of these times. Make a list of what you have to think negatively about so you won't forget. Do not add to the agenda items from areas you decided not to think negatively about anymore. Those are off limits, even during &QUOT;the negative hour.&QUOT; If you don't get to everything on your list within one period, table it until your next meeting. Allow yourself one &QUOT;emergency session&QUOT; per day.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>THOREAU</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

	<LI>Add more central areas of your life to the &QUOT;verboten&QUOT; list. Decide you'll do no more negative thinking about, say, an important relationship; then extend the ban to all relationships. 
Gradually fold in business, money, health, death. Focus only on the positive aspects of these areas.
</OL><P>
Plan so that everything winds up on the &QUOT;think only positive&QUOT; list at the same time as the scheduled &QUOT;negative hours&QUOT; are reduced to zero.
<P>
Congratulations. You are now free of the addiction of negative thinking.
<P>
Will you still have negative thoughts? Sure. But, as time goes on, you'll catch yourself sooner and the periods of negative thinking will be shorter. Also, positive focusing will lessen the intensity of the negative periods. A situation that would have had you fuming for days now has you percolating for only an hour. Something that would have had you terrified for several hours now has you worried for only a few minutes.
<P>
&QUOT;I'm going to focus more and more on the positive aspects of life,&QUOT; is a life-long adventure.

<H2>Keep Track of Negative Thoughts</H2>

<FONT SIZE=-1>SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

If there's an area of negative thinking causing you trouble, keep track of it. Every time you have a negative thought in that area, make a tick mark on an index card reserved especially for that purpose.
<P>
At the end of the day you'll have a good idea how many times you thought negatively about that area. The number may surprise you. Sometimes seeing in black and white how much time we're wasting and harm we're doing to ourselves makes us realize enough is enough.
<P>
You can continue to keep a card a day on that area of thinking. It will chart your progress. You can look back over a month of cards and see how you're doing. It's a good feedback system. If the tick marks are increasing or staying about the same, maybe you need to do more to eliminate the negative thoughts. If the tick marks are decreasing (as they probably will be--simple awareness can be curative), congratulations are in order.
<P>
You can keep multiple cards if you like--one for each troublesome area of negative thinking.
<P>
Watching the number of tick marks decrease is a wonderful reminder that not only can you do it, but you've already done it. If you can do it in one area, you can do it in any area.
<P>

<H2>The Power of Partnership</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>One's friends are that part of the human race with which one can be human.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>GEORGE SANTAYANA</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Let's face it--taking dominion over our thought process (the mind is a wonderful servant, but a terrible master) is not only challenging but, well, unusual.
<P>
If a friend asks, &QUOT;What new?&QUOT; and you answer, &QUOT;Oh, I'm breaking my addiction to negative thinking so I can be more healthy, wealthy, and happy,&QUOT; you may be met by a blank stare and a &QUOT;Huh?&QUOT; (On the other hand, your friend may say, &QUOT;It's about time!&QUOT;)
<P>
When starting something that's both challenging and unusual, it helps to have support. We've already discussed how helpful a good therapist can be. Later we'll be taking a closer look at the value of groups.
<P>
Now I'd like to explore the power of partnerships. Find one or two or three people you can form a close alliance with, people who are moving in the direction of a more positive focus.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Each friend represents a world in us, a world possibly not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>ANAIS NIN</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Speak with these people at regular, agreed-upon intervals--daily, if possible. It's sometimes best if at least one partner is not part of your regular circle of family and friends. That way you can be totally candid without fear of anything being repeated, however unintentionally, and offending mutual acquaintances.
<P>
Don't gather too many positive-focusing partners--you're going for depth of relationship, not quantity. It is good, however, to have two or three just in case one decides to &QUOT;drop out.&QUOT; (The road to positivity is strewn with the abandoned vehicles of the faint-hearted.)
<P>
What do you talk about in your daily or thrice-weekly discussions? Why, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, of course. &QUOT;I'm so proud about . . . &QUOT; &QUOT;I really blew it when . . . &QUOT; &QUOT;I can't find a way out of this . . . &QUOT; &QUOT;I found it helpful to . . . &QUOT;
<P>
Chatter, laughter, swapping war stories, sharing secrets, giving and receiving support--all done in an atmosphere of nonjudgment, unconditional caring, and the knowledge that &QUOT;we may not have come here on the same ship, but we're all in the same boat.&QUOT;
<P>
Two important points:
<P>
One, talk to each of your partners at least three times a week. This gives a sense of continuity, of flow. You can discuss the details of life that are often forgotten in less-frequent talks.
<P>
Two, keep your agreements with each other. If you say, &QUOT;Tuesday at four,&QUOT; mean it. Keep it. Honoring your commitment creates a foundation of trust on which the partnership can build.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Burn 'Em</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Necessary, forever necessary, to burn out false shames  and smelt the heaviest ore of the body into purity.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>D. H. LAWRENCE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

If one area of thought seems to be troubling you more than others, here's a good technique for lessening the power the thoughts have over you.
<P>
Get a clean sheet of paper and write down everything terrible about the situation. No one else will read it, not even you, so be as candid as you can. Don't worry about grammar or spelling or penmanship.
<P>
Include all the loaded words you can find. Get really negative. Add invectives, insults, profanity, abuses, railings, billingsgates, contumelies, obloquies, revilements, scurrilities, vituperations, curses, oaths, epithets, blasphemies, expletives, and swearwords. (Aren't thesauruses wonderful?) Get it all out of you and onto the paper.
<P>
Then burn it.
<P>
Don't reread it. Don't make a copy for your files (no matter how eloquently you expressed your wrath). Just burn it.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes "Awww!".</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>JACK KEROUAC</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

I hope I don't have to drag out Smokey the Bear or Sparkey the Fire Dog to tell you how to do this safely. Over the toilet bowl is a good place. You might want to hold the paper with a pair of tongs from the kitchen. (&QUOT;Tina! Bring me my tongs!&QUOT;) After the ashes drop in the toilet, you have the extra satisfaction of flushing it.
<P>
If burning is not possible, tearing the paper into little pieces works just as well. If you can't write, dictate into a tape recorder whatever's bothering you and destroy or erase the tape.
<P>
This process does two things--it gets the negative thoughts outside of and away from you. Then it destroys them.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The fountain of content must spring up in the mind; and he who has so little knowledge of human nature as to see his happiness by changing anything but his own disposition, will waste his life in fruitless efforts, and multiply the griefs which he proposes to remove.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>SAMUEL JOHNSON</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

A variation on this is to get a package of cigarette papers. Each time a negative thought appears from your &QUOT;trouble area,&QUOT; write it on the cigarette paper and burn it over a large ash tray. It's a good idea to use tweezers or tongs to hold the paper--cigarette paper burns quickly, and you've already been burned enough by your negative thoughts.
<P>
To save matches, have a candle burning. Let the flame represent the light of who you are, eliminating the darkness of your addiction.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Activities That Contribute to Negative Thinking</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I'm glad I don't have to explain to a man from Mars why each day I set fire to dozens of little pieces of paper, and then put them in my mouth.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>MIGNON MCLAUGHLIN</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Anything you abuse or overindulge in contributes to your negative thinking. Overindulgence reaffirms unworthiness. It is a physical affirmation: &QUOT;I'm not worthy to control my life.&QUOT;
<P>
I don't have to tell you what those activities are for you. You know. They're the ones about which you've said, &QUOT;I know this is a bad habit, but . . . &QUOT; and &QUOT;I wish I didn't do this, but . . . &QUOT; and &QUOT;I know this isn't good for me, but . . . .&QUOT;
<P>
It's time to get off your buts.
<P>
I'll list some of the popular abuses. Yours may or may not be among them, but you'll get the idea. The idea? Stop it. Knock it off. It may be killing you. That's the negative way of putting it.
<P>
The positive way? You have authority and dominion over your life. You have the power, the right and, yes, the obligation to do only those things you know to be uplifting and life-enhancing. You are stronger than anything that gets in the way of your achieving this goal.
<P>
<B><I>Smoking.</I></B> Every smoker knows the multiple health dangers associated with smoking. To continue smoking, then, is an ongoing affirmation of illness. Every time smokers light up, the message they're giving themselves is, &QUOT;I'm not worthy of health. I'm not able to control my hands, much less myself.&QUOT; By the very action of lighting up, smokers admit tobacco is a more powerful influence on their lives than they themselves are. This admission may do more harm than the physiological effects of the smoke. Stopping smoking is easy. You simply never put a lit cigarette in your mouth ever again. Period. It's getting to that point that's difficult.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Tell him to live by yes and no-- yes to everything good, no to everything bad.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>WILLIAM JAMES</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<B><I>Drug and alcohol abuse.</I></B> If you automatically turn to drugs and/or alcohol in times of trouble, or if you find using them negatively affects your work, your relationships, or your general well-being, you're abusing them. The physiological effects of drug and alcohol abuse make it difficult for the abuser to hold positive thoughts. The residual toxicity of the chemicals in the body makes toxic thinking easy. This is why drug and alcohol dependence often needs dramatic, outside support--joining Alcoholics Anonymous or checking into a treatment hospital such as the Betty Ford Clinic. The cure, however, is easier than solving the primary problem--to admit that there's a problem in the first place.
<P>
<B><I>Hanging out with negative people.</I></B> Negative thinking is one of the most contagious diseases around. As George Herbert pointed out in 1651, &QUOT;He that lies with the dogs, riseth with fleas.&QUOT; If youspend time with negative people, sooner or later you'll be thinking negative thoughts. To support their own weaknesses, people often gravitate toward similar people. &QUOT;But everyone I know ____________.&QUOT; You can fill in the blank with the addictive behavior of your choice. &QUOT;We can't all be wrong!&QUOT; Every lemming thinks that about all the other lemmings as they head for the cliff. As you change your thinking, you may have to change some of your &QUOT;friends.&QUOT; I put <I>friends</I> in quotes because the severe way some negative people criticize the positive movement of those around them I would hardly call friendly. And, by &QUOT;changing friends&QUOT; I mean finding new ones, not changing the thinking of the ones you have. If they want to change their thinking, they will. Give them a copy of this book. If they're ready, they'll act on it. If they're not, they probably won't even read it. So let it go. Changing your own thinking is a full-time occupation.
<P>
<B><I>Compulsive sex.</I></B> Some people seek sexual highs the same way drug and alcohol abusers seek chemical highs. Just because sex is &QUOT;natural&QUOT; (non-chemical) doesn't mean it can't be abused. It can. What you do sexually is not the issue. Why you do it is. Is it an expression of love for another, or is it a way of avoiding some inner feeling--loneliness, for example? Compulsive sex, like any lust, carries the message: &QUOT;I'm not enough as I am. I need something or someone out there to make me happy. Without that, I'm worthless.&QUOT;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>A great many people have asked how I manage to get so much work done and still keep looking so dissipated.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>ROBERT BENCHLEY</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<B><I>Workaholism.</I></B> Is your work an expression of who you are, or is it the only place in your life you feel &QUOT;in control&QUOT;? People who work too much often do so from a desperate need to prove they are worthy. &QUOT;I've done all this--see? I am worthy.&QUOT; The problem is, no accomplishment is ever good enough for these people. As one goal is about to be reached, a new, more difficult goal replaces it. The real problem, however, is that they never believe they are worthwhile <I>just as they are.</I> Worthiness is; it doesn't have to be earned or proven. If your work is your play and also your personal expression of life, then spending long hours at it is fine. So many people, however, hide from themselves in work that the term <I>workaholic</I> isnow part of the language.
<P>
<B><I>Complacency.</I></B> Chronic inaction in areas you know need attention can be an addiction. Some people become habitually lethargic. Not taking an action becomes an automatic response. This stems from the belief, &QUOT;I can't do it.&QUOT; Not doing anything &QUOT;proves&QUOT; the belief to be true, thereby strengthening the response that's there's no reason to respond. The habit of complacency is solved through action--physically moving and doing something. If the habit is strong, it may feel at first as though you're moving through Jell-O--every motion in every direction seems to have something pulling against it. That's the habit. You're stronger than it is. Keep moving. Set yourself a reasonable task and complete it. Then another. Then another. Show yourself you can do it, because you can.

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The more serious the illness, the more important it is for you to fight back, mobilizing all your resources--spiritual, emotional, intellectual, physical.</I><P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<H2>If One Has Done It, You Can Be Two. If None Has Done It, You Can Be One.</H2>
<P>
Whatever your disease, there are statistical tables telling you your odds of surviving the illness. Remember, however, you are a human being, not a statistic. The tables give statistical averages, not facts about your life.
<P>
The insurance industry's life-expectancy tables are an example of this. No matter what your age, they will tell you--to the month--when you will die. Of course, they can do nothing of the kind. But statistically, they're accurate.
<P>
The absurdity of relying on statistics is reflected in the insurance salesperson who was looking up the life expectancy of an elderly client. The salesperson looked and looked and finally said, &QUOT;I'm sorry. I can't sell you insurance. You're already dead.&QUOT;
<P>
Let's say you have a disease with a very low rate of survivability--ninety-five percent of all people who have your disease die within a certain length of time. Don't look at the percentage and say, &QUOT;Oh, ninety-five percent of the people who have this die. Of course, I'm one of the ninety-five percent.&QUOT; Ninety-five percent of the people hearing that information would say just that. It's probably what makes them part of the ninety-five percent.
<P>
Tell yourself instead, &QUOT;Five percent make it. Great. I'm in that five percent.&QUOT;
<P>
Five percent may seem like a small number, but when you multiply it times the number of people who have ever had that particular disease, it's usually a large number of people.

If the disease affects, say, 10,000 people each year, that means, statistically, 500 people will makeit. You might find it hard to think of yourself as being part of five percent, but being one of 500--that's easier. After all, you only have to be one of those 500. And there's room for 499 others as well.
<P>
Even if only one other person survived the life-threatening illness currently visiting you, you can be number two. And if no one else survived it, you can be the first. You've probably always wanted to be first at something. Here's your chance.

What your doctors want is your recovery. Give your doctors what they want. Get well.
<P>
While doing that, follow your doctors' orders to the letter. (If you're rebellious, just think of &QUOT;orders&QUOT; as &QUOT;kindly suggestions.&QUOT; If you're competitive, think of them as &QUOT;challenges.&QUOT;) Take the pills, avoid the foods, do the exercises, take the rest, practice the therapy, be cooperative.
<P>
Follow your doctors' advice as though it were an affirmation. Do everything he or she asks, no matter what. If you want to make a change in treatment, ask if it's okay. If the doctor says no, don't make the change. If you're not happy with the care you're getting, change doctors.
<P>
Ask your doctor what each pill and procedure isfor. As you take the pill or take part in the procedure, tell yourself, &QUOT;This pill will heal my ___________.&QUOT; &QUOT;This exercise will strengthen my ___________.&QUOT; Don't just blindly take pills. Add your energy to each pill, such that--even if it were only a sugar pill--it would still do the intended job.
<P>
Following your doctor's orders, to the letter, is a discipline. Doing it with a will to be well will make you well.

A book popular about twenty-five years ago was called Psychotherapy: The Purchase of Friendship. That's about the best definition of therapy I've heard.
<P>
Consider all the things you classically think a friend to be. (Coleridge: &QUOT;Flowers are lovely; love is flower-like; Friendship is a sheltering tree.&QUOT;) As with all things rare, true friendship can be hard to find.
<P>
However, the qualities of a willing ear, enduring patience, sound advice, and the knowledge that &QUOT;someone's in your corner&QUOT; can be found in a good therapist.

If you have a life-threatening illness, you may find it invaluable to have someone you can just be yourself with, someone with whom you can openly discuss your fears and concerns (especially the ones you're afraid might frighten and concern your friends and loved ones), someone you can trust.
<P>
Such a relationship can be a lifesaver.
<P>
Whether you have a life-threatening illness or not, the goal of conquering a habit of negative thinking (or any other bad habit) can use the support, compassion, and guidance of a qualified therapist.
<P>
Select a therapist with care. Shop around. Just because a person is &QUOT;a therapist&QUOT; doesn't necessarily mean he or she can help you. Not all therapists are right for all people. Have initial sessions with several. Choose the one you feel most comfortable with, a natural empathy for, and, above all, one you can trust.
<P>
In working with a therapist, be honest about everything--including how you feel about the therapist. You can con and make nice and play games and spare the feelings and try to win the approval of everyone else in your life, but with your therapist, just be you. Don't pretend, cover up, or conceal. Give yourself the freedom to feel, think, and express whatever happens to be there.

<H2>Consider Alternative Therapies</H2>

In addition to the cornucopia of treatments offered by the &QUOT;established&QUOT; medical community, there is a vast body of healers, chiropractors, nutritionists, massage therapists, herbologists, naturopaths, body workers, acupuncturists, prayer therapists (and on and on) available to you.
<P>
Once all the medical doctors' advice has been followed, you will probably find time in the day to explore &QUOT;the other side.&QUOT;
<P>
As you do, keep this in mind: the traditional medical establishment and the alternative practitioners do not, for the most part, see eye to eye. At some places along the borders of their disciplines is an uneasy truce; at other points, open warfare. If you choose to go from one camp to another in search of health, know that you will from time to time be in no-man's-land.
<P>
Both sides may take potshots, at best, and mount major attacks, at worst, on your dalliance with &QUOT;those other people.&QUOT;
<P>
The attitude of the alternative practitioner might be, &QUOT;Don't take that poison [your prescription medications] your doctor gives you. That's what's killing you. Stop it at once!&QUOT;
<P>
The attitude of the established medical doctor is sometimes more benign--he or she has, after all, won the battle of who's best with the vast majority of the public and can afford to be magnanimous. The established doctor may dismiss the entire field of alternative healing with a comment such as, &QUOT;It's a complete waste of your time and money.&QUOT;
<P>
I have found enormous value in each camp. When ill, I wouldn't dream of being without lavish attention from both. Some illnesses, traditional medical science can cure with a bottle of pills. I take the pills. Other illnesses have traditional medical science stumped, but for the natural healer, they are no problem. In those cases, I visit the alternative practitioner.
<P>

In some treatments the lines between traditional and alternative begin to blur. Traditional medicine begins incorporating alternative medicine, and alternative medicine begins including the traditional. Acupuncture, for example, oncepooh-poohed by the traditionalists, is now used and accepted by more and more doctors. Dietary changes--once thought to have no significant effect on one's health as long as one was getting the daily minimum allotment of nutrients--are now, with many illnesses, standard medical advice.
<P>
More and more M.D.s are using alternative medicine in their practices, and more and more natural healers are saying, &QUOT;A good shot of penicillin will clear this up faster than anything else,&QUOT; or &QUOT;Have you tried aspirin?&QUOT;
<P>
I applaud this &QUOT;meeting of the minds.&QUOT; It may be some time before there is One Medicine. The day, frankly, may never come. Even if it never comes, use what works for you from either world and incorporate it all in your plan for wellness.
<P>
Don't be duplicitous: let each health-care provider--traditional or alternative--know what you're doing with the others. Some may throw up their hands and shriek, others may shake their heads in disapproval, but let each know you plan to continue. &QUOT;What can you do for me in addition to this?&QUOT; is what you want to know. If they say, &QUOT;Nothing,&QUOT; move on. There are plenty of healers on both sides who are flexible enough to augment.

<H2>Take Good Care of Yourself</H2>
<P>
This may seem redundant--not of what was in the book before, but of what you were taught as a child.
<P>
I will list certain common-sense guidelines for taking care of yourself--and particularly your body. Most medical types will assume you're doing these things already. Maybe you are; maybe you're not. I won't go into much detail. A part of you will say, &QUOT;I know what you mean.&QUOT; Compare that inner knowledge with what you are doing and, if necessary, change your lifestyle.
<P>
Get sufficient rest. How much sleep do you need? Go to sleep. When you wake up, that was enough. When you get tired again, go back to sleep. Use earplugs if noises bother you, a sleeping mask if light is troublesome.
<P>
Take vitamins. You may need more vitamins than you are getting. Check with your health care practitioners about which ones you need. Minerals, too. And maybe other nifty supplements they can recommend.
<P>
Eat sensibly. Remember the Four Basic Food Groups? Eat some of each every day. Especially fruits and raw vegetables, the food group most Americans omit from their diet. But eating only raw vegetables is not the answer, either. Take the time to enjoy eating your food so that (a) it's fun, and (b) it's properly assimilated.
<P>
Avoid fad diets. What's wonderful in Asia may not work here. Listen to your body. It will tell you what it needs. Learn to distinguish between wants and needs.
<P>
Get some exercise. Because this book will find its way to people in all sorts of conditions, I'm not going to give any specifics. Check with your doctor.
<P>
Get massaged. Okay, so maybe you didn't learn this as a child, but it's one that may awaken the child within you. Massage releases tensions, frees energy, removes physical blocks, and--perhaps most important of all--feels good. Indulge yourself. Often. You deserve it.
<P>
Take hot baths. In this rush-rush, stand-up world, most people take showers. They're faster. More efficient. Some people haven't been in a hot bath for years. Too bad. They don't know what they're missing. Soaking in hot water, even for a few minutes, relaxes the body and soothes the mind faster than almost anything I know. So take a hot bath every day--whether you need it or not. And more often if you do.

<H2>Altitude and Attitude</H2>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Another endless loop (I like to think of them as upward spirals) is the one of altitude and attitude. When &QUOT;stuck&QUOT; in something you don't like, you can either change the altitude or the attitude and, as Peter Pan would say, &QUOT;U-u-u-u-up you'll go!&QUOT;
<P>
Altitude is our viewing point, our perspective. The higher our viewing point, the more we can see. The more we can see, the more information we have. The more information we have, the better we can make well-informed decisions.
<P>
When the question arises, &QUOT;Shall I think negatively about this moment or not?&QUOT; I maintain that, with enough altitude, your spontaneous response will be &QUOT;not.&QUOT;
<P>
Have you ever been in a situation that seemed awful at the time, but eventually led to something wonderful? If you knew, at the time, that the bad situation would eventually lead to a much better one, would you have wasted all that energy feeling bad about it? Probably not.
<P>
What if all situations in life were like that? What if there were a reason behind all movement, a plan behind the action? What if, with sufficient altitude, you could see the plan? Not necessarily the way in which every detail will come to pass--what a dull life it would be if we knew precisely what the future held--but more a general sense that &QUOT;something good will come from this.&QUOT;
<P>
Attitude is the way we approach things--our point of view. Do you look at life as an adventure to be enjoyed, or a problem to be solved? There are infinite possibilities for living in either Adventureland or Problemville. The choice, as I've pointed out numerous times, is yours. The key is attitude.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>It is possible that our race may be an accident, in a meaningless universe, living its brief life uncared for, on this dark, cooling star: but evenso--and allthe more--what marvelous creatures we are! What fairy story, what tale from the Arabian Nights of the Jinns, is a hundredth part as wonderful as this true fairystory of simians! It is so much more heartening, too, than the tales we invent.A universe capable of giving birth to many such accidents is--blind ornot--a good world to live in, a promising universe. We once thought we lived on God's footstool; it may bea throne.</I><P>

The connection between attitude and altitude is easy to see. If we have a good attitude, our altitude will lift, and if we have an elevated altitude, our attitude will rise. (The reverse, by the way, is also true--spirals go up or down, and seem to be infinite in either direction.)
<P>
Altitude is raised through meditation, contemplation, prayer, spiritual exercises, creativity, service--connecting directly in some way with the uplifting energy of life.
<P>
Attitude lifts through inspiring lectures, reading, seminars, therapy, support groups, books, movies, TV shows--learning concepts and techniques that naturally lead to an enlightened view.
<P>
If you lift the attitude, the altitude will lift. If you raise the altitude, the attitude will lift. Either way, comme tu veux (it's up to you).
<P>
Of course, doing things to lift both attitude and altitude will put you on what is technically known as an upward hyper-spiral, or, as it's more commonly known, joy.

I've dropped God's name quite a few times in these last few chapters. Maybe it's time to talk directly about the Deity.
<P>
I'm going to suggest you reach for God in two ways.
<P>
First, whatever your concept of God currently is, reach a little higher. Whatever you believe or perceive God to be is fine with me--from the bearded, omnipotent Father on the throne to the creative flowering of Mother Nature. Whatever it is, see if you can expand it just a little bit more.
<P>
Second, reach for God in whatever form you feel God to be. If God is the power that grows plants and moves planets, fine. If God is the creator behind all that, fine. If God is the part of us that beats our heart and breathes our breath, fine. Reach into that power, energy, and spirit for support, solace, direction, and love.
<P>
Relate to God in whatever way you choose, but do relate. Chat, ask for things, listen for guidance, give love, receive joy, or just say &QUOT;thanks.&QUOT;
<P>
Give it a try. You have nothing to lose but your doubt. The following thoughts on God may stir a few of your own.
<P>
Serve God, that He may do the like for you.--The Teaching for Merikare (2135-2040 B.C.)
<P>
What is God? Everything.--Pindar (518-438 B.C.)
<P>
Beauty is the gift of God.--Aristotle
<P>
Even God lends a hand to honest boldness.--Menander (342-292 B.C.)
<P>
I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse.--Charles V
<P>
When God wounds from on high he will follow with the remedy.--Fernando de Rojas

I treated him, God cured him.--Ambroise Par (1517-1590)
<P>
God is usually on the side of the big squadrons and against the small ones.--Roger de Bussy-Rabutin
<P>
Belief is a wise wager. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager then, without hesitation, that He exists.--Blaise Pascal (1623-1662)
<P>
If God were not a necessary Being of Himself, He might almost seem to be made for the use and benefit of men.--John Tillotson (1630-1694)

Ready for a pop quiz? Okay. Consider this statement: &QUOT;If something is too good to be true, it is.&QUOT;
<P>
Pop quiz question: What words will follow &QUOT;it is&QUOT;?
<P>
(a) &QUOT;too good&QUOT; (If something is too good to be true, it is therefore not true.)
<P>
(b) &QUOT;true&QUOT; (If something is too good to be true, it is true.)
<P>
BZZZZZZZ. Time's up.
<P>
The correct answer is (b): if something is too good to be true, it is true. The answer most people spontaneously arrive at, however, is (a).
<P>
LESSON: Negative thoughts lead to negative assumptions.
<P>
SCORING: Give yourself 50 points if you chose answer (a). Give yourself 50 points if you chose answer (b). Give yourself 100 points for taking the test.
<P>
GRADING: If you got more than 20 points, congratulations! You get an A. Give yourself a gold star. Excellent work. Superb. Bravo. Hurrah! Good for you.
<P>
That's the pop quiz. How did you do?
<P>
Too good to be true?
<P>
It is.

If we have a life-threatening illness, sometimes the very sound of the name--or the condensed version of the name (CA for cancer, MS for multiple sclerosis, etc.)--can strike fear into our hearts.
<P>
So, change the meaning of the abbreviations. They're just letters. Assign other words to them, uplifting words. Then, whenever you hear people say the letters, you can smile. To them it means one thing; to you it means something else.
<P>
CA can be Creating Always, or Carefree and Alive, or Caring for All.
<P>
MS could be Mighty Spiritual, or Making Success, or Mirthful Snuggle.
<P>
AIDS might become And I'm Doing Swell, or Always I'm Dancing and Singing, or Another Interesting Day in Spirit.
<P>
You can also invent acronyms for treatments you don't like; shots, for example. Sure Helps Overcome The Symptoms or Sure Heals Over The Seasons.
<P>
You can do it with any words or abbreviations you don't like. They're just letters. Letters can represent anything you want. Might as well let them represent something uplifting.

<H2>Visualization</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Without this playing with fantasy no creative work has ever yet come to birth. The debt we owe to the play of imagination is incalculable.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>CARL JUNG</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>



Creative visualization is holding an image of the direction we want to go, of what we want to achieve, of the things and people we want to be with, and of what we want to become.
<P>
Visualization is something we all do all the time anyway--we are always visualizing, either positively or negatively.
<P>
If I were to ask you to draw a square, a triangle, and a circle, you would probably be able to do that without &QUOT;thinking&QUOT; too much about it. You'd have an almost immediate image of each of those shapes. That image would come from visualization.
<P>
The use of the term visual in visualization is, perhaps, misleading. Yes, some people see clear, Technicolor images, but others have more a sense (a feeling) of what they're &QUOT;visualizing,&QUOT; while for others, &QUOT;visualization&QUOT; is process of hearing. Visualization can take place through any one or any combination of the five senses.
<P>
Perhaps a better word might be imagine--to put an image of something in to your awareness. Either word is fine. I'll use visualization because that's the term that has generally come to describe using the mind and emotions as tools for consciously creating a positive reality.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>His imagination resembled the wings of an ostrich. It enabled him to run, though not to soar.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>LORD MACAULAY<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


I say &QUOT;consciously&QUOT; because we unconsciously use visualization to create our lives. Almost everything we've done, we probably &QUOT;thought about it&QUOT; before we did it; that &QUOT;thinking about it&QUOT; included visualization. We project ahead in our imagination, imagine what the situation will be like, imagine the way we would like it, and imagine all the things that might go wrong.
<P>
Therein lies the rub. Many people create their own negative reality through negative visualization. I've quoted a couple of times the saying, &QUOT;What you fear may come upon you.&QUOT; Negative visualization is the process by which it comes about. We worry so much about something that we create an image of failure, terror, rejection, and destitution. Then we set about to fulfill our vision.
<P>
This process is not a total waste of energy--we do, after all, get to be &QUOT;right.&QUOT; &QUOT;I knew it!&QUOT; we think. &QUOT;That wasn't worry; that was accurate perception.&QUOT; The reality seldom turns out as bad as we imagined. We're relieved, then, when the other shoe finally drops and we discover catastrophe is merely disaster.
<P>
As Henry Ford said, &QUOT;If you think you can do a thing or think you can't do a thing, you're right.&QUOT;
<P>
I, naturally, am suggesting you use this powerful tool of the imagination for your upliftment, healing, and joy; that you use it as yet another method of getting what you really want and, of course, not hurting anyone else in the process.
<P>
Positive visualization accomplishes the positive in the same way that negative thinking achieves the negative. It helps us &QUOT;preview&QUOT; goals, makes us comfortable with the reality we're creating, and lets us know when to say yes and when to say no as opportunities arise. (The ones that fulfill our vision, we follow; the ones that run counter to our vision, we let pass.) And, somehow, our thoughts seem to attract to us the realities our imagination creates.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The imagination may be compared to Adam's dream-- he awoke and found it truth.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>KEATS</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


For the balance of the book, when I use the word visualization, I'll be referring to positive visualization. I just wanted you to know that all thinking incorporates visualization and that all visualization tends to manifest itself in physical reality.
<P>
How do you visualize? What senses do you personally use? What's it like? It's easy to find out. Think of the Eiffel Tower. Now think of the Statue of Liberty. Now think of a lemon. Now think of a rose. What color is the rose? If it's red, make it yellow; if it's yellow, make it red. Think of a lake. Think of a glass of water. What does your bathroom look like? What color is your car?
<P>
However you got those images, that's how you visualize.
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


One essential point about visualization: Never lose in your imagination. It is your imagination; you can have everything precisely the way you want. Have it that way. When visualizing, you're not limited to any physical reality. You can fly. You can be always joyful. You can be perfectly healthy. You can be loved. You can be loving.
<P>
So be it.
<P>

<H2>Resentment</H2>
<P>
Resentment is a miserable game we play with ourselves and others. It's the price we pay for not taking an honest, compassionate, realistic, forgiving look at other people's reality. It's a game of make-believe with bitter consequences.
<P>
Resentment is anger directed at others. We get angry with others for something they should have done or shouldn't have done. It accumulates over time. Our punishment becomes worse with each repeated occurrence. (&QUOT;They should have known better!&QUOT;)
<P>
Fear steps in. We become afraid of situations in which people might fail to live up to our personal expectations. We're afraid of what we might do to others if they fail again. We're afraid of our own anger.
<P>
We avoid new people, situations, activities. We settle into a predictable rut, and then feel resentful because we aren't doing more for ourselves. Some people become immobilized with resentment, afraid of doing anything lest they let others disappoint and anger them again.

This cycle of negative energy--from ourselves to others--can have devastating effects. It poisons relationships, inhibits growth, stifles expansion. And it hurts. It can become hatred. It puts enormous stress on the mind, emotions, and body.
<P>
Over time, it can kill.
<P>
Perhaps the most tragic part about resentment is that it is thoroughly unnecessary.
<P>
Sound familiar? No, you weren't having an attack of deja vu. What I just said about resentment is the same thing I said about guilt a few pages ago.
<P>
Resentment and guilt are the same. With guilt, we don't live up to the images we have about how we should be; with resentment, other people don't live up to our images about how they should be.
<P>
The images are ours. The anger is ours. We're judge, jury, and executioner. With guilt, the judgment goes against us. With resentment, the judgment goes against others. (All that I'm about to say about resenting people is true of things, too--cars, VCRs, weather, nature, food, TV commercials. For the sake of clarity, I'll just talk about people. Please add &QUOT;and things&QUOT; at key points.)
<P>
When we resent others, we are protecting our image of how they should behave. Based on results, the image is false. But we protect the image because, after all, it's easier to keep our image and resent people for not measuring up than it is for us to change our image.
<P>
We have a lot invested in our image of how others should behave. We inherited the basic plan from our parents and teachers. Then we spent years refining it. Why should we change our shoulds, musts, and have-tos just because some inconsiderate people are too lazy to measure up?
<P>
The problem is, of course, the anger. Almost invariably, it does more harm to us than to the people we're mad at. Earlier I quoted, &QUOT;The love I give you is secondhand--I feel it first.&QUOT; The same is true of hate. From a cardiovascular point of view, the most dangerous and damaging emotion is anger. It's one of the most unpleasant emotions, too.
<P>
The solution? Once again, the six magic words-- change the image or the action. Except with resentment it's shortened to three--change the image.
<P>
With anger at ourselves (guilt), we have an option. We have, after all, the right to change our actions if we so choose. We do not, however, have the right to change anyone else's actions. We, therefore, have only one solution--change the image.
<P>
There are two situations in which you have the right to change another's actions--when you're the parent of a young child or when you're the boss. In those situations, you may have not only the right, but the obligation to change the child's or the employee's behavior. You will most likely find, however, that if you change your image of how people should be behaving before attempting to change their behavior, you will get better results and feel better in the process.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>It is easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>ALFRED ADLER</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

With resentment, always change the image, and only if you're a parent or the boss do you even consider changing the action.
<P>
To eliminate resentment, add, &QUOT;...and sometimes they're not&QUOT; to all the images you have about other people. &QUOT;Friends are always honest, and sometimes they're not.&QUOT; &QUOT;Doctors are always meticulous, and sometimes they're not.&QUOT; &QUOT;Waiters are always friendly, and sometimes they're not.&QUOT; When you feel resentment, you know the other person is in the &QUOT;...and sometimes they're not&QUOT; range of behavior.
<P>
When Jesus told his followers, &QUOT;Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you&QUOT; (Matthew 5:44), do you suppose he said it primarily so those nasty persecutors could enjoy the benefits of his disciples' love, blessings, goodness, and prayers?
<P>
I think he advised his disciples to love their enemies because it was also good for the disciples. That way, no matter what happened to them, they would always be loving, blessing, doing good, and praying--not a bad life.
<P>
That the people around you will feel better when you stop resenting them is a secondary benefit. That you will feel better when you're not resenting others is the primary gain.
<P>
As with guilt, we have an inner friend to tell uswhen it's time to change our images. It's a twinge of resentment. The twinge of resentment is quiet, like the twinge of guilt. It will gently tug and remind you, &QUOT;It's time to change your image about . . . .&QUOT;
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

If you don't change the image at that point, you'll probably be off on resentment, running the gamut from ticked off to seething. That's okay. As soon as you find yourself there, back off, take a deep breath, and take one (or all) of the steps listed in the next chapter.

When you realize that your resentment is based not on others' actions, but on your reactions to their actions, it's a day for celebration. Yet another &QUOT;bad thing&QUOT; you thought happened &QUOT;out there&QUOT; comes under your direct influence. You reclaim even more of your power. You have more mastery, more control over your life--not because you can control others' actions, but because you're learning to modify your own re-actions.
<P>
Another word for it is freedom.

Whenever you're caught in the cycle of guilt or resentment, a few techniques can help get you back on track. I'll be discussing most of these in detail later, but here's a summary:
<P><OL>
	<B><LI><I>Change the image.</I></B> I know I've said this severaltimes, but it bears repeating. Ask yourself, &QUOT;What am I upset about?&QUOT; Whatever it is, let it be okay. Accept the &QUOT;transgression&QUOT;--either yours or another's. Give yourself (and others) permission to do what you (or they) have already done. Let your image to adjust to reality. You don't have to <I>like</I> it, but you don't have to hate it either.
<P>
	<B><LI><I>Forgive.</I></B> Forgive the others and forgive yourself. Forgive yourself for whatever you did. Forgive the others for whatever they did. Then forgive yourself for judging yourself and others.
<P>
	<B><LI><I>What's the payoff?</I></B> Are you enjoying the intensity of it all? Are you feeling &QUOT;right&QUOT;? Is all the drama of it fun? What are you getting from this resentment?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Humor is a prelude to faith and Laughter is the beginning of prayer.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1> REINHOLD NIEBUHR</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

	<B><LI><I>Move.</I></B> Do something physical. Run around the block. Clean a closet. Do aerobics. If you're in bed, move your arms a lot. Get your energy circulating, flowing, moving.
<P>
	<B><LI><I>Refocus.</I></B> Yes, once again I suggest: focus on something in your immediate environment that's more positive.
<P>
	<B><LI><I>Is it worth dying for?</I></B>If you had a choice--(a) defending the inaccurate image or (b) your life--which would you choose?
<P>
	<B><LI><I>Be grateful.</I></B> Find something to be grateful for--anything. Right now.
<P>
	<B><LI><I>Observe.</I></B> Observe the anger or resentment. Observe the feeling. Don't do anything to it or with it. Don't pay attention to the thoughts feeding the feeling. Observe the feeling itself.
<P>
	<B><LI><I>Breathe.</I></B> Resentment and guilt are usually felt in the lower abdomen and chest. Take slow, deep breaths into these areas. Stretch the area as you breathe in. Imagine a white light going in with each breath and filling the area.
<P>
	<B><LI><I>Surrender.</I></B> Let go of the struggle. Don't try to get rid of the feeling. Just surrender. Feel it; don't fight it.
<P>
	<B><LI><I>Sacrifice.</I></B> Give it up. If you thought sacrifice meant giving up good things, know that it can also mean giving up the not-so-good things. Sacrifice your judgments. Give them up.
</OL><P>
Use any of these techniques, in any order, when you feel guilt or resentment.
<P>
The important thing is not getting rid of guilt and resentment as quickly as possible. Perhaps the most valuable aspect of guilt and resentment is what they can teach you about yourself. What &QUOT;shoulds,&QUOT; &QUOT;musts,&QUOT; and &QUOT;have-tos&QUOT; hold the most sway over you? Where did they come from? What can you do about them? What are you getting out of the guilt and resentment? What are the payoffs?
<P>
Guilt and resentment are the primary expressions of anger. Anger and fear are the primary &QUOT;negative&QUOT; emotions. Learning to master them can take time. Be patient. Tell yourself you're doing a wonderful job.
<P>
You are.
<P>

<H2>Monitor What You Say</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>If you can't say anything good about someone, sit right here by me.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>ALICE ROOSEVELT LONGWORTH</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Listen to yourself as you speak. Note especially any time you (a) let your words limit you, or (b) set something in motion you might not want in motion. Watch out for sentences along the lines of &QUOT;I can't take this anymore,&QUOT; &QUOT;I'll never get it right,&QUOT; &QUOT;This is killing me,&QUOT; or even &QUOT;It's to die for!&QUOT;
<P>
We are powerful creators. What we say often enough can become reality. When it comes to pass, we say, &QUOT;I know I didn't create this!&QUOT; No? Remember six months ago when you said, &QUOT;I need to lose ten pounds; I don't care how, but I need to lose ten pounds&QUOT;? The &QUOT;how&QUOT; is extensive dental work that will keep you from eating very much for a few weeks. By the time it's over, you'll have lost ten pounds. &QUOT;But I didn't want it this way!&QUOT; &QUOT;I don't care how,&QUOT; you said. This is the how.
<P>
If you find yourself saying something you don't necessarily want to take place, quickly say, &QUOT;Cancel&QUOT;  or any other word you understand to mean, &QUOT;Don't put what I just said in motion.&QUOT; Then say what you really want.
<P>
Put yourself on a one-minute time delay. Remember Yul Brynner as the Pharaoh in The Ten Commandments? Remember when he gave a command? &QUOT;So let it be written,&QUOT; he would say in deep, pharaonic tones, &QUOT;so let it be done.&QUOT; Give yourself sixty seconds to cancel an order before the scribe within you hears, &QUOT;So let it be written, so let it be done.&QUOT;
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Endurance</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Elysium is as far as to The very nearest Room If in that Room a Friend await Felicity or Doom-- What Fortitude the Soul contains, That it can so endure The accent of a coming Foot-- The opening of a Door.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>EMILY DICKINSON</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

If something can't be removed, ask for the strength to endure it. There is an old saying, &QUOT;That which doesn't destroy us makes us stronger.&QUOT; A life-threatening illness can be a strengthener, not necessarily to the body, but certainly to the character and to the spirit.
<P>
Robert Louis Stevenson prayed: &QUOT;Give us grace and strength to forbear and to persevere. Give us courage and gaiety and the quiet mind.&QUOT;
<P>
If all of our tribulations were taken from us, we would never grow. It would be crippling. As Oscar Wilde said, &QUOT;When the gods choose to punish us, they merely answer our prayers.&QUOT;
<P>
When we learned to walk, we stumbled, fell, struggled, fell again, bumped our heads--it went on for months. Our parents, who easily could have carried us, instead encouraged us. They comforted us when we fell, but put us back on our feet and stepped back, saying, &QUOT;Come on, you can do it.&QUOT;
<P>
As infants we may have wondered, &QUOT;Why are they doing this to me? Why are they putting me through all this torture? Without the &QUOT;torture,&QUOT; however, we never would have learned to walk.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Yes, as my swift days near their goal, 'Tis all that I implore: In life and death a chainless soul, With courage to endure.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>EMILY BRONTE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Perhaps there's a lesson we must learn that we don't understand, a lesson that requires this new &QUOT;torture.&QUOT; If that's the case, then all we can ask for is the strength to endure.
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
&QUOT;Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning&QUOT; (Psalm 40:5).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1>YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE LUXURY<BR>OF A NEGATIVE THOUGHT</H1><H2>PART TWO</H2>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=80% ALIGN=LEFT><BR>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The return from your work must be the satisfaction which that work brings you and the world's need of that work. With this, life is heaven, or as near heaven as you can get. Without this with work which you despise, which bores you, and which the world does not need this life is hell.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>WILLIAM EDWARD BURGHARDT DU BOIS</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<H2>Do You Like Your Job?</H2>
<P>
Mr. Du Bois knew whereof he spoke: this message was given to his newly born great-grandson on the occasion of Mr. Du Bois's ninetieth birthday. He loved his work (he was, among other things, a founder of the NAACP) and didn't give up the ghost (or his work) until he was ninety-five.
<P>
Most people tend to think of the division between work and play the way Mark Twain saw it: &QUOT;Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do. Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.&QUOT;
<P>
Some people, however, have discovered, as Shakespeare pointed out, &QUOT;If all the year were playing holidays/To sport would be as tedious as to work.&QUOT; Or, as Jerome Klapka Jerome put it, &QUOT;It is impossible to enjoy idling thoroughly unless one has plenty of work to do.&QUOT;
<P>
If you go to a job you despise, filled with things you hate to do, populated with people you don't like, find another job. &QUOT;If you cannot work with love but only with distaste,&QUOT; Kahlil Gibran tells us, &QUOT;it is better that you should leave your work.&QUOT;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I don't like work --no man does-- but I like what is in work the chance to find yourself. Your own reality for yourself, not for others; what no other man can ever know.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>JOSEPH CONRAD</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Work takes up entirely too many of our waking hours for us to let it be a drudgery. &QUOT;Every really able man, in whatever direction he work,&QUOT; wrote Emerson, &QUOT;if you talk sincerely with him, considers his work, however much admired, as far short of what it should be.&QUOT;
<P>
Get a job you enjoy. Before finding that job, you may have to find your career first--your calling, your avocation. &QUOT;Blessed is he who has found his work,&QUOT; said Carlyle. &QUOT;Let him ask no other blessedness.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;In order that people may be happy in their work,&QUOT; John Ruskin tells us, &QUOT;these three things are needed: They must be fit for it. They must not do too much of it. And they must have a sense of success in it.&QUOT;
<P>
The idea of &QUOT;work&QUOT; implies there is something you do that you would not do without the reward. For most people, the reward is money. If you see the primary reward of work as money, I suggest you change the reward. Try loving, maybe. Or service--knowing you are providing people with something they really need. Or creative expression. (&QUOT;That's entertainment!&QUOT;)
<P>
Sometimes you don't need to change your work--all you have to change is your <I>attitude</I> about work. Many good things have been said about work and working over the years: &QUOT;Back of the job--the dreamer who's making the dream come true!&QUOT; (Berton Bradley) &QUOT;Work keeps us from three great evils: boredom, vice, and need&QUOT; (Voltaire).
<P>
If you want to make your dreams come true, it will require work--doing something you're not necessarily thrilled about doing for the sake of a desired goal. Thomas Alva Edison told us, &QUOT;There is no substitute for hard work.&QUOT;
<P>
Some people get religious about their work. The motto of the Benedictine order is, &QUOT;Orare est laborare, laborare est orare.&QUOT; (&QUOT;To pray is to work, to work is to pray.&QUOT;) Some, such as Carlyle, wax poetic: &QUOT;All work is as seed sown; it grows and spreads, and sows itself anew.&QUOT; While others, such as Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, are downright gruff: &QUOT;In the morning, when you are sluggish about getting up, let this thought be present: `I am rising to a man's work.'&QUOT;
<P>
I doubt if that thought would get me out of bed, but this one, from Gibran, might: &QUOT;Work is love made visible.&QUOT;
<P>
If we think of work as a way of manifesting our love, then whatever job we do can be fulfilling.
<P>
If you're working at McDonald's, instead of thinking, &QUOT;Oh god, not another busload of tourists with a Big Mac Attack!&QUOT; you can think, &QUOT;I'm helping provide food so that these people can enjoy their journey.&QUOT; Either way, you'll be wrapping the same number of burgers and boxing the same number of fries. With one attitude, however, you'll feel miserable; with the other, you'll feel useful.

So, if you hate your job, either change your job or change your attitude about the job. One or the other. Don't indulge in negative thinking about it.
<P>
You may say, &QUOT;I can't afford to be without this job.&QUOT; If you're hopelessly mired in disliking the job, you can't afford to keep it.
<P>
If you have a life-threatening illness, regaining your health is Job #1. Until Job #1 is done, everything else is just filler.

A strong mental attitude is built the same way physical strength is gained--by repetition. Manipulating weights builds physical strength. Manipulating thoughts builds mental strength.
<P>
You may have a habit of negative thinking, built over years of repeating negative thoughts. This repetition has made the habit strong.
<P>
Focusing on the positive may not be as strong yet; it may, in fact, be a 97-pound weakling. The way to make it strong is to exercise it. Use it often. Unlike physical exercise, if you do too much positive focusing, you will seldom wake up sore the next morning.

Decide what you want to become stronger in. Become strong by doing it.

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

When we make a commitment, we &QUOT;give our word.&QUOT; Giving something as valuable and as powerful as our word should not be taken lightly. When we don't fulfill our word, a part of us begins to mistrust ourselves. Over time, the effects of broken commitments build up. One begins to have serious self-doubts and uneasy feelings.
<P>
This self-doubt feeds the unworthiness, causing tiredness, confusion, lack of clarity, and a general sense of &QUOT;I can't do it.&QUOT;
<P>
Parallel to this disintegration in our relationship with ourselves is the deterioration of our relationships with others. If you make a series of commitments and don't keep them, people--at best--don't trust you. At worst, it's a great deal of Sturm und Drang--hurt feelings, anger, betrayal, accusations, abandonment.
<P>
It's easy to see that if you've been, shall I say, freewheeling in your commitments--either with yourself or with others--you have plowed, irrigated, and fertilized the soil in which negative thinking thrives.
<P>
To reverse this--and encourage a crop failure--I have a few suggestions:
<P><OL>
	<LI>Don't make commitments you're not sure you can keep. If you're not sure, say you're not sure. If a definite maybe is not good enough, it's better to tell the other person no.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>There's one way to find out  if a man is honest-- ask him. If he says, "Yes," you know he's a crook.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>GROUCHO MARX</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

	<LI>Only make commitments that are important to you. If a commitment is important enough, you'll keep it. If it's not important enough to keep, don't make it.
<P>
	<LI>Learn to say no. Don't make commitments that are important to others but not important to you just because you're afraid of &QUOT;hurting their feelings.&QUOT; In doing this, you will either (a) break the commitment later, causing more hurt feelings, or (b) keep the agreement, hurting your own feelings. It's better to say, &QUOT;No, thank you&QUOT; up front.
<P>
	<LI>Communicate. As soon as you think you might not be able to keep a commitment, let the other person know. Don't just say, &QUOT;Sorry, can't make it.&QUOT; Renegotiate. Changing a commitment is asking for a favor. Do it nicely.
<P>
	<LI>Write down your commitments with others. Keep a calendar and note your appointments. This (a) helps you remember them and (b) avoids scheduling conflicts.
<P>
	<LI>Write down commitments with yourself. Write this on the first page of your calendar: &QUOT;All commitments with myself will be put in writing. Everything else is just a good idea.&QUOT; This keeps you from thinking the &QUOT;good idea&QUOT; to go jogging tomorrow at 6 a.m. is actually a commitment. If it <I>is</I> a commitment, write &QUOT;Jogging, 6 a.m.&QUOT; in your calendar. And do it.
<P>
	<LI>Declare things finished. If you have a half-dozen half-read books lying around open, gathering dust, declare your reading of them finished. Put book marks in them and put them away. Tell yourself, &QUOT;I'm done with this for now.&QUOT; You can always go back and pick them up again, but for now, release yourself from any implied commitment you have with yourself to read them. The same works with commitments with others. When you know you're not going to be taking part in something people expect you to be taking part in, let them know that, until further notice, you won't be there. It's amazing how much energy declaring things finished can free up within you.
<P>
	<LI>Forgive yourself. Forgive yourself for any broken agreements in the past. Forgive yourself for judging yourself for having broken those agreements. While you're at it, forgive yourself for breaking any agreements you may make in the future. (More on the technique of forgiveness later.)

It may help you keep your agreements--and not make agreements you don't plan to keep--if you understand the four primary reasons people break agreements. They are
<P><OL>
	<LI>Approval. We say we'll do something we really don't want to do because we're afraid someone might disapprove of us--then we don't have time to keep all the conflicting agreements.
<P>
	<LI>Comfort. It often seems more comfortable not to keep the commitment. This is actually a false sense of comfort. Usually greater discomfort is the result. We also tend to make agreements we don't want to make because we don't want the discomfort of saying no. Learn to say no.
<P>
	<LI>Rebellion. Breaking agreements for rebels is a knee-jerk reaction to feeling hemmed in, limited, or tied down in any way. Rebels especially feel rebellion toward (a) authority figures and (b) ultimatums. Unfortunately, rebelling against the &QUOT;doctor's orders&QUOT; (ultimatums issued by an authority figure) can be fatal.
<P>
	<LI>Unconsciousness. Unconsciousness is a reason people break agreements. There are other important things to say about this, but I forgot them. Maybe I'll remember later.
</OL><P>
Keeping agreements (and not making agreements you don't plan to keep) is a good way to learn about your need for other people's approval and how to replace it with self-approval; how to expand your &QUOT;comfort zone&QUOT; so you'll have more freedom; and how to move from automatic, unthinking rebellion into conscious, voluntary cooperation.
<P>
The second part of this little &QUOT;secret of happiness&QUOT; is simple--whenever anyone breaks an agreement with you, let it go. In your mind, let the other person out of the agreement at once. Imagine that the person called with the best reason and apology in the world.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Love truth, but pardon error.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>VOLTAIRE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Let it go.
<P>
Expecting human beings to keep their agreements is (a) not realistic, and (b) an invitation to irritation.
<P>
When someone breaks an agreement--especially someone important to you--it may bring back earlier images and feelings of being let down, betrayed, and abandoned. Use the opportunity to heal these memories from the past, not to add further injury to yourself in the present. (More on the healing of memories later.)

In order to make progress, three things are necessary--a thought, a feeling, and an action. They form a pyramid:
<P>
If we have a thought and a feeling, but no action, we're just spinning our wheels. If the thoughts and feelings are negative, this combination usually becomes worry, depression, and frustration. If the thoughts and feelings are positive, it's often just unproductive &QUOT;positive thinking.&QUOT; (Meditation, contemplation, visualization, or spiritual exercises do not fall in the &QUOT;unproductive&QUOT; category. More on those later.) A physical action is required to make the thought and feeling tangible.
<P>
If we have a thought and an action but no feeling, the action will probably not continue for long. Our feelings are our greatest motivators. For sustained physical action, we need to feel something about what we're doing.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Do what you can, with what you have, with where you are.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>THEODORE ROOSEVELT</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

If we have a feeling and an action, but no directed thoughts, we're like a powerboat without a rudder. There's no logical, rational direction. This happens a lot with addictive behaviors--drug abuse, alcoholism, compulsive sex. The emotions say, &QUOT;I want it.&QUOT; And the body says, &QUOT;You got it,&QUOT; before the mind can even engage. Later, themind may say, &QUOT;You know you shouldn't have done that.&QUOT; We knew, but we &QUOT;forgot.&QUOT; Temporary insanity.
<P>
If any one of the three sides of the pyramid is missing, the structure collapses. We cannot do productive work. We cannot accomplish what we want to accomplish.
<P>
Knowing this, I offer the following advice: if you don't have a matching thought, feeling, and action all available at the same time, release yourself from whichever ones you do have.
<P>
For example, if you have the thought, &QUOT;I'd like to go swimming,&QUOT; and the emotions say, &QUOT;Swimming! Oh boy, swimming!&QUOT; but there's no available water, let the thought and the feeling go.
<P>
If you're by a lake, in a bathing suit, and your mind says, &QUOT;Swimming would be good for us,&QUOT; and the body says, &QUOT;I'm ready,&QUOT; but the feelings say, &QUOT;I am not at this moment emotionally equipped to deal with cold water,&QUOT; let go of the thought and the physical preparedness.
<P>
If the emotions want to go swimming and the body is ready to go swimming, but the mind says, &QUOT;I think this water is polluted and may not be safe,&QUOT; let go of the feeling and the physical readiness.
<P>
You &QUOT;let go&QUOT; by refocusing on something the mind, emotions, and body are willing to do--and can do--together. Now.

Did you ever feel you were going in three directions at once? Maybe you were. Maybe your mind wanted one thing (let's clean the garage), the emotions wanted another (let's go dancing), and the body wanted another (let's take a nap). You cannot do all three things at the same time. Two of the three will have to go--or maybe all three will go, and the mind-body-emotions triumvirate will agree to do something else.
<P>
It's as though the mind, body, and emotions have little &QUOT;minds&QUOT; of their own. Sometimes you have to ask the Inner Henry Kissinger to step in and negotiate for you. &QUOT;First we'll take a nap, then we'll clean the garage, then we'll go dancing, okay?&QUOT;
<P>
Sometimes you simply have to lay down the law (lovingly) and tell the body, &QUOT;No nap&QUOT;; the emotions, &QUOT;No dancing&QUOT;; or the mind, &QUOT;The garage is clean enough.&QUOT;
<P>
However you work it, don't let yourself be caught in nonproductive thinking, feeling, or doing. The result is ineffectiveness, and ineffectiveness feeds a lack of self-esteem (&QUOT;I knew I couldn't do it&QUOT;), which leads to more negative thinking, which leads to a triggered Fight or Flight Response, which leads to--well, you already read that part of the book.
<P>

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>If You Want to Feel Good about Yourself, Do Good Things</H2>
<P>
One of the easiest ways to feel good about ourselves is to do good things. The operative word is do.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The greatest pleasure I know is to do a good action by stealth, and to have it found out by accident.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>CHARLES LAMB</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

What's &QUOT;good&QUOT;? I'll let you decide. Whatever you think is good--as long as it doesn't hurt yourself or others--is fine with me.
<P>
It could be doing good things for yourself--mentally (learning something new, focusing on the positive, reading a good book--well, you're already doing that), physically (exercise, massage, eating well) or emotionally (practicing forgiveness, spending time with a loved one, seeing a good movie).
<P>
Or it could be doing something good for someone you know, or for someone you don't know, or for a group, or for nature, or for the whales, or for world peace, or for the planet as a whole.
<P>
Again, the key is action, doing, involvement. We are, as Madonna was kind enough to point out, living in a material world. As Madonna's spiritual teacher, Olivia Newton-John, once said, &QUOT;Let's get physical.&QUOT; Sending people nice thoughts is, well, nice, but sending them notes saying how nice you think they are is even nicer.

<H2>The Twelve Steps</H2>
<P>
While exploring addictions, I would be remiss if I didn't discuss what is probably the most successful program for overcoming addiction--Alcoholics Anonymous.
<P>
For more than fifty years, through the AA program, millions of people have found freedom from their addiction to alcohol. The Twelve Steps--as the AA program is called--are so successful that more than one hundred fifty other organizations use them to overcome eating disorders, compulsive sex, drug abuse, and negative emotions.
<P>
The core of the AA program is described in thebook Alcoholics Anonymous (also known as The Big Book). Here are the Twelve Steps, along with the three paragraphs preceding and the one paragraphfollowing them. If you don't have a problem with alcohol, just substitute &QUOT;negative thinking&QUOT; (orwhatever you feel your addiction to be) for &QUOT;alcohol.&QUOT;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Remember that we are dealing with alcohol--cunning, baffling, powerful! Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power--that One is God. May you find Him now!
<P>
Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We asked His protection and care with complete abandon.
<P>
Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:
<P><OL>
	<LI>We admitted we were powerless over our addiction--that our lives had become unmanageable.
<P>
	<LI>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

	<LI>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of this Higher Power, as we understood Him, Her, or It.
<P>
	<LI>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.
<P>
	<LI>Admitted to our Higher Power, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.
<P>
	<LI>Were entirely ready to have our Higher Power remove all these defects of character.
<P>
	<LI>Humbly asked our Higher Power to remove our shortcomings.
<P>
	<LI>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.
<P>
	<LI>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.
<P>
	<LI>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.
<P>
	<LI>Sought, through prayer and meditation, to improve our conscious contact with our Higher Power as we understood Him, Her, or It, praying only for knowledge of our Higher Power's will for us and the power to carry that out.
<P>
	<LI>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to others and to practice these principles in all our affairs.
</OL><P>
Many of us exclaimed, &QUOT;What an order! I can't go through with it.&QUOT; Do not be discouraged. No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not saints. The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we have set down are guidelines to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection.

No, You Can't Afford the Luxury of a Negative Thought is not an AA book, nor am I saying these twelve steps are the only way to break addictions. I just wanted to offer them as a way millions of people have found successful.
<P>
As far as I know, there is no Negaholics Anonymous (NA) for people who realize they are powerless over their negative thoughts. The closest I've found is Emotions Anonymous. If you consider that a negative thought is usually the step just before a negative emotion, then the goal of EA and the goal of overcoming negative thinking seem in alignment.
<P>
One of the advantages of AA, EA, and all the other organizations that end with &QUOT;Anonymous&QUOT; is the meetings. These meetings provide support, camaraderie, and the knowledge, &QUOT;I'm not alone in this.&QUOT;
<P>
For more information on AA or EA, telephone information and ask for the number in your area. Or, write for meeting times and places in your area. (Emotions Anonymous, P. O. Box 4245, St. Paul, Minnesota, 55104. Alcoholics Anonymous, P. O. Box 459, Grand Central Station, New York, New York, 10163.)
<P>
EA has a book entitled EA: Emotions Anonymous. AA has, in addition to Alcoholics Anonymous, a long list of publications. Write to the above addresses for information.

Pain hurts. We as human beings seem prepared to do almost anything to avoid pain. So why do we persist in doing things we know will bring us mental, emotional, and/or physical pain?
<P>
Return with me now to those thrilling days of yesteryear--childhood. Most children find that when something bad happens to them--an illness, an accident--they get an extra measure of care, understanding, sympathy, and love. &QUOT;Oh, you hurt your finger! Let me kiss it and make it better.&QUOT; Injuries and illness seem to bring an outpouring of affection.
<P>
Given this scenario, it's not difficult for a child to conclude, &QUOT;Injury and illness get me love.&QUOT; Some children then create accidents and sicknesses because they want the love, the cuddling, the pampering. The payoff. 
It's not necessarily a conscious creation-- although I'd bet just about everyone at one time or another faked an illness in order to stay home from school.
<P>
For the children unwilling to go through physical trauma to get attention, there are other ways.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I always keep a supply of stimulant handy in case I see a snake-- which I also keep handy.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>W. C. FIELDS</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Children who get their way by throwing tantrums sometimes grow up to be &QUOT;rageaholics.&QUOT; When they don't get what they want, they get mad. Even in adulthood, getting angry sometimes gets them what they want. And probably quite a bit of what they don't want.
<P>
Some children misbehave to get attention, figuring even negative attention is better than no attention at all. These children can grow to be adults who go through life causing problems just to be noticed.
<P>
Actually, however, all of these payoffs are just symbols of loving, not the genuine article. But, when the real thing's not around--and people haven't yet learned how to give loving to themselves--a symbol will have to do.
<P>
Some of the popular payoffs people receive from indulging in negative behavior include attention, sympathy, avoidance, excuses, protection, acceptance, approval, martyrdom, deception, control, manipulation, and a sense of strength (albeit false), security, closeness, or accomplishment.
<P>
Other seeming benefits of negative behavior are avoiding responsibility, not having to risk, appearing to be right, self-justification, and appearing to prove worthiness. People even boast about their negativity: &QUOT;I'm working out my problems,&QUOT; &QUOT;I'm learning,&QUOT; &QUOT;I'm getting a good emotional release,&QUOT; &QUOT;Pain equals growth,&QUOT; and &QUOT;I can handle pain.&QUOT;
<P>
You might want to take an honest look at what you're getting--or seem to be getting--from whatever negative thoughts, feelings, or physical manifestations you put yourself through. If you want attention, for example, that's a good thing to know. If you can find a way of getting all the attention you want without having to go through all the negativity, wouldn't that be easier? (Not to mention less painful.)
<P>
There's a simple way of getting payoffs directly--asking. &QUOT;Would you please pay attention to me for a few minutes?&QUOT; &QUOT;Could I have some support?&QUOT; &QUOT;Tell me you love me.&QUOT; Yes, there's risk involved--you might not get the payoff. But--as you may have discovered--negative behavior doesn't always get it, either.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>There is luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves we feel no one else has the right to blame us.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>OSCAR WILDE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Make a list of what you're getting from your illness--the payoffs. Work on getting those things more directly. Once you're getting those things through other methods, you may be able to let the illness go.
<P>
Making such a list requires unflinching honesty. The idea that we're doing something as drastic as creating a life-threatening illness just to get attention or sympathy or love is hard to accept. I'm not saying it's true in all cases. Yours may or may not be one. Only you really know.
<P>
Maybe you'll look at your list of payoffs and decide you don't need some of them after all. Then cross them off the list and tell yourself, &QUOT;I don't need ____________ anymore. I can let that one go.&QUOT; The part of you that's creating the illness because it thinks you still want those things will listen and respond. This part of you <I>only wants you to have what you want!</I>
<P>
The remaining payoffs--the ones you really do want--give them to yourself. Love yourself. Pay attention to yourself. Nurture yourself. Cuddle yourself. Pamper yourself. Give to yourself so fully that whatever anyone else gives you will be just icing on the cake.
<P>
When you are filled by your own nurturing, there's no need to seek payoffs &QUOT;out there.&QUOT; If there's no need to seek payoffs, maybe the illness that's seeking them for you will have no need to stick around.

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Know you what it is to be a
child? It is to be something very different from the man of today.
It is to have a spirit yet streaming from the waters of baptism; it
is to believe in love, to believe in loveliness, to believe in
belief; it is to be so little that the elves can reach to whisper
in your ear; it is to turn pumpkins into coaches, and mice into

<P>  <H2>Learn to Play Again</H2> 
<P> Children at play can create enormous amounts of fun,
enthusiasm, and joy with whatever is at hand. A stick becomes a
scepter. A stone, a throne. Two minutes later, the stick is a magic
wand and the stone a pet dragon. 
<P> Somewhere along the way, we &QUOT;serious adults&QUOT; forgot
how to play. Recapture that sense of being in the moment with
whatever the moment has to offer. 
<P> One way is to play with young children--five, six, seven years
old. They'll stretch your imagination while rekindling in you the
sense of wonder you, too, once had. 
<P> You might get yourself some toys you played with--or wanted to
play with--as a child: finger paints, Erector sets, crayons, dolls.
Take a trip to a toy store and buy yourself whatever seems like
fun. 
<P> Be your own nurturing parent. Give yourself permission to play.

<P> <HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT> <H2>Be Creative</H2> 
<P> One of the great joys of life is creativity. Information goes
in, gets shuffled about, and comes out in new and interesting ways.

<P> Whatever creative activity you've always wanted to do--do it
now. Writing, painting, sculpting, cooking, gardening, sewing,
knitting, singing, playing an instrument, composing, dancing,
choreographing, designing, photographing, acting, directing, video
making--the list is endless. 
<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>If I had to define life in
a word, it would be: Life is creation.</I>
<P> <FONT SIZE=-1>CLAUDE BERNARD<BR> FROM THE BULLETIN OF NEW YORK
ACADEMY OF MEDICINE</FONT></CENTER> </BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  It doesn't matter that you don't know how to do it
&QUOT;perfectly.&QUOT; (How many people who make a <I>living</I> at
it do?) It doesn't matter how &QUOT;good&QUOT; you are. What
matters is the creativity. Does it give you joy? Does it give you
satisfaction? Is it fun? Does it make you feel more in touch with
the creative flow of life? If the answer is yes to any of these,
then do it. 
<P> Letting creativity flow through you can be therapeutic.
&QUOT;Energy flowing through a system acts to organize that
system,&QUOT; as the Whole Earth Catalog reminds us. 
<P> Give yourself plenty of creative time and plenty of
opportunities to create. 
<P> <HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT> <H2>Choose Well Your
Companions</H2> 
<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>A noble person attracts
noble people, and knows how to hold on to them.</I>
<P> <FONT SIZE=-1>GOETHE</FONT></CENTER> </BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  If you know people who have a positive direction to their
lives--or who are working on one--you may find them rewarding to be
around. 
<P> Conversely, people who are addicted to their negative
thinking--and refuse to recognize it--can be a drag. They feed you
negativity and criticize every positive move you make. 
<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I love tranquil solitude And
such society As is quiet, wise, and good.</I>
<P> <FONT SIZE=-1>PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  Negative thinkers are a great challenge. If possible, avoid
that challenge. 
<P> Fill your life with people who applaud your positive thoughts,
feelings, and actions; who encourage you toward more and better;
who know how to praise the good and the beautiful. 
<P> As I said before, you don't have to spend  time with people you
don't want to. If you choose to spend time with them, you're
entitled to set the rules. &QUOT;I don't want to discuss negative
things.&QUOT; If they don't like it (and they probably won't),
they're entitled to go elsewhere and spend time with people who do.

<P> If there are people you feel you must spend time with (usually
relatives), (a) try to do it on the phone, and (b) use the time
with them to learn something about yourself. Watching how other
people negate and sabotage themselves can provide you with a
blueprint of how you may be doing it to yourself. 
<P> You don't have to get negative about their negativity. 
<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>My heart leaps up when I
behold A rainbow in the sky: So was it when my life began; So is it
now I am a man; So be it when I shall grow old, Or let me die! The

each to each by natural piety.</I>
<P> <FONT SIZE=-1>WORDSWORTH</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  The idea that it's better to spend time with uplifting people
is also true of books, movies, TV shows, CDs--everything. Not that
you have to watch <I>The Sound of Music</I> three times a day--it's
just that certain sources of information reinforce the notion that
&QUOT;life is terrible,&QUOT; while other sources of information
uphold the idea that &QUOT;life is wonderful.&QUOT; (Try watching
Field of Dreams.) 
<P> It's your life. Live it with people who are alive. It tends to
be contagious. 
<P> <HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT> <H2>The Miracle of
Modern Medicine</H2> 
<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Some patients, though
conscious that their condition is perilous, recover their health
simply through their contentment with the goodness of the
physician.</I>
<P> <FONT SIZE=-1>HIPPOCRATES<BR> 460-400 B.C.</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  That sounds like an article from <I>Reader's Digest,</I>
doesn't it? The fact is, modern medicine routinely does things that
would have been considered miraculous only a century ago. 
<P> In some cases, far less than a century ago: Before the
discovery of stable penicillin in 1941 and its widespread
manufacture after World War II, pneumonia killed more people than
any other complication. People would have a simple disease or
accident, develop pneumonia, and die. Alexander the Great, the most
powerful man of his day, died of pneumonia. King Henry VIII, the
most powerful man of his day, died of syphilis. Since penicillin,
deaths in the Western world from pneumonia have dropped
significantly, and syphilis deaths are almost not measurable
(according to The World Almanac, 0.0 percent). 
<P> Although the remarkably expanded life span of human beings over
the past two hundred years is more thanks to plumbing and
transportation than medicine (carrying away refuse and adding fresh
fruits and vegetables to the daily diet have done more to lengthen
the life span than anything else), any number of formerly
&QUOT;incurable&QUOT; diseases and maladies are now routinely
cured. 
<P> It's interesting to sit with a group of people and ask,
&QUOT;Would you be alive today if medicine were only as advanced as
it was one hundred years ago?&QUOT; Most people who had had
syphilis, pneumonia, any other formerly fatal bacterial disease, a
severe accident, or almost any operation--including appendectomy
and Caesarean section--would have to say they'd be dead. 
<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Honor a physician with the
honor due unto him for the uses which ye may have of him: for the

<P> <FONT SIZE=-1>ECCLESIASTICUS 38:1</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  The discovery of just the Big Three--anesthesia, antiseptics,
and antibiotics--directly accounts for the saving of tens of
millions of lives each year. 
<P> There are miracles happening every day in medicine. You--or
someone you know well--is still alive because of them. 
<P> When you think of medicine, don't just think of sterile
science, lab coats, and test tubes. Ponder the wonder of medicine,
the marvel of how far it has come--and how quickly. Consider the
magic of it. 
<P> The history of modern medicine is less the story of
predictable, plodding advances than it is a chronicle of miracles. 
<P> And the miracles continue. 
<P> <HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT> <H2>Explore Every
Medical Option</H2> 
<P> As I mentioned at the start of this book, nothing in this book
is designed to replace proper medical treatment. The ideas in this
book are designed to augment whatever treatment program you're on.

<P>  If you have a life-threatening illness, explore every
possibility of treatment, of cure, or--at the very least--of

<P>  Your doctor has hundreds of diseases to learn and keep current
on--you have just one. Know it. It is, after all, a visitor. Even
an unwelcome visitor you'd probably spend some time getting to
know. And the better you know it, the more ways you'll have of
getting it to leave. 
<P> Ask your doctor about the disease, its treatment, its cure.
When you've reached the limits of your doctor's knowledge (or
patience), do some research. Read about the disease. Talk to other
people who have it--or, better still, who no longer have it. 
<P> Become a co-creator of your own cure. Work with your doctor on
the best course of treatment for you. Don't be the passive patient,
taking pills and paying bills. Become involved. 
<P> As any good doctor will tell you, the treatment of many
illnesses is as much an art as a science. 
<P> Become an artist.

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  The reason for knowing your disease is so that you can cure
it. Keep that always in mind as you do your studying. 
<P> No matter how clever, powerful, or tenacious a disease may be
(and some of them are remarkable), keep reminding yourself,
&QUOT;I'm smarter than that,&QUOT; &QUOT;I'm more powerful than
that,&QUOT; &QUOT;I'm more persistent than that.&QUOT; 
<P> Because you are. 
<P> <HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT> <H2>Don't Believe
Everything You Read in the Papers (Magazines, TV, etc.)</H2> 
<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I><B>MARTIANS BUILD TWO

<P> <FONT SIZE=-1>NEW YORK TIMES FRONT-PAGE HEADLINE<BR> AUGUST 27,
1911</FONT></CENTER> </BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  Knowing the disease can not only help you work toward the
cure; it can also keep you from getting worse due to fear. Once you
know the disease, media accounts that once might have caused you to
panic now only produce a smile and a sigh. (Although the temptation
will be enormous, don't let your reaction get more negative than a
sigh.) 
<P> The news media are, for the most part, the bringers of bad
news. That statement, of course, is no longer news. And it's not
entirely the media's fault--bad news gets higher ratings and sells
more papers than good news. (&QUOT;Three Americans Shot by Mad
Gunman!&QUOT; sells papers. &QUOT;258,829,439 Americans Not Shot by
Mad Gunman!&QUOT; doesn't.) 
<P> When your disease is reported in the media, remember that the
reporting is apt to (a) focus on the negative, and (b) be
superficial enough to appeal to everyone. Because you have a vested
interest in knowing about the disease, you may know more about it
than the reporter who reported it. (The reporter probably has to
cover every other known disease and Space Shuttle launchings, too.)

<P> The media often fall into the &QUOT;Is the glass half-full or
half-empty?&QUOT; trap. If a disease has a fifty-fifty
survivability rate, the media tend to say, &QUOT;Fifty percent of
all people with this disease die,&QUOT; rather than, &QUOT;Half the
people diagnosed with this illness are cured.&QUOT; Same
information, different slant. 
<P> Sometimes the reporting is so general it blurs the issue.
Because the media only report that so-and-so &QUOT;died of
cancer,&QUOT; many people don't know, for example, that cancer is
not one always-fatal illness, but a term describing a whole
collection of illnesses, the majority of which are now considered
curable. 
<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The French army is still the
best all-around fighting machine in Europe.</I>
<P> <FONT SIZE=-1>TIME<BR> JUNE 12, 1939</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  Also, diseases in the media tend to follow a trend--they have
their day in the spotlight and fade into obscurity. In the early
eighties, herpes had its day. Now, although people still get and
have herpes, you don't hear much about it. Now AIDS has the
spotlight. 
<P> The problem with this kind of &QUOT;fad reporting&QUOT; is
three-fold: 
<P> First, it tends to report rumors, speculations, and projections
as facts. These tend to be more sensational. How does the media do
this? By quoting some &QUOT;expert.&QUOT; Experts seldom agree,
especially at the early stages of studying a disease, and you can
always find some expert who will say something hopelessly hopeless
about anything. 
<P> Second, the most curative work on a disease is achieved after
it has fallen out of media favor. When a cure--which usually
happens in gradual stages of treatment and prevention--is found,
the disease is by then in media exile, and the report of the cure
is often relegated to a small article next to the used car ads--if
reported at all. 
<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Comet Kohoutek promises to
be the celestial extravaganza of the century.</I>
<P> <FONT SIZE=-1>NEWSWEEK<BR> NOVEMBER 5, 1973</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  Third, if the horrifying projections turn out to be
exaggerated, no one bothers to report, &QUOT;Five years ago we made
a big mistake. Hope we didn't frighten you folks too much.&QUOT;
(Remember during the herpes scare when experts were predicting that
the virus would eventually attack the spinal column and people
would die horrible deaths? How many retractions of this
misinformation have you read?) 
<P> In the media, good news must, alas, also be taken with a grain
of salt. If going against the popular grain and reporting the
opinion of an overly optimistic &QUOT;expert&QUOT; will make a good
headline, so be it. 
<P> As any reporter will tell you, when writing for the mass media
on a complicated subject such as disease, the instructions are,
&QUOT;Generalize, simplify, and don't take up too much space (or
time).&QUOT; &QUOT;All the news that's fit to print&QUOT; often
becomes &QUOT;All the news that fits.&QUOT; 
<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Everything you read in the
newspaper is absolutely true except for the rare story of which you
happen to have first-hand knowledge.</I>
<P> <FONT SIZE=-1>ERWIN KNOLL</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  On the brighter side, the scare tactics of the media often
make available more time, money, and resources for treatment and
cure than might otherwise have been available. I just wish there
were a way to do it without instilling all that fear--especially
for the people who have to deal with not only the disease and their
own fear of the disease, but everyone else's fear as well.

<P>  Any time someone tells you that you only have so long to live,

between now and your demise--it's a prediction, an opinion based

<P> The Experts Speak (by Christopher Cerf and Victor Navasky,
Pantheon Books, New York) is 392 pages of small type featuring
noted experts being wrong about almost every major event,

were trash, World Wars I and II could not possibly happen, and Gone

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  I quote these (and there are many, many more) to show that
experts--even doctor experts--are human, and humans make mistakes.
There are certain medical facts, but predictions about how long
someone will live are just that--predictions, opinions, best
guesses. 
<P> Unfortunately, when some people are told by a doctor--Authority
Figure Extraordinary--&QUOT;Your disease is incurable; you only
have six months to live,&QUOT; they may believe it so faithfully
they--with their own thoughts, feelings, and actions--sentence
themselves to die within six months. 
<P> And they do. 
<P> If they had been given years, perhaps they would have lived
years; and if the doctor had said, &QUOT;There's a condition here,
and if you work with me, together we can beat this,&QUOT; perhaps
they could have--given a fully cooperative patient ready to do
&QUOT;whatever it takes&QUOT;--beaten it. 
<P> Deeming a disease officially &QUOT;incurable&QUOT; often
becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. When people don't allow that to
happen and cure themselves, they are usually told, &QUOT;Ah, we
made a mistake in diagnosis.&QUOT; 
<P> &QUOT;How do you know you made a mistake in diagnosis?&QUOT; 
<P> &QUOT;Because the disease we first diagnosed is incurable, and
since you no longer have any signs of it, it must not have been
that disease, because that disease is incurable.&QUOT; 
<P> Some doctors don't like to admit that they misdiagnosed. They
just call the healing a &QUOT;spontaneous remission&QUOT; and leave
it at that. There's no rhyme or reason to the cure, they claim. It
was &QUOT;spontaneous.&QUOT; Besides, you're not &QUOT;cured.&QUOT;
The disease is just &QUOT;in remission.&QUOT; It could flare up at
any time. You were lucky, nothing more. Go home. 
<P> Other doctors, however, ask, &QUOT;What did you do? How did you
do it? Let's see what it was, and maybe it will help others.&QUOT;
I loudly applaud this ever-growing group of medical practitioners. 
<P> AIDS, for example, is currently thought to be
&QUOT;incurable&QUOT; and &QUOT;always fatal&QUOT; by most experts.
The problem is, some people who have had AIDS before AIDS even had
a name are still alive. Until everyone who has AIDS dies, I don't
understand how it can be called &QUOT;always fatal.&QUOT; 
<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The art of medicine consists

<P> <FONT SIZE=-1>VOLTAIRE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  Also reported as fact by most of the media is that ninety-nine
percent of all people who currently test positive for the HIV
antibody will die of AIDS complications. (One doesn't die of AIDS;
one dies of the complications from opportunistic infections the
AIDS-suppressed immune system can't fight off.) 
<P> This is devastating information for anyone who's ever taken an
&QUOT;AIDS test&QUOT; and had a positive result. (There is no
&QUOT;AIDS test.&QUOT; The test is for the antibody to the HIV
virus, the virus many experts believe causes AIDS. All the test
shows is that the antibody to the virus is in the bloodstream. It
does not show the presence of the HIV virus or of the disease AIDS,
nor does it mean one will develop AIDS.) 
<P> Before taking this ninety-nine percent figure too much to heart
(or head, and thinking negatively about it), consider the facts. 
<P> I'll go into detail on this as an example of how important it
is to look beneath the well-circulated doomsday predictions about
<I>any</I> disease so you can find information closer to the truth.

<P> In 1978, at a sexually transmitted disease clinic in San
Francisco, blood was taken from thousands of patients and stored as
part of a study on hepatitis. When, in 1984, the test for the HIV
antibody was discovered, an experiment was begun on 5,000 primarily
gay men whose 1978 stored blood showed the presence of the HIV
antibody. 
<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>We have not lost faith, but

<P> <FONT SIZE=-1>GEORGE BERNARD SHAW</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  By 1988, forty-eight percent of the people who had the HIV
antibody in their blood in 1978 had developed AIDS. 
<P> These are tragic figures, but this was all that was known in
1988. Scientific fact stopped here. Expert projection and opinion,
journalistic hysteria, and no small amount of homophobia took over.

<P> Some experts looked at the graph and projected the rise of AIDS
cases in the future based on what had happened in the past. Based
on <I>this </I>assumption, they predicted that, by the year 2000,
nearly everyone in the study would have AIDS. Based on this
projection, they further projected that ninty-nine percent of all
people who are HIV antibody-positive will die of complications
arising from AIDS. 
<P> This 1988 series of assumptions and projections on projections
failed to take into account the following: 
<P><OL>   <LI>A disease tends to affect the weakest and/or most
susceptible portions of a population first. If these same experts
had graphed the bubonic plague (which wiped out half of Europe from
1348 to 1350), they would have predicted Europe devoid of all human
life by 1352. If they had charted the flu epidemic of 1918 (which
killed more than twice as many people as World War I--20,000,000
worldwide, 548,000 in the United States), they would have projected
the end of human life by 1925. 
<P> This, of course, is not what happened. The diseases ran their
course and eventually died out without a &QUOT;cure&QUOT; ever
being found. It would have been just as reasonable to predict that
the same thing would happen to the people in the HIV test group as
it was to predict that they were all doomed.

<P>       <LI>The people in the study were coming to a public
clinic for sexually transmitted diseases. The majority of them had
a history of syphilis, gonorrhea, parasites, herpes, and/or
hepatitis. This brings up certain questions: (a) Were these people
more susceptible to diseases than an &QUOT;average&QUOT; group of
gay males? (b) Was the immune system, before being exposed to AIDS,
already suppressed by repeated exposure to other diseases, and, if
so, did that give AIDS a stronger foothold? (c) Was the health care
they were given at a public clinic as good as the care other gay
males received in private treatment? 
<P>  <LI>The chances are very high that many of the men in this
population would have had, through multiple sexual contacts,
repeated exposure to AIDS. Multiple exposure to most viruses tends
to produce a more severe case of the disease and to bring it on
more quickly. The people in the study were already HIV positive by
1978, and the guidelines for &QUOT;safe sex&QUOT; were not
announced for another six years. 
<P>  <LI>Recreational drug use was higher than average among this
population. 
<P>  <LI>The number and frequency of sexual partners in this
population were higher than average. 
<P>  <LI>Many of the gay males in San Francisco in the late 1970s
sometimes practiced sex that was not just &QUOT;unsafe&QUOT; (in
terms of AIDS transmission) but <I>acrobatic</I>. Some of the
activities, from a transmission-of-AIDS point of view, could be
considered ostentatiously unsafe. 
<P>  <LI>The study only goes as far back as 1978. There is no way
of telling for how many years <I>before</I> 1978 these people were
infected. 
<P>  <LI>The people in the study have known since 1984 that they've
had antibodies to HIV in their blood since 1978, and probably
before. They've read reports about the study, as well as heard
experts &QUOT;predict&QUOT; the grim state of their life
expectancy. They may have watched friends who were in the study die
from AIDS, or even friends infected after 1978. Can you imagine the
kind of negative thinking this can induce among this dwindling
population of volunteers?</OL> 
<P> From what we now know about the transmission of AIDS, we can
see that these people may have had more contributing AIDS factors
than thegeneral population--even more than the general population
of people who currently test HIV antibody-positive. 
<P> Taking these eight factors into account, I don't see how the
experts could have made the &QUOT;ninety-nine percent
prediction&QUOT; for even the remaining members of the test group,
much less the entire HIV antibody-positive population. (And why
ninty-nine percent? Why not ninty-eight percent? Or one hundred
percent? Or 99 percent?) 
<P> From the comfortable vantage point of 1995, we can see that the
alarmists were wrong once again. The statistics from the San
Francisco study--far from getting increasingly grave and
horrifying--have gotten no worse. The percentage of people in that
study who developed AIDS has stayed virtually the same since 1988,
at around forty-eight percent. Did this make the front page of any
newspaper? Did an evening television newscast open its broadcast
with this wonderful information? 
<P> I saw an article about a year ago. The headline read:
&QUOT;AIDS INFECTION RATE LESS THAN ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.&QUOT; The
article went on to say that the number of people &QUOT;infected
with AIDS&QUOT; (as the press likes to misrepresent HIV
antibody-positive) in the United States is not 1.5 million, as
originally thought, but closer to one million. The article was
three paragraphs long. The original scare projections were off by
one-third. More than 500,000 fewer people were HIV
antibody-positive than theblaring front-page headlines had first
proclaimed. Where did I find this corrected information? Page 22,
next to an ad for office supplies and FAX machines. 
<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The biggest liar in the

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  The studies of otherwise healthy people who happen to have HIV
antibodies in their systems have been--uniformly and
universally--encouraging. In other words, the news about being HIV
antibody-positive is positive. 
<P> Far from a death sentence, HIV antibody-positive status is yet
another of life's wake-up calls. &QUOT;Watch your diet; do what you
love; monitor your attitude; exercise; reduce stress; don't worry,
be happy,&QUOT; seems to be its message. Those who heed the message
seem to have about the same chances of living a long, full life as
almost anyone else. 
<P> In late 1994, the World Health Organization reported that only
about twenty percent of all HIV antibody-positive people worldwide
had developed AIDS. When you consider that most of these people
live in underdeveloped countries where life is hard, epidemics are
rampant, drinking water is often contaminated, and medical
treatment almost nonexistent, the prognosis is, in fact, good for
those in a country with wholesome food, uncontaminated water,
nutritional supplements, emotional support, access to information
(if you dig for it), and two-movies-for-ninety-nine-cents video
rental days. 
<P> It's been fun--in a Kafkaesque way--to watch the media adapt to
the new, more optimistic information: each year they simply change
the boilerplate statement in their reports. Currently, &QUOT;The
AIDS virus can remain dormant in the body for as long as fifteen
years.&QUOT; Ten years ago it was five years. Next year it will be
sixteen years. Why don't they just admit they don't know? 
<P> The &QUOT;HIV-POSITIVE equals AIDS equals DEATH in a few
years&QUOT; falsehood will, I trust, belooked on as one of the most
inaccurate--and cruelest--myths of the latter part of the twentieth
century. 
<P> Before believing what you read, or even what you are told by a
professional, you'd do well to find out (a) if the information is
fact or projection, (b) where the study was done and under what
conditions, and (c) who took part in the study and what's the
difference between your life and theirs. 
<P> And remember, according to the experts, humans can't fly, the
sun goes around the earth, and the Titanic is unsinkable.

<H2>For the Highest Good of All Concerned</H2>

Whenever asking for something (and visualization is a form of asking), you might find it a good idea to underwrite your request with an insurance policy.
<P>
The insurance policy I suggest: preface and/or follow all your requests with &QUOT;for the highest good of all concerned.&QUOT;
<P>
We are powerful creators. We might ask for something--a solution to a problem, say--and, by the time that solution comes to pass, it has more problems attached to it than the problem it was intended to solve: it isn't the right color (or some other omitted detail), we no longer need it, we already have two others, or we simply no longer want it.
<P>
Sometimes putting requests in motion is like ordering room service at a bad hotel. We place the order at ten in the evening. By midnight nothing's come, so we give up and go to sleep. At 3:00 a.m., there's a pounding at the door, &QUOT;Room service!&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;I don't want it anymore.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;But you ordered it.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;That was at ten o'clock.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;We were very busy tonight.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;Well, I don't want it now.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;Did you cancel your order?&QUOT;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>There are two tragedies in life. One is to lose your heart's desire. The other is to gain it.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>GEORGE BERNARD SHAW</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


&QUOT;No. The phone lines were busy.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;How many times did you try?&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;Three.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;That wasn't enough.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;Well, I still don't want it.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;You ordered it. You've got to eat it.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;No, I don't.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;It'll be outside your door. You'll have to step over it in the morning.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;Fine. Now, leave me alone.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;And you have to pay for it.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;I'll do nothing of the kind.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;Then we won't bring you breakfast.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;Fine. Now, go away.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;What about my tip?&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;What tip?&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;It's customary to offer a gratuity when someone brings you room service. Especially at three o'clock in the morning.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;But I didn't want room service at three o'clock in the morning.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;Did you tell them that when you placed the order?&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;No.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;Then it's not our fault. It's certainly not <I>my</I> fault. I did my job. I deserve a tip.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;You're not getting a tip. Now, leave me alone.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;The maid's a friend of mine. I'll tell her not to clean your 
room tomorrow.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;I'm checking out tomorrow.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;The bellboy's a friend of mine, too. You'll have to carry your own baggage.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;Write yourself a tip on the bill. Now, let me get some sleep.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;Could you sign the bill, please?&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;What?&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;If you give a tip, you have to sign the bill.&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;Why?&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;Hotel policy.&QUOT;
<P>
Sound familiar?
<P>
To get what we want--and only what we want, and all of what we want--it's good to be as specific as possible. But it seems that, no matter how many details we include, the fickle finger of fate can add a few we never considered.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The highest good.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>CICERO<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

That's where &QUOT;the highest good&QUOT; comes in. Do all that you can; then ask for it in the name of the highest good of all concerned. That way, no matter what happens, what comes to you will be right, and the timing will be perfect.
<P>
This is especially true when making requests for others. We don't always know what would be the best for ourselves, so how can we hope to know what would be the best for someone else?
<P>
I was once told of an elderly woman who was in a coma. Her friends and family prayed, affirmed, and visualized unceasingly that she come out of the coma and live. The coma continued for weeks. The woman finally awoke from the coma and said in perfectly lucid tones to those gathered around her bed, &QUOT;Let me go. I've seen what it's like on the other side. I want to go there. You're all holding me here. I love you. If you love me, let me go.&QUOT; She closed her eyes, returned to the &QUOT;coma.&QUOT; A few hours later--after the message of &QUOT;let go&QUOT; was spread among her family and friends--she died.
<P>
If her friends had sent their prayers, affirmations, and visualizations to her for her highest good and the highest good of all concerned, she might have been able to make her transition with less struggle.
<P>
How often have we wished for our friends, &QUOT;I hope he gets that job,&QUOT; or &QUOT;I hope they stay together,&QUOT; or &QUOT;I hope she sells her house&QUOT;? Maybe the new job, staying together, and selling the house aren't for their highest good. Maybe later they'll say, &QUOT;I sure hate this job,&QUOT; or &QUOT;We should have broken up years ago,&QUOT; or &QUOT;I wish I had my house back.&QUOT; At this point we usually tell ourselves, &QUOT;But that's what they said they wanted.&QUOT;
<P>
What people say they want and what they really want when it actually comes to pass are often two different animals. Usually two different species.
<P>
What we don't know, fully and absolutely, is the future. We don't know what will happen or how things will be different or how we will have changed. What we ask for today, we may not want tomorrow. This is why it's a good idea to make a list of all the things you're asking for--your list of goals. When you no longer want something (maybe because you got something better), cross it off your list. Tell yourself, &QUOT;Thank you, but I no longer want this.&QUOT;
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


When asking for things, some people also like to add, &QUOT;this, or something better.&QUOT; If we want ten million dollars, but we get twenty million, that would be okay, wouldn't it? Some people put an upper limit on their receiving by how they ask. &QUOT;This, or something better, for my highest good and the highest good of all concerned&QUOT; encompasses all variables, changes, and extremes.
<P>
You can relax after asking. (Relax from worrying, that is. You'll still have to get busy to make your dreams a reality.)
<P>
&QUOT;For my highest good and the highest good of all concerned&QUOT; trusts that there is some Higher Power--Mother Nature, Father God, or whatever you care to call It--who is taking care of us, who is there to nurture and support us, who knows what we want before we even know it, and who is happy to give it to us.

<H2>Light</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>THE FIRST BOOK OF MOSES, CALLED GENESIS 1:1-3</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


The concept of light as a gift from &QUOT;someplace greater&QUOT; to humanity seems to be ageless and universal. It spans time, geography, and belief. It's central to almost every religion, a great many philosophies, and is at the very core of atomic physics-- which means at the very core of life itself.
<P>
In approximate historical order, let's look at how light is viewed by the major religions of the world.
<P>
<B><I>Hinduism,</I></B> one of the oldest religions in the world, was founded around 1500 B.C. One of Hinduism's sacred texts, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, states (1.3.28):
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
Lead me from the unreal to the real!<BR>
Lead me from darkness to light! <BR>
Lead me from death to immortality!<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Light is equated both with reality and immortality. &QUOT;Enlightenment&QUOT; is a Hindu's highest goal.
<P>
<B><I>Judaism</I></B> was formally founded around 1300 B.C.E. (Before the Common Era). Jewish scripture is abundant with references to light, starting with &QUOT;In the beginning,&QUOT; quoted on the facing page.
<P>
The Old Testament of the Bible--the sacred texts as well as the story of the Chosen People--includes some of the most beautiful references to light ever written.
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light. (Exodus 13:21)
<P>
Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. (Psalm 4:6)
<P>
The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? (Psalm 27:1)
<P>
Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. (Isaiah 60:1)
<P>
I shall light a candle of understanding in thine heart, which shall not be put out. (II Esdras 14:25)
<P>
The light that cometh from her [wisdom] never goeth out. (Wisdom of Solomon 7:10)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father in heaven.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>MATTHEW 5:14-16</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


<B><I>Buddhism</I></B> was founded by Gautama Buddha around 525 B.C. Buddha is often referred to as &QUOT;The Light of Asia.&QUOT; &QUOT;Enlightenment,&QUOT; in fact, is what transformed the endarkened Siddhartha Gautama into &QUOT;Buddha&QUOT; (&QUOT;the Enlightened One&QUOT;).
<P>
<B><I>Christianity</I></B>. Jesus said of himself, &QUOT;I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life&QUOT; (John 8:12).
<P>
He told his followers, &QUOT;Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you&QUOT; (John 12:35).
<P>
After he physically left the earth, Jesus sent &QUOT;an advocate&QUOT; in the form of the Light of the Holy Spirit, which first appeared to the disciples as tongues of fire (light).
<P>
<B><I>Islam</I></B> was founded by the prophet Mohammed in 622 A.D. The sacred text of Islam is the Koran. This passage from the Koran (24:35) leaves little doubt as to Islamic beliefs about light:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
God is the light of the heavens and of the earth. His light is like a niche in which is a lamp--the lamp encased in glass--the glass, as it were, a glistening star. From a blessed tree it is lighted, the olive neither from the East nor of the West, whose oil would well nigh shine out, even though fire touched it not. It is light upon light. God guideth whom He will to His light, and God setteth forth parables to men.

The Native Americans of both North and South America had many religions, but most have a common thread--The Great Spirit, Mother Earth, and the colors of Light. This North American Indian song illustrates the latter.

Or from the poem &QUOT;The Flight of [the Aztec] Quetzalcoatl&QUOT;:

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Now, if all this talk about God and light isn't quite up your avenue, how about ancient philosophers?
<P>
The Greeks liked light. Pindar (518-438 B.C.) wrote, &QUOT;Creatures of a day, what is a man? What is he not? Mankind is a dream of a shadow. But when a god-given brightness comes, a radiant light rests on men, and a gentle life.&QUOT;
<P>
The Romans were fond of light, too. &QUOT;On a dark theme I trace verses full of light,&QUOT; wrote Lucretius (99-55 B.C.), &QUOT;touching all the muses' charm.&QUOT;
<P>
The pagan gods used light. &QUOT;The evening is come; rise up, ye youths,&QUOT; spoke Catullus (87-54 B.C.). &QUOT;Vesper from Olympus now at last is just raising his long-looked-for light.&QUOT;
<P>
Not happy with Greeks, Romans, and pagans? How about poets?
<P>
Dante, in the early 1300s, declared that Beatrice &QUOT;...shall be a light between truth and intellect.&QUOT; Three hundred and fifty years later, Henry Vaughan calmly informed us,
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
I saw Eternity the other night<BR>
Like a great ring of pure and endless light.<BR> 
All calm, as it was bright; <BR>
And round beneath it, <BR>
Time in hours, days, years,<BR> 
Driv'n by the spheres <BR>
Like a vast shadow moved;<BR> 
in which the world <BR>
And all her train were hurled.<BR>

A hundred-or-so years later, Wordsworth advised us, &QUOT;Come forth into the light of things, /LetNature be your teacher.&QUOT; And Lord Byron either heard a song from without or (as I like to think) a sound from within when he wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A light broke in upon my brain--<BR>
It was the carol of a bird; <BR>
It ceased, and then it came again, <BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Emily Dickinson enjoyed one of the qualities of light: &QUOT;Phosphorescence. Now, there's a word to lift your hat to,&QUOT; she wrote. &QUOT;To find that phosphorescence, that light within, that's the genius behind poetry.&QUOT;
<P>

Closer to our time, Theodore Roethke pointed out, &QUOT;The word outleaps the world, and light is all.&QUOT; On a more personal note, he wrote, &QUOT;Light listened when she sang.&QUOT;
<P>
Which brings us to one of the favorite poetical uses of light--to describe one's beloved. The most famous, perhaps, is Shakespeare's &QUOT;But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? / It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!&QUOT;
<P>
Robert Burns was a bit more, well, Scottish with the light of love:

All right. Enough poets. How about artists? Michelangelo wrote, &QUOT;I live and love in God's peculiar light.&QUOT; During an interview, Marc Chagall once made this comment: &QUOT;Do not leave my hand without light.&QUOT;

And of light and death? Goethe's last words were &QUOT;More light!&QUOT; while Teddy Roosevelt requested, &QUOT;Put out the light.&QUOT; Herder's self-written epitaph was &QUOT;Light, love, life.&QUOT; Longfellow seemed to accept the notion that light is to be found on either side of death: &QUOT;The grave itself is but a covered bridge / Leading from light to light, through a brief darkness.&QUOT;

Why have I gone through all this? Isn't this book long enough already? Well, this was just my meandering way of illustrating that there are many kinds of light. My suggestion? Whichever kind you like, use it.
<P>
Imagine, if you will, a pure, white light surrounding, filling, and protecting you, all of your activities, everyone and everything around you. Ask for this light for your highest good and the highest good of all concerned.
<P>
Just as darkness is merely the absence of light, not a real thing in itself, negativity, another form of darkness, is simply the absence of another kind of light.

Where does the darkness go when you turn on the light? What happens to your fist when you open your hand? Where does your lap go when you stand up? If you work with the light (and ask the light to work with you), you may find yourself asking the question, &QUOT;What happens to negativity when I ask for the light?&QUOT;
<P>
You can think of light as an acronym: Luxuriating In Good Happy Times, perhaps, or Loving Intensely Gives Higher Thinking, or Laughing Internally Gets Hilarious Teachings. Invent any others you choose.
<P>
If there is a power in light you can call on, you might as well use it. If not, you're not losing much except the few seconds it takes to think, &QUOT;I ask the light to surround, fill, and protect me and everyone and everything around me for my highest good and the highest good of all concerned.&QUOT; (In a pinch, you can shorten it to: &QUOT;Light! Highest Good!&QUOT;)

It's one of those you-have-little-to-lose-and-a-lot-to-gain suggestions. Try it. Play with it. See what happens. I'm not asking you to believe; just experiment. Based on your results, you'll know if there's something to it for you or not.

<H2>Guilt</H2>
<P>
Guilt is a miserable game we play with ourselves. It's the price we pay for not taking an honest, compassionate, realistic, forgiving look at our own reality. It's a game of make-believe with bitter consequences.
<P>
Guilt is anger directed at ourselves. We get angry with ourselves for something we should have done or shouldn't have done. It accumulates over time. Our self-punishment becomes worse with each repeated occurrence. (&QUOT;I should have known better!&QUOT;)
<P>
Fear steps in. We become afraid of situations in which we might fail to live up to our personal expectations. We're afraid of what we might do to ourselves if we fail again. We're afraid of our own anger.
<P>
We avoid new people, situations, activities. We settle into a predictable rut, and then feel guilty we aren't doing more for ourselves. Some people become immobilized with guilt, afraid of doing anything lest they disappoint themselves again.
<P>
This cycle of negative energy--from ourselves to ourselves--can have devastating effects. It poisons relationships, inhibits growth, stifles expansion. And it hurts. It can become self-hatred. It puts enormous stress on the mind, emotions, and body.
<P>
Over time, it can kill.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>When lovely woman stoops to folly, And finds too late that men betray, What charm can soothe her melancholy? What art can wash her guilt away?

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Perhaps the most tragic part about guilt is that it is thoroughly unnecessary.
<P>
That's the bad news. Now, let's lighten up a bit and discuss the good news: after reading this chapter you'll never have to feel guilty again. You probably will, but you won't have to. Once you understand how guilt works, you don't have to let it do its dirty work on you.
<P>
We all have images, beliefs, and expectations about ourselves. They usually begin, &QUOT;I am a good person, and good people . . . . &QUOT; Most of these expectations are cultural and were &QUOT;sold&QUOT; to us when our sales resistance was particularly low--when we were children. We bought them. And we reconfirm the purchase every time 
we feel guilt.
<P>
To illustrate, let's take a fairly common example. We're on a diet. We want to lose some weight. Chocolate cake is not on our diet. We eat the cake. We feel guilty.
<P>
What images or beliefs about ourselves might have been violated by eating the cake?
<P>
&QUOT;I am a good person, and good people take care of their body, keep commitments with themselves, have willpower, eat only things that are good for them, care about how they look, follow through on plans, meet goals, set a good example for others, and care about their loved ones.&QUOT; Something along those lines.
<P>
This is what good people do, but what did we do? When we describe our guilty actions to ourselves, we tend to exaggerate. Remember the fast-talking, bad-mouthing vulture? It has a field day. Squawk, squawk, squawk. Negative, negative, negative. Bad, bad, bad. Shame, shame, shame. It might sound something like this:
<P>
&QUOT;I'm getting big as a house, and still I ate the fattening, empty-caloried piece of cake after having too much to eat at dinner anyway. I ignored all inner guidance to the contrary. I broke a solemn agreement with myself not to eat fattening foods. I have no willpower. I damaged my body by adding extra fat to it. I already look terrible, but now I'll look worse. I can't accomplish anything. I never do what I tell myself I'm going to do. I hurt my loved ones by setting a bad example of how to diet after I told them I was going to lose weight. If I don't care about myself, at least I could care about the people I love.&QUOT; And that's just round one.
<P>
The pristine image we have of ourselves is repeatedly violated by our despicable actions.
<P>
What to do? Well, the small print at the bottom of the &QUOT;I am a good person . . . &QUOT; contract reads, &QUOT;And when I'm not, I'll feel guilty.&QUOT; Feeling guilty lets us prove we're still a good person.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The New England conscience doesn't stop you from doing what you shouldn't; it just keeps you from enjoying it.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>CLEVELAND AMORY</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

After all, who feels bad about doing bad things, bad people or good people? Good people, of course. Bad people enjoy doing bad things. Bad people feel wonderful doing bad things.
<P>
To prove we're good, we punish ourselves with guilt. This allows us to maintain the image that we are all of those wonderful things. By feeling guilty, we're saying, &QUOT;I did it this time, but I'll never ever do it again. See how much this hurts me? I don't want to hurt this bad again. So I promise, cross my heart and hope to die, I'll never ever do it again.&QUOT;
<P>
Guilt allows us to pretend something is true about ourselves that, based on results, isn't. It lets us maintain an inaccurate image about ourselves, an image that does not match our actions.
<P>
Am I saying we're not good people? Not at all. That part's true. The falsity begins with &QUOT;...and good people . . . &QUOT; Do good people always, only, and exclusively do those things? Of course not.
<P>
Do good people sometimes not take care of their bodies? Sure. Do good people sometimes break commitments with themselves? Yes. Do good people sometimes lack willpower? Absolutely. Do they always eat things that are good for them? Ha! Do they always care about how they look? Hardly. Do they always follow through with their plans, always meeting their goals? Nonsense. Do they always set a good example for others? Of course not. And do they always care about their loved ones? Afraid not.
<P>
The truth is, good people do do all those good things and sometimes they don't.
<P>
You are a good person. You do a lot of good things. And sometimes you don't. Does that alter the fact that you're good? Not at all. It merely confirms the fact that you're a human being.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I have, all my life long, been lying till noon; yet I tell all young men, and tell them with great sincerity, that nobody who does not rise early will ever do any good.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>SAMUEL JOHNSON</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Guilt not only protects an erroneous gilt-edged image we have about ourselves; it also lets us do the thing we felt guilty about doing again. When we've &QUOT;paid the price&QUOT; for our &QUOT;crime,&QUOT; we're free to do it again as long as we're willing to pay the price again. The price? More guilt. &QUOT;How badly do I want the cake? Is it worth two hours of guilt? No. I'll take a smaller piece and only feel guilty for an hour.&QUOT;
<P>
We plea-bargain with ourselves before we even commit the crime.
<P>
So, guilt as it's popularly practiced in our culture (a) feels lousy, (b) has devastating effects on our mind, emotions, and body, (c) maintains an inaccurate image of what &QUOT;good people&QUOT; are and do, (d) allows us to believe one thing about ourselves while doing something completely contradictory, and (e) lets us continue doing things that may not be in our best interests.
<P>
Talk about your nonproductive activities. And what good is there in guilt? Guilt is anger at ourselves. Anger is the energy for change. Therefore, guilt can be used as the energy for personal change. We can use the energy to change the image of how we should be <I>or</I> change the action we feel guilty about.
<P>
There is also the twinge of guilt we feel before taking part in the contrary action. The twinge is a much quieter sensation. Easier on the mind, body, and emotions. The twinge of guilt is our friend. Just as the warning light in our car reminds us to get gas, this twinge tells us when we're about to trigger a more painful form of guilt.
<P>
When you're about to do something--or even contemplating something--and feel the twinge of guilt, stop. The twinge of guilt is telling you you're off balance. You are about to take an action that would violate an image you have about yourself.
<P>
At this point, rather than plea-bargain or blindly rush ahead, do one of two things--change the image or the action. You can change the image you have about yourself, bringing it up to present-day reality, or you can not take the action that violates your image.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>MAE WEST:  For a long time I was ashamed of the way I lived.<P>
"Did you reform?"<P>
MAE WEST:  No; I'm not ashamed anymore.
</I></CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

If you do either one, you will not have the punitive, painful, lasting guilt.
<P>
Take chocolate cake, for example. You have lots of options for changing the image. You could change your belief to include occasional forays into cakedom, or you could decide your weight is fine as it is and call off the diet, or you could promise to take a long walk after dinner, or any other alteration of the image that currently says, &QUOT;Chocolate cake is always forbidden.&QUOT; Changing the action is simple: don't eat the chocolate cake. (Once again: simple, but not necessarily easy.)
<P>
If you do one of those two things--change the image or the action--you will not feel guilty about eating the chocolate cake. If you don't change the image or the action, it's back to the old cycle of crime and punishment.
<P>
In addition to the obvious physical, emotional, and mental benefits of breaking the cycle of guilt, here are three others:
<P><OL>
	<B><LI><I>Breaking the guilt cycle gives us a more realistic view of ourselves and humanity in general.</I></B> One of the values of the &QUOT;tell-all&QUOT; biographies is that they let us see that good people--great people--who have accomplished laudable, extraordinary things, are human beings, too. We all have a full complement of quirks, foibles, preferences, habits, lusts, and temptations. Sometimes they serve us; sometimes they don't. And so what? It's the human condition. Nothing to get upset about.
<P>
	<B><LI><I>It lets us set more reasonable goals.</I></B> So we eat a piece of chocolate cake now and again. So we don't lose three pounds a week. Maybe we lose only one pound a week. That's still 52 pounds a year. We can take it easier on ourselves, taking time for what we once called &QUOT;failure&QUOT; and now call &QUOT;diversion.&QUOT;
<P>
	<B><LI><I>It lets us do things that are truly important.</I></B> By not kidding ourselves and cluttering up the daily &QUOT;agenda for action&QUOT; with pipe dreams, we can focus more clearly and with greater determination on the truly important tasks at hand. If our mind is not cluttered with twenty or thirty things we &QUOT;should&QUOT; be doing, it's easier to do the two or three things that really must be done.
</OL><P>
Freeing yourself from guilt is a gradual progression. Guilt, for most people, is an automatic response. When it goes off--and it will--please don't feel guilty about feeling guilty. And if you do feel guilty about feeling guilty, don't feel guilty about feeling guilty about feeling guilty. And if you do feel guilty about feeling guilty about . . . .
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>If error is corrected whenever it is recognized as such, the path of error is the path of truth.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>HANS REICHENBACH</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Some people create a New Enlightened Image of themselves that says, &QUOT;I am a good person and I no longer feel guilt.&QUOT; Please, change that image before you even create it. Probably the most accurate one you can have is, &QUOT;I am a good person and I feel what I feel,&QUOT; because that's the way it seems to go. Sometimes it's guilt and sometimes it's glory.
<P>
If you're in a cycle of guilt, there are techniques to help you change your image or your actions. But first, let's talk about resentment.

<H2>Write Down the Good</H2>
<P>
Whenever something good happens, write it down. Buy a special notebook--perhaps one of those cloth-covered, fancy, hard-cover ones--and use it to list all the good in your life.
<P>
Include the good that happens to you and the good you do for yourself and for others. Spend ten minutes a day--or longer--remembering and writing the good.
<P>
The entries don't have to be long. They don't have to make sense to anyone but you. &QUOT;Watched beautiful sunrise,&QUOT; &QUOT;Talked to Grandma,&QUOT; &QUOT;Saw great TV show,&QUOT; &QUOT;Pain in left arm is less,&QUOT; &QUOT;Got letter from Chris.&QUOT;
<P>
Begin your notebook with the entry, &QUOT;Bought myself the most wonderful book,&QUOT; followed by, &QUOT;Am writing the most wonderful book&QUOT;--because you will be.
<P>
We tend to forget the good and remember the bad. We seem to be programmed that way. Writing down the good helps reprogram us. We retrain ourselves to focus on the positive and then to work with that positivity in a physical, material way (writing).
<P>
Use the book whenever you're feeling low. Read through it. Remember the good. It will lift your spirits and help reestablish your self-esteem.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Doing Things with Joy Will Create More Joy</H2>
<P>
If you want more joy in your life, do whatever you're doing with more joy.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>There are some days when I think I'm going to die from an overdose of satisfaction.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>SALVADOR DALI</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

How? Just do it. How do you behave when you're joyful? Behave that way. What do you think when you're joyful? Think that way. How do you feel when you're joyful? Feel that way.
<P>
The joy begins a cycle of joy, which produces more joy, which produces even more joy.
<P>
You don't have to do anything special or different--just do whatever you're doing with joy.
<P>
The same is true of loving, happiness, compassion--all the good attitudes of life. Doing with loving produces more loving. Doing with happiness produces more happiness. Doing with compassion produces more compassion.
<P>
It's a wonderful, upward spiral that starts whenever you decide to start it. How about now?
<P>

No matter how powerful we are, we have a few fairly significant limitations:
<P><OL>
	<LI>We can put our physical body in only one place at one time.
<P>
	<LI>We have only twenty-four hours each day, 365 days each year. (Except every fourth year, when we get one more day.)
<P>
	<LI>We have only so many years on this planet. (Somewhere between zero and one hundred fifty, tops.)
</OL><P>
Given all this, it's obvious that we can't--contrary to the claims of some positive thinkers, self-help books, and TV commercials--&QUOT;Have it all.&QUOT; There's just too much &QUOT;all&QUOT; and not enough time.
<P>
You can, however--contrary to the claims of negative thinkers, third-grade teachers, and those who always listen to reason--have anything you want. The only limitations on &QUOT;anything&QUOT; are, &QUOT;Can it be gotten by anyone?&QUOT; and &QUOT;Is it available?&QUOT; If the answer to those two questions is yes, it's there for you as well.
<P>

Don't get lost in &QUOT;possible&QUOT; or &QUOT;impossible.&QUOT; If you have no money and say, &QUOT;I want ten million dollars,&QUOT; some might think it's impossible. But it's not. Lots of people have started out with no money and made ten million dollars.
<P>
Just concern yourself with &QUOT;workable&QUOT; and &QUOT;not-workable.&QUOT; Not-workable might be, &QUOT;I want to be the first man on the moon.&QUOT; That's not workable. It's already been done. But to be the first woman on the moon--that's workable. It hasn't been done yet.
<P>
To get what you want takes ten simple steps. Simple, but if your desire is gargantuan, not necessarily easy. These ten steps also work for less-than-gargantuan desires, in which case fulfillment will be easier.
<P>
If you keep in mind that you can't have <I>everything</I> you want, here's how to get anything you want:
<P><OL>
	<LI>Focus all your attention on what you want. Be &QUOT;obsessed&QUOT; by it.
<P>
	<LI>Visualize and imagine yourself doing or having whatever it is you desire.
<P>
	<LI>Be enthusiastic about getting and having it.
<P>
	<LI>Know exactly what you want. Write down a detailed description. Draw pictures. Make models.
<P>
	<LI>Desire it above all else. Above everything else. Above all.
<P>
	<LI>Have faith with involvement. Know you can have it, that it's already yours. Be involved with whatever you need to get it.
<P>
	<LI>Do the work required. How do you know how much work is required? When you have it, that was enough. Until you've got it, it's not enough.
<P>
	<LI>Give up all attitudes and activities opposing your goal.
<P>
	<LI>Pretend you already have it.
<P>
	<LI>Be thankful for what you already have.
</OL><P>
There. That's it. How to get anything you want.
<P>
If you have a life-threatening illness, these steps can be the blueprint for your recovery. As long as one other person has survived the illness you currently have, you can be number two. And if no one has survived the illness, you can be number one.

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Frankly, however, the stickler in there--&QUOT;the fine print,&QUOT; if you will--is number five: Desire it above all else. Some people wonder if there is something beyond this physical world. They start to desire--above all else--an answer to the question, &QUOT;What happens after death?&QUOT;
<P>
If they believe in God, they often--above all else--want to know God, to feel God's presence more abundantly, to prepare, as they say, &QUOT;to meet their maker.&QUOT;
<P>
Even W. C. Fields, shortly before his death (Christmas Day, 1945), was discovered by a friend propped up in bed reading a Bible. &QUOT;Bill!&QUOT; his friend said. &QUOT;You don't believe in God. What are you doing reading the Bible?&QUOT;
<P>
&QUOT;Looking for loopholes,&QUOT; Fields replied. I like to think he found his loophole.
<P>
The struggle is not just between the habit of negative thinking and the positive focus required to heal your body; the struggle is also between staying here--in this body, on this planet--or going on to someplace many people have described as far greater than here.
<P>
As the king in The King and I said, &QUOT;Is a puzzlement.&QUOT;
<P>
As the bumper sticker reads: &QUOT;Everybody wants to go to Heaven, but nobody wants to die.&QUOT;
<P>
Or, as I say, &QUOT;You can have anything you want; you just can't have everything you want.&QUOT;
<P>
(Lots more on choosing and obtaining what you want is in my book DO IT! Let's Get Off Our Buts. Available at bookstores, or call 1-800-LIFE-101.)

<H2>What Is Your Purpose?</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>To every thing there is a season,  and a time to every purpose  under the heaven.

Everyone has a purpose. Very few people know what theirs is. What's yours?
<P>
A purpose can be summed up in just a few words. It usually begins, &QUOT;I am . . . .&QUOT; It's a simple but powerful statement about why you're here and what you are here to do.
<P>
In fact, it's what you've already been doing all along. You have been fulfilling your purpose your whole life, even if you don't consciously know what your purpose is.
<P>
A purpose is not a goal. A purpose can never be obtained, reached, or checked off. A purpose is fulfilled, continuously, in every moment. Goals that can be defined, achieved, and noted are but way stations along life's purpose.
<P>
Some examples of purposes: &QUOT;I am a joyful explorer,&QUOT; &QUOT;I am a lover of life,&QUOT; &QUOT;I am a servant of spirit,&QUOT; &QUOT;I am a giver of happiness,&QUOT; &QUOT;I am a willing student of life,&QUOT; &QUOT;I am a scout,&QUOT; &QUOT;I am a servant of humanity,&QUOT; &QUOT;I am a joyful giver,&QUOT; &QUOT;I learn and I teach,&QUOT; &QUOT;I know and I grow,&QUOT; &QUOT;I am a silent contributor,&QUOT; &QUOT;I am a cheerful disciple,&QUOT; &QUOT;I am an intense appreciator,&QUOT; &QUOT;I am a lighthearted creator.&QUOT; Get the idea?
<P>
A purpose is general enough to fit many situations, but specific enough to fit you perfectly. &QUOT;I am a student of life&QUOT; might fit almost anyone. &QUOT;I am a festive student of life&QUOT; might be you.
<P>
You may want your life to go in a certain way. That's not necessarily your purpose. Statements about what you want are called affirmations. We'll talk about those later. Your purpose is what you are already doing. You can look back on your life and say, &QUOT;Yes, I've been doing that all along,&QUOT; and you can look ahead and say, &QUOT;Yes, that's what I'll be doing from now on.&QUOT;
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

The purpose also implies directed action and movement. &QUOT;I'm here&QUOT; or &QUOT;I'm a human&QUOT; or &QUOT;I am a child of God&QUOT; may be accurate, but they don't indicate movement. A purpose indicates both movement and direction.
<P>
To discover your purpose, begin by telling yourself, &QUOT;I want to know my purpose.&QUOT; It may be immediately evident, or it may take a while to reveal itself.
<P>
Look back on your life. Write down the words (uplifting ones, please) that describe the activities and general thrust of your life thus far. As you write, a few may hit you as &QUOT;right.&QUOT; You can also ask the people who know you well to suggest words (uplifting ones, please) that apply to you.
<P>
Write the words that seem right on another piece of paper. Experiment with them. Eventually the two or three that describe the thrust of your life will reveal themselves.
<P>
A purpose is not something you create; it's something you discover.
<P>
Once you know your purpose, it becomes a golden divining rod. When you're wondering, &QUOT;Should I do this or should I do that?&QUOT; look to your purpose. If one action is in line with your purpose and the other is not, the choice of which way to move becomes clear. If neither is in line with your purpose, look for more options. If both are in line with your purpose, it's dealer's choice.
<P>

It's a good idea to keep your purpose to yourself. This keeps it powerful and prevents comments such as, &QUOT;You don't seem much like a joyful giver to <I>me!&QUOT;</I> Keeping your purpose private also removes the temptation to choose a purpose that will impress others. (&QUOT;Let's see, what would sound real good?&QUOT;)
<P>
Once you discover your purpose, you have answered the time-honored question, &QUOT;Why am I here?&QUOT;
<P>
If you know your purpose, but haven't been fulfilling it as completely as you might, this could be contributing to your discontent.

If you know your purpose is &QUOT;I am a joyful giver,&QUOT; but you've been more of a begrudging giver or a joyful hoarder, that can cause dis-ease: blockages of energy, a sense of not belonging here, a feeling &QUOT;something's not right&QUOT; (and all the negative thoughts that accompany that feeling).
<P>
When you bring yourself more in line with your purpose--in an involved, active way--you may notice your energy flows more freely, the blocks and the tensions in your body release, you become more active, vibrant, and alive--healthier.

Most people don't know what they want. They think they know, but they really don't. An interview might sound something like this:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><UL TYPE=SQUARE>
	<LI>&QUOT;What do you want?&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;I want a million dollars.&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;What would you do with it?&QUOT;

	<LI>&QUOT;Then what?&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;I'd buy things.&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;Like what?&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;A car. A house. Furniture.&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;Then what?&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;I'd travel.&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;Where?&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;Uh, Europe, Hawaii.&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;Then what?&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;I'd lie back and enjoy my life.&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;Doing what?&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;Driving my car. Living in my house. Swimming in my pool. Watching TV.&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;All the time?&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;Well, no. I'd travel some more.&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;Where?&QUOT;
	<LI>&QUOT;Uh, I don't know. What does it matter where? Would you get off my back!?&QUOT;</UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Most people could not make a list--one through ten, in order of importance--of what they want to have, do, or be.
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Having such a list is invaluable. It helps us sort the opportunities that come our way. (Contrary to the popular belief, opportunity doesn't knock just once--it will knock you down.) It helps us set goals. It assists us in making plans. It answers that burning question, &QUOT;What am I going to <I>do</I> for the rest of my life?&QUOT;
<P>
Avoid the inaccurate statement people in loss situations tend to make. Don't say, &QUOT;If I only had my health (or whatever was recently lost), I wouldn't ask for anything ever again!&QUOT; Don't kid yourself. If you had your health back, you'd soon want other things. So, find out what those other things are. Sometimes by finding out what those things are and by doing them, you can have your health &QUOT;miraculously&QUOT; return.
<P>
To make your list, get a few hundred 3 x 5 cards and begin by writing down everything you want to have, do, or be--one per card. Free-associate. The sky's the limit. Write down all your desires, goals, wants, and needs. Spend some time with it. Include material, mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual goals. Make a complete list.
<P>
Now review the list. How many of the things do you really want, and how many did you write down because you think you should want them? Do you really want, say, a Rolls Royce, or is that just a symbol of something else? (Have you ever driven a Rolls Royce?) Remove from the list the things you don't really want.
<P>
Go through the list again and, with the ten steps from the chapter &QUOT;You Can Have Anything You Want--You Just Can't Have Everything You Want&QUOT; in mind (page 191), ask yourself about each item, &QUOT;Am I willing to do the work required?&QUOT; &QUOT;Am I willing to make a plan and follow all ten steps to get this?&QUOT; If you've discovered your purpose, ask yourself, &QUOT;Is this in line with my purpose?&QUOT; If the answer to any of those questions is no, remove the card from the pile, say good-bye to that goal, and let it go. The next time you think about this goal, tell yourself, &QUOT;I thought about this one and decided not to do it.&QUOT;
<P>
Now see if any items on your list are in conflict with any others. &QUOT;I want to be a concert pianist&QUOT; may conflict with &QUOT;I want to be an Olympic medalist.&QUOT; (Each requires a lot of daily practice.) &QUOT;I want to party every night&QUOT; and &QUOT;I want a quiet home life&QUOT; seem to conflict. (If you go out partying every night you might have a quiet home life--you won't be there, but your home will be quiet.) Between the two conflicting desires, choose the one you want more and cross the other off your list.
<P>
Then do a first-pass prioritization. Sort the cards into three piles: &QUOT;A&QUOT; (I want this very, very much), &QUOT;B&QUOT; (I want this a lot), or &QUOT;C&QUOT; (I want this).
<P>
When you're done, count the number of A's, B's, and C's. If you have more than ten A's, eliminate all the B's and C's. if you have ten A's and B's, eliminate all the C's. (people seldom get to the C's anyway, so why pretend?) Keep eliminating until you have ten.
<P>
Go through the cards and pick the one that's most important. Then go through the remaining nine and select the most important. Continue until all ten are prioritized.
<P>
On each card, answer one important question: &QUOT;How will I know when I've reached this goal?&QUOT; Be specific. Then you'll know when to cross it off your list to make room for another.
<P>
Behold--Your Life Plan.
<P>
Given that we only have twenty-four hours in the day, 365 (or 366) days in the year, and only so many more years on this planet, achieving this list may be all you'll have time for. Certain material items will be obtained and replaced by others, but some goals, such as being healthy and feeling happy, may take the rest of your life--even if that's another ninety-nine years.

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<H2>Accountability</H2>
<P>
If I even <I>hint</I> that people have more to do with creating, allowing, or promoting what happens to them than they ordinarily think, some people immediately take the defensive. &QUOT;You mean this is my fault?! Is that what you're trying to tell me?&QUOT;
<P>
No, that's not what I'm trying to tell anyone. That's the dark side of accountability--fault, blame, guilt. It's also the inaccurate side, a misuse of the concept. It's as though I gave someone a hammer and, instead of using it to hang pictures, the person used it to smash frames and then told me, &QUOT;This hammer was a lousy thing to give me.&QUOT;
<P>
The light side of account-ability is realizing a simple fact--we are far more powerful than we generally like to admit. If we can see, for example, that we had a hand in creating, allowing, or promoting something we don't like in our life--even a life-threatening illness--we can also see how we have the power to get rid of it.
<P>
The word accountability comes from an ancient Roman term, which meant &QUOT;to stand and be counted.&QUOT; I'm merely suggesting you might want to stand more and be counted (account-able).
<P>
Take a look at what you're happy with in your life--the people, the objects, what you've learned, all you've accomplished. The idea of accountability says you had a hand in all that--that you created, promoted, or allowed all of the good in your life.Let's take a look at creating, promoting, and allowing.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>It is the commonest of mistakes to consider that the limit of our power of perception is also the limit of all there is to perceive.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>C. W. LEADBEATER</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<B>Create.</B> You saw it, you wanted it, you went out and got it. Simple creation. Maybe after you got it you didn't want it as much, but you got it nonetheless. It was your doing. If you saw, say, a Picasso reproduction and wanted it for your living room--you saw it, you bought it, you hung it in your living room. Creation.
<P>
<B>Promote.</B> Here you were a co-creator. Someone or something else was involved and together you created it, but it might not have happened if you did not have some outside influence. A friend has a Picasso hanging in her living room and offers to sell it to you. You think, &QUOT;Not bad. Sure, I'll buy it.&QUOT; It ends up in your living room.
<P>
<B>Allow.</B> More subtle still. In these situations, you could have said, &QUOT;Stop&QUOT; or done something earlier on to avoid it, but you didn't. The same friend gives you the Picasso for your birthday. You think it's all right, but not what you would have chosen for the living room. You do, however, have that bare spot on the wall. It's been bare for months. You can't say you don't like it, because that's not entirely true. Besides, it might hurt your friend's feelings. And you can't say you have no place to hang it, because that's obviously not true either. So, accompanied by feigned squeals of delight, the Picasso ends up in your living room. And, over time, you've grown to like it there.
<P>
If you look at everything you like in your life, you'll find you had something to do with getting it--even if it was a passive act of allowing it to happen.
<P>
Now, apply these same concepts to little things in your life you don't like. Start small, now. Don't immediately stalk the great tragedies. That's one of the best ways of dismissing a new idea without having to fully explore it: apply it to the most challenging situation you can imagine and see if the concept holds up. It probably won't. It's as though we were newly introduced to math and an older relative suddenly gives us a problem in trigonometry: &QUOT;Here. See if your math can solve this.&QUOT; Eventually it can, but right now we're at nine minus six equals three.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>HOWARD W. NEWTON</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

So start with, say, the pictures on the walls you don't like. How did they get there? Why are they still there? You probably participated to some degree in creating, promoting, or at least allowing them to be there. If it's your apartment and the pictures are still there five minutes from now, you are allowing them to remain by not taking them down.
<P>
Every so often we like to pretend we are the victim. We had nothing to do with it. We didn't want it. It just happened. That, in fact, is a good definition of a victim: a person to whom life happens. As someone said, &QUOT;There are three kinds of people in the world: the ones who make life happen, the ones to whom life happens, and the ones who wonder, `What happened?'&QUOT; Victims fall (after slipping on a banana peel left there by some inconsiderate person) into the latter two categories.
<P>
Being a victim can become a habit--also the source of some of our best anecdotes. Most stand-up comics make a living from it. Stand-up comedy is mostly one &QUOT;victim story&QUOT; after another. Rodney Dangerfield has gained enormous respect telling stories about how little respect he gets. 
Victim stories can be fun--although the victim may not think so (until much later). Here are some victim stories, taken from actual auto insurance accident reports:
<P><blockquote>
Coming home I drove into the wrong house and collided with a tree I don't have.
<P>
The guy was all over the road. I had to swerve a number of times before I hit him.
<P>
In my attempt to kill a fly, I drove into the telephone pole.
<P>
I had been driving for forty years when I fell asleep at the wheel and had the accident.
<P>
To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front, I hit the pedestrian.
<P>
An invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my vehicle, and vanished.
<P>
The indirect cause of this accident was a little guy in a small car with a big mouth.
<P>
The telephone pole was approaching. I was attempting to swerve out of its way when it struck my front end.
<P>
The pedestrian had no idea which way to run, so I ran over him.
<P>
I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother-in-law, and headed over the embankment.

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Note the lack of accountability in these. That may be one reason they're so funny--we remember the lame excuses we've invented in the past. &QUOT;The telephone pole was approaching,&QUOT; 
indeed.
<P>
It's fine to tell victim stories, but when we start to believe them, we get into trouble. Inherent in that belief are the underlying beliefs, &QUOT;I have no control over my life,&QUOT; &QUOT;I can't have things the way I want them,&QUOT; and &QUOT;I'm not worthy of what I want.&QUOT;
<P>
Take a look at some occurrence--small, now--that you felt victimized by. Tell yourself the story as though you were telling it to a sympathetic friend, with all the bitter details.
<P>
Then take a look at the same story, and see if you can find some areas in which you were accountable--areas in which you helped, even in some small way, to create, promote, or allow whatever happened. You'll probably start seeing glimmers of, &QUOT;Well, if I had followed my instinct and done this, the outcome would have been different.&QUOT; Or, &QUOT;I made it even worse by . . . .&QUOT; Or, &QUOT;I could have left half an hour before.&QUOT;
<P>
To help find areas of greater response-ability in the story, here are some clues:
<P><OL>
	<B><LI><I>Go back in time.</I></B> Usually we start a victim story at the point we can claim to be The Innocent. &QUOT;I was just standing there, minding my own business when . . . .&QUOT; If we go back in time, we often find the innocence fades. &QUOT;I was all ready to go when Paul called and said he couldn't make it.&QUOT; If we go back in time, we might discover we canceled an appointment at the last minute with Paul the week before, or Paul had a history of being unreliable, or Paul had mentioned something else might come up. When we go back, we usually find we had some information or experience that takes the bloom off our innocence.
<P>
	<B><LI><I>What were you pretending not to know?</I></B> We all have an inner voice that gives us direction. Some people are more in touch with their voice than others are. It's not necessarily the loudest voice &QUOT;in there,&QUOT; but it's consistent, and usually correct. (I call it the Master Teacher.) Often when something bad happens, people will spontaneously say, &QUOT;I knew it!&QUOT;--a highly accountable statement. But then they immediately revert to blame, accusations, and other forms of playing victim. What did our Master Teacher tell us about the situation? It might have been &QUOT;Don't go&QUOT; or &QUOT;Be careful,&QUOT; yet we went and we weren't careful and--voil--a victim story. Not that you should follow every voice inside your head, of course. If, however, you get a message from yourself, it's certainly worth checking out. Also, as you learn to listen to your Master Teacher, you'll be able to distinguish it from the voice of your lust, the voice of your discontent, the voice of your fear, and so on. (More on how to call upon this helpful inner voice later.)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>JANE AUSTEN</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

	<B><LI><I>What thoughts did you have about the situation?</I></B> Did you, perhaps, through worry or doubt or unwillingness or some other negative thinking, contribute to what happened? Let's use the example of Paul canceling at the last moment. Maybe you had the thoughts: &QUOT;I'm not sure I want to go to this place,&QUOT; or &QUOT;I don't know if I want to spend time with Paul,&QUOT; or &QUOT;I don't feel like going out,&QUOT; or &QUOT;I wish I could watch TV tonight.&QUOT; Sometimes we think something, our wish is granted, and then we complain because we got what we wanted. The same is true of wanting to do something so much that our unworthiness surfaces. &QUOT;I really want to go with Paul, but maybe I won't be good enough company for him,&QUOT; or &QUOT;I never get to go to places with people I really want to, like Paul,&QUOT; or &QUOT;If I were Paul, I wouldn't go out with me.&QUOT; Remember: what we fear can come upon us.
</OL><P>
Are there some situations in which we really are victims? Of course. There are evil, destructive, deceitful people who will manipulate you into giving them what they want by promising whatever they think you need. In trusting, you get taken; by risking, you get took. Sharks are one of the dangers of swimming in tropical waters.

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

I am suggesting, however, that we have more choices than we realize in situations we would normally think of as choiceless. We are more powerful than the persona we've been programmed to believe is us.
<P>
The more you can look at all the incidents of your life--good and bad--from an accountable point of view, the more you'll reclaim the power you've given to the illusion of &QUOT;random&QUOT; situations &QUOT;out there.&QUOT;
<P>
Remember the three magic words: Create, Promote, Allow--C. P. A.--Account-ability.
<P>
Continue exploring the concept by considering more and more important situations with the question, &QUOT;How did I create, promote, or allow what's happening here?&QUOT; And, &QUOT;How can I create, promote, or allow more of what I want to take place?&QUOT;
<P>
If you have trouble, consider it a creative puzzle-- &QUOT;What if I were accountable?&QUOT; Also, be willing to know. The willingness to know creates the opportunities to know.
<P>
There are three aspects to accountability:
<P><OL>
	<B><LI><I>Act-knowledgment.</I></B> We simply acknowledge that we had <I>something</I> to do with the situation. We &QUOT;act knowingly.&QUOT; We may not know all that we did--consciously or unconsciously--to set it up, but we're willing to take a look and, when we find some way we were accountable, to acknowledge it. This is not blame, criticism, condemnation, or guilt. (I'll get to guilt in a moment.) It's asking a simple question: &QUOT;This happened to me, so if I had something to do with it, what was it?&QUOT;
<P>
	<B><LI><I>Response-ability is the ability to respond.</I></B> How could you have more effectively responded to the situation? What effective responses can you take now? Realize that in any situation there are response options that will either lift you higher or drag you lower. Why not take the uplifting ones? Sometimes the response is physical; sometimes it's a change of attitude; sometimes it's both. You always have the ability to respond in an elevating way. Response-ability is not blame. People often ask, &QUOT;Who's responsible for this?&QUOT; in tones that clearly mean, &QUOT;Who's to blame for this? Whom can we punish?&QUOT; That's not how I use it here. Response-ability is simply looking at the response options available, and being willing to choose uplifting ones.
<P>
	<B><LI><I>Corrective action.</I></B> If we learn something, but it doesn't lead to a change in behavior, then we haven't really learned it. It's still a concept. It may be a nice concept, a well-thought-out and brilliantly described concept--but a just concept nonetheless. When genuine learning takes place, so does a corrective action. If we say, &QUOT;Yes, we understand hammers are to be used for hanging pictures, not smashing frames,&QUOT; and we continue to smash frames, we haven't learned. We merely comprehend. To become truly accountable, one must be willing to take corrective action. We don't make plans with Paul, or next time we make plans with Paul, we have alternate plans in mind. Either of these would be corrective action.
</OL><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The price of greatness is responsibility.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

To make plans with Paul and fully expect him to be there is (multiple choice): (a) unreasonable, (b) dumb, (c) an indication we haven't learned, (d) evidence we're not being accountable to ourselves in relationship to Paul, (e) all of the above.
<P>
Corrective action incorporates forgiving yourself and others. It also includes making amends. If we spill milk on a friend's floor, we can acknowledge we did it, we can take responsibility for it, but--to be truly accountable--we take corrective action: we clean up the milk.
<P>
As you continue to examine more and more important and &QUOT;impossible&QUOT; (&QUOT;I couldn't possibly have had anything to do with that!&QUOT;) areas of your life from an accountable point of view, you'll start to get a sense of how powerful you truly are.
<P>
We use that enormous power to create--consciously and unconsciously, positively and negatively. As we look at our role in creating our life to date and see how much more we had to do with it than we thought, we can be more and more aware of our creative action. Then we can use it in more and more positive ways--such as healing.

<H2>The Joy of Service</H2>
<P>
Ironically, service--which has the same roots as the words serf, servile, servitude, and slave--seems today to indicate an exchange between equals. &QUOT;May I be of service to you?&QUOT; has a very different slant to it than &QUOT;Would you accept my charity?&QUOT;
<P>
It's one of the great open secrets of the world that by serving others you serve yourself. As Emerson said, &QUOT;It is one of the beautiful compensations of this life that no one can sincerely try to help another without helping himself.&QUOT; Those who have given to others for the joy of giving know the reward is just that--joy.
<P>
Service is a self-ish thing--in the truest sense of self-ish. We do it because it feels good. And because it feels good, we want to do more. As a poet once wrote, &QUOT;The greatest gift is to fill a need unnoticed.&QUOT; The gift is given, simultaneously, to both the giver and the receiver. &QUOT;The love I give you is secondhand: I feel it first.&QUOT;
<P>
In service, the person serving and the person being served are one. By allowing others to serve you, you serve them. By serving others, you are serving yourself. It's the cycle of giving and receiving. Soon it's hard to tell who's giving and who's receiving. It just flows.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Lord, make me an instrument of Your peace. Where there is hatred let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Besides making you feel good because you know that you have done good for others, service is physiologically good for you.
<P>
A study in Tecumseh, Michigan, for example, showed that regular volunteer work--more than any other factor--dramatically increased life expectancy. &QUOT;Men who did no volunteer work were two and a half times as likely to die during the study as men who volunteered at least once a week.&QUOT;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>ERIC HOFFER</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Doing good for others enhances the immune system, lowers cholesterol, strengthens the heart, decreases chest pains, and reduces stress. A study at Harvard showed that even thinking about doing service produced positive psychological results.
<P>
Service can be done even from bed. The phone is a great tool of service with which you can--to quote Ma Bell--reach out and touch someone.
<P>
Give to live.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Let Others Serve You</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>So long as we love we serve; so long as we are loved by others, I would almost say that we are indispensable; and no man is useless while he has a friend.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

One of the greatest forms of service is allowing others to serve you. Their giving might be of the &QUOT;charitable&QUOT; sort at first, but gradually they may learn the joy of giving. In allowing them to give, you have been part of their learning.
<P>
Giving to others feels good; it strengthens the physiology and enhances self-worth. When you let others give to you, you are giving them the gift of good feelings, strengthened physiology, and enhanced self-worth.
<P>
Each time someone does something for you, remind yourself, &QUOT;I am worthy of this.&QUOT; If you weren't worthy, it wouldn't be taking 
place. (Pragmatism 101.) You are worthy. Accept the service.
<P>
When, through your service to others, you see how much there is to be gained, you will gladly let others serve you. Or you can learn this by watching the faces of the people as they serve you.
<P>
One of the greatest myths of our culture is that of the &QUOT;rugged individualist&QUOT;--independent, self-sufficient, &QUOT;I can do it all myself.&QUOT; Hardly. Imagine what your life would be like if you had to meet all your needs yourself.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Independence? That's middle-class blasphemy. We are all dependent on one another, every soul of us on earth.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>GEORGE BERNARD SHAW</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Did you make your own clothes? Did you weave the cloth? Did you grow the cotton? Did you chop the trees to make the loom and mine the ore to make the needles? Did you make the tools to chop the trees and mine the ore? Did you invent these?
<P>
If we look beneath the surface of almost anything we rely on, the myth of &QUOT;independence&QUOT; falls apart. We are, in fact, interdependent. We depend on something someone has done--or is doing--for almost everything in our lives. And other people are depending on what we do and have done.
<P>
If you can assist others, without overtaxing or overextending yourself, do so. If you want assistance from others, ask for it. It's all part of the flow, the interaction, the interdependence, the interconnectedness of life.

<H2>Get Off the Excitement Treadmill</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The superfluous, a very necessary thing.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>VOLTAIRE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Some people become addicted to excitement, to mental-emotional-physical intensity of any kind. Some of it is &QUOT;positive,&QUOT; some of it is &QUOT;negative,&QUOT; but all of it is thrilling, demanding, exciting.
<P>
Excitement addiction, like any other addiction, requires future levels of excitement to be greater, and greater, and greater still.
<P>
The results of this are graphically illustrated in a film that features an unfortunate mouse. (No, not one of those Disney antidrug films--this was a movie about a real mouse.)
<P>
The mouse had been surgically wired so that the pleasure center of the brain was stimulated by an electric current each time the mouse touched a switch in its cage. The mouse would touch the switch, an electric current would stimulate its pleasure center, and the mouse would fall on its back writhing in ecstasy.
<P>
At first, one &QUOT;hit&QUOT; was sufficient for quite some time. After the pleasure had subsided, the mouse would lie there for a while, smoke a cigarette, wonder if it would respect itself in the morning, get something to eat, and see who was on &QUOT;The Tonight Show.&QUOT;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>In Rome you long for the country; in the country --oh inconstant!-- you praise the distant city to the stars.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>HORACE<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>In the valleys you look for the mountains. In the mountains you've  searched for the rivers. There is no where to go. You are where you belong. You can live the life you dreamed.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>JUDY COLLINS</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

As time went on, however, the interval between lever hits grew shorter, and the amount of time the mouse could hold down the lever grew longer. Eventually, the mouse abandoned all nourishment and sat, spasmodically pushing the switch several hundred times per minute.
<P>
Humans who become addicted to excitement do approximately the same thing--they need more and more but enjoy it less and less.
<P>
If you find yourself on this treadmill, get off. Slow down. Take it easy. Learn to appreciate the quieter, subtler, simpler pleasures of life.
<P>
The process is the one we discussed before-- focusing on the positive. The positive is not necessarily what will get you excited. The positive is sometimes contemplating the wonder of a plant or reflecting on the amount of time and attention that went into making even the most common of objects--say, a drinking glass.<I>Treating Type A Behavior and Your Heart</I> by Meyer Friedman, M.D., and Diane Ulmer, R.N., M.S. Available in paperback from Fawcett Books, New York.>
<P>
Replace the idea of &QUOT;excitement&QUOT; with that of &QUOT;enjoyment.&QUOT; When you feel the need for excitement, see if you can find something enjoyable instead. Too much excitement strains the body. Enjoyment, in its own quiet way, strengthens.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Take It Easier</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out of it alive.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>ELBERT HUBBARD</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Be easier on yourself, on everyone, on everything. Suspend your judgments of the way things should be, must be, and ought to be. Suspending judgments gives you greater ease.
<P>
Consider ease the antidote for disease.
<P>
Do things that bring you ease--quiet walks, resting, hot baths, being with friends, meditating, contemplating, reading, writing.
<P>
Approach life with acceptance, patience, flowing, giving, grace, effortlessness, simplicity, allowing, acquiescing, permitting, forgiving.
<P>
Write these words--and others like them--on separate cards and put them in places you will see them. Pick one of these attitudes each day and no matter what happens, meet it with that attitude.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>What Would a Master Do?</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>It often happens that I wake at night and begin to think about a serious problem and decide I must tell the Pope about it. Then I wake up completely and remember that I am the Pope.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>POPE JOHN XXIII</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

When challenged by a situation you're not quite sure how to respond to, ask yourself, &QUOT;How would a Master handle this?&QUOT; or &QUOT;How would the perfect __________ respond to this?&QUOT; (Fill in the blank with whatever &QUOT;role&QUOT; you happen to be playing--the perfect friend, the perfect boss, the perfect employee, the perfect lover, the perfect patient.)
<P>
If you have religious or spiritual beliefs, ask yourself how the One you worship would respond to the situation. If you admire certain leaders--masters--in their chosen fields, ask yourself what they would do.
<P>
You'll probably get an answer. You're not obliged to follow that answer, of course, but, you will at least have another option.
<P>
For the most part, Masters don't get upset--at least not for long. They have, as the sayings go, &QUOT;the wisdom of Solomon,&QUOT; &QUOT;the patience of Job,&QUOT; and &QUOT;the love of Christ.&QUOT; If you have this kind of wisdom, patience, and love, what is there to be upset about?
<P>
Within us we all have that kind of wisdom, patience, and love. It's just a matter of calling on it.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Complaining</H2>
<P>
Some people are remarkably good at knowing not only what's wrong, but also whom to tell about it, and how. These are the effective complainers. Their complaints often result in improvement.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Life is too short to waste In critical peep or cynic bark, Quarrel or reprimand: 'Twill soon be dark; Up! Mind thine own aim, and God speed the mark!</I><P><FONT SIZE=-1>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Most people, however, are ineffective complainers. They moan, groan, kvetch, and complain to anyone who will listen.
<P>
This phenomenon can be seen from 4 p.m. until 7 p.m. every working day. It's the daily National Convention of the &QUOT;Ain't It Awful?&QUOT; Club. The Club Motto is Miseria Libere Companio (&QUOT;Misery Loves Company&QUOT;). Bars and cocktail lounges all over the country serve drinks at half-price, and, for the price of a drink, people tell each other their troubles. For some unknown reason, this segment of time is known as The Happy Hour.
<P>
Conversations between some people consist of a litany of how unfair it all is. When these people ask their friends, &QUOT;What's new?&QUOT; what they mean is, &QUOT;Any news of fresh disasters?&QUOT;
<P>
If your learning to focus on the positive, the habit of complaining is, to mix metaphors, not flowing with the river in the direction the horse is riding. If you're looking for things to complain about, you'll find them--and you'll find the consequences of negative thinking as well.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>What a wonderful life I've had! I only wish I'd realized it sooner.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>COLETTE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

To reverse this habit, here are two suggestions:
<P><OL>
	<LI>Only complain to someone who can do something about it. If your water bill seems too high, there's no point in telling anyone but the water company or someone who's had experience dealing with the water company. If your reception on cable TV is not up to par, telling a friend will do no good unless that friend has solved a similar problem or happens to work for the cable company. Effective complaining helps keep your conversations positive. You may find some people, if they can't complain, have nothing to talk about.
<P>
	<LI>Compliment at least as often as you complain. If you're a complainer who knows how to get things done through effective complaining, well and good. I suggest, however, you add a step to each negative communication--compliment at least as often as you complain.</OL>
<P>
For every letter you write grumbling about something, write a letter of tribute as well. (It need not be to the same person or company.) Each time you ask the maitre d' over and condemn the food, invite the same maitre d' to your table and praise something.
<P>
If, in fact, you find something to praise before giving your complaint, (a) you may find the person receiving the complaint more open to hearing it (and doing something about it), and--more importantly--(b) you will be learning to look for the positive even in situations worthy of complaining.

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>You grow up the day you have the first real laugh --at yourself.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>ETHEL BARRYMORE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Probably some of the best anecdotes in your personal repertoire are stories of how disaster befell you. With the passage of time, most tragedies have a way of becoming comedies.
<P>
Start looking at &QUOT;bad&QUOT; situations in life as raw material for your opening monologue. Ever notice how much humor is based on misfortune? What's the difference between laughing about something and crying about it? Attitude. Which would you rather do?
<P>
Yes, sometimes crying is appropriate. But laughter--as long as it doesn't become a form of denial--is often the best response to those slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. As the tribulations mount, tell yourself, &QUOT;This is great! I can't wait to tell so-and-so!&QUOT;
<P>
The people you know who laugh easily, talk to them often. As Evelyn Waugh said, &QUOT;We cherish our friends not for their ability to amuse us, but for ours to amuse them.&QUOT;
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Laugh</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The growth of the human mind is still high adventure, in many ways the highest adventure on earth.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>NORMAN COUSINS</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Many years ago, Norman Cousins was diagnosed as &QUOT;terminally ill.&QUOT; He was given six months to live. His chance for recovery was one in five hundred.
<P>
He could see that the worry, depression, and anger in his life contributed to, and perhaps helped cause, his disease. He wondered, &QUOT;If illness can be caused by negativity, can wellness be created by positivity?&QUOT;
<P>
He decided to make an experiment of himself. Laughter was one of the most positive activities he knew. He rented all the funny movies he could find--Keaton, Chaplin, Fields, the Marx Bros. (This was before VCRs, so he had to rent the actual films.) He read funny stories. His friends were asked to call him whenever they said, heard, or did something funny.
<P>
He was in pain so great he could not sleep. Laughing for five solid minutes, he found, relieved the pain for several hours so he could sleep.
<P>
He fully recovered from his illness; and lived another twenty happy, healthy, and productive years. (His journey is detailed in his book, Anatomy of an Illness.) He credits visualization, the love of his family and friends, and laughter for his recovery.
<P>
Some people think laughter is &QUOT;a waste of time.&QUOT; It's a luxury, they say, a frivolity, something to be indulged in only every so often.
<P>
Nothing could be further from the truth. Laughter is essential to our equilibrium, to our well-being, to our aliveness. If we're not well, laughter helps us get well. If we are well, laughter helps us stay that way.
<P>
Since Cousins's ground-breaking subjective work, scientific studies have shown that laughter has a curative effect on the body, the mind, and the emotions.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>I have never made but one prayer to God, a very short one: "O Lord, make my enemies ridiculous."  And God granted it.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>VOLTAIRE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

So, if you like laughter, consider it <I>sound medical advice</I> to indulge in it as often as you can. If you don't like laughter, then take your medicine--laugh anyway.
<P>
Use whatever makes you laugh--movies, sitcoms, Monty Python, records, books, <I>New Yorker</I> cartoons, jokes, friends.
<P>
Give yourself permission to laugh--long and loud and out loud--whenever anything strikes you as funny. The people around you may think you're strange, but sooner or later they'll join in--even if they don't know what you're laughing about.
<P>
Some diseases may be contagious, but none is as contagious as the cure--laughter.
<P>

<H2>Do Things That Make You Happy</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>No man is a failure who is enjoying life.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>WILLIAM FEATHER</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Whatever makes you happy--as long as it doesn't hurt you or hurt someone else--do it.
<P>
Schedule pleasurable activities into your life with the same dedication, precision, and priority you give less-than-pleasurable ones.
<P>
Some people think that happiness just happens, and, yes, to a degree that's true. But happiness has a better chance of happening in situations you find enjoyable. Experienced positive focusers can find happiness in a garbage pile, but even experienced positive focusers find it easier to find happiness at a museum (or reading a good book, or watching a good TV show, or at the beach, or with friends).
<P>
Make a list of the things you enjoy doing. Do them often. Actively pursuing happiness is pursuing health.
<P>

<P>

<H2>The Colors of Light</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Joy is the sweet voice, Joy the luminous cloud-- We in ourselves rejoice! And thence flows all that charms or ear or sight, All melodies the echoes of that voice, All colors a suffusion from that light.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>COLERIDGE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


As long as I've suggested you experiment with light, let me tell you about the colors of light, too. Certain colors have certain effects on many people.
<P>
This is probably not surprising. You may have felt a difference between walking into, say, an all-yellow room and walking into an all-blue room. The investigation of color and its effects on people is now considered by many a legitimate scientific study.
<P>
The white light contains all colors. With paints, all colors mixed together form a sort of murky green-brown. When you combine all colors of direct light, however, it makes white. On a color TV, for example, when the screen is white, all the primary colors are on. The <I>absence</I> of all colors is black.
<P>
You've probably seen light go through a prism and become the colors of the rainbow. Rainbows are formed, in fact, by water molecules in the air acting as billions of tiny prisms.
<P>
When you want the benefit of all colors, use white. When you're looking for specific results, you can use specific colors.
<P>
<B><I>Red</I></B> is the color of intense, physical energy. When you need a powerful burst of energy, imagine red or look at something red. Coke does not put caffeine in its cola and paint the cans bright red for nothing. They're selling energy--raw, physical energy. The Real Thing! The Pause That Refreshes! Coke Is It!
<P>
This powerful physical energy, if overemphasized, sometimes leads to delusions of grandeur. As Edmond Rostand noted, &QUOT;I fall back dazzled at beholding myself all rosy red, / At having, I myself, caused the sun to rise.&QUOT;
<P>
When the red gets rowdy, it's often associated with mischief: &QUOT;Three jolly gentlemen, / In coats of red, / Rode their horses / Up to bed&QUOT; (Walter de la Mare). If the physical actions go too far, red becomes associated with crime: &QUOT;caught red-handed&QUOT; or &QUOT;My case is bad. Lord, be my advocate. / My sin is red: I'm under God's arrest&QUOT; (Edward Taylor).

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>For memory has painted this perfect day With colors that never fade, And we find at the end of a perfect day The soul of a friend we've made.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>CARRIE JACOBS BOND</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


The intense physical energy is also why red is the color often associated with sexuality: red-light districts and scarlet letters. As John Boyle O'Reilly wrote, &QUOT;The red rose whispers of passion / And the white rose breathes of love; / O, the red rose is a falcon, / And the white rose is a dove.&QUOT;
<P>
<B><I>Orange</I></B> is the next color in the spectrum. Orange is a color of energy, too, but a quieter, more sustaining energy. You'd use red if you needed a burst of energy; orange, for more enduring physical strength.
<P>
&QUOT;The red earth&QUOT; of the South is really more orange in color. (&QUOT;The orange earth of Tara&QUOT; doesn't sound too romantic.) Edward Markham's description of Abraham Lincoln incorporates the orange quality of abiding strength: &QUOT;The color of the ground was in him, the red earth, / The smack and tang of elemental things.&QUOT;
<P>
<B><I>Yellow</I></B> is the color of the mind, of joyful, purifying, mental energy. It's the color of lemons (so what?), smile buttons, and Joy dishwashing detergent. (Lily Tomlin: &QUOT;A friend of mine asked her four-year-old daughter, `Do you know what joy is?' and the daughter answered, `Yes. It's what gets your dishes so spotlessly clean you can see yourself.'&QUOT;) Yes, yellow light does bring clarity.
<P>
The thing we most often associate with yellow is the sun. The sun has been described as &QUOT;glorious&QUOT; (Shakespeare or Coleridge, take your pick) and &QUOT;colossal&QUOT; (Wallace Stevens)--qualities we could certainly apply to the mind (on a good day).
<P>
As Daniel Webster observed, &QUOT;Knowledge, in truth, is the great sun in the firmament. Life and power are scattered with all its beams.&QUOT; Or, as Theodore Roethke said, &QUOT;The sun! The sun! And all we can become!&QUOT;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Dear friend, all theory is gray, And green the golden tree of life.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>GOETHE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


<B><I>Green</I></B> is the color of healing and the color of learning--brilliant, emerald green. &QUOT;The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters&QUOT; (Psalm 23: 1-2). &QUOT;That happy place, the green groves of the dwelling of the blest&QUOT; (Virgil).
<P>
Andrew Marvell marveled (sorry) in 1651, &QUOT;Annihilating all that's made / To a green thought in a green shade.&QUOT; The &QUOT;annihilation&QUOT; is that of illness when the ease of green confronts dis-ease, or when the green of learning confronts ignorance. &QUOT;Keep a green tree in your heart,&QUOT; states the Chinese proverb, &QUOT;and perhaps the singing bird will come.&QUOT;
<P>
Of course, healing and learning are active processes. When you think of green, think of actively healing yourself, through physical action and active visualizations. Think of vigorously learning all you can about yourself and your life. &QUOT;April prepares her green traffic light and the world thinks Go&QUOT; (Christopher Morley).
<P>
<B><I>&QUOT;Blue</I></B> color is everlastingly appointed by the Deity to be a source of delight.&QUOT; John Ruskin said it in 1853 better than I could today. Blue is a color of spirit, of calm, of peace. &QUOT;Blue, darkly, deeply, beautifully blue&QUOT; (Robert Southey).
<P>
As the sun is yellow and usually associated withsunny thoughts, so the sky is high and blue, and the sea is deep and blue. High and deep: two good descriptions of a life fully lived. &QUOT;The spacious firmament on high, / With all the blue ethereal sky&QUOT; (Joseph Addison). &QUOT;The sea! the sea! the open sea! / The blue, the fresh, the ever free&QUOT; (Barry Cornwall).
<P>
The Apache have a chant: &QUOT;Big Blue Mountain Spirit, / The home made of blue clouds / I am grateful for that mode of goodness there.&QUOT; And the final word on blue will go to Coleridge (dear Coleridge), who reminds us that &QUOT;Saints will aid if men will call: / For the blue sky bends over all!&QUOT;
<P>
<B><I>Purple</I></B> is the color of royalty--the inner royalty that is you and the outer royalty of the divine. We seem to associate purple with kings, queens, and the main color in stained-glass windows.
<P>
Use purple when you want to feel cloaked in the grand, majestic, stately One of the universe, or the grand, majestic, stately presence within you.
<P>
It's also fun mixing colors. If you have, say, &QUOT;the blues,&QUOT; you might add the physical energy of red, which would make a more active purple. Or you could add to blue some mental energy (yellow), which would give you the green of healing.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>JAMES WELDON JOHNSON</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


If you were being a little too yellow--thinking too much at the expense of action (cowards, who sacrifice action for fearful thoughts, are often called &QUOT;yellow&QUOT;)--you could add some highly physical red, which would give you steady, reliable orange to help carry out your physical tasks. Or you could add blue to the yellow to make green and be ready for some active healing or learning.
<P>
If you add too many colors, don't worry: unlike mixing paints, when you overmix light, the worst you can end up with is white.
<P>
Use the colors you feel drawn to. Think about them surrounding and filling you with their energy. You can also look at sheets of colored paper, or wear clothes of the colors you want to imbue yourself with. As always, ask for them to impart their energy for your highest good and the highest good of all concerned.

<H2>Make a Sanctuary</H2>

If you wanted to learn wood crafting, you'd probably want not just tools, but a workroom. If you wanted to become an artist, you'd probably want not just paints, but a studio. If you wanted to become a gourmet cook, you would probably want not just pots and pans, but a kitchen.
<P>
If you want to become a &QUOT;gourmet visualizer,&QUOT; you might want not just the techniques of visualization, but also a place for you to use them. I call this place a sanctuary.
<P>
A sanctuary is a place you build in your imagination. It's an inner place for you to go to visualize, contemplate, meditate, affirm, do spiritual exercises, solve problems, get advice, heal yourself, relax, have fun, hang out, and communicate with yourself and others.
<P>
I call it a sanctuary because the word seems to incorporate the qualities of preciousness (sanctity), retreat, getting away from it all, safety, and refuge. You can call your inner place whatever you choose. Some call it a workshop; others, a shrine or an inner sanctum. The name is not important. Building and using it is.
<P>
You build a sanctuary in your imagination. The nice thing about building in your imagination is that the wait between design and construction is nonexistent. You can try something out, see how you like it, change it, see how you like that, and change your changes, all in a very short time.
<P>
To show you how quickly this can happen: imagine the Statue of Liberty. See the right arm holding up the torch and the left arm holding the tablets.
<P>
Imagine that Lady Liberty has gotten tired of holding up her right arm all these years. (She is a she, by the way--the artist's mother posed for the statue.) Imagine her switching the tablets to her right arm and the torch to her left. Then see her holding aloft the torch in her left hand while holding the tablets in her right.
<P>
That didn't take long. Can you imagine how long that would have taken to do in real life? Heck, it took them two years and Lee Iacocca just to clean the thing.
<P>
As I mentioned earlier, some people see clear pictures; others have a vague sense; while others don't see much, but listen carefully and &QUOT;know&QUOT; something happened.

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

If I asked you to draw a very rough sketch of the Statue of Liberty with the torch in her left hand, you could probably do it, even though you had never seen a left-handed Liberty before. You would be drawing your visualization of it, from your creative imagination.
<P>
In constructing your sanctuary, keep this in mind: Moss Hart, the playwright and director, bought an estate outside New York and began landscaping it. He moved a large hill from one location to another, redirected the course of a stream, and rearranged trees so the effect would be aesthetically pleasing. When George S. Kaufman came to visit and saw the changes Hart had made, he commented, &QUOT;This is what God would do if He only had money.&QUOT;
<P>
When building your sanctuary, be a god with lots of money--because in your imagination, you are.
<P>
You can have as many workers as you want, or you can snap your fingers and things will just appear. Want to change the color of the whole place? Snap your fingers, it's done. Want to make it twice as large? Snap, it's larger.
<P>
I'll give you the basic outline for a sanctuary. Keep in mind that it's your sanctuary. You can add anything else you like. There are no limitations other than the ones you place there. I, naturally, recommend limitlessness.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>MOSS HART</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


I'll suggest uses for the sanctuary later, but for now I'll just describe their basic function. Their size, shape, design, and so on, are entirely up to you. Ready? Here we go.
<P>
<B><I>Location.</I></B> Your first choice is location. Where would you like your sanctuary to be? It can be anyplace, real or imagined: on a mountaintop, floating over the ocean, on the moon, in a valley.
<P>
<B><I>Outside.</I></B> What do you want the outside of the sanctuary to look like? Choose a size (from enormous to moderate to cozy), shape (cathedral to cottage to geodesic dome), color (the full spectrum, plus colors we can't physically see). Landscape it as you please: add rivers, rock formations, galaxies, and shrubbery galore.
<P>
<B><I>Entry Way.</I></B> The entry way to your sanctuary permits <I>only</I> you to enter. How does it know it's you? Do you have a special key? Does it read your handprint? Do you have secret words, such as &QUOT;Open sez me&QUOT;? Or does it just automatically recognize you?
<P>
<B><I>White Light.</I></B> Just inside the doorway, create a perpetual white light. Whenever you enter or exit your sanctuary, automatically pass through a column of pure, white light. As you do, you are surrounded, filled, protected, and healed by this light, and only that which is for your highest good and the highest good of all concerned takes place while you're in your sanctuary.
<P>
<B><I>Main Room. </I></B>How would you like the main room of your sanctuary to be? Large? Small? Carpeted? Wood floors? Grass? How about the walls, ceiling, windows? How is it decorated? Snap into place whatever you want. If you're not entirely satisfied, snap your fingers and create something else.
<P>
<B><I>Information Retrieval System.</I></B> This can be in the main room or in a special room by itself. It's a way of getting information on whatever you want to know. It could be a computer terminal, a staff of researchers, a telephone, or anything else. All you need is a method of asking questions and getting the answers.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Three things are to be looked to in a building: that it stand on the right spot; that it be securely founded; that it be successfully executed.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>GOETHE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


<B><I>Video Screen.</I></B> Again, this can be in the main room or in its own room. It can be any size, from hand-held to wall-size. Have some comfortable chairs in front of it so you can relax and watch. What will you watch? Mostly the story of your life. You're the star; everyone else is just bit players. You can also use the video screen to play videos from the information retrieval system. Surround the screen with a white light that can go off and on.
<P>
<B><I>Ability Suit Closet.</I></B> For every ability you have or would like to have--painting, flying, being rich, playing piano--there's a suit that, when you put it on, instantly gives you that ability. When you're done with the suit, throw it on the floor. It automatically hangs itself back in the closet. That's just a minor ability of the ability suits.
<P>
<B><I>Ability Practice Area. </I></B>This is where you can try different abilities on for size. You put on the ability suit for, say, gourmet cook, and the ability practice area becomes a master chef's kitchen. You can also use this area to practice abilities as you develop them.
<P>
<B><I>People Mover.</I></B> This is the way to invite others into your sanctuary. (Remember, only you can come and go by way of the main entrance.) It can be an escalator, a conveyer belt, one of those beam-me-up-Scotty devices from Star Trek, or whatever people-moving you can imagine.
<P>
<B><I>White Light by People Mover.</I></B> Place a perpetual white light over the entrance of the people mover. In this way, anyone who comes into your sanctuary is automatically surrounded, filled, and protected by the white light, and only that which is for his or her highest good and the highest good of all concerned can take place. Anyone visiting your sanctuary passes through this white light both on entering and on leaving.
<P>
<B><I>Healing Center.</I></B> This can be a multi-room wing of your sanctuary. Here, all the healing arts are practiced. You are attended by all known and imagined healers--past, present, and future. The latest and most ancient technologies are available, as of course are all future discoveries.
<P>
<B><I>Sacred Room.</I></B> This is a special room for you to commune with yourself--to meditate, contemplate, do spiritual exercises, visualize, or just be. If you like, you can invite special friends into this room of communion.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>MICHEL EYQUEM DE MONTAIGNE<BR>1580</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


<B><I>Master Teacher.</I></B> A special feature of your sanctuary is the presence of a special teacher, a friend, someone who knows everything about you, who cares for you totally, and who loves you unconditionally. How do you discover your Master Teacher? Easy. Just stand in front of the people mover and say, &QUOT;Would my Master Teacher please come forth?&QUOT; From the column of white light in front of the people mover will emerge your Master Teacher. Take some time. Get acquainted. Show off your sanctuary. Enjoy together the sacred room.
<P>
I'll leave you two alone for a while. See you both--whenever you get around to it--in the next chapter.

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<H2>Do It</H2>
<P>
Now that you know what you want, make a plan, put it in motion, and do what you choose to do.
<P>
Here are some thoughts on successful action:
<P><OL>
	<LI>Break each goal into do-able steps. If you want to be a lawyer but haven't gotten your high school diploma, your next do-able step might be &QUOT;Call the board of education and find out where and when the next high-school equivalency test is being given.&QUOT; The next do-able step after that might be &QUOT;Take the test.&QUOT; Based on the results of the test, the next do-able steps will follow. In the meantime, you can start pricing BMWs.
<P>
	<LI>Make a plan. Once you have your next do-able step for each goal, schedule them. Get a calendar, date book, or appointment book (if you don't already have one) and fill it up.
<P>
	<LI>Be flexible. As you make progress, you'll discover new information that may lead to changes in plans.
<P>
	<LI>Be willing. Remember: &QUOT;The willingness to do creates the ability to do.&QUOT;
<P>
	<LI>Don't let how you feel about something stop you from doing what you know you need to do. Feel the feeling (fear, guilt, unworthiness, hurt, anger) and do it anyway. Move your body--physically--in the direction of your goals. The feelings may complain. Expect them to. Thank them for their &QUOT;advice&QUOT; and move ahead.
<P>
	<LI>Turn fear into excitement. As I said before, if you feel carefully, you'll notice that the physiological feeling we call &QUOT;fear&QUOT; and the physiological feeling we call &QUOT;excitement&QUOT; are the same feeling. One we label &QUOT;bad&QUOT; and the other we label &QUOT;good.&QUOT; If you feel &QUOT;that feeling&QUOT; and automatically call it &QUOT;fear,&QUOT; stop and call it &QUOT;excitement&QUOT; instead. Whenever you hear yourself saying (to yourself or to someone else) &QUOT;I'm afraid,&QUOT; change it to &QUOT;I'm excited.&QUOT; Then it becomes preparation energy. It keeps your mind focused, your energy up, your attention clear--just what you need to help you do new and &QUOT;exciting&QUOT; things.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Even if you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>WILL ROGERS</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

	<LI>Turn stubbornness into determination. Like fear and excitement, stubbornness and determination are the same energy. Both include steadfastness, constancy, power, and drive. For most people, it's a matter of turning &QUOT;won't power&QUOT; (stubbornness) into &QUOT;will power&QUOT; (determination). When you find yourself being stubborn (I don't want this), find out what you do want and, using the same energy, move toward it.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The destiny of mankind is not decided by material computation. We learn that we are spirits, not animals, and that something is going on in space and time, and beyond space and time, which, whether we like it or not, spells duty.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

	<LI>Do it as though you were teaching it to another. Set a good example, even if no one else is around. Follow through with the precision, dedication, courage, kindness, and persistence one would expect of a great educator teaching a beloved pupil. In a sense, that's exactly what you're doing--you are teaching various parts of you how to live more fully.
<P>
	<LI>Be response-able. Be willing to respond to whatever happens along your path. Don't fall into the negative-thinking trap of labeling certain occurrences &QUOT;setbacks,&QUOT; &QUOT;disappointments,&QUOT; or &QUOT;letdowns.&QUOT; Consider them, instead, challenges. Respond to them in such a way that you get what you want. That's response-ability.
<P>
	<LI>Ask. Learn to ask for what you want. Ask for help, guidance, instruction--whatever you need. The worst people can do is not give you what you ask for--which is precisely where you were before you asked. As they used to say on TV, &QUOT;You have everything to gain and nothing to lose.&QUOT; Also, don't expect people who've offered you help (especially ones close to you) to be mind readers. Let them know what you need as you need it. Don't assume they &QUOT;should&QUOT; know &QUOT;if they really loved me.&QUOT; They can love you very much and still not know. Ask.
<P>
	<LI>Do it with love. Be gentle with yourself and others. Don't become so obsessed with the goal that the process is not enjoyable. Send the light of your own loving ahead of you. When you get there, the loving will have prepared a place for you. Be kind, gentle, and enjoy the journey.</OL>

Write that in big letters somewhere you can read it often. A lot of negative thinking, depression, frustration, and illness stems from people's thinking they want something they don't really want.
<P>
How do you know what you really want? Whatever you are actively involved in getting, that's what you really want. Everything else is just what you <I>think</I> you want. If you think you want something and you're not actively involved in getting it, you're probably just kidding yourself.
<P>
It's true that, in every moment, you can't be actively involved in doing something about everything you want. How, then, can you tell what you're actively involved in?
<P>
Here's where your calendar can prove useful. Have you scheduled activities that support each of your goals in, say, the next two weeks? If not, ask yourself: &QUOT;Is this goal becoming another one of my `laters'?&QUOT; (&QUOT;I'll do it later, later, later,&QUOT; and it never gets done.)

I'm pragmatic. If someone tells me, &QUOT;I'm dependable! You can count on me,&QUOT; I say, &QUOT;Great,&QUOT; and watch carefully. If she (in the last example I used he; this time I'll use <I>she</I>) is late three times in a row, but continues to say she's dependable, I tend to base my opinion of her dependability more on her actions than on her words. Not that she means to deceive. She may, however, be deceiving herself.
<P>
If people say they want health, I look to see what they are doing about it. Are they actively involved in healing? Are they doing everything they can to promote healthy ideas, healthy feelings, and healthy actions? Are they exploring options for greater health? If so, I'd say they really want health.
<P>
If, however, they're involved in life-damaging activities, I'd say they have a desire for lesser health.
<P>
We are more than our minds, more than our thinking process. We are also more than our feelings and more than our body. Most people have spent so much time in either thinking or feeling, they think that a thought or feel that a feeling <I>is</I> them. To think you want something or to feel you want something doesn't necessarily mean that's what you want.
<P>
What you want--what you <I>really</I> want--is what you are making real through action.
<P>
If you think you want something but you're not doing much to get it, you have three choices:
<P><OL>
	<LI>You can go on the way you've been: kidding yourself and pretending you really want this thing that you don't really want--or aren't willing to do the necessary work to get. This causes frustration (&QUOT;Why can't I have what I want?), hurt (&QUOT;I never get what I want&QUOT;), resentment (&QUOT;Other people get what they want; why not me?&QUOT;), and unworthiness (&QUOT;I guess I don't really deserve it&QUOT;).
<P>
	<LI>Give up the goal. Realize it's a nice idea, and if it were in the next room, you'd probably go to the next room and partake of it. It is, however, not something you really want more than other things you are actively seeking.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>ELEANOR ROOSEVELT</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

	<LI>Do whatever is necessary to reach the goal. Eliminate from your schedule activities that support goals with lower priorities than the one in question. As you move toward your goal, certain mental, emotional, and physical objections will be raised. No matter what complaints your mind, emotions, and body fling at you, if you know you need to do it, do it anyway. Gently, lovingly--but firmly--teach the objecting parts of you that you have a new goal, a new priority, and that your actions will now be in alignment with achieving that goal.</OL>
<P>
Those are your choices. Most people choose by default--they &QUOT;choose&QUOT; #1 by not choosing, and things go on as they have in the past. I suggest you choose from options 2 or 3. Either will put you more actively in charge of your thoughts, feelings, and actions.

<H2>The Two Sides of Hope</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>He that lives upon hope, dies fasting.</I><P><FONT SIZE=-1>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Remember the story of Pandora's Box?
<P>
Pandora was sort of the Eve of Greek mythology--the First Woman, told not to do something by God (by Zeus, in this case), but she did it anyway.
<P>
Pandora was given a box (a jar, actually) and told not to open it because it contained all the evils of the world. She took the jar/box with her on her honeymoon. Alas, it was a dull honeymoon, so she opened the jar/box.
<P>
Just as in Raiders of the Lost Ark when the Nazis opened the Ark and all the ghosts came whooshing out with Industrial Light and Magic visuals and Dolby SurroundSound, when Pandora opened the jar/box, all the evils of the world escaped. The last evil in the jar/box was hope. What happened to hope is not clear. Some stories say it remained inside; others say it got out. But all agree that hope was the last item in the jar/box.
<P>
Most people interpret this as good news--yes, evil has been added to the world, but we've been given hope so that we can take care of all that evil.
<P>
Did you ever consider that hope might be one of the evils of the world?
<P>
If it weren't for hope, perhaps we would have cleaned up all the other evils long ago. We would have gotten sick and tired of being tired and sick and sent them packing--&QUOT;Back to the jar/box!&QUOT;
<P>
What we sometimes do instead is tolerate evil and hope it's going to go away. &QUOT;Oh, I hope it will be better tomorrow,&QUOT; we sigh, never doing anything productive to get rid of &QUOT;it&QUOT; today. (&QUOT;It&QUOT; being whatever evil we happen to be currently sighing about.)
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>A gentleman who had been very unhappy in marriage, married immediately after his wife died: Johnson said, it was the triumph of hope over experience.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>BOSWELL</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

The hope I'm talking about is the kind of hope that inspires passivity, resignation, and stagnation.
<P>
If there's a situation in your life--be it a life-threatening illness or any other &QUOT;evil&QUOT;--and you're using hope to stimulate you to greater and greater depths of inaction, lethargy, and torpor, the dark side of hope has gotten hold of you.
<P>
Shake it off. Become active. Do something to replace the evil with what you really want. Move toward a positive condition in which the evil cannot exist. (Don't &QUOT;get rid&QUOT; of evil--replace it with what you prefer and focus on the goodness of that.) Turn the evil around. Evil spelled backwards (&QUOT;turned around&QUOT;) is live.
<P>
You can hope things will get better, but if you're not taking specific, energetic, and frequent actions to make things better, you've got the wrong kind of hope working for you. (Or, more accurately, working against you.)
<P>
That the limiting kind of hope is almost epidemic in our culture is reflected by the frequent misuse of the word hopefully. As you may recall from Grammar 101, hopefully is an adverb (it ends in ly); therefore, it should be used to modify (describe) a verb.
<P>
Verbs are, of course, action words--run, jump, skip, look, walk, duck--words that describe movement. You can run hopefully, jump hopefully, skip hopefully, look hopefully, walk hopefully, and duck hopefully--which means you are running, jumping, skipping, looking, walking, and ducking with hope.
<P>
As the song goes, &QUOT;Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart.&QUOT; You are walking, and you're doing it with an attitude of hope.
<P>
All this is fine. It is correct English, and it is--to my way of thinking--correct living. You hope as you do something. You take an action while anticipating (hoping) the action will have a positive outcome. Well and good.
<P>
Most people, however, use the word hopefully as a replacement for the phrase &QUOT;I hope.&QUOT;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>There is nothing so well known as that we should not expect something for nothing-- but we all do and call it Hope.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>EDGAR WATSON HOWE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

&QUOT;We will hopefully be going to the store&QUOT; means, &QUOT;We will, I hope, be going to the store.&QUOT; &QUOT;This problem will go away, hopefully&QUOT; means, &QUOT;This problem will go away, I hope.&QUOT; &QUOT;Hopefully I'll be able to do it&QUOT; means, &QUOT;I hope I'll be able to do it.&QUOT;
<P>
Traditionally, this use of the word hopefully is incorrect--but so many people use it in this way that many grammarians are (reluctantly) conceding a second usage. I'm not here to debate grammar. I'm more interested in how the word went from the active &QUOT;being hopeful while taking an action&QUOT; to the passive &QUOT;I hope.&QUOT; Does that, I wonder, reflect a trend in our culture?
<P>
I look hopefully toward the day when people won't let hope stop them from doing what needs to be done. The combination of hope (anticipating a positive outcome) and action is a powerful way to get what one is hoping for.
<P>
Please use this information about hope for your upliftment and not as ammunition against others (or yourself). If someone says, &QUOT;Hopefully you'll get better,&QUOT; don't say, &QUOT;Yeah? Well, what are you doing about it?&QUOT; Go to the essence of their communication--they are wishing you well--and thank them for it.
<P>
Do, however, listen to yourself. When you use the word hope, ask yourself, &QUOT;Am I using it as a replacement for action or as an adjunct to action?&QUOT; If it's a replacement, get moving. If it's an adjunct, keep moving.

<H2>Poor Charity</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>But how shall we expect charity towards others, when we are uncharitable to ourselves? Charity begins at home, is the voice of the world; yet is every man his greatest enemy, and, as it were, his own executioner.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>SIR THOMAS BROWNE<BR>
1642</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Charity began as a wonderful word. To quote from The Dictionary of Word Origins: &QUOT;Charity was first an inner love; then a sign of this feeling; then an action or an act.&QUOT; The roots of charity include the Greek chayrs, meaning &QUOT;thanks, grace,&QUOT; and the Latin caritas, &QUOT;love, regard, affection,&QUOT; and carus, &QUOT;to hold dear.&QUOT; (Carus is also the root of such words as caress and cherish.)
<P>
And what does charity mean today? The first three definitions in The American Heritage Dictionary read &QUOT;1. The provision of help or relief to the poor; almsgiving. 2. Something that is given to help the needy; alms. 3. An institution, organization, or fund established to help the needy.&QUOT;
<P>
To give charity under this definition produces an immediate rift between giver and receiver. Although the material needs of the recipient may be met, both giver and receiver suffer separation. &QUOT;I--superior and blessed among people--give proudly to you, poor, needy person.&QUOT; &QUOT;I--poor, needy person--accept humbly this gift from you--magnificent, benevolent, rich person.&QUOT;
<P>
I am certainly not knocking charities or charitable feelings. It's just that a word that started out meaning love, regard, and affection has, for many people, come to mean pity.
<P>
This stigma on the word affects people who are, as the phrase goes, &QUOT;forced to take charity.&QUOT; (Note the implied destitution and helplessness in that.)
<P>
The onus of having to go to a charity, because of the popular misdefinition of the word, can strike deeply at one's sense of self-worth--precisely what one does not need when in need.
<P>

Ironically, most charities are happy to help people who can truly use it. That's why the charity was formed in the first place. And the people who work for most charities were drawn there by a genuine desire to help others.
<P>
I'm afraid charity is a word that will forever be associated with the sort of human condition described in Emma Lazarus's inscription on the Statue of Liberty:
<P><CENTER><I>
Give me your tired, your poor <BR>
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, <BR>
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore, <BR>
Send these, the homeless, <BR>
tempest-tossed to me: <BR>
I lift my lamp beside the golden door.</I></CENTER>
<P>
This, of course, hasn't been the policy of the Immigration Service for years. It is, however, the way in which any number of charities portray their beneficiaries when asking for donations. It's a successful tactic. It works. It will no doubt continue.
<P>
Rather than rehabilitate the word <I>charity,</I> let me introduce an alternate word--<I>service.</I>

Most of us have memories of past hurts, disappointments, and fears that keep returning. When this happens, we're letting a memory of something that happened then negatively affect us now. Fortunately, memories--like any other part of our being--can be healed.
<P>
Here's a simple technique for healing memories. Go into your sanctuary, making sure you pass through the white light at the entry way. You may want to ask your Master Teacher to join you. If so, stop by the people mover and pick up your Master Teacher. Have a seat in front of your video screen.
<P>
The white light surrounding the screen is off. On the screen, see the situation you feel upset about. Let it play itself out. Watch it as you would a movie. After it's over, go back and freeze-frame a moment you found particularly upsetting.
<P>
Imagine you have a large paintbrush full of black paint in your hand. Take the paintbrush and make a large, black X across the upsetting image on the screen. Let the image and the paint fade.
<P>
Now, the white light around the edges of the video screen begins to glow. On the screen, see the situation again, but this time let it happen exactly the way you would have liked it to happen. Remember, never lose in your imagination. Ask your Master Teacher for suggestions on winning <I>big.</I>
<P>
This process replaces the painful or fearful memory with a joyful, contented one. With some memories, you may need to repeat the process a few times; with others, once will do.
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


The healing center of your sanctuary is a powerful place. There, healing can take place instantly. Some people like to have their Master Teacher come along when they go for healing. (Some people keep their Master Teacher with them all the time. Your sanctuary and Master Teacher are only a thought away.)
<P>
How to heal your body in your healing center islimited only by your imagination. You can be given the Miracle Shot (painlessly, of course), shot with the Magic Bullet (which cures whatever ails you), or cured with the Miracle Pill. You can have healers heal you by placing their hands on you. You can lie under different colors of light and be healed in that way.
<P>
In your healing center is an infinite supply of replacement body parts, especially stocked for your body. You can snap out any part that's not quite up to par and snap in a perfect part. It only takes a second. You can do it yourself or have a whole team--like the pit crew at the Indianapolis 500--do it for you.
<P>
If you know you're having trouble with, say, your liver, snap out the old liver and snap in a new one. Heart? Snap out, snap in. (You can also replace your whole circulatory system--blood and all--while you're at it.) Immune system? Easy. Snap, snap.
<P>
You might want to look at some color drawings of various organs and where they're located. The more vivid the image and knowledge of the replacement body part, the better. You may have to replace a particularly recalcitrant part a hundred times, but that's okay. Whatever it takes, right?
<P>
You can bring in for consultation, on your people mover, the greatest medical experts in the world (any world). They're always available, alwayshave plenty of time, and never charge a cent. You can invite healers from the past, present, and future--real and imagined--to do work and to give advice.
<P>
Some people like to have a Master Healer to organize the comings and goings of all the other healers. Some people like to imagine their Master Teacher in a white coat and stethoscope. Others like the variety of new and different experts.
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Anytime you hear of a new healing method or technique that interests you, go to your healing center and try it out. Let it work perfectly for you. Create new techniques. And feel free to visit the healing center even when you're not sick. You don't have to be sick to enjoy getting better.
<P>
As I've stated before, none of the inner work you do should replace the outer work of proper medical treatment. If your outer treatment reaches an impasse, however, the inner work might help the outer along.
<P>
Some people ask their inner doctors for help in diagnosing certain &QUOT;mysterious&QUOT; ailments. When they go to their regular (outer) doctor next, they say, &QUOT;Just for the heck of it, why don't you check out __________.&QUOT; It's amazing how often __________ has something to do with the ailment.
<P>
If you have any spiritual or religious beliefs, be sure to invite the healers of your tradition--via the people mover--into your sanctuary. And don't accept some assistant--go for the Top, the Head Honcho, the Big Enchilada.
<P>
You're worth it.

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


The technique of visualization I'm about to describe can be done in your sacred room, if you like, or in a special room of the healing center. You can, as always, have your Master Teacher come along. (The Master Teacher, naturally, has the ability to join you in any inner journeys you take; makes a great guide, in fact.)
<P>
The technique is one made popular by Dr. Carl Simonton. For years, Dr. Simonton has been using nontraditional methods for treating cancer patientswho were diagnosed as untreatable and &QUOT;terminal.&QUOT; (When new patients enter his clinic for an initial consultation, Dr. Simonton looks them straight in the eye and asks, &QUOT;When did you decide to die?&QUOT;)
<P>
</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can receive a catalog of Dr. Simonton's books and tapes by calling 1-800-338-2360. Outside the U.S.: 1-817-575-2420
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Imagine whatever is not healthy as the Bad Guys and your healthy body parts as the Good Guys. Then imagine them slugging it out. The Good Guys always, always, always win.
<P>
If, for example, you have cancer cells in your body, you can see those as, say, cowboy villains in black hats and your white blood cells as heroes in white hats. They meet at the OK Corral for a showdown. Much punching and gunplay later, the &QUOT;black hats&QUOT; are in jail or boot hill, and the &QUOT;white hats&QUOT; are riding off into the sunset or going upstairs with Miss Kitty or doing whatever your white hats enjoy doing.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>JANE AUSTEN</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


You can imagine the nasty cells being dog biscuits and the good cells dogs; whenever a dog sees a biscuit, naturally he eats it. Or imagine the good cells as Pac-Man (or Ms. Pac-Man) and the bad cells as the little white dots Pac-People devour. (Am I revealing my age by mentioning Pac-Man?)
<P>
The negative emotions often connected with life-threatening illness (fear, anger, guilt, blame, unworthiness, helplessness) can be visualized away.
<P>
You can see anger, for example, as a fire (or burning embers or fire-breathing dragon) and rivers (or fire hoses or waterfalls) flowing into the fire, extinguishing it at its source. Let the water form a beautiful inner lake (or pond or reflecting pool) surrounded by peaceful trees (or mountains or rolling hills or--don't be limited by <I>my</I> imagination).
<P>
Fear can be seen as an ice cube (or iceberg or icicle) melted by the sun (or blowtorch or sauna).
<P>
If a visualization seems to &QUOT;go bad&QUOT; (the polar bear you've been chasing turns and starts chasing you), change it at once. (You run into the annual gathering of the National Polar Bear Hunter's Club--thousands of hungry hunters who have spent the past week just looking for a bear.)
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


<I>Never lose in your imagination.</I>
<P>
Another option is to imagine the harmful cells in your body mutating into non-life-threatening ones. They mutate to a point where they no longer want to be in a human body and just leave. (There are all sorts of viruses, bacteria, and parasites that want nothing to do with the human body.)
<P>
If you have an organ that's not functioning properly--a heart, say--visualize it operating perfectly. See it doing its job flawlessly. In your imagination, hear and feel it beating with strength, regularity, and vigor. If you have, for example, clogged arteries, see them open, clear, and healthy.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>The mind, in proportion as it is cut off from free communication with nature,<BR>

just as the body droops when debarred from the air and the cheering light from heaven.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


These visualizations can be done anywhere, anytime. Let boredom and impatience be the reminders to do some inner work. The checkout line at the supermarket or a dull passage on the radio can be the perfect time to heal yourself.
<P>

The options, as you may have noticed, are endless. Be creative. Have fun. If you learn to enjoy the process of healing, you'll find your health more enjoyable, too.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Listen to Your Pain</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>It would be a great thing to understand pain in all its meanings.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>PETER MERE LATHAM</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


What if pain were really your friend? What if it were giving you important advice about your life and, once you listened to and followed that advice, the pain would go away?
<P>
We learned that guilt and resentment could be used to keep us from traveling down pointless and destructive pathways of negative thinking. The same is true of pain.
<P>
Let's define pain as anything in your mind, body, or emotions you wish weren't there. It might be a physical pain (headache, sore muscles, upset stomach), an emotional pain (hurt, anger, fear), or a mental pain (confusion, doubt, rigidity).
<P>
All you have to do is talk to your pain. Ask it some questions. Listen to the answers. If the answers seem to make sense, follow the pain's advice.
<P>
Go into your sanctuary--gathering your Master Teacher at the people mover, if you like--and go to the sacred room. Imagine the pain leaving your body and sitting in a chair opposite you. Give the pain some human characteristics. How would Walt Disney animate it? What kind of Muppet would Jim Henson make of it?
<P>
Then ask the pain some questions. Make them up as you go along. Here are some possible starters: Do I embarrass you by talking to you? What payoff am I getting from having you? How am I using you? Is there anything I avoid by having you around? Is there some excuse you give me? What other information do you have for me? What would I have to do in order to let you go? Do you have any other advice for me?
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


You may be amazed how knowledgeable the pain is. After you've made note of the information, say good-bye to the pain and imagine it surrounded by a white light. See the pain disappear into this light, smiling and waving good-bye, newly freed energy, happy to be going on to other projects.
<P>
Then put the pain's advice in motion. If you do the things you've been avoiding, you'll probably find that the pain doesn't need to be there reminding you anymore.
<P>
When we've learned the lesson the pain was sent to teach, it generally goes. How do we know when we've learned the lesson? When the pain is gone. If it remains, there's probably more to learn--and to do.
<P>
If the pain is chronic, you've probably ignored lesser pains that could have given you the same information. When we need to change something, the messages telling us to get moving are like an alarm clock that keeps getting louder and louder until we finally wake up.
<P>
When you learn to listen to your pain and take corrective action at an earlier point--when it's just discomfort or annoyance or mild sensations--you can usually avoid the alarm clock's loudest rings.
<P>
Learning that guilt, resentment, and pain are our friends can be a powerful process. Could that mean that everything in our life is put here for our good?
<P>
Good question.
<P>
<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Meditate, Contemplate, or &QUOT;Just Sits&QUOT;</H2>

<FONT SIZE=-1>SATCHEL PAIGE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


In addition to visualization, you might like to try any number of meditative and contemplative techniques available--or you might just want to sit quietly and relax.
<P>
Whenever you meditate, contemplate, pray, do spiritual exercises, or &QUOT;just sits,&QUOT; it's good to ask the white light to surround, fill, and protect you, knowing only that which is for your highest good and the highest good of all concerned will take place during your quiet time. You may want to do your meditation in your sanctuary.
<P>
Before starting, prepare your physical environment. Arrange not to be disturbed. Unplug the phone. Put a note on the door. Wear ear plugs if noises might distract you. (I like the soft foam-rubber kind sold under such trade names as E.A.R., HUSHER, and DECIDAMP.) Take care of your bodily needs. Have some water nearby if you get thirsty, and maybe some tissues, too.
<P>
<B>Contemplation </B>is thinking <I>about</I> something, often something uplifting. You could contemplate any of the hundreds of quotes or ideas in this book. Often, when we hear a new and potentially useful idea, we say, &QUOT;I'll have to think about that.&QUOT; Contemplation is a good time to &QUOT;think about that,&QUOT; to consider the truth of it, to imagine the changes and improvements it might make in your life.
<P>
Or, you could contemplate a nonverbal object, such as a flower, or a concept, such as God. The idea of contemplation is to set aside a certain amount of quiet time to think about just <I>that,</I> whatever you decide &QUOT;that&QUOT; will be.
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


<B>Meditation.</B> There are so many techniques of meditation, taught by so many books and organizations, that it's hard to define the word properly.
<P>
You might want to try various meditations to see what they're like. With meditation, please keep in mind that <I>you'll never know until you do it.</I> We may like to think we know what the effects of a given meditation will be by just reading the description, but I suggest you try it and <I>then</I> decide.
<P>
<B>Breathing Meditation.</B> Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and simply be aware of your breath. Follow it in and out. Don't &QUOT;try&QUOT; to breathe; don't consciously alter your rhythm of breathing; just follow the breath as it naturally flows in and out. If you get lost in thoughts, return to your breath.
<P>
<B>Mantras.</B> Some people like to add a word or sound to help the mind focus as the breath goes in and out. Some people use <I>one </I>or <I>God</I> or <I>AUM (OHM)</I> or <I>l</I><I>ove</I>. These--or any others--are fine. As you breathe in, say to yourself, mentally, &QUOT;love.&QUOT; As you breathe out, &QUOT;love.&QUOT; If you don't like synchronizing sounds to breath, don't. It doesn't matter.
<P>
It's not so much the <I>sound,</I> but the <I>meaning you assign</I> to the sound. You may use a mantra such as &QUOT;Ummmm&QUOT; just because it sounds good--satisfying and relaxing. Or you may say &QUOT;Ahhhh&QUOT; represents the pure sound of God. Because you <I>say</I> it does, it will.
<P>
<B>Affirmations.</B> Brief affirmations can be used in meditation. My favorites include &QUOT;God is within me&QUOT; and &QUOT;I love myself.&QUOT;
<P>
Some people think meditation takes time <I>away</I> from physical accomplishment. Taken to extremes, of course, that's true. Most people, however, find that meditation <I>creates</I> more time than it <I>takes.</I> Meditation is for rest, healing, balance, and information. All these are helpful to attain a goal.
<P>
One of the primary complaints people have about meditating is, &QUOT;My thoughts won't leave me alone.&QUOT; Well <I>naturally</I>--that's what the mind does; it <I>thinks</I>. Rather than fight the thoughts (good luck), you might <I>listen</I> to the thoughts for nuggets of information. If a thought reminds you of something to do, write it down (or record it on a tape recorder). Then return to the meditation.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>A powerful agent is the right word. Whenever we come upon one of those intensely right words the resulting effect is physical as well as spiritual, and electrically prompt.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>MARK TWAIN</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


As the &QUOT;to do&QUOT; list fills, the mind empties. If the thought, &QUOT;Call the bank,&QUOT; reappears, you need only tell yourself, &QUOT;It's on the list. I can let that one go.&QUOT; And you will. It is important, however, to <I>do</I> the things on the list--or at least in a nonmeditative state to consider doing them. If you don't, you will continue to think about them, again and again.
<P>
When finished meditating, not only will you have had a better meditation, you will also have a &QUOT;to do&QUOT; list that can be very useful. One insight gleaned during a few minutes of meditation might save <I>hours,</I> perhaps <I>days</I> of unnecessary work. That's what I mean when I say--from a purely practical point of view--meditation can make more time than it takes.
<P>

<H1>YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE LUXURY<BR>OF A NEGATIVE THOUGHT</H1><H2>Part Three</H2>

<H2>Affirmations</H2>

An affirmation is a statement of positive fact. It's always worded in the present and usually begins with &QUOT;I am.&QUOT; Affirmations are designed &QUOT;to make firm&QUOT; the positive things about yourself.
<P>
Affirmations may be truer in the future than they are now, but the affirmation is always claimed <I>here and now.</I> Affirmations can be said anywhere, silently or out loud. The more often they're used, the more real, true, solid, and &QUOT;firm&QUOT; they become.
<P>
Setting aside periods of time especially for affirmations is valuable. Go to your sanctuary, sit in the sacred room, and say a selected affirmation over and over again. After a while, go to the video screen and watch yourself living that affirmation fully.
<P>
Then go to the ability closet and put on the ability suit for that affirmation. Go to the ability practice area and live the affirmation.
<P>
Affirmations are very powerful. When you repeat them in front of a mirror while looking into your eyes, all the negative thoughts and feelings that keep you from fulfilling your affirmation will surface. Let them surface; let them float away. Beneath all the limitations is a part of you that knows the truth of the affirmation.
<P>
Create affirmations to suit your particular situations. Remember to keep them positive statements of the present. &QUOT;I am healthy, wealthy, and happy,&QUOT; not &QUOT;I want to be healthy, wealthy, and happy,&QUOT; or &QUOT;Pretty soon, with enough luck, I'll be healthy, wealthy, and happy.&QUOT;

Go to your sanctuary and invite your Master Teacher in. Together, go to the sacred room. Sit down, close your eyes, and relax. Imagine your Master Teacher kneeling behind your chair and whispering gently into your ear a few words of encouragement, words you will use often on your path from illness to health, from negative thinking to positive focus, from desiring death to affirming life.
<P>
They're just a few words: three, four, five. Listen carefully. Your Master Teacher is repeating them, over and over. Listen. What are they? As your Master Teacher repeats them, relax; let them go deep. Hear them repeated, over and over. After a while it's hard to tell if the words are coming from your Master's mouth or from inside your own head.
<P>

Thank your Master Teacher for giving you those words. Escort your Master Teacher back to the people mover, and, as you turn, you see your words of encouragement emblazoned on the wall of your main room in golden letters. You realize that these aren't just words of encouragement; they are an accurate statement about you, here and now.
<P>
Whenever you enter your sanctuary, while standing under the white light of your entry way, pause for a moment; read your words of encouragement. Let the words touch your heart. Whenever you feel challenged on your path, remember that those are not just words, but a fundamental truth about you.

<H2>Forgiveness</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Always forgive your enemies-- nothing annoys them so much.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>OSCAR WILDE</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Yes, I am saving the best for last. The information in any one of these final three chapters, if applied with a genuine desire to heal, is more than enough.
<P>
The first of these is forgiveness. Forgiveness may be the greatest healer. As Charles Fillmore said:
<P>
Here is a mental treatment guaranteed to cure every ill that flesh is heir to: sit for half an hour every night and mentally forgive everyone against whom you have any ill will or antipathy.
<P>
We hold so much against ourselves and against others; then we hold it against ourselves that we hold things against ourselves and others. Judging ourselves and others for not measuring up is painful. (PAINFUL = PAY-IN-FULL.)
<P>
The way out? Forgiveness. The process of forgiveness is such a simple one. It's so easy, most people don't realize how effective it can be, so they don't try it and don't find out how well it works.
<P>
To forgive yourself, all you have to do is say, &QUOT;Iforgive myself for __________ (transgression),&QUOT; or &QUOT;I forgive _________ (another) for __________ (transgression),&QUOT; and fill in the blanks.
<P>
Notice that the forgiveness is unconditional. Be willing to let go of any hurt, guilt, resentment, or attachment.
<P>
That's part one.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Forgiveness is the key to action and freedom.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>HANNAH ARENDT</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Part two is, &QUOT;I forgive myself for judging myself for ___________ (transgression),&QUOT; and &QUOT;I forgive myself for judging ______________ (another) for ___________ (transgression).&QUOT;
<P>
What we or someone else did is of little concern. The real problem for us began when we judged what happened as wrong, bad, improper, hurtful, mean, nasty, etc. It's our judgment we need to forgive. The action was just the action. Our judgment about the action caused our difficulty.
<P>
If you're going to judge something, wait until all the evidence is in. Yes, so-and-so walked out on you, but two years later you met such-and-such, and thanks to so-and-so's departure you were free to take up with such-and-such, who is much more fun than so-and-so ever was; therefore, so-and-so's &QUOT;desertion&QUOT; was really a blessing in disguise and, had you known then what you know now, you would certainly have thrown so-and-so a bon voyage party.
<P>
How long does it take for all the evidence to come in? Give it at least five years--wait that long before judging anything.
<P>
&QUOT;But in five years I won't remember this even took place.&QUOT; Fine. Then forget it now. If it's not worth remembering for five years, it's not worth getting upset about now. How will you know if it's worth remembering for five years? Wait five years and see. Until then, &QUOT;the jury's out.&QUOT;
<P>
What happens if we forget the five-year moratorium on judgments (and, of course, we will)? If you forget, then as soon as you remember, forgive yourself on the spot. Knowing it was the judgment--not the action--that caused the hurt, pain, and separation, forgive yourself for judging.
<P>
Just say those forgiveness sentences to yourself. Try it. See what happens. It's one of those techniques that works by rote: you do it, it works. When should you do it? Whenever you're upset. All upset is caused by our judgment. Forgive the judgment, and the upset tends to fade.
<P>
You may have to repeat the forgiveness sentences several times, because you may have judged something several times. How many times does it take? You know the answer to that one by now: when the upset goes away, it was enough.
<P>
There's another element to forgiveness, and that's forgetting. When it's forgiven, it's forgotten. Let it go. It's not worth holding on to. Some people would rather have the righteousness of their vindictiveness than health. That's their choice.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>To be wronged is nothing unless you continue to remember it.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>CONFUCIUS</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Use the white light, your sacred room, and your Master Teacher in your forgiveness process. Learn to forgive fully and completely. If you want health, wealth, and happiness, you can't afford the luxury of lugging around all those unforgiven, unforgotten past events. Let them go.
<P>
Declare regular periods of General Amnesty during the day. Forgive yourself and everyone else for everything that happened (or failed to happen) since the last General Amnesty. Schedule one every few hours. Nothing from the past is worth polluting your present with for any longer than that.
<P>
Forgiveness is simply a matter of declaring yourself forgiven. That can surface worthiness issues faster than almost anything I know. Tell yourself you are worthy of being forgiven. You are. And even if you don't feel worthy of forgiveness, forgive yourself anyway. Prove your unworthiness wrong again.
<P>
And then forgive it.

<H2>The Attitude of Gratitude</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Thank God for tea! What would the world do without tea? --how did it exist? I am glad I was not born before tea.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>SYDNEY SMITH<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


As you learn to focus on the positive things in your current environment, take it one step further: be grateful for everything in your life.
<P>
Start with the outstanding things, then the good things, then the mundane things, then the not-so-good things, then the very not-so-good things, then the terrible things.
<P>
Why should you be grateful for the terrible things? First, meet terrible things with feelings of gratitude, because gratitude feels so good. Second, the terrible things are part of your life--there must be some reason why they're there. You might not know the reason yet, but, sooner or later, if you're open to it, the reason will appear. So, be grateful until it does, and when it does, be grateful.
<P>
Negative thinking simply cannot coexist with gratitude. If a nasty thought tries to take hold, the attitude of gratitude says, &QUOT;Thank you for that thought!&QUOT; Such appreciation diffuses negative thinking almost at once.
<P>
Remember to be grateful for what we often take for granted--our awareness, our senses, our bodies, our lives. Sure, we have things we could complain about, but we also have so much to be grateful for.
<P>
Whom or what should you be grateful to? It doesn't matter. Take your choice. You can be grateful to the power company for the electricity, or Edison for inventing the light bulb, or the designer of the lamp, or for the money to pay the power bill, or to God for the energy behind it all, or any combination. And that's for just a <I>lamp.</I>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>But if a man happens to find himself he has a mansion which he can inhabit with dignity all the days of his life.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>JAMES MICHENER</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<I>Who</I> gets the gratitude is not as important as your feeling the gratitude. Gratitude is such a free, abundant, happy attitude. That's why I'm suggesting you find things to be grateful about--not so the electric company gets thank-you notes, but so you'll feel the joy of being grateful.
<P>
In his cassette tape <I>Meditation of Gratitude: A Key to Receptivity</I> ($12 postpaid from The Cosmos Tree, 301 E. 78th NY, NY 10021), Roger Lane asks you to imagine yourself as a sweater, a simple wool sweater. He then goes through everything even a simple sweater has to be grateful for: the sheep, the spinners, the knitters, the people who grow the food to feed the knitters, etc.
<P>
And how much more we have to be grateful for than a sweater! If we were truly grateful for everything in our lives, we wouldn't have time for a single negative thought.
<P>
Throw an inner gratitude party. Invite the people from your past and present into your sanctuary and thank them for all they've contributed to your life: teachers, lovers, friends, brothers, sisters, spouse(s), children, and, of course, parents. See them come in, one by one, through the white light of the people mover. Express your gratitude. Then point them to the bar and buffet and welcome your next guest. (Your Master Teacher knows a great Master Caterer.)
<P>
Gratitude opens the place in you to receive. Whom do you prefer giving to: people who truly appreciate your gifts, or those who find fault with every little detail? The universe probably thinks as you do: let's give to the grateful.
<P>
And it does.
<P>

<H2>Loving</H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.</I><P>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

There are three magic words in healing--I Love You. When we say them, to others or to ourselves, all are healed.
<P>
I prefer the word loving to love. Loving includes the action necessary to bring about the qualities of love. Love is nice, of course, but love-in-action gets a lot more done.
<P>
Loving feels wonderful, but it's more than just a feeling; loving is a choice. We choose to be loving toward ourselves and others. This moment we choose. The next moment, we choose again. We always have a choice.
<P>
We can be lost in the gravity of our bad habits and negative thinking, but with each moment comes a new opportunity to choose loving. Now and now and now again.
<P>
It's usually not a grand choice preceded by golden trumpets and a chamberlain heralding, &QUOT;Do you choose the joy of loving, or do you choose the quagmire of negative thinking?&QUOT; Usually it's small choices: How do I respond to this information? Should I focus on the positive or the negative? Would eating this be taking care of myself? Would doing my exercises be loving myself?
<P>
There may not be a &QUOT;loving feeling&QUOT; behind the choice to take a loving action, but we take the action anyway; that's part of the decision to be loving. The loving action often produces the loving feeling. When we act in a loving way--either toward ourselves or others--we usually start to feel loving. If we wait for the loving feeling before we take a loving action, we might take only two or three loving actions a week.
<P>
Who is there to love? Ultimately, you. As the song declares, &QUOT;Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.&QUOT; You're the only person you'll be with <I>constantly</I> for the rest of your life. Why not make it a loving time?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>If you call him your Master will hear you. Seven bars on the door will not hold him Seven fires burning bright only bring him delight. You can live the life you dream.</I><P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>JUDY COLLINS</FONT></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Choose to love yourself. Do loving things for yourself. Act toward yourself in a loving way. Forgive yourself for everything. Be easy on yourself. Love yourself unconditionally. When you learn to love yourself--warts, bumps, bald spots, love handles, habits, negative thinking, illness, and all--you can love anyone or anything. Then you'll always be &QUOT;in loving.&QUOT;
<P>
Did I say love the illness? Yep. Love it so much that it wouldn't even dream of harming you. Love it so much that if you told it, &QUOT;I love you, but I could love you better if you were over there,&QUOT; it would go over there. Love it so much that that you won't have any hate left in you about anything.
<P>
As Dale Evans pointed out, &QUOT;I'm so busy loving <I>everybody,</I> I just don't have time to hate <I>anybody.&QUOT;</I>
<P>
What's the answer? Loving. What's the question? It doesn't matter; the answer is still loving.
<P>
It's the last word I want to leave you with, the first word in healing, the antidote to stress, the ease that dissolves dis-ease, the Magic Bullet of Joy, the vaccine against hatred, the positive action we can take when negative thinking flares, what we can always be grateful for, proof positive that the blessings already are, and the heart of forgiveness--
<P>
Loving.
<P>

<H1>How to Heal Depression</H1>
<H2>Part Four: <BR>As Healing Continues...</H2>
<P>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>My grandfather always said that living is like licking honey off a thorn.</I><P>LOUIS ADAMIC</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

This last part of the book offers some thoughts, suggestions, and encouragements; things to do, consider, and enjoy, as your healing continues.
<P><BR>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><EM><A NAME="Seventy-four">Seventy-four</A>: Your Healing Has Already Begun</EM></H2>
<P>
Some people will read this book all the way through before seeking a professional consultation to evaluate depression. Other people, who are reading this book on the recommendation of their doctor or therapist, may already be well into treatment. 
<P>
Wherever you are in the process, know that your healing has already begun.
<P>
Healing begins as a choice; a decision to get better. <EM>Any</EM> physical action that supports that decision indicates healing is underway.
<P>
Just picking up a book entitled <EM>How to Heal Depression</EM> and reading this far shows that your healing has begun.
<P>
Never before has the quest to heal depression been so swiftly and abundantly rewarded.
<P>
Once treatment begins, you are very likely to wonder, "Where has <EM>this </EM>been all my life?" The truth is, it hasn't been <EM>available</EM> for most of your life.
<P>
Congratulations on your courage to heal.
<P>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><EM>It isn't for the moment you are stuck that you need courage, but for the long uphill climb back to sanity and security.</EM><P>ANNE MORROW LINDBERG</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><EM><A NAME="Seventy-five">Seventy-five</A>: Patience</EM></H2>
<P>
When being treated for a medical condition, you become the patient.

We also suggest that you treat yourself well by<EM> becoming</EM> patient.
<P>
As we previously discussed, antidepressant medication can often take weeks to work. Sometimes it takes months to discover the best antidepressant for you and to arrive at the ideal dosage. 
<P>
Looking <EM>back</EM> on this time from a nondepressed state, the healing seems miraculously swift. Looking <EM>ahead,</EM> to the possibility of more weeks of depression, this period can seem long indeed.
<P>
Give yourself time. Give your health practitioners time. Give nature time.
<P>
Be patient with your impatience.
<P>
If patience is too much to ask, at least<EM> endure.</EM><P>
 Hang in there. Hold on. Stick with it. Healing is on its way.
<P>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><EM>Patience, and the mulberry leaf becomes a silk gown.</EM><P>CHINESE PROVERB</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><EM><A NAME="Seventy-six">Seventy-six</A>: Think Big, but Not Huge</EM></H2>
<P>
As you envision your healing, hold a vision of what you'd like the "healed you" to be. Words such as <EM>contentment, well-being, enthusiasm, joyful, happy, effective, loving, tender,</EM> and others may come to mind.
<P>
When dreaming of your healing, it's fine to think big.
<P>
But don't think <EM>too</EM> big. <EM>Never </EM>being angry, sad, hurt, disappointed, in pain, or feeling any other emotion you associate with depression is not a reasonable goal. Strive for excellence, not perfection.
<P>
Yes, as you heal from depression, the general shift of emotions--mood, if you will--should definitely be on the upswing. <EM>Never, ever</EM> feeling bad again is not, well, <EM>human.</EM><P>

<P>
Your psychiatrist or therapist can help you set reasonable personal goals as you heal.

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><EM><A NAME="Seventy-seven">Seventy-seven</A>: Healing Has Its Ups and Downs</EM></H2>
<P>
Healing from depression--or healing from anything else, for that matter--is not a smooth, even, steady, upward path. It tends to look more like this:
<P>
Not-so-depressed
<P>
Depressed
<P>
It's like a roller coaster, a<EM> slow</EM> roller coaster for the most part, one that lets you off at a higher point than where you got on.
<P>
Ride the ride. Follow your treatment. Soon you'll find that the downs of today were the ups of yesterday.
<P>

<P><BR>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><EM><A NAME="Seventy-eight">Seventy-eight</A>: Seek the Support of Others</EM></H2>
<P>
For you it's a time for change, for growth, for healing. Change can sometimes seem chaotic, confusing, frightening. Seek the support of others.
<P>
Ask trusted friends or family members to help with specific tasks or ongoing responsibilities.
<P>
Although, as we mentioned, it's a good idea to postpone major decisions, if decisions must be made, ask for the opinions of others you respect when making your choice.
<P>
Ask people who have been through treatment for depression and are further along in the healing process to be available for phone calls, questions, or chats. Sometimes nothing is so reassuring as a simple, "Oh, yeah, I went through that." 
<P>
Ask your boss if it's possible to have your workload lightened for a while.
<P>
Ask if certain commitments might be put off until later.
<P>
People may say no--but at least give them a chance to say yes.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Seventy-nine">Seventy-nine</A>: Support Groups</EM></H2>
<P>
People often benefit by gathering with others going through similar experiences. Those who are healing from depression are no exception.
<P>
Often these groups form around the principles of Cognitive/Interpersonal Therapy, or are made up of people who are taking antidepressant medications, or both.
<P>
Support groups are an excellent place to share experiences, suggestions, information, and, obviously, as the title of the group indicates, <EM>support.</EM><P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important knowledge to be gained from support groups is that <EM>you are not alone.</EM>
<P>
You might discover, for example, that a problem you thought was yours and yours alone, is so common that the group has given it a number. ("Right! That's number 43.") Or, someone may share an experience that sounds interesting, but you can't quite relate to it. A week later, it happens to you.
<P>
Your psychiatrist, doctor, or therapist may be able to recommend support groups in your area. Or, you can call some of the organizations listed starting on Page 222.
<P>
A support group is made up of human beings who care about and are committed to their own healing. By self-selection alone, then, support groups are populated by supportive, wonderful people.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Eighty">Eighty</A>: Twelve-Step and Recovery Programs</EM></H2>
<P>
The most successful treatment ever created for addiction is the Twelve-Step Program of Alcoholics Anonymous. It has been adapted and used successfully in treating just about every addiction, bad habit, or emotional problem in the human condition.
<P>
The secret of the Twelve-Step Program is that it is, in reality, important rules for personal growth. Following these steps leads to greater personal maturity, integrity, and freedom.
<P>
This upward growth gives the inner strength to focus on something other than the addiction. 
<P>
While depression is not an addiction, people with depression often become addicted to other things, from food to sex to drugs to smoking to procrastination to alcohol to negative thinking.thinking is <EM>You Can't Afford the Luxury of a Negative Thought,</EM> by Peter McWilliams and John-Roger, available by calling 1-800-LIFE-101. In overcoming any of these, Twelve-Step Programs can be valuable.
<P>
For more information on Twelve-Step Programs, see the listing on page 224.
<P>
THE TWELVE STEPS
<P><OL>
	<LI>We admitted we were powerless over our addiction--that our lives had become unmanageable.
<P>
	<LI>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.
<P>
	<LI>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of this Higher Power, <EM>as we understood Him, Her, or It.</EM><P>
<P>
	<LI>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.
<P>
	<LI>Admitted to our Higher Power, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.
<P>
	<LI>Were entirely ready to have our Higher Power remove all these defects of character.
<P>
	<LI>Humbly asked our Higher Power to remove our shortcomings.
<P>
	<LI>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.
<P>
	<LI>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.
<P>
	<LI>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.
<P>
	<LI>Sought, through prayer and meditation, to improve our conscious contact with our Higher Power <EM>as we understood Him, Her, or It,</EM> praying only for knowledge of our Higher Power's will for us and the power to carry that out.
<P>
	<LI>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to others and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Eighty-one">Eighty-one</A>: Praise Yourself</EM></H2>
<P>
It takes courage to accept that you might have a depressive illness.
<P>
It's courageous to make a medical appointment for a diagnostic evaluation.
<P>
It's courageous to enter onto a course of treatment that is frightening to some and ridiculed by others.
<P>
It takes wisdom and courage to work with your doctor to find the right medication, and with your therapist on deeply personal and challenging issues.
<P>
Praise yourself for all this. Praise yourself for every little victory, every step taken on the path of healing--including those that don't work. It's all part of the journey.
<P>
Keep reminding yourself that who you really are is much more than your depression.
<P>
Praise yourself for your courage to learn, risk, and grow.
<P>
Well done!

<H2><EM><A NAME="Eighty-two">Eighty-two</A>: Give Yourself Time to Heal</EM></H2>
<P>
Healing takes time. Even if you--like so many people who begin treatment for depression--find marked improvement in just a few weeks, the complete process of healing may take longer.
<P>
The longer you've been depressed, the longer the body is likely to need to heal. Give it the time it needs. 
If you--like many people with long-term, low-grade depression--can't even <EM>remember </EM>when you weren't depressed, relax: you're now healing from the ravages of a lifetime.
<P>
Fortunately, as you heal, time passes more enjoyably.<EM> Just sitting</EM> can be enjoyable. In fact, one moves more and more into "the moment," or the "here and now" that saints, both eastern and western, have described. (Some even claim that enjoying the moment is the goal of life.)
<P>
The more you heal, the less you're concerned about whether or not your healing is "done"--a sure sign that you're healing.

<P>
Just as you asked others for support, ask <EM>yourself </EM>for support, too.
<P>
Be gentle with yourself, be easy, give yourself a break. 
<P>
A major symptom of depression is being hard on yourself. Soften up; lighten up. Remember that mistakes are something "this flesh is heir to." 
<P>
The next time you want to attack yourself, have a laugh attack instead. Consider how silly it is to be at war with yourself.
<P>
Imagine two armies facing each other in the trenches. One soldier looks up from one side, another soldier looks up from the other--and they have precisely the same face. They begin pointing and laughing hysterically. Other soldiers cautiously peek out of trenches and around barricades, only to discover their mirror images cautiously peeking back at them. All the faces are yours. The entire battlefield dissolves in waves of laughter. End of war. Beginning of Monty Python sketch.
<P>
Here's one of the most radical thoughts you will ever read: <EM>it's okay to feel good when things go bad.</EM><P>

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><EM><A NAME="Eighty-four">Eighty-four</A>: View Problems As Creative Challenges</EM></H2>
<P>
During depression, it's easy to view problems as burdens, interruptions, something else to struggle through--in short, <EM>upsetting.</EM><P>
<P>
As the depression lifts, it's easier to see problems as creative challenges, invitations to activity, even <EM>games.</EM><P>
<P>
<EM>Problems do not need to make you unhappy.</EM><P>
<P>
Think of life as a <EM>process</EM> to be enjoyed <EM>as you go along.</EM><P>
<P>
Too often depressive thinking says, "When I get through this, <EM>then</EM> I'll be happy." With that thinking, it's no wonder one is seldom--if ever--happy. Did you ever notice that problems just "keep on comin'"?
<P>
So, when a problem arises, view it with the attitude you'd have if your best friends said, "Let's play Monopoly (or poker, or canasta, or touch football, or whatever your favorite game is). When we <EM>intentionally</EM> create problems for ourselves, we call them <EM>games</EM>. Can't we treat the unintentionally created problems the same?
<P>
Enthusiasm, creativity, playfulness, and a bemused sense of humor are the keys.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Eighty-five">Eighty-five</A>: Seek Comforting</EM></H2>
<P>
Being hugged, stroked, nurtured, and adored is a perfectly natural desire. When the need for these arises, do what you can to fulfill it.
<P>
A professional massage--or a series of them--is an excellent investment in healing.
<P>
Perhaps the comforting comes not by touch, but by touch tone. Make a list of friends, support group members, relatives, and others whom you can call and say, "Tell me I'm okay!"
<P>
Of course, the #1 comforter in your life--and the one whom it's often hardest to accept comforting from--is yourself. Tell yourself, often, "I love you," "I care about you," "You are precious to me," "You're great!" Blush if you must, but tell yourself nonetheless.

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><EM><A NAME="Eighty-six">Eighty-six</A>: Relationships May Change</EM></H2>
<P>
As you heal, you may find your relationships change.
<P>
The relationships based on the "depressed you" tend to wither, while the relationships with people who like you for the <EM>real</EM> you often grow stronger.
<P>
Treatment for depression does not make people "all the same." Far from it. As depression lifts, the individual qualities of the person tend to surface and are naturally expressed. One may even develop (or deepen) an eccentricity or two. This deeply upsets those who count on you to be your "old, predictable self."
<P>
Some people prey upon the weaknesses of depressed people, using fear, guilt, and unworthiness to manipulate and control. As these symptoms of depression heal, you become less needy, less manipulatable.
<P>
This, obviously, does not please the controllers or manipulators. They may try to manipulate you out of treatment. Don't let them.
<P>
Don't make any firm decisions about relationships until your healing is well underway. Observe what's happening inside yourself and with others. There's time to make choices later.
<P>
But beware: if you fail to attend one of the regularly scheduled meetings of the Ain't-It-Awful Club, guess who gets talked about?
<P>
Ain't it awful?
<P>

<H2><EM><A NAME="Eighty-seven">Eighty-seven</A>: Enjoy the Good</EM></H2>
<P>
Don't be surprised if good things happen to you <EM>without your even trying.</EM><P>
<P>
Struggle, effort, and trying are, for many depressed people, the only way they know to get something good.
<P>
As depression heals, good things tend to happen--spontaneously. Accept them. Enjoy them.
<P>
You may, for example, find yourself simply not wanting to continue a bad habit you thought would take enormous effort to overcome. Or, you may find yourself naturally wanting to take part in a healthy activity that you figured would require tremendous discipline.
<P>
You may find career opportunities, relationships, and your health becoming more of what you want them to be--simply because you are <EM>being</EM> more of who you <EM>are.</EM><P>
<P>
"Enjoy life," the bumper sticker reminds us. "This is not a rehearsal."

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><EM><A NAME="Eighty-eight">Eighty-eight</A>: Making Peace with Depression</EM></H2>
<P>
Clinical research indicates that approximately
<P><UL TYPE=SQUARE>
	<LI>One-third of the people who are treated for depression heal completely. They never need antidepressant medications or treatment again.
<P>
	<LI>One-third of the people heal completely and are taken off antidepressant medication. Later, however, a depression returns and it must be treated again, usually with antidepressants.
<P>
	<LI>One-third of the people will need antidepressant medication on a long-term basis.
</UL><P>
There's no way of telling which path your depression will take. The important thing is that the depression can be contained and the symptoms eliminated--as in the treatment of high blood pressure, low thyroid, or diabetes.
<P>
The point is that either one heals oneself from depression; one heals oneself from depression and it returns (in which case it can be successfully treated again); or depression is a fact of life (for which, ongoing, long-term treatment can be safe and successful with periodic medical supervision).
<P>
So, make peace with depression. It's not an enemy. It's not out to "get ya." It's just an imbalance of the biochemistry of the brain and/or the thought patterns of the mind. As with any illness, it needs ongoing acceptance and healing.
<P>

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><EM><A NAME="Eighty-nine">Eighty-nine</A>: Society and Depression (the Good News) </EM></H2>
<P>
Imagine for a moment that the millions and millions of depressed people in this country were no longer depressed:
<P><UL TYPE=SQUARE>
	<LI>They no longer blame themselves or others for the symptoms of an illness.
<P>
	<LI>They have more energy, get angry less quickly, are less prone to physical illness, and are free from addictions.
<P>
	<LI>They laugh more and care more about themselves and their fellow human beings.
<P>
	<LI>They are more productive, tolerant, giving, and forgiving.
</UL><P>
Whether this sounds like Sir Thomas More's <EM>Utopia,</EM> Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World," or John Lennon's "Imagine," it does describe what is possible--for the first time in human history.
<P>
Take an extreme case: the homeless. Have you ever spoken with a homeless person who you would say <EM>wasn't </EM>clinically depressed? Well, neither have we. Whether they're depressed because they're homeless or they're homeless because they're depressed no longer matters--treat the depression and perhaps a good number of the homeless will again become productive citizens.
<P>
Healthy individuals make healthy societies.

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><EM><A NAME="Ninety">Ninety</A>: Society and Depression (the Bad News)</EM></H2>
<P>
It is estimated that untreated depression costs this country <EM>43.7</EM> <EM>billion dollars</EM> per year.
<P>
With so much undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, untreated, and undertreated depression, what are we, as a country, doing about it? Not much. 
<P>
Yes, the National Institutes of Health are doing a good job educating the American public about depression and its treatment. 
<P>
But it's not enough.
<P>
Medicaid and Medicare will <EM>not</EM> pay for the latest generation of antidepressants (Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Effexor). Treatment with these drugs costs about five dollars a day--which is not a problem for a middle to upper-middle class person--but it can be devastating to a lower income person whose <EM>food</EM> budget is less than five dollars a day.
<P>
This lack of healthcare coverage is especially distressing because it is estimated that as many as <EM>sixty-five percent</EM> of the elderly in this country have a clinical depression. A good number of the elderly depend on Medicare for their medical treatment.
<P>
What if one of the reasons people are trapped in poverty is depression? What if giving them proper treatment allowed them to work their  way <EM>out </EM>of poverty?
<P>
Do our elderly and lower income citizens deserve such<EM> lack</EM> of treatment?
<P>
Equally startling is how economically wasteful this policy is. Many people are being treated for specific <EM>symptoms</EM> of depression at a great cost (for sleeping pills, sedatives, pain pills, etc.), when five dollars' worth of antidepressants would, by treating the depression, relieve most of the symptoms.
<P>
Why waste money ineffectively treating <EM>symptoms?</EM>
<P>
And what cost can we put on unnecessary suffering and misery?
<P>
These are questions the government somehow has not fully considered. If you have any thoughts on this matter, please drop a note to your elected officials.
<P>
When you hear depressing news, there's no point becoming depressed <EM>about</EM> it. Either do something about it, or determine that someone else is going to do something about it, and then let it go.
<P>
Treating depression doesn't cost money. It <EM>saves</EM> money--and lives.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Ninety-one">Ninety-one</A>: Giving to Others</EM></H2>
<P>
Someone once asked: "If you were arrested for kindness, would there be enough evidence to convict you?" It's an interesting question. The answers are often more interesting.
<P>
As your treatment reaches its conclusion, and as your healing continues, you may find that your healing is enhanced by giving to others.
<P>
What do we give to others? We give of what we have. Among the things <EM>you</EM> have is the knowledge that (a) depression is an illness, and (b) depression is a <EM>treatable</EM> illness.
<P>
A lot of people--roughly ten million in the United States alone--are waiting for that information.
<P>
To the degree you can, and in the ways you know how, give them that information. We wrote a book. That's what we knew how to do. If you feel so moved, do what you can do.
<P>
No, we are not asking you to become the local proselytizer of antidepressants. We're simply saying that if there's one person who might be inspired by your story, consider telling it.
<P>
Then let the person decide how, when, and if he or she will use the information you so kindly supplied.

<P>
Thank you for reading our book. Glance through it again and again as you move along your path of healing.
<P>
In closing, we want you to know that we have walked this road ahead of you. We have deep compassion for all depressed people go through because we, too, have suffered from depression.
<P>
We also know how difficult it was to read the writing on the wall (even though it was written in neon letters twelve feet high), to seek treatment, and to "hang in there" until the treatment was successful.
<P>
So, we are not just authors and you are not just readers: we are all human beings--magnificent and monstrous, phenomenal and foolish, grasping selfishly and giving unconditionally.
<P>
And you know what? We wouldn't have it any other way.
<P>
Thanks for joining us.
<P>
Enjoy your journey!

<H2><I><A NAME="Sixty-five">Sixty-five</A>: Positive Distractions</I></H2>
<P>
The <I>instant</I> you find yourself in a negative pattern, do something--anything--positive to break the pattern. Take a deep breath, look out a window, smell a flower, eat an apple, drink some water, read a joke, sing a song, write a poem, say a prayer--the list is endless.
<P>
It's sometimes difficult to "work through" a negative pattern while it's going on. So, interrupt the pattern with a positive distraction.
<P>
Make a list of your favorite positive distractions and memorize five that you can do practically anywhere. The next time you find yourself "stuck" in a negative pattern, immediately turn to one of your positive distractions. If one isn't distracting enough, try another, and another, and another.
<P>
"The hardest thing you can do," wrote Allen Klein, "is smile when you are ill, in pain, or depressed. But this no-cost remedy is a necessary first step if you are to start on the road to recovery."

Smile.

<H2><I><A NAME="Sixty-six">Sixty-six</A>: Straighten Up! Head Up! Take a Deep Breath! </I></H2>
<P>
The classic "depressed stance" is stooped over, head down, shoulders round. With such posture depressed people seem to be, as they say in <I>clich,</I> "carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders."
<P>
Changing this posture can change the depressive mood. Head up, shoulders back, deep breath--and you tend to feel better.
<P>
It's very hard to breathe deeply all slouched over, which can cut oxygen intake, which itself contributes to depression. Learn to breathe deeply, expanding your lower abdomen as you do.
<P>
Experiment with different postures, ways of sitting, ways of walking, and so on, and see if some make you feel better than others.
<P>

<H2><I><A NAME="Sixty-seven">Sixty-seven</A>: Get Things Done or Let Them Go</I></H2>
<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Life is too short to stuff a muchroom.</I><P>STORM JAMESON</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Most people are overcommitted. There are books they plan to read, videotapes they plan to watch, dinners they plan to have, friends they plan to visit, closets they plan to clean (or come out of), classes they want to take, and on and on. If they added nothing to these "plans" and lived to be 302, they <I>still</I> wouldn't get them all done.
<P>
This backlog of "I've-been-meaning-to," can be depressing.
<P>
This is especially true when the things we mean to do are <I>important--</I>charitable works, exercise programs for health, quality time with loved ones, religious or spiritual practices, political causes, social change, and the like. Here, not only do we miss the satisfaction and enjoyment of doing them, we also feel guilty for not having done them.
<P>
There are two ways to effectively deal with such past commitments: do them, or be done with them. Get them done, or let them go.
<P>
To break the cycle of depression, reprioritize and then <I>move.</I><P>
 Get those things done. Accomplish them.
<P>
Or, declare to yourself that you are no longer going to do them--at least not at this time. (Be reasonable about this--if you owe someone money, for example, you can't just "declare" it paid.) It's not that what you want to do is no longer important to you; it's just that your resources are otherwise engaged. "I can't do this," is seldom true. "I'd like to do this, but my resources are otherwise engaged," more often is.
<P>
It's a good idea to make a list of all the things you said--either to yourself or to others--you were going to do. (The listing of the things you said to yourself will probably be considerably longer than the list of commitments you made to others.) Then check off the ones associated with essentials (food, shelter, healing your depression) and notice how much time you have left for all the rest. Start checking off, one by one, what you still have time and resources to do.
<P>
At some point, as happens to us all, you will run out of time and resources.
<P>
Then, <I>cross</I> <I>off</I> the rest. As you cross each item off, say, "Yes, I'd like to do this, but my resources are otherwise engaged. For now, I declare it done." (When communicating with others, it's probably a good idea to leave off the "I declare it done" part.)
<P>
In doing this, you'll probably notice an increase in energy, a clarity of mind, and a stronger desire to accomplish the things you really <I>do</I> plan on doing.
<P>
And (need we point out?) be <I>very</I> watchful in making future commitments--to others, and <I>especially</I> to yourself.
<P>

<P>

An af<I>firm</I>ation is a tool used to make something <I>firm.</I>
<P>
We take something as ephemeral as a thought and make it firm--that is, <I>real</I>. (Reading this book began as a thought in your mind--an affirmation--and you repeated that thought often enough that it has now become a reality: you are reading this book.)
<P>
To <I>visual</I>ize is to see in your imagination the affirmation taking place.
<P>
Don't be misled by the word <I>visual:</I> many people don't "see" a picture in their imagination--for some it's more <I>feeling;</I> for others it's more <I>hearing.</I>
<P>
Remember what a triangle looks like? A red apple? The Statue of Liberty? That's what your visualization is like. The way we remember the past is the way we "see" the future.
<P>
We use affirmations and visualizations all the time. It's how we human beings create. 
Our thoughts--which include our imagination--create emotions, biological reactions, physical actions, and we use these to gather to us people and things.

Almost everyone uses the process of affirmation and visualization--usually unconsciously--in both positive and negative ways. We are, of course, suggesting that you use them in more positive ways. 
When people refer to affirmations and visualizations, they almost always mean <I>positive </I>affirmations and visualizations.
<P>
Affirmations are simply statements of what you want to be, do, and have. They are best stated in the present, as though you were already being, doing, and having them. Affirmations, then, usually begin with, "I am...." For example: "I am joyful and happy," "I am loving my life," "I am contented and grateful in this moment."
<P>
This naturally leads to visualizations--imagining yourself in happy and joyful situations, loving various aspects of your life, being contented and grateful in this moment.
<P>
Make a list of positive affirmations. Say them over and over, anywhere you are. Write them on cards and place the cards around as reminders: on the dashboard of your car, the mirror where you dress, the ceiling above your bed. Visualize what your life would be like if these affirmations were true.
<P>
Keep affirming and keep visualizing, and they <I>will</I> be true. As Maharishi Mahesh Yogi explained, "That which we give attention to grows stronger in our lives."
<P>

<H2><I><A NAME="Sixty-nine">Sixty-nine</A>: Light and Meditation</I></H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Sadness flies on the wings of the morning and out of the heart of darkness comes the light.</I><P>JEAN GIRAUDOUX</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<I>Light</I> is a concept that has permeated religious, spiritual, philosophical, and even scientific beliefs throughout history, from ancient civilizations to advanced quantum physics.
<P>
You may consider light as the light of God, the light of the Holy Spirit, the light of nature, the light of the sun, the light within us all, or the electromagnetic waves of energy that physicists tell us make up the entire known universe, visible and invisible, including the book you're holding, the light reflecting off the page that allows you to read the book, your hands that are holding the book, your eyes that are perceiving the reflected-light images, and your brain that is making sense of the whole thing; these, or any other concept of light you may have, are fine with us. (So who says we don't know how to write long sentences?)
<P>
Let us simply define light as<I> the invisible message of goodness from the Divine.</I><P>

<P>
You can use the light to surround, fill, and heal yourself. You can send it anywhere you like--even forward or backwards in time. You can breathe deeply of the light.
<P>
Whenever you use or send the light, it's a good idea to ask for it to go "for the highest good of all concerned." Don't use the light as a form of control. Let it be used as an affirmation of the statement, "Thy will be done."
<P>
As depression is so often associated with darkness, asking those dark parts of your life--both inside and outside yourself--to be filled with light can be profoundly uplifting.
<P>
A good way of doing this is through <I>meditation.</I><P>
 During meditation, we can ask that any dark, heavy aspects of our lives--past, present, or future--be filled with light. We can imagine the darkness dissolving and the heaviness lightening.
<P>
Sometimes in meditation, we just want to listen--listen to ourselves, or to whatever or whomever we consider to be a source of Divine inspiration. Sometimes it's fun just to sit and listen to the mind chattering on. 
<P>
Meditation can be used to contemplate an idea, thought, or even a physical object that you consider meaningful, profound, or beautiful. When you hear something nice and tell yourself, "I'll have to think about that," meditation is a good time to think about it.
<P>
There are so many forms of meditation (including the Transcendental Meditation Technique, which Harold has used and recommends), taught in so many ways: books, tapes, classes. It's a rich world to explore.
<P>
Meditation is a time you can spend with yourself, as well as with your <I>self.</I><P>

Laughter is an amazingly rapid healer of depression. So is humor. Humor doesn't necessarily make you laugh, but it does make you smile inside.
<P>
We're going to step aside for a moment and hear from the experts:

<H2><I><A NAME="Seventy-one">Seventy-one</A>: Music</I></H2>
<P>
If, as William Congreve observed in 1697, "Music has charms to soothe a savage breast, To soften rocks, or to bend a knotted oak," surely, then, it also has the charms to soothe and soften a savage depression.
<P>
Music you find soothing can make an excellent addition to meditation, or it can be a meditation in itself. Whether it's the second movement of Beethoven's<I> Third Concerto for Piano and Orchestra,</I> or the first twelve hours of Mantovani's <I>Four-hundred-and-sixty-seventh Concerto for Elevator and Supermarket,</I> whatever music you find soothing, put it on, close your eyes, and drift away.
<P>
Of course, music does more than just soothe; it can stimulate or enhance almost any activity, emotion, or mood--from crying, to dancing, to mystical visions. Music--carefully selected--is a way to elicit suppressed feelings in need of expression and catharsis.
<P>
The idea is not just to have background music, but to spend time with it; focus on it; relax into it. "Music heard so deeply," wrote T.S. Eliot, "That it is not heard at all, but you are the music / While the music lasts."
<P>
Thanks to today's technology, the music can last and last.

<P>
What playful, creative things do you do--or want to do? Paint? Write? Sew? Dance? Cook? Garden? Sing? Act? Compose? Play (an instrument, a game, a sport)?
<P>
Well, <I>do it!</I> 
<P>
Don't worry about being good at it, or making a living at it, or even sharing it with anybody else. <I>Just have fun with it.</I> Let yourself <I>play.</I><P>
<P>
We forget about play, we adults--especially we depressed adults. It's a contributing factor to depression. Too often, even when we're having fun, we do it passively--watching a movie, watching TV, watching sports. This is fine, but we're suggesting you also do something that gets you <I>actively involved.</I><P>
<P>
As the ultimate expert on life, Ward Cleaver, once put it: "You're never too old to do goofy stuff."
<P>

<H2><I><A NAME="Seventy-three">Seventy-three</A>: Gratitude</I></H2>
<P>
We have <I>so much</I> to be grateful for. Alas, depression robs us of gratitude. Or is it that we fall into the painful habit of ingratitude, and depression results? One of the nicest ways out of depression is to have frequent gratitude breaks.
<P>
Look around. Be grateful for what you perceive. Actually say to yourself, "I am grateful for the lamp. I am grateful for my hands. I am grateful for the couch...." Let yourself feel a little gratitude before moving on to the next object. Don't forget to be grateful if you <I>can</I> see, hear, touch, taste, smell.
<P>
"Love your eyes that can see, your mind that can hear the music, the thunder of the wings," wrote Robinson Jeffers. "Love the wild swan."
<P>
Run out of things to be grateful for? Okay, try this: breathe out all your air. Hold it. Soon you'll be <I>very</I> grateful for your breath.
<P>
Share your gratitude with others: "That was beautiful," "You look lovely," "I appreciate what you did." There is no need for gushing sentimentality or false flattery. Simply express appreciation freely and appropriately.
<P>
In any moment, there's something to be grateful for. That we don't spontaneously focus on the good is merely a bad habit. Learn a new habit, a better habit: focus on the positive. More and more, you will have that <I>great, full</I> feeling.
<P>

<P>
<H2><I><A NAME="Fifty-seven">Fifty-seven</A>:<BR>Exaggerating Is Absolutely the Worst Thing You Can Do, and It Can Kill You If You Don't Completely Stop It-- Right Now!!!</I></H2>
<P>
Look at the word <I>exaggerate.</I>
<P>
It has too many g's, doesn't it? It only needs one g to get by. That's what we do when we exaggerate: we add extra g's. The <I>g-force,</I> of course, is the weight of gravity. Adding extra g's presses down on us, making us depressed.
<P>
<I>Wasn't that first point the dumbest, stupidest, most juvenile and insultingly unprofessional description of how exaggeration worsens depression that you've ever</I> seen<I>?!</I>
<P>
And so exaggeration goes. We take an idea or event and mentally blow it out of proportion. The emotions soon follow. Emotions react to what the mind tells them. If we are disappointed and our mental response is, "You're killing me!" the emotions respond as though we are <I>literally</I> being killed. That's a fairly strong emotional reaction.
<P>
Don't exaggerate in the <I>other</I> direction, either. If you're disappointed, it's fine. Don't try to kid yourself by thinking, "Oh, it really doesn't matter." If it matters to you, it matters.
<P>
Strive for <I>accuracy</I>--a word that has a lot of c's in it. That will keep your mind and emotional responses more appropriate. C what we mean?

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><I><A NAME="Fifty-eight">Fifty-eight</A>: Observe Yourself</I></H2>
<P>
The next time you're upset, take a step back--mentally--and <I>listen</I> to your thoughts. If you're speaking to someone, <I>hear</I> what you're saying. If you're doing something, <I>observe</I> your actions. 
<P>
When you objectively stand back and monitor your thoughts, words, and actions, you'll see where a good deal of your negativity is coming from.
<P>
Look for <I>shoulds, have-tos, musts.</I><P>
 Look for exaggerations. Look for assumptions you've made. (You've probably heard the old saying: "To <I>assume</I> is to make an <I>ass</I> out of <I>u</I> and <I>me.")</I> Look for judgments.
<P>
Then see where all this negative thinking gets you: the negative feelings, the words that don't truly reflect <I>you,</I> the ineffective actions.
<P>
Also notice what you're <I>ignoring.</I><P>
 What are the good things going on that you're paying absolutely no attention to? Ignoring positive realities is a form of negative thinking.
<P>
Sometimes there's no need to <I>change</I> anything. You may find that simply <I>observing</I> a negative thought or feeling dissolves it.
<P>

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><I><A NAME="Fifty-nine">Fifty-nine</A>: Heal Thyself First</I></H2>
<P>
As you learn more about yourself, you will also learn more about others. As you learn more about depression--and especially after the depression begins to lift--you'll probably notice a great many people you think need to be treated for <I>their</I> depression.
<P>
One of the cleverest avoidances of treatment is to spend time "healing" others. Heal<I> yourself </I>first.
<P>
The first few months of healing your depression is an important time. The more you participate in the treatment, the greater your healing will be. Recognizing negative habits, developing new skills, and learning to enjoy simply <I>being--</I>perhaps for the first time in your life--can be exhilarating <I>and</I> exhausting. Monitor your energy; reserve it for yourself.
<P>
Is this being selfish? Sure. <I>Self-</I>ish. You're taking time for your<I>self</I>. Some might say that depression grows from an impoverished self; an inner being that has not been properly nourished. Nourish yourself. Become your own best gardener.<I>Being There</I> and watch it while thinking about being your own best gardener.>
<P>
When you heal more fully, <I>that's</I> the time to reach out to others. You'll be able to help them far more from wholeness.

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><I><A NAME="Sixty">Sixty</A>:<BR>No One or No Thing Can Depress You Unless You Allow It</I></H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>Men are disturbed not by things, but by the view which they take of them.</I><P>EPICTETUS</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The buck stops here. More accurately, the<I> blame</I> stops here.
<P>
You, and you alone, have the ability to depress yourself. "No one can make you feel inferior," wrote Eleanor Roosevelt, "without your consent."
<P>
Short of directly <I>physically </I>harming you, all external events and people depress you because <I>you</I> think negative thoughts about them, <I>not because of what they do.</I>
<P>
This is the foundation of personal responsibility: It's not what happens to you, but your <I>inner</I> <I>reaction</I> to what happens to you, that determines whether you feel miserable or marvelous.
<P>
Using this <I>ability</I> to <I>respond</I> in a masterful way is response-ability.
<P>
This idea, of course, brings on a chorus of, "Yes, but what about . . . ?"
<P>
People get <I>so</I> <I>involved</I> in creating outlandish scenarios in which another's actions <I>cause</I> them to feel bad. "Faced with the choice between changing one's mind and proving there is no need to do so," observed Professor John Kenneth Galbraith, "almost everyone gets busy on the proof."
<P>
Rather than counter all the "Yes, buts . . ." individually, allow us to simply mention one name: Viktor Frankl, M.D. Dr. Frankl had<I> everything</I> and <I>everyone</I> in his life taken from him in, historically, the most appalling way possible. He is a survivor of the Holocaust. There's no need for detail here.
<P>
What's important is the conclusion Dr. Frankl came to. While in the concentration camp, he realized one essential truth: no matter <I>what</I> they put him through, he still had within him the power to <I>choose</I> how he was going to order his inner environment--his thoughts, his feelings, his being.
<P>
No matter how much they took from him--which was every person and material thing he had--he still had freedom; the freedom to choose.<I>Man's Search for Meaning.</I><P>
<P>
It's a freedom you have, too. You can't always choose what happens to you, but you <I>can</I> always choose your reaction to it. To react negatively to certain situations is not "just you." You may have bad habits that currently are "on automatic." But old habits can be broken; new habits can be learned.
<P>
Becoming more responsible for your actions and feelings may seem like a lot of work. You're right. It <I>is</I> a lot of work.
<P>
Freedom usually is.
<P>

<P><BR>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><I><A NAME="Sixty-one">Sixty-one</A>: "Yes" and "No" </I></H2>
<P>
<I>Yes</I> and <I>no</I> are two invaluable words in obtaining and maintaining personal freedom. The secret? <I>Say the one you mean.</I><P>

<P>
Yes and no guard your time. Think of them as the door of your house: the open door is yes, the closed door is no. If you open the door when you really want it closed, and close the door when you really want it open, you will soon find yourself with a house full of what you do not want. This is depressing, indeed.

Too often, we say yes or no for the wrong reason. That reason, usually, is fear: we're afraid of a new experience; we're afraid of hurting someone's feelings; we're afraid someone might not like us; we're afraid of what other people might think, and so on.
<P>
Yes and no are there to express what <I>you</I> want, what <I>your</I> preferences are, what <I>you</I> are willing to and not willing to do.
<P>
Often, we're asked to say yes or no to a future event. How do we know <I>now</I> if we're going to want to do it <I>then?</I> A good indicator: If it were available to do <I>right now,</I> would you do it? Yes or no? When it comes time to do it, you'll be doing it "right now," because "then" has a sneaky way of becoming "now." So, if you don't want to do it now, you probably won't want to do it then.

<H2><I><A NAME="Sixty-two">Sixty-two</A>: It's Okay to Feel--Anything</I></H2>
<P>
There are no "bad" feelings. Even "feeling bad" is not a "bad" feeling.
<P>
The secret--whether up or down--is to enjoy the ride.
<P>
Feel the full range of emotions available to you. People spend large amounts of time and money on movies, TV, videos, novels, and music so that they might <I>feel</I> something.
<P>
Those who can make us feel the most, most often, are known as entertainment geniuses. We make them stars--and <I>rich.</I>
<P>
Even if we don't respect <I>what</I> they create, we are still aware that it has the power to move us. ("Extraordinary," said Noel Coward, "how potent cheap music is.")
<P>
There is such a thing as a healthy sadness--free from the self-pity and suffering of depression.
<P>
Be <I>moved</I> by your own life. <I>Feel</I> it in all its fullness and glory.

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><I><A NAME="Sixty-three">Sixty-three</A>: Hurt, Resentment, and Guilt</I></H2>
<P>
<I>Hurt, resentment,</I> and <I>guilt</I> are closely related. When something is taken away from us, or something we want is not made available to us, we can feel hurt. Hurt is difficult for people to feel and express. So, some people avoid it by turning to anger. If we get angry at someone or something <I>outside</I> ourselves, it's called resentment. If we get angry <I>at</I> ourselves, it's called guilt. Anytime we feel anger--whether it's expressed as guilt or resentment--there's hurt underneath it.
<P>
If you catch the hurt early enough, you can move directly back to the <I>caring.</I>
<P>
You're never hurt about anything you don't care about. <I>Switch</I> the caring from the disappointing object to another object about which you can "safely" care. (Here, having a love for God, nature, or the universe comes in handy.)
<P>
If you don't catch the disappointment soon enough, you're left with hurt, guilt, and/or resentment. <I>Do something</I> with them--preferably something physical, but safe. A few deep breaths, a good stretch, walking, dancing, or singing. Silent screams, or noisy screams--if you can do them without frightening the horses. ("I don't care what they do," said Mrs. Patrick Campbell a century ago, "as long as they don't do it in the street and frighten the horses.") Cry, write down your negative thoughts and burn the paper. Lie on a bed and kick and scream. Beat a pillow.
<P>
If you seem to have a residue of hurt, resentment, or guilt, you might want to schedule a session with your therapist for some emotional "release" work.
<P>
Notice that none of our suggestions for releasing negative feelings involves anyone other than you and a professional. We did not suggest, "Go and really tell them off. <I>Then</I> you'll feel better!" That seldom works. In the first place, people don't just stand there, as they do in the movies, and get told off. They tend to <I>interrupt.</I>
<P>
(Well, you <I>knew</I> they were rude.) They usually start to tell <I>you</I> off. (The impertinence!) Finally, once they have been told off, they are <I>seldom</I> properly devastated. (How dare they?) And if they <I>act</I> devastated, how do you know they're not doing it just to make you feel guilty? (Those sneaky bastards!) "Peace of mind," wrote J. P. McEvoy, "is better than giving them `a piece of your mind.'"
<P>
<I>Communicating</I> your feelings with people you're close to is essential, but communication is not the same as venting, dumping, or telling off. In fact, it's often easier to communicate a negative feeling when you're <I>not</I> feeling it.
<P>
Communicate hurt using "I" statements. ("I feel disappointed"; "I'm hurt when you don't call if you're going to be late"; "I'd prefer it if you would....") And be sure to let them know that you only feel hurt because you <I>care.</I><P>

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><I><A NAME="Sixty-four">Sixty-four</A>: Forgiving</I></H2>
<P>
Forgiving is a word that means just what it says: <I>for giving.</I>
<P>
Whom are we for giving to? Those we forgive? Sometimes. Ourselves?<I> Always.</I>
<P>
The primary reason to forgive is for <I>your</I> peace of mind, and the quality of all your future relationships. (For more on this, please see two of Harold's earlier books, <I>Making Peace with Yourself</I> and <I>Making Peace with Your Parents.)</I>
<P>
Jesus of Nazareth was one of the greatest teachers of forgiveness. In the eye-for-an-eye, tooth-for-a-tooth world into which he came, forgiveness was a radical concept. (Just as it is today.) The word Jesus used for forgiveness meant to <I>untie, </I>to<I> let go.</I><P>
<P>
That's what we do when we forgive: we <I>let go </I>of the imaginary (but painful) control of the way we think things <I>should</I> be, and we <I>untie</I> ourselves from the burden of judging the way they are. Forgiveness is a direct route to freedom, lightening up, and moving on.
<P>
Forgiveness is a simple process: you say (aloud or to yourself), "I forgive..." then state the person (perhaps yourself), event, or occurrence you have judged. Then add, "I forgive myself for judging . . ." and state the same person, event, or occurrence. So, not only do you let go of the <I>judgment;</I> you let go of whatever judgment you've made <I>for having judged in the first place.</I><P>
 And then let the matter go. See it dissolve in a pure, white light.
<P>
Forgive, forget, and move on with your life.

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P><BR>


Welcome.
<P>
Our goal is to make this book brief, practical, and to-the-point.
<P>
The last thing a person with depression wants is an intricate tome, heavy with footnotes, citations, Latin words, and sentences such as "Depression is a biopsychosocial disorder, sometimes treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors."
<P>
We have also included quotes from people, some well known and some not, across many cultures and centuries, to show that depression-and the desire to heal it-is a deeply human and universal experience.
<P>
Our approach to the treatment of depression is twofold. Each part is equally important.
<P>
One is healing the brain, as current medical research points to biochemical imbalances in the brain as the seat of depression.
<P>
The other is healing the mind-overcoming negative habits of thought and action which may cause, or be caused by, depression.
<P>
Treating the brain and the mind is the most effective way to heal depression. Recent medical and psychological breakthroughs make depression among the most successfully treatable of all serious illnesses.

<STRONG>About This Book</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>
Our book is divided into four parts.
<P>
In Part I, "Understanding Depression," we discuss what depression is (and is not); how you can be depressed without "feeling depressed"; and the possible causes of depression. There's even a short self-evaluation for depression, compliments of the National Institutes of Health (page 22).
<P>
In Part II, "Healing the Brain," we look at the biological causes of depression and its medical treatment. This includes antidepressant medication, nutrition, exercise, and such strenuous activities as hot baths and massage. This is the domain of the psychiatrist, family doctor, and other healthcare specialists.
<P>
Part III we call "Healing the Mind." We explore unlearning mental habits either caused by or contributing to depression, while learning new mental patterns that tend to enhance effectiveness, well-being, and emotional freedom. We discuss exciting new short-term therapies (usually only ten to twenty sessions) that have proven to be highly successful in healing depression. This is the domain of the psychologist, psychiatrist, clinical social worker, and mental health professional.
<P>
The final section, Part IV, is "As Healing Continues...." Although most people treated for depression find remarkable results within a short time, the complete healing of depression often continues for a while. There are ups and downs, lessons to be learned, new pathways to be explored.
<P>
Thank you for joining us on this healing journey.

If you or someone you know is depressed, you are not alone.
<P>
<EM>That's</EM> something of an understatement.
<P>
One in twenty Americans currently suffers from a depression severe enough to require medical treatment.
<P>
One person in five will have a depression at some time in his or her life.
<P>
Depression in its various forms (insomnia, fatigue, anxiety, stress, vague aches and pains, etc.) is the most common complaint heard in doctors' offices.
<P>
Two percent of all children and five percent of all adolescents suffer from depression.
<P>
More than twice as many women are currently being treated for depression than men. (It is not known whether this is because women are more likely to be depressed, or whether men tend to deny their depression.)
<P>
People over sixty-five are four times more likely to suffer depression than the rest of the population.

If you feel suicidal and are afraid you might act on it, please call 911, your doctor, a crisis prevention hotline, or go immediately to your local hospital emergency room. (Our thoughts on suicide are on page 36.)

<P>
More than eighty percent of the people with depression can be successfully treated.
<P>
Long-term, expensive treatments are seldom necessary.
<P>
Modern treatment for most depression is antidepressant medication and short-term "talk" therapy--usually just ten to twenty sessions.
<P>
Treatment for depression is relatively inexpensive but whatever the cost, it is more than made up for in increased productivity, efficiency, physical health, improved relationships, and enjoyment of life.
<P>
Yes, life will always have its "slings and arrows of outrageous fortune," and, yes, they will hurt. But there's no need to suffer from depression as well.

One of the most common feelings people with depression have is, "Enough!" "I've had it!" "I can't take any more."
<P>
When we discuss treatment for depression, it may sound as if we're asking you to add even more to your already overburdened life. Although it may <EM>seem</EM> this way, effective treatment for depression will <EM>lighten</EM> your load.
<P>
Yes, we are asking you to visit "healthcare professionals," and, yes, a simple suggestion such as "Find a doctor or psychiatrist who specializes in the treatment of depression" can seem awfully intimidating.
<P>
<EM>But it will be worth it.</EM><P>
Most people respond to treatment for depression swiftly usually in a matter of weeks. You may not feel "better than good" overnight, but the sense of being overburdened, overworked, and overwhelmed should significantly ease in a short time.

<P>
Another common symptom of depression, as voiced by Hamlet: "How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world!"
<P>
Questions such as "Who cares?" "What's the point?" and "Why bother?" circulate in the mind of the depressed person.
<P>
Unfortunately, this <EM>symptom</EM> of depression can keep one from seeking treatment. It becomes a vicious cycle: as the untreated depression worsens, the person feels that life is less and less worthwhile. As the person feels that life is less and less worthwhile, he or she is less likely to seek treatment.
<P>
Depression is an illness that robs one of the meaning of life. Heal the illness. As the depression heals, enthusiasm, well-being, and a sense of life's purpose will return.

<P>
You didn't <EM>do</EM> anything to become depressed. 
<P>
Your<EM> failure</EM> to do something didn't cause your depression.
<p>
Depression is an <EM>illness.</EM>
<P>
You are no more at fault for having depression than if you had asthma, diabetes, heart disease, or any other illness.
<P>
In becoming depressed, you have nothing to blame yourself for and nothing to feel guilty about. (Although two of the symptoms of depression are that you probably <EM>will</EM> blame yourself and you probably <EM>will </EM>feel guilty.)
<P>
A predisposition toward depression can be hereditary. In addition, life is full of bumps and potholes--many of which simply cannot be avoided. It's not surprising, then, if one of them (or a collection of them) triggers a depressive illness.
<P>
So, for heaven's sake, don't blame yourself. Don't even blame yourself for blaming yourself.
<P>
It's not your fault.

<P>
In this book, we will do our best not to overburden you with technical terms and healthcare jargon. A few terms, however, are important to know.
<P>
First, the word <EM>depression</EM> itself. When we speak of depression, we are speaking of what is medically known as <EM>clinical depression</EM>. We're discussing a specific illness that requires clinical intervention--hence <EM>clinical</EM> depression.
<P>
We are not discussing the pain that immediately follows loss, or the "down" cycle in life's ordinary ups and downs.
<P>
Nor are we discussing the popular use of the word <EM>depressed,</EM> which usually means <EM>disappointed.</EM><P>("The coffee machine ran out. I'm depressed.")
<P>
When we use <EM>depression,</EM> we're talking about a specific medical illness--one with a highly effective treatment.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Nine">Nine</A>:<br>The Three Primary Types of Depression</EM></H2>
<P>
There are three primary forms of depression.
<P>
<B><EM>Major Depression.</EM></B> Like the flu, major depression has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Unlike the flu, major depressions often last for months. Left untreated, they tend to reoccur. Each reoccurrence tends to last longer and is more debilitating than the one before.
<P>
<B><EM>Chronic Depression.</EM></B> Chronic depression is a low-grade, long-term depression that can go on for years. Some people have had it most of their lives. Long-term, low-grade depression is also known as <EM>dysthymia</EM>. <EM>dys,</EM> meaning disorder, and <EM>thymia</EM> for mood. Dysthymia, then, is a disorder of one's mood.
<P>
<B><EM>Manic-Depression.</EM></B> Here the lows of depression can alternate with days or weeks of <EM>mania</EM>extreme elation, unreasonably grandiose thoughts, and inappropriate, sometimes destructive actions. This is also known as <EM>bipolar </EM>depression, because the manic-depressive person fluctuates from one emotional pole (down) to the opposite pole (up) in unpredictable, rapid swings. (By contrast, major depression is unipolar--it focuses on only one pole: down.)
<P>
We'll discuss other types of depression later. For now, let's take a look at that burning question, "Am I depressed?"
<P>
<BR><CENTER><EM>The aggravated agony<BR>

	<LI>Eating disturbances (loss of appetite and weight, or weight gain)
	<LI>Difficulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions
	<LI>Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness
	<LI>Thoughts of death or suicide, suicide attempts
	<LI>Irritability
	<LI>Excessive crying
	<LI>Chronic aches and pains that don't respond to treatment

"A thorough diagnosis is needed if four or more of the symptoms of depression or mania persist for more than two weeks," say the National Institutes of Health, "or are interfering with work or family life."
<P>
The symptoms on the facing page are <EM>not</EM> "just life." If four or more of the symptoms have been a regular part of your life for more than two weeks or regularly tend to interfere with your life, a consultation with a physician experienced in diagnosing and treating depression is in order. 
You need not suffer any longer. Treatment is readily available.
<P>
"With available treatment, eighty percent of the people with serious depression--even those with the most severe forms--can improve significantly," say the National Institutes of Health. "Symptoms can be relieved, usually in a matter of weeks."

<P>
It is unfortunate that the word <EM>depression</EM> is used to describe so many different, yet sometimes overlapping, experiences.
<P>
Yes, many people who have clinical depression feel down, sad, disappointed, and upset. One can, however, feel all of these emotions ("I'm depressed!") <EM>without </EM> being clinically depressed.
<P>
Pain after a loss, for example, is a natural part of the healing process, not a sign of clinical depression. (If the pain becomes extremely severe or continues for an unusual length of time, the loss may have triggered a type of clinical depression that's known as a <EM>melancholy depression.</EM> When mourning becomes melancholia, or if a loss has dealt a severe blow to your self-worth, see your physician.)
<P>
On the other hand, some people <EM>do</EM> have a clinical depression and <EM>do not</EM> feel unusual amounts of sorrow, sadness, or emotional hurt.
<P>
Symptoms of clinical depression include insomnia; eating disturbances; physical aches and pains; difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. These are not, however, what most people call "down" or "depressing" emotions.
<P>
If in doubt, it is best to get an objective, outside expert--your physician--to make an accurate diagnosis.

Because of the stigma of depression, many people think that seeking help implies some sort of personal lack--a lack that <EM>should</EM> be overcome by strength, fortitude, or gumption.
<P>
This is not the case.
<P>
Seeking help for an illness (<EM>any </EM> illness) does not imply a lack of mental, physical, emotional, or moral character.

To the contrary, it takes great courage to admit something <EM>may </EM>be wrong. It is a sign of deep wisdom to consult professionals, seeking their advice and direction.

<P>
The original title for Woody Allen's film <EM>Annie Hall</EM> was <EM>Anne Hedonia.</EM><P>
<P>
"Sometimes [depression] is mere passive joylessness and dreariness, discouragement, dejection, lack of taste and zest and spring," wrote the father of American psychology, William James, in 1902. "Professor Ribot has proposed the name <EM>anhedonia </EM> to designate this condition."
<P>
Anhedonia was derived from the Greek: <EM>an </EM>, meaning not, and<EM> hedone</EM>, meaning pleasure--the inability to experience pleasure.
<P>
If it's been a while since you've genuinely enjoyed your life (or can't relate much to the terms <EM>enjoyment,</EM> <EM>pleasure,</EM> or <EM>fun),</EM> that may indicate depression.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Fifteen">Fifteen</A>: Other Types of Depression</EM></H2>
<P>
In addition to the Big Three we discussed on page 20--major depression, chronic low-grade depression (dysthymia), and manic-depression--there are some other types of depression:
<P><UL>
	<LI>Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This seems to be associated with the reduction of daylight hours during winter. The treatment may be as simple as installing full-spectrum fluorescent lighting in the home and workplace. (New Yorkers have been prescribing for themselves winter trips to Miami for generations.) 
<P>
	<LI>Postpartum Depression. Fifty to seventy- five percent of all women, following childbirth, experience "postpartum blues." One in ten women who experience this, however, develop a postpartum <EM>depression.</EM> This means that from five to seven and one-half percent of all new mothers have a depression that requires treatment. Postpartum depression seems to be caused by the hormonal, physiological, and emotional vulnerabilities of this period. If the normal "postpartum blues" seem particularly severe, or they continue for more than a few weeks, discuss it with your doctor. 
<P>
	<LI>Atypical Depression. Atypical <EM> not </EM> typical) depression has symptoms which seem to be the opposite of what was once thought to be a typical depression. Rather than sleeping less, people sleep more; rather than lose weight, they gain weight; rather than have low energy, they're agitated. In addition, people with atypical depression tend to be <EM>extremely </EM> sensitive to rejection.  
<P>
	<LI>Double Depression. Here someone with a chronic low-grade depression (dysthymia) has a major depression as well. As we previously noted, chronic depressions can go on for years, even decades, while major depressions have a beginning, a middle, and an end. During the time one has both chronic depression and a major depression, it's a double depression.
</UL><P>
A psychiatrist or physician well versed in diagnosing depression will know the symptoms to look for in determining which depression you may have. 
<P>
(Please don't use this brief list to try to categorize or diagnose yourself or others. It is presented here simply to give an idea of the range and varieties depressive illness can take.)

<H2><EM><A NAME="Sixteen">Sixteen</A>: Delay Major Decisions--Depression Alters Perception</EM></H2>
<P>
It's important to remember that when depressed, we are not perceiving the world, or ourselves, accurately. Therefore, evaluations, judgments, and decisions may be inaccurate.
<P>
If you think you may be depressed, the only major decision to make is to get a diagnosis and, if diagnosed as depressed, to get treatment. Other major decisions can wait until the depression begins to heal.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Seventeen">Seventeen</A>: The Question of Suicide</EM></H2>
<P>
It is very common for depressed people to have thoughts and feelings of suicide. Such thoughts and feelings are, in fact, a symptom of depression.
<P>
For obvious reasons, however, it is important not to <EM>act </EM>upon suicidal thoughts or feelings.
<P>
Sadly, fifteen percent of all depressed people will commit suicide as a result of their depression. Two-thirds of all suicides are directly related to depression.
<P>
If you feel you even <EM>may</EM> act upon suicidal thoughts or feelings, call a crisis prevention line, your family doctor, a good friend, or any healthcare professional <EM>at once.</EM> Go to an emergency room, or call 911 and say, "I'm feeling suicidal. Please help."
<P>
As your depression heals, life improves; you will no longer feel like committing suicide.
<P>
Yes, life will still have its ups and downs, and you will feel your fair share of sadness, anger, grief, fear, and all the other "down" emotions. As depression heals, however, suicide will seldom seem the only solution.
<P>
The question of suicide? Keep it a question. It's not really an answer.

<P>
As powerful as the power of positive thoughts are, depression<EM> biologically interferes </EM> with the brain's ability to maintain a positive thought for any period of time. Like the farmer who casts his seed upon the rocks, all the positive thoughts in the world presented to the depressed mind will not bear fruit.
<P>
"There are joys which long to be ours," wrote Henry Ward Beecher. "God sends ten thousand truths, which come about us like birds seeking inlet; but we are shut up to them, and so they bring us nothing, but sit and sing awhile upon the roof, and then fly away."
<P>
Depression shuts us up.
<P>
Overly positive, horrendously cheerful people can make a depressed person even more depressed. In fact, perhaps the <EM>least </EM> helpful thing one can say to a depressed person is, "Cheer up!"
<P>
When thinking is distorted, as it is during depression, medical <EM>treatment</EM> is needed to till the soil so that positive thoughts can take root.

<P>
Here we use the word <EM>God</EM> in the broadest possible sense. Please fill in your personal belief when we use the word <EM>God.</EM><P>
There are many misconceptions concerning God and depression. These include:
<P><UL>
	<LI>Depression is a punishment from God.<BR>
	<LI>To seek help for depression is to doubt God's ability to heal it.<BR>
	<LI>If we "suffer enough," God will be pleased with us.<BR>
	<LI>Depression is a spiritual illness; the only treatment should be God's personal intervention.</UL>
<P>
In fact (or at least it seems a fact to <EM>us),</EM> God and God's benevolence come in many forms and manifest in many ways. Among these we must include modern science and the entire healing profession. (God moves in mysterious ways; psychiatrists are just one of them.)
<P>
It is hard to find the believer who will not take penicillin for pneumonia, insulin for diabetes, or have a broken bone properly set.
<P>
The overwhelming majority of people who are successfully treated for depression find that their faith, spiritual connection, and perception of divine goodness <EM>increase.</EM><P>
<P>
Modern treatment of depression is a gift of God.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Twenty">Twenty</A>: What Causes Depression?</EM></H2>
<P>
Depression manifests as an imbalance in the biochemistry of the brain. This results in what some call "faulty thinking." This combination of biological imbalance and psychological distortion causes the havoc known as depression.
<P>
A depression can be triggered--that is, set off--by any number of factors: genetic predisposition, major loss, a painful childhood, unresolved grief, stress, serious illness, economic difficulties, bad relationships, and so much more. These are, however, merely what <EM>sets off</EM> the depression.
<P>
The state of "being depressed" (having a depressive illness) takes place in the brain: a biochemical imbalance in the brain and a psychological imbalance in thinking.
<P>
Let's explore each in greater detail.

The human brain is the most intricate, complex, and exquisite communication center on earth. Ten billion brain cells transmit billions of messages each second. And, as Alan Watts pointed out, "It does all this without our even thinking about it."
<P>
The biochemical messengers of this communication are known as neurotransmitters. (<EM>Neuro</EM> refers to the brain cells and <EM>transmitter</EM> , to sending and receiving information.)
<P>
When neurotransmitters are at appropriate levels, the brain functions harmoniously. We tend to feel good. We have hope, purpose, and direction. Although we certainly experience the ups and downs of life, the overall mood is one of well-being, confidence, and security.
<P>
Although there are dozens of different neurotransmitters, research indicates that a deficiency in some of the neurotransmitters<EM>serotonin, norepinephrine,</EM> and <EM>dopamine</EM> may be one cause of depression. On the other hand, excess amounts of neurotransmitters may be a cause of the manic phase of manic-depression.
<P>
Restoring these neurotransmitters to natural levels by way of antidepressant medication brings the brain back into harmonious functioning and a return to well-being.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Twenty-two">Twenty-two</A>: The Mind and Its Negative Thoughts</EM></H2>
<P>
Negative thoughts can play an important role in depression. Such thoughts can become a bad habit. For some, they become an addiction.
<P>
Some common negative thoughts include
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>"I'm no good."
	<LI>"No one understands me."
	<LI>"Life isn't fair."
	<LI>"I don't <EM>dare</EM> do that."
	<LI>"How dare they do that?"
	<LI>"I hate it when . . . ."
	<LI>"I'm afraid that . . . ."
	<LI>"I'm a failure."
</UL><P>
These can lead to habitual, often addictive behavior, such as
<P><UL>
	<LI>Overeating
	<LI>Drug abuse
	<LI>Alcoholism
	<LI>Smoking
	<LI>Compulsive gambling
	<LI>Shoplifting
	<LI>Sexual compulsions
	<LI>Workaholism
</UL><P>
And many more.
<P>
Habitual patterns of negative thoughts and self-destructive behavior can cause, continue, or worsen a depression.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Twenty-three">Twenty-three</A>: Which Came First? </EM></H2>
<P>
So, depression manifests itself as a biochemical imbalance in the brain and as negative thoughts in the mind. But where does depression begin? Which manifestation is the "first cause" of depression?
<P>
The answer: it doesn't really matter.
<P>
A deficiency of neurotransmitters can contribute to negative thoughts and behaviors. And, negative thoughts and behaviors can contribute to a reduction in neurotransmitters. Whichever started the depression, it becomes a downward spiral, one feeding the other into a deepening gloom.
<P>
Which came first, then, is not important. What to <EM>do</EM> about depression is. Antidepressant medication helps restore the proper balance of neurotransmitters in the brain. Certain short-term therapies (most particularly Cognitive and Interpersonal therapies) teach new habits of thought and action. The medical (brain) and psychotherapeutic (mind) approaches have, individually, been successful in treating depression.
<P>
Some prefer to approach healing from one angle; others prefer to approach it from the other. Gluttons for happiness that we are, we suggest you consider <EM>both.</EM><P>
 Combining therapies appears to be the most successful treatment of all.

<P>
Like many illnesses, depression runs in the family. Heart disease, hypertension, and depression are among the illnesses that are common to certain family trees.
<P>
Living with someone who is chronically depressed can be depressing. When a relative or loved one has recurrent episodes of depression, there is a profound disruption of family life. Family members experience pain, exhaustion, and are more prone to depression.
<P>
"Misery no longer loves company," Russell Baker observed. "Nowadays it insists upon it."

<H2><EM><A NAME="Twenty-five">Twenty-five</A>: Depression Related to Age</EM></H2>
<P>
Depressions can take place at any age. Infants can have depression, as can people well into their second century on earth.
<P>
About six million American children under twelve have a clinical depression, much of it unrecognized and untreated. Sometimes behavior diagnosed as an Attention Deficit Disorder (children who are easily distracted, hyperactive, and have difficulty paying attention) is, in fact, depression.
<P>
One in twenty adolescents suffers from depression. Hormonal changes, emerging identity crises, peer pressure, sexual issues, and the increased responsibility of approaching adulthood can contribute to depression. Tragically, the suicide rate among teenagers has almost tripled in one generation.
<P>
The generation from eighteen to thirty sometimes called Generation-X realizes it may be the first generation in the history of the United States to be less affluent than the generation before. Many who make up Generation-X are also keenly aware of the condition of the country and planet being passed on to them. Understandably, many are not happy about it. For some individuals, this unhappiness deepens into a depression.
<P>
The ubiquitous baby boomers--some in their forties, some in their fifties, and most in denial--find that they have <EM>become</EM> their parents. All the problems, crises, and attitudes they so despised in their parents have come home to roost. In addition, the post-war generation is discovering that, like Peter Pan exiled from Never-Never Land, youth is not eternal. And then there's that icky thing called <EM>death.</EM> All of this leads to what has been dubbed the Baby Boomer Blues.
<P>
People over sixty-five are four times more likely to experience depression than the general population. Tragically, many elderly people are believed to have early stages of senility or Alzheimer's disease when, in fact, they have a treatable depression.
<P>
Too often, the symptoms of depression from physical aches and pains to poor memory--are written off as "just growing old." While certain physical and mental problems may arise due to aging, they may <EM>also</EM> be symptoms of depression that should be carefully evaluated by a physician.
<P>
Above all, it is <EM>never</EM> normal to feel unhappy day after day, simply because you're growing older.
<P>
The National Institutes for Health have free pamphlets for depression written for various age groups. Please call 1-800-421-4211 for your copy.

<P>
A person can seldom experience the feelings associated with depression misery, fear, anger, hurt, or an inability to experience pleasure without looking for a cause.
<P>
The symptoms of depression are often blamed on everything <EM>but </EM>depression.
<P>
People look for a cause for these feelings in two places: within themselves or outside themselves.
<P>
Those who look inward for the cause of their depressive symptoms feel blame, guilt, and shame. They are mercilessly criticized by the inner voice of depression.
<P>
Those who look outside themselves for causes of depression tend to become angry, contemptuous, arrogant, destructive (sometimes physically), and spend a great deal of time complaining--usually to other depressed people.
<P>
Members of the Ain't-It-Awful Club gather in bars and cocktail lounges all over the country between five and seven, when drinks are half price, and the only rule is, "You get to tell me your problems, but you have to listen to mine." For some unknown reason, this is known as the Happy Hour.
<P>
Inappropriate blame either inner or outer contributes to an ever-deepening depression.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Twenty-seven">Twenty-seven</A>: Physical Pain and Depression</EM></H2>
<P>
Thus far, we have been exploring the emotional pain caused by depression. Depression can cause physical pain, too.
<P>
Physical pain can be both a symptom of and a cause of depression.
<P>
Vague physical aches and pains that do not respond to treatment may, in fact, be a manifestation of depression. Some people feel the pain of depression primarily <EM>physically</EM> rather than emotionally or mentally.
<P>
On the other hand, the chronic (long-term) physical pain caused by an accident, arthritis, back problems, burns, cancer, AIDS, or other illness can trigger a depression. Biologically, chronic pain can deplete the supply of neurotransmitters in the brain.
<P>
To make matters worse, depression can lower the threshold of pain--pain tends to be felt more often and more intensely.
<P>
All pain is real. Nothing we say here is to imply that the physical pain from depression is only "in your head." It is as real as any other pain, and needs to be treated.
<P>
If you know you are depressed, do not simply write off physical aches and pains as symptoms of depression. Pain is a signal from the body that something needs attention and care. Report all physical pain to your physician.
<P>
Those with chronic pain due to an accident or illness would do well to discuss with their physician whether depression is also present.
<P>

<P>
Obviously, the symptoms of depression on page 22 would not be a listing of what people refer to when they discuss "the quality of life."
<P>
But on top of the pain, misery, and unproductiveness depression brings, it also brings an increase in physical illness.
<P>
Many people with depression produce a higher-than-normal level of the hormone <EM>cortisol.</EM> Cortisol suppresses the immune system.
<P>
A suppressed immune system makes one more vulnerable to infectious illness. In addition, a suppressed immune system can make one more susceptible to cancer. 
People who suffer from "poor health" may run from doctor to doctor putting out one fire after another, when the underlying cause may be depression.
<P>
In a vicious cycle, a depression can contribute to chronic illness, and chronic illness can contribute to depression. It's often hard to tell which came first, but it's easy to see how both can feed upon each other, causing more illness, more depression, and shortening life.
<P>
Those suffering from a chronic illness would do well to discuss with their doctor whether depression is also present.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Twenty-nine">Twenty-nine</A>:<BR>Depression is the #1 Cause of Alcoholism, Drug Abuse, and Other Addictions</EM></H2>
<P>
Depression can be an all-pervasive emotional-mental-physical source of misery. It's hard to hurt so completely and for so long without seeking some relief from the pain.
<P>
Almost any drug or distraction will do. Alcohol is the most commonly self-prescribed painkiller for depression. It is readily available and socially acceptable. Unfortunately, alcohol is chemically a depressant. After its brief euphoric effects, it only worsens the depression. This is especially true when alcohol is taken in the quantities some people consume in order to obtain mental and emotional oblivion.
<P>
Drugs of all kinds--legal, illegal, over-the-counter, or prescription--are sometimes inappropriately used by depressed people for numbing specific symptoms. Alas, they do not treat the underlying cause. Uppers, downers, painkillers, tranquilizers, "getting high," and all the rest are ineffective treatment for depression. In fact, they can worsen the depression.
<P>
We certainly aren't saying that social drinking, prescription drugs, or appropriately selected medications for either therapeutic or recreational purposes are always bad, always a sign of depression, or always cause depression. We are simply saying that <EM>anything--</EM>even good things--can be abused in an effort to "self-medicate" the symptoms of depression.
<P>
Tobacco is both a stimulant <EM>and</EM> a depressant. Consequently, it can be used by smokers to regulate mood--up, down, or both. Unfortunately, nicotine is one of the most addictive substances known, and the "side effects" of smoking result in numerous illnesses and 500,000 deaths each year in the United States. Even if smoking <EM>were</EM> the cure for depression (which it's not) and even if tobacco <EM>didn't</EM> contribute to depression (which it does), the side effects alone would rule it out as a drug of choice.
<P>
These "self-medications" need not be chemical. People have been known to abuse just about anything you can name in an effort to distract themselves from an untreated depression: food, sex, TV, gambling, work--even romance and religion.
<P>
Anything can become a compulsion--a joyless, driven, addictive behavior. What may be good and positive in its proper place becomes not only a cover-up for the depression, but, in time, contributes to the depression itself.
<P>
Certainly people can have compulsions without being depressed, and not all depressed people have serious compulsions. If you have a "bad habit," however, it may be worth exploring the possibility of depression with your physician.
<P>

<H2><EM><A NAME="Thirty">Thirty</A>: Eating Disorders</EM></H2>
<P>
Depression may contribute to eating disorders, and eating disorders may contribute to depression. It's another of those downward spirals.
<P>
<EM>Anorexia nervosa</EM> is characterized by severe weight loss, distorted body image, and an extreme fear of becoming overweight.
<P>
<EM>Bulimia </EM>is binge-eating, followed by purging either through vomiting or laxatives. Some bulimics also have anorexia nervosa.
<P>
<EM>Obesity</EM> is caused by eating until the body is dangerously overweight.
<P>
Depression can be an underlying cause of eating disorders. In one study, as many as three out of four bulimic individuals were depressed. The vast majority of them benefited from treatment for depression.
<P>
Eating disorders are illnesses. They are not anyone's fault. They are not a lack of will power, character, or self-discipline.
<P>
If depression is contributing to these illnesses, treating the depression is an important complement to treating the eating disorder.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Thirty-one">Thirty-one</A>: Insomnia and Other Sleep Disorders</EM></H2>
<P>
Most people with depression have a sleep disorder. The most common is <EM>insomnia</EM>. People with depression often tell their doctors, "I can't remember the last time I had a good night's sleep."
<P>
There are basically three types of insomnia:
<P>
<EM>Difficulty falling asleep</EM>
<P>
<EM>Difficulty staying asleep,</EM> also known as <EM>intermittent awakening</EM>
<P>
<EM>Early morning awakening,</EM> in which one awakes at three or four in the morning and is unable to get back to sleep
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum is hypersomnia. <EM>Hyper,</EM> for lots, and <EM>somnia,</EM> for sleep. People with hypersomnia can sleep ten to fourteen hours at night and still take daily naps.
<P>
Both insomnia and hypersomnia can indicate depression.
<P>
Unfortunately, insomnia caused by depression is sometimes inappropriately treated with sleeping pills, which do not treat the underlying depression <EM>and</EM> can make the depression worse. Anyone who regularly takes sleeping pills should discuss the possibility of depression with his or her physician.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Thirty-two">Thirty-two</A>: Fatigue</EM></H2>
<P>
The most common symptom of depression presented to doctors is fatigue. Certainly, fatigue has any number of physical and mental causes (mononucleosis, hepatitis, excessive workload, profound boredom), but when fatigue persists, depression should not be overlooked.
<P>
Fatigue is more than just being occasionally tired. Tiredness is a natural phenomenon and a signal to rest. Many people with fatigue, however, awaken from a full night's sleep and still feel exhausted. Or, they may have only a few productive hours in the day.
<P>
Procrastination, distraction, and lack of motivation are often manifestations of fatigue.
<P>
Depression also brings a mental fatigue--the mind is simply "tired," and one has difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions.
<P>
Emotional fatigue is often felt as "I can't take any more," "Leave me alone," and often manifests as irritability or withdrawal.
<P>
For many, the lifting of fatigue that follows the successful treatment of depression can transform their lives.
<P>

Depression impairs the ability to care and be cared for, give and receive, love and be loved.
<P>
Depression can significantly interfere with <EM>all</EM> relationships--with friends, co-workers, bosses, employees, children, parents, spouses, lovers, and even one's relationship with self, God, and life.
<P>
Relationships are an excellent mirror as to how we are doing. If the relationships in one's life seem deeply troubled, perhaps it's because that person is deeply troubled. The trouble may be depression.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Thirty-four">Thirty-four</A>: Romanticizing Depression</EM></H2>
<P>
In days of old (prior to the mid-1950s) there were few effective treatments for depression. People, however, knew depression well.
<P>
Depression is as old as humankind. "The Man Who Was Tired of Life" is the title of a poem written in 1990--that's 1990 <EM>B.C.</EM><P>

<P>
What can poets and philosophers do when they have a malady that has no treatment? Romanticize it, of course. Thus sprang the belief that depression was essential to the development of a human being.
<P>
"All artists today," said Lawrence Durrell, "are expected to cultivate a little fashionable unhappiness."
<P>
In 1621, Robert Burton observed that nothing was "so sweet as melancholy," and Maurice Maeterlinck mused in 1896, "The value of ourselves is but the value of our melancholy and our disquiet."
<P>
Some artistic or intellectual people avoid treatment for fear of losing their creative sensibilities. It may be difficult to communicate to them that ongoing suffering does not bring about deepening wisdom, perception of life's "true reality," or creative achievement.
<P>
Depression is an illness, and it is no more noble today to suffer from it than it would be to suffer from untreated scurvy, syphilis, or goiter--three illnesses that, like depression, had no known cure a century or so ago.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Thirty-five">Thirty-five</A>: The Stigma of Depression</EM></H2>
<P>
The flip side of romanticizing depression is the enormous social stigma of depression and the treatment of depression itself.
<P>
Some believe that depression is the first step on a short walk to the loony bin. Others believe that the treatment of depression is just too hip to be true.
<P>
<EM>Newsweek</EM> stated on its February 7, 1994, cover, "Shy? Forgetful? Anxious? Fearful? Obsessed? How science will let you change your personality with a pill." <EM>Newsweek</EM> suggests that shyness, forgetfulness, anxiety, fear, and obsession are part of one's <EM>personality.</EM>
<P>
They are also possible symptoms of depression.
<P>
As long as people<EM> identify</EM> with their depression as though it were some part of their <EM>self,</EM> ("It's just the way I am"), they're not likely to seek diagnosis and treatment.
<P>
The major problem <EM>by far</EM> with treating depression in this country is undertreatment.
<P>
Nevertheless, some people mock antidepressant treatments as a trendy fad, making snide comments about "Vitamin P" or the "Prozac personality." (In fact, people successfully treated for depression report they feel <EM>more themselves.)</EM>
<P>
Please don't let any of this media chatter interfere with your seeking a diagnosis, treatment, and healing.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Thirty-six">Thirty-six</A>: Why Depression Must Be Treated</EM></H2>
<P>
That may sound like a rather strong statement--as you may have noticed, we seldom use the word <EM>must</EM> (at least in print). The statement, however, is not ours. It comes from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
<P>
Major depression, untreated, can last six months to a year. It then goes away. (One cycle of a major depression--its beginning, middle, and end--is known as an <EM>episode.)</EM> Without treatment, half the people who have one depressive episode will have another. After two episodes, the chances of having a third episode are even greater. After three episodes, the chances of having a fourth depression are ninety percent.
<P>
Chronic low-grade depression (dysthymia) may not have any seriously debilitating symptoms, but it can interfere with work, family, and almost all other aspects of life. Untreated, it can last for years, decades, or a lifetime. Dysthymia, in fact, becomes a "ground of being," and it's hard for a person with a long-term depression to even imagine another way of feeling, thinking, or behaving. Without treatment, the chances are that chronic depression will continue and, most likely, worsen.
<P>
Manic-depression, untreated, continues. The highs become increasingly unstable, and the lows become increasingly painful. The sudden shifts from mania to depression become more frequent and debilitating.
<P>
Many people postpone treatment, thinking the depression will simply "go away." This may or may not take place. As with any serious illness, it is always advisable to seek treatment.
<P>
Depression, like any major illness, is better treated sooner than later. Treatment tends to be more successful the earlier it is begun.
<P>
And, most importantly, the earlier the illness is treated, the sooner the suffering ends, and the sooner one returns to life, loves, friends, and full productivity.
<P>
Please don't postpone your healing.

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><EM><A NAME="Thirty-seven">Thirty-seven</A>: Treatment for Depression Is a Natural Process</EM></H2>
<P>
Both pillars of treatment for depression--antidepressant medications for the brain and psychotherapy for the mind--are, for the most part, <EM>natural</EM> processes.
<P>
Psychotherapy involves mostly <EM>talking</EM>--a natural process. There is no "brainwashing," and you will not be told you <EM>must</EM> do anything.
<P>
Antidepressant medications simply restore the brain's <EM>natural</EM> levels of certain naturally produced neurotransmitters. "Synthetic" neurotransmitters are not added. Antidepressants simply balance the supply of naturally produced neurotransmitters.
<P>
For example, antidepressants such as Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft tell the brain not to break down the neurotransmitter serotonin too soon. This restores serotonin to its natural levels, and the brain can function harmoniously again.<EM>Reuptake</EM> means the body is "taking up" serotonin and breaking it down. <EM>Inhibitors</EM> slow the action of this reuptake, allowing serotonin to remain at natural levels. Hence: serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SRIs.
<P>
The most recently introduced antidepressant (as of summer 1994) is Effexor. Effexor prevents the premature breakdown of <EM>two</EM> neurotransmitters, serotonin and norepinephrine. The latter has been associated with physical energy and heightened mental clarity. Hence, Effexor has been dubbed "Prozac with a boost." (Or, as the <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM> called it, "Prozac with a punch.")
<P>
You don't "feel" antidepressant medications in the way you feel other mood-altering drugs such as alcohol, tranquilizers, or amphetamines. The improvements experienced with antidepressants seem to come from re-establishing natural levels of certain neurotransmitters produced by the brain.
<P>
Lithium, the primary antidepressant medication prescribed for manic-depression, is a simple salt. Its beneficial effect on those with manic-depression was discovered by Dr. John Cade in 1949--although the physician Galen, who practiced around 200 A.D., advised bathing manic patients in alkaline springs. Perhaps the salt, lithium carbonate, was absorbed through the skin and that calmed the manic patient.
<P>
All medications involve some degree of risk and have, for some, side effects. The risks and side effects of the newer antidepressant drugs are comparatively low.
<P>
"Antidepressant drugs are not habit forming or addictive," the National Institutes of Health tell us.
<P>
The potential rewards far outweigh the risks.

<P>
Your treatment for depression is uniquely yours. Although you'll be receiving guidance, diagnosis, advice, and suggestions from one or more healthcare professionals, your treatment is, fundamentally, your own.
<P>
Among other things, you must choose who your healthcare individual or individuals will be. And, you must choose from the various courses of treatment presented. 
<P>
Don't become a sheep. Become educated. Ask questions.
<P>
Your healing is in your hands.
<P>
Perhaps most importantly, it's up to you to follow through on the treatment you choose. If you take antidepressant medications, don't just take them until you "feel better"; take them for as long as your doctor recommends. If you agree to a certain number of therapeutic sessions, fulfill your commitment.
<P>
To the degree that's possible, enjoy your healing. If you've suffered from depression for a long time, you may discover depths and riches within yourself you have not known for years--perhaps ever. This can be a challenging but exciting journey.

<H2>Part Two: <BR>Healing the Brain</H2>
<P><BR>

Current research points to an imbalance of biochemicals in the brain as the seat of depression. Recent medical breakthroughs have led to effective treatments and cures for depression for the first time in history. These are what we'll explore in this part of the book, along with important healthcare tips to speed your healing.
<P><BR>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><I><A NAME="Thirty-nine">Thirty-nine</A>: Choose a Doctor</I></H2>
<P>
The health professional to <I>diagnose</I> and <I>medically</I> treat depression is the physician (an M.D.).<I>mental</I> health practitioner. In this part of the book, we are looking at <I>medical</I> diagnosis and treatment.> As we shall explore shortly, other physical illnesses can have symptoms similar to depression, or may be the cause of depression itself. It is one of the doctor's jobs to rule out these illnesses when symptoms of depression are present.
<P>
Psychiatrists are the physicians best suited to diagnose and treat depression. Psychiatrists are, first and foremost, medical doctors. They have, in addition, three years of training in the workings of the brain and mind. Many psychiatrists now specialize in treating depression.
<P>
According to a 1993 survey performed by the RAND Corporation, fewer than half the general practitioners ("family doctors") treating depressed patients had spent more than <I>three minutes</I> discussing their patient's symptoms before determining if the patient had a depression. While diagnosing depression usually takes no more than one or two fifty-minute consultations, three minutes is obviously far too brief. This may explain why general practitioners fail to diagnose depression accurately about half the time. (They tend not to find a depression when one, in fact, exists.)
<P>
More and more general practitioners, however, are becoming well versed in the treatment of depression and are taking the necessary time to do a proper diagnostic evaluation. The psychiatrist, then, is certainly not the only physician who can successfully diagnose and treat depression.
<P>
Most important, you want to find a competent physician with whom you feel <I>comfortable,</I> someone you can trust with the most intimate details of your life. You must give thorough, complete information about all aspects of your life if the doctor is to make an accurate diagnosis and prescribe the most effective treatment. In addition, the physician you choose to work with you must provide emotional support, encouragement, and guidance. It's important that you can feel his or her compassion and caring.
<P>
If your family doctor or healthcare professional does not specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of depression, he or she will probably be able to recommend a psychiatrist who does. There is no need to choose the first recommendation. Sometimes "interviewing" two or three prospective psychiatrists is in order.
<P>

<P>

Diagnosing depression--from the patient's point of view--is an uncomplicated, straightforward procedure.
<P>
There will probably be forms to fill out (aren't there always?) concerning your medical and personal history.
<P>
Because depression tends to run in families, you may be asked to answer a few basic questions about your family medical history.
<P>
Your doctor might also perform what's called a medical workup, to rule out physical illnesses that can first appear as a depression. These can include low thyroid, mononucleosis, anemia, diabetes (half of the fifteen million people with diabetes in this country don't know they have it), adrenal insufficiency, and hepatitis, among others. (Most of these can be determined by a simple blood test.)
<P>
You'll be asked about medications you are taking or have recently taken. Certain prescription drugs (for example, high blood pressure medications, birth control pills, or steroids) and over-the-counter drugs (such as diet or sleeping pills) can sometimes cause depression.
<P>
It's also a good idea to provide your diagnosing physician with a <I>complete</I> list of all vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, or recreational drugs you may have taken in the past year. (Understandably, you may not want to write down some of the illegal substances, but <I>do</I> tell your diagnosing physician when in the privacy of your consultation.)
<P>
Your medical exam should include a physical, especially if you haven't had one recently.
<P>
Mostly, though, arriving at a diagnosis will involve <I>talking</I>. You'll tell the doctor which symptoms of depression you think you have. You can ask the doctor whether what <I>you</I> are experiencing qualifies as a symptom or not. The doctor will also ask you some questions, which, of course, should be answered as frankly and completely as possible.
<P>
After reviewing your personal, family, and medical history, and the results of all tests, your doctor may diagnose depression.
<P>
Rather than feeling dread, most people diagnosed as depressed feel relieved. <I>Finally,</I> there is a single, medical explanation for a great many frustrating, debilitating problems.
<P>
At this point, your doctor will recommend a course of treatment. In most cases, this will include antidepressant medication and short-term psychotherapy.

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><I><A NAME="Forty-one">Forty-one</A>: Antidepressant Medications</I></H2>
<P>
There are roughly a dozen antidepressant medications from which you and your doctor can choose. As previously mentioned, none of them is addictive or habit-forming. They are generally safe when taken as prescribed.
<P>
Although various types of antidepressants work in different ways, the overall effect is the same: balancing the neurotransmitters in the brain, thus restoring harmony to brain functioning.
<P>
Antidepressant medications become effective gradually. Although some people notice an improvement within days, some take as long as eight weeks to feel the maximum benefits. During this time, patience and perseverance are the key.
<P>
Some patients decide after a few days or weeks, "This isn't working for me," and stop. Others experience side effects, fail to tell their doctor about them, and stop. Either of these responses is a mistake.
<P>
Communicate <I>all </I>effects--especially problems--to your doctor. If the problem is especially troublesome, call <I>at once.</I>
<P>
Don't wait until your next appointment. Your doctor may then prescribe a different antidepressant. If, however, your doctor suggests continuing with the medication as prescribed, please do so. Most side effects disappear within two to three weeks, or, when compared with the positive results of medication, eventually seem minimal.
<P>

<P><BR>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><I><A NAME="Forty-two">Forty-two</A>: Side Effects</I></H2>
<P>
Most people who take antidepressants experience few, if any, side effects. Those who do have mild side effects. This is especially true of the newer antidepressants (Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, and Effexor).
<P>
Your physician will let you know which side effects to look for with the particular antidepressant(s) you are taking.
<P>
As previously mentioned, most antidepressants' side effects disappear on their own within two or three weeks.
<P>
Seldom are side effects severe enough to necessitate switching medications. If you do need to change, however, take heart: there are several other antidepressants equally effective, but without the same side effects.
<P>
Most important, do not change your medication or dosage on your own. Contact your doctor.
<P>
Do not take any additional drugs--either over-the-counter, prescription, or recreational--without first checking with your healthcare provider. Drugs that, when taken alone, are relatively harmless can become dangerous--even deadly--when taken with some antidepressants. <I>Always</I> check with your doctor.
<P>
Whatever the side effects may be, it is usually more harmful to have a depression than to take antidepressant medication.

<H2><I><A NAME="Forty-three">Forty-three</A>: The Prozac Rumors</I></H2>
<P>
It seems that whenever the subject of depression and antidepressant medications arises, the discussion turns to Prozac. Frankly, Prozac has "a bad rep."
<P>
It is completely undeserved. Since its release in 1987, ten million people have taken Prozac. The vast, <I>vast</I> majority of them have found it to be an effective treatment for depression, with few side effects. (In fact, Prozac has fewer side effects than almost any other antidepressant.)
<P>
Naturally, in studying a group of ten million people doing <I>anything,</I> some aberrant behavior is likely to be found.
<P>
A certain religious group for whatever reason decided to "get" Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Prozac. The group spent millions of dollars publicizing the aberrant behavior (murders, suicides) of a handful of those ten million.
<P>
Since then, elaborate studies reported in everything from the<I> American Journal of Psychiatry</I> to "60 Minutes"--show that Prozac, in and of itself, does not cause a greater likelihood of aberrant behavior.
<P>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><I>It is estimated that ten million people around the world have taken Prozac, five million of them right here in the United States.

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><I><A NAME="Forty-four">Forty-four</A>: The Right Medication and Dosage</I></H2>
<P>
Due to the delay between starting antidepressants and seeing results, it may take a while for your doctor and you to arrive at the proper medication and dosage for you.
<P>
Be patient with this process. During the initial phase of treatment, you may require more frequent consultations with your doctor.
<P>
People respond differently to specific antidepressants. One person may find antidepressant A highly effective, while another person may find it only marginally effective. The other person, however, may find that antidepressant B works wonders, while the antidepressant A fan finds antidepressant B ineffective.
<P>
The same is true of side effects. Antidepressant A may work fine, but have a disagreeable side effect, while antidepressant B may work just as well, and have no side effects.
<P>
Although it may take a while, when you and your doctor discover the antidepressant and dosage that work best for you, it will be worth it.

<H2><I><A NAME="Forty-five">Forty-five</A>: "You're Not Dealing with Your Pain!" </I></H2>
<P>
Some people seem morally opposed to antidepressant medication. They have a firm belief that pain must be <I>dealt with,</I> experienced, analyzed, categorized, and, at all costs,<I> </I>must<I> not</I> be avoided.
<P>
These people, it seems, are confusing antidepressants with tranquilizers or painkillers.
<P>
Antidepressants do not numb the body, mind, or emotions. On the contrary, they usually make a person more perceptive and aware of feelings.
<P>
The suffering of depression is not the ordinary occasional pain of living. Suffering, in fact, interferes with the processing of, and taking appropriate action about, pain. Pain is a signal that something is not right. Far from covering this pain, antidepressants help you deal with it more effectively.
<P>
People being treated for depression often find that the clarity of mind, relief of emotional suffering, and increased energy allow them to clear up problems--mental, physical, and emotional--that had been festering for years.
<P>
Antidepressant medications, then, are not an escape, a cover-up, or a short circuit for life's difficulties. <I>They are a medicine to heal disease and end suffering.</I><P>
 They often make psychotherapy more effective.

So many people with depression experience difficulty in sleeping that--as with many other symptoms of depression--it's hard to tell whether insomnia contributed to the depression or depression contributed to the insomnia. The answer, in many cases, is both.
<P>
Many people find that as treatment progresses they return to normal sleep cycles. This is healing in itself.
<P>
If, after taking antidepressants for a while, you find your sleep has not returned to normal, it may be that the particular antidepressant you take has the unwanted side effect of insomnia. You may want to discuss with your doctor the possibility of a bedtime dose of an antidepressant (such as Trazadone) that has sleepiness as one of its side effects. 
These antidepressants are not sleeping pills. When taken at bedtime, however, the side effect of sleepiness--which can obviously be a detriment during the day--becomes an added blessing.
<P>
Sleeping pills can be easily abused and are particularly dangerous for a depressed patient. Sedatives actually disrupt your normal sleep patterns and can quickly become addicting.
<P>
If you are already taking an over-the-counter or prescription sleeping medication, ask your doctor if it's advisable to switch you to an antidepressant at bedtime. These are often not only more effective for the depressed person, but allow him or her to avoid sleeping pills, which can interfere with the successful treatment of depression. As always, check with your doctor.
<P>
Sleep is a significant part of the healing process--it is the time for your body, emotions, brain, and mind to rejuvenate and restore themselves to proper functioning.
<P>
Sleep is the guardian of health.

Good nutrition, plus taking vitamin and mineral supplements, supports the healing of your brain and body. A nutrition-conscious doctor can test you for nutritional deficiencies and treat these appropriately.
<P>
Consider taking a vitamin B-complex twice daily. Deficiencies of B1, B2, or B6 can cause depression. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause depression, neurological problems, and anemia. (You may need to take the B12 under your tongue or as a "B12 shot" because this vitamin is absorbed poorly from the diet.)
<P>
Vitamin C twice daily helps combat stress and strengthens your immune system.
<P>
A daily multimineral supplement is also helpful because a deficiency of zinc, iron, magnesium, or manganese can contribute to depression.
<P>
<I>Excess</I> sugar, white flour, alcohol, and caffeine deplete your energy and can contribute to depression.
<P>
Especially among the elderly, deficiencies of vitamins and minerals contribute to not only depression, but less-than-optimal mental performance.
<P>
In general, vitamin/mineral supplements are better purchased at a health food store than the corner drug store.
<P>
And... drink lots of water--at least eight 8-ounce glasses a day.
<P>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><I><A NAME="Forty-eight">Forty-eight</A>: Treat Your Body Well</I></H2>
<P>
Anything you've learned that promotes the strengthening, flexibility, and endurance of your body will almost invariably support your overall healing and well-being.
<P>
Exercise--particularly aerobic exercise--produces <I>endorphins,</I> which are among the body's natural antidepressants. Bicycling, swimming, or even a good brisk walk can do wonders.
<P>
Other physical activities--such as yoga, stretching, dancing, tai chi--are excellent ways to loosen the body, relieve stress, and get energy moving again.
<P>
It's hard to overestimate the healing powers of a hot bath. If you're a typical "shower power" American, making that a ten-minute hot bath could have soothing results.
<P>
Even more deeply relaxing is massage.
<P>
Do more of whatever activities you personally find nurturing and enjoyable: walks in nature, viewing art, listening to good music, watching your favorite movies, gardening.
<P>
One of the most common outcomes of a depressive illness is a mistreated body. Now is the time to treat your body well. The more you learn to treat yourself well now, the less treatment you'll need down the road.

<P>

The second approach to healing depression--equally important as healing the brain--is healing the mind. Extensive research has shown that two short-term therapies, <EM>Cognitive Therapy</EM> and <EM>Interpersonal Therapy, </EM>are highly effective in the treatment of depression.
<P>
After a brief discussion of these potent therapies, we will present <EM>our</EM> favorite skills to heal the mind and enjoy a happier, more productive life. (These are offered as an adjunct to, not a substitute for, Cognitive/Interpersonal Therapy.)

<P>
Psychotherapy has changed considerably in the past decade. The stereotype most people have of lying on a couch for the fifty-minute hour while a dispassionate therapist sits silently taking notes has almost disappeared.
<P>
Therapy--especially in the treatment of depression--has become much more <EM>educational.</EM><P>

<P>
<EM>Education</EM> comes from the Latin word <EM>educare,</EM> which means to draw forth from within. A good therapist actively draws from within you things you may have known about yourself and forgotten, things you may have never known about yourself, or things that you knew to be true but, for whatever reason, disregarded.
<P>
In addition, a therapist teaches new skills for living a more productive, satisfying, and loving life.
<P>
Depressed people sometimes do things that make them even more depressed because <EM>no one ever taught them any other way.</EM><P>

<P>
An important part of therapy, then, is learning other ways.
<P>
<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><EM><A NAME="Fifty">Fifty</A>: Cognitive Therapy</EM></H2>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><EM>If we see things as negative, we are likely to feel negative and behave in a negative way.</EM><P>AARON T. BECK, M.D.</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Cognitive Therapy was developed by psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck, M.D.
<P>
The word <EM>cognitive</EM> relates to how we perceive and think. For example, the word <EM>recognize</EM> means simply to <EM>re</EM> (do again) <EM>cognize </EM>(perceive)--to cognize something we have cognized before. Descartes's famous phrase, "I think, therefore I am," is, in fact, a bad translation. A better translation would be, "I cognize, therefore I am."
<P>
Simply put, the way we perceive the world is the way we respond to the world. If our cognition of life is negative, our thoughts, feelings, and actions will be negative.
<P>
Cognitive Therapy identifies a person's distorted cognitions (perceptions and evaluations) and "reframes" them in a more accurate, factual light. Cognitive Therapy is <EM>not</EM> positive thinking--it simply seeks what's <EM>real,</EM> what's <EM>genuine,</EM> about one's life.
<P>
Depression distorts perception. The depressed person perceives life through a glass darkly. Cognitive Therapy does not add rose-colored glasses: its goal is clear glass, which allows the world to be perceived accurately--both its good and its bad.
<P>
Dr. Beck's therapeutic method is outlined in the book, <EM>Feeling Good</EM> by David D. Burns, M.D.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Fifty-one">Fifty-one</A>: Interpersonal Therapy</EM></H2>
<P>
A depressive illness colors how a person thinks, feels, and acts toward a spouse, lover, friend, boss, co-worker, parent, or child. Troubled relationships are the rule in depression.
<P>
Interpersonal Therapy was developed by psychiatrist Gerald Klerman, M.D., of Harvard, and psychologist Myrna Weissman, Ph.D., of Yale as a short-term therapy to help people identify and resolve their difficulties with others.<EM>Interpersonal Psychotherapy of Depression</EM> is the book written by Dr. Klerman and Dr. Weissman.
<P>
Whereas Cognitive Therapy focuses on perception and reaction to those perceptions, Interpersonal Therapy lays an extra emphasis on communication skills. Interpersonal Therapy and Cognitive Therapy have so many overlapping concepts and work so well together, many therapists have combined both into Cognitive/Interpersonal Therapy.
<P>
Both Cognitive and Interpersonal Therapy deal with your habits of thought, feeling, and behavior as they are<EM> now,</EM> not what happened somewhere <EM>back then</EM> in your childhood. The origin of the pattern is not as important as the pattern itself and how to turn that pattern into one that elevates rather than depresses.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Fifty-two">Fifty-two</A>: Acknowledging Two Pioneers</EM></H2>
<P>
We would be remiss if we did not mention two people whose work laid the foundation for the success of Cognitive and Interpersonal therapies. They are Albert Ellis, Ph.D., and Arnold Lazarus, Ph.D.
<P>
Albert Ellis is the founder of Rational-Emotive Therapy. It is described brilliantly in his book, <EM>How To Stubbornly Refuse to be Miserable About Anything . . . Yes, ANYTHING.</EM><P>
 
<P>
The idea behind Rational-Emotive Therapy is this: there are three aspects of life--(a) what really happens, (b) what we perceive about what happens, and (c) how we react. The majority of our difficulties, according to Dr. Ellis, come at point (b): what we perceive. By rationally, factually comparing our perceptions and reactions with what actually happened, we become more effective at (c): our reaction and action.
<P>
Dr. Arnold Lazarus is the father of Multimodal Therapy. This looks at what one is thinking, feeling, and doing that is not productive, and teaches proven, effective strategies for reversing them. For example, Dr. Lazarus maintains that many people are <EM>de</EM>pressed because they have an inability to <EM>ex</EM>press. Whether the depressed expression is tenderness, assertiveness, joy, anger, or love, learning appropriate expression is valuable in the treatment of depression.
<P>
Dr. Lazarus's most recent book is <EM>Don't Believe It for a Minute.</EM><P>

<H2><EM><A NAME="Fifty-three">Fifty-three</A>: Psychiatrist, Psychologist, or Both? </EM></H2>
<P>
In some cases, you may choose the psychiatrist who is treating the medical aspect of your depression to also guide you through Cognitive/Interpersonal Therapy. This has the advantage of combining your therapy and medical visits into one.
<P>
Or you may choose to have a psychiatrist or general practitioner diagnose, prescribe antidepressants, monitor medical progress, <EM>and</EM> have a psychologist or other mental health professional provide the psychotherapy.
<P>
A psychiatrist has more medical training, and a psychologist has more psychological training. This gives you two people with different, but overlapping, specialties working together on your healing.
<P>
More and more psychologists and psychiatrists are joining to treat depression in a "team" approach. (Keep in mind, however, that you are not stuck with either member of the team--<EM>any</EM> psychiatrist and <EM>any</EM> therapist you choose can work together on your healing.)
<P>
Most importantly, you must feel trust, confidence, and comfort with your therapist so that you can express and explore whatever you need to in order to fully heal and grow.

<H2><EM><A NAME="Fifty-four">Fifty-four</A>: Books, Tapes, and Videos</EM></H2>
<P>
Books and tapes (both audio and video) can be excellent sources for learning new skills, ideas, and ways of looking at life. The use of books and tapes as an adjunct to therapy is growing more and more popular.
<P>
This even has a name: <EM>bibliotherapy.</EM><BR>
 (<EM>Biblio</EM> means book in Latin. Fortunately, there is no Latin word for <EM>tape,</EM> so there is no<EM> tapiotherapy.)</EM> We like James Burke's idea from <EM>The Day the Universe Changed:</EM> a book is like holding another's mind in your hands.
<P>
Audiotapes are especially useful because you can listen to them while you drive, jog, walk, or even clean house.
<P>
The advent of videotapes has made thousands of movies, documentaries, and other inspirational and educational material conveniently available.
<P>
So, here are Harold's and Peter's ten favorite books or tapes about learning life's lessons. 
<P><blockquote>
 Rules for the list: Naturally, we weren't allowed to choose each other's books or tapes--that would have left room for very few other books. Nevertheless, we <EM>do</EM> recommend each other's books. For more titles on depression, please see the list at the end of this book, "Recommended Reading on Depression." Finally, we did not select any materials referred to elsewhere in this book.</blockquote>

<H2><EM><A NAME="Fifty-five">Fifty-five</A>: Personal Growth</EM></H2>
<P>
With this point, we begin sharing with you some of our favorite personal growth techniques.
<P>
These are simply a gathering of ideas and activities you might like to try. Experiment with them. Play with them. Modify them to your needs and preferences. If they work for you, take them; they're yours. If they don't work for you, move on to techniques that do.
<P>
Again, these suggestions are <EM>not</EM> a review of Cognitive/Interpersonal Therapy, nor are they the outline for Bloomfield/McWilliams Depression Therapy; doing the techniques in this book is <EM>not </EM>a substitute for working with a professional in Cognitive/Interpersonal Therapy.
<P>
Frankly, we do not believe that depression can be successfully treated from a book. The downward spiral of depression requires, we believe, professional intervention at both the biological and the psychological levels.

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH=65% ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2><EM><A NAME="Fifty-six">Fifty-six</A>: Flexibility</EM></H2>
<P>
One of the hallmarks of depression is rigid, inflexible thinking. 
Words such as <EM>must, should, never, bad, have to,</EM> and <EM>ought to</EM> create emotional states (anger, fear, hurt, guilt, and unworthiness), which, naturally, contribute to depression.
<P>
Using the words listed above sets up a battle of absolutes within ourselves: bad vs. good, right vs. wrong, light vs. dark. This mental and emotional battle zone often becomes the ground of being from which we perceive and act in the world. We declare war on the world--although we are <EM>firmly convinced</EM> that the world has declared war on us. As with all wars, we are overcome by fear and anger.
<P>
Not only is this a depressing way to live; it's phenomenally inaccurate. <EM>The world does what it does</EM> no matter <EM>how</EM> depressed we become about it.
<P>
Life is lived on the continuum between good <EM>and </EM>bad, right <EM>and</EM> wrong, light <EM>and </EM>dark.
<P>
Replacing rigid words with more flexible (and accurate) words such as <EM>often, sometimes, seldom, either, or, </EM>and<EM> both,</EM> makes life more realistic--and livable. Strive for excellence, not perfection. Practice tolerance, not insistence. Live in a world of preferences, not demands. Say, "I'd like," or "I want," rather than "I need," or "I must have...."

Life is not a struggle, it's a wiggle.

<p>
<p>Men would like to learn to love themselves, but they usually find  they cannot. That is because they have built an ideal image of themselves  which puts their real self in the shade.
<p>
<p>GERALD BRENAN
<p>
<p>We do not know whether it is good to live or to die. Therefore, we  should not take delight in living nor should we tremble at the thought  of death. We should be equiminded towards both. This is the ideal.
<p>
<p>MAHATMA GANDHI
<p>
<p>The "what should be" never did exist, but people keep trying  to live up to it. There is no "what should be," there is only  what is.

<p>
<p>SOMERSET MAUGHAM
<p>
<p>It is not materialism that is the chief curse of the world, but idealism.  Men get into trouble by taking their visions and hallucinations too  seriously.
<p>
<p>H. L. MENCKEN
<p>
<p>The poet, described in ideal perfection, brings the whole soul of  man into activity, with the subordination of its faculties to each  other, according to their relative worth and dignity. He diffuses  a tone and spirit of unity, that blends, and (as it were) fuses, each  into each, by that synthetic and magical power . . . imagination.
<p>
<p>SAMUEL COLERIDGE
<p>
<p>Don't use that foreign word "ideals." We have that excellent  native word "lies."

<p>What we need most, is not so much to realize the ideal as to idealize  the real.

<p>The true ideal is not opposed to the real, but lies in it; and blessed  are the eyes that find it.

<p>To hate and to fear is to be psychologically ill. It is, in fact,  the consuming illness of our time.

<p>H. A. OVERSTREET
<p>
<p>All interest in disease and death is only another expression of interest  in life.
<p>
<p>THOMAS MANN

<p>The more serious the illness, the more important it is for you to  fight back, mobilizing all your resources—spiritual, emotional,  intellectual, physical.
<p>
<p>NORMAN COUSINS
<p>
<p>If the essential core of the person is denied or suppressed, he gets  sick sometimes in obvious ways, sometimes in subtle ways, sometimes  immediately, sometimes later.
<p>
<p>ABRAHAM MASLOW
<p>
<p>It's been troubling me. Now, why is it that most of us can talk openly  about the illnesses of our bodies, but when it comes to our brain  and illnesses of the mind we clam up and because we clam up, people  with emotional disorders feel ashamed, stigmatized and don't seek  the help that can make the difference.
<p>
<p>KIRK DOUGLAS
<p>
<p>The past few years have seen a steady increase in the number of people  playing music in the streets. The past few years have also seen a  steady increase in the number of malignant diseases. Are these two  facts related?
<p>
<p>FRAN LEBOWITZ
<p>
<p>A wise man should consider that health is the greatest of human blessings,  and learn how by his own thought to derive benefit from his illnesses.
<p>
<p>HIPPOCRATES
<p>
<p>We forget ourselves and our destinies in health, and the chief use  of temporary sickness is to remind us of these concerns.

<p>ALBERT EINSTEIN

<p>Love doesn't grow on the trees like apples in Eden—it's something  you have to make. And you must use your imagination to make it too,  just like anything else.

<p>Without this playing with fantasy no creative work has ever yet come  to birth. The debt we owe to the play of imagination is incalculable.

<p>With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and my bended arm for  a pillow—I still have joy in the midst of these things.
<p>
<p>CONFUCIUS
<p>
<p>With an eye made quiet by the power of harmony, and the deep power  of joy, we see into the life of things.

<p>
<p>The eye sees the open heaven, The heart is intoxicated with bliss.

<p>
<p>Gladness of the heart is the life of a man, and the joyfulness of  a man prolongeth his days.
<p>
<p>ECCLESIASTICUS 30:22
<p>
<p>Mirth is the sweet wine of human life. It should be offered sparkling  with zestful life unto God.
<p>
<p>HENRY WARD BEECHER
<p>
<p>Since Time is not a person we can overtake when he is gone, let us  honor him with mirth and cheerfulness of heart while he is passing.
<p>
<p>JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE
<p>
<p>Joy is the sweet voice, Joy the luminous cloud—We in ourselves  rejoice! And thence flows all that charms or ear or sight, All melodies  the echoes of that voice, All colors a suffusion from that light.
<p>
<p>SAMUEL COLERIDGE
<p>
<p>His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant:  thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler  over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
<p>
<p>JESUS OF NAZARETH Matthew 25:21

<p>
<p>MARK TWAIN
<p>
<p>Joy is the feeling of grinning inside.
<p>
<p>DR. MELBA COLGROVE
<p>
<p>There is no such thing as the pursuit of happiness, but there is the  discovery of joy.
<p>
<p>JOYCE GRENFELL
<p>
<p>One joy scatters a hundred griefs.
<p>
<p>CHINESE PROVERB
<p>
<p>The very society of joy redoubles it, so that, while it lights upon  my friend, it rebounds upon myself, and the brighter his candle burns,  the more easily will it light mine.
<p>
<p>ROBERT SOUTH
<p>
<p>To love what you do and feel that it matters—how could anything  be more fun?
<p>
<p>KATHERINE GRAHAM
<p>
<p>We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing.
<p>
<p>WINSTON CHURCHILL on the day World War II ended

<p>When I played pro football, I never set out to hurt anybody deliberately—unless  it was, you know, important, like a league game or something.
<p>
<p>DICK BUTKUS
<p>
<p>Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind.
<p>
<p>ERIC HOFFER
<p>
<p>One of the most difficult things to give away is kindness; it usually  comes back to you.
<p>
<p>ANONYMOUS
<p>
<p>Kindness is loving people more than they deserve.
<p>
<p>JOSEPH JOUBERT
<p>
<p>Kind looks, kind words, kind acts, and warm handshakes—these are  secondary means of grace when men are in trouble and are fighting  their unseen battles.
<p>
<p>JOHN HALL
<p>
<p>Kindness is gladdening the hearts of those who are traveling the dark  journey with us.
<p>
<p>HENRI-FRÉDÉRIC AMIEL
<p>
<p>Kind words do not cost much. They never blister the tongue or lips.  Mental trouble was never known to arise from such quarters. Though  they do not cost much yet they accomplish much. They make other people  good natured. They also produce their own image on men's souls, and  a beautiful image it is.
<p>
<p>BLAISE PASCAL
<p>
<p>If you can't be kind, at least be vague.
<p>
<p>MISS MANNERS
<p>
<p>You cannot do a kindness too soon, for you never know how soon it  will be too late.
<p>
<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON
<p>
<p>When kindness has left people, even for a few moments, we become afraid  of them as if their reason has left them. 
<p>
<p>WILLA CATHER
<p>
<p>Do not ask me to be kind; just ask me to act as though I were.
<p>
<p>JULES RENARD
<p>
<p>Kindness is the insignia of a loving heart.
<p>
<p>ANONYMOUS
<p>
<p>Be kind and considerate to others, depending somewhat upon who they  are.
<p>
<p>DON HEROLD
<p>

<p>
<p>Pleasure is a shadow, wealth is vanity, and power is a pageant; but  knowledge is ecstatic in enjoyment, perennial in frame, unlimited  in space and infinite in duration.
<p>
<p>DE WITT CLINTON
<p>
<p>We are here and it is now. Further than that, all knowledge is moonshine.
<p>
<p>H. L. MENCKEN
<p>
<p>Knowledge, in truth, is the great sun in the firmament. Life and power  are scattered with all its beams.
<p>
<p>DANIEL WEBSTER
<p>
<p>You are free to eat from any tree of the garden, but you must not  eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you  eat of it you will surely die.
<p>
<p>GOD, TO ADAM Genesis 2:16-17
<p>
<p>We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, but God did say, "You  must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden,  and you must not touch it, or you will die."
<p>
<p>EVE, TO SERPENT Genesis 3:2-3
<p>
<p>The public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything, except  what is worth knowing.
<p>
<p>OSCAR WILDE
<p>
<p>The things most people want to know about are usually none of their  business.
<p>
<p>GEORGE BERNARD SHAW
<p>
<p>Most men believe that it would benefit them if they could get a little  from those who <I>have</I> more. How much more would it benefit them  if they would learn a little from those who <I>know</I> more.
<p>
<p>WM. J. H. BOETCKER

<p>
<p>First we form habits, then they form us. Conquer your bad habits,  or they'll eventually conquer you.
<p>
<p>DR. ROB GILBERT
<p>
<p>Have a place for everything and keep the thing somewhere else; this  is not a piece of advice, it is merely a custom.
<p>
<p>MARK TWAIN
<p>
<p>I'm glad I don't have to explain to a man from Mars why each day I  set fire to dozens of little pieces of paper, and then put them in  my mouth.
<p>
<p>MIGNON MCLAUGHLIN
<p>
<p>Good habits, which bring our lower passions and appetites under automatic  control, leave our natures free to explore the larger experiences  of life. Too many of us divide and dissipate our energies in debating  actions which should be taken for granted.
<p>
<p>RALPH W. SOCKMAN
<p>
<p>Cultivate only the habits that you are willing should master you.
<p>
<p>ELBERT HUBBARD
<p>
<p>Custom is the plague of wise men and the idol of fools.
<p>
<p>THOMAS FULLER
<p>
<p>Habit with him was all the test of truth, "It must  be right: I've done it from my youth."
<p>
<p>GEORGE CRABBE
<p>
<p>To fall into a habit is to begin to cease to be.
<p>
<p>MIGUEL DE UNAMUNO
<p>
<p>I always keep a supply of stimulant handy in case I see a snake—which  I also keep handy.
<p>
<p>W. C. FIELDS
<p>
<p>Faced with the choice between changing one's mind and proving there  is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof.
<p>
<p>JOHN KENNETH GALBRAITH
<p>
<p>Life is made up, not of great sacrifices or duties, but of little  things, in which smiles and kindness, and small obligations given  habitually, are what preserve the heart and secure comfort.

</center>
 <center><h2>Also See ENJOYMENT, JOY</h2></center>

<p>
<p>The only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose.
<p>
<p>WILLIAM COWPER
<p>
<p>Happiness? A good cigar, a good meal, and a good woman—or a bad  woman. It depends on how much happiness you can handle.
<p>
<p>GEORGE BURNS
<p>
<p>The only way to avoid being miserable is not to have enough leisure  to wonder whether you are happy or not.
<p>
<p>GEORGE BERNARD SHAW
<p>
<p>My creed is that: Happiness is the only good. The place to be happy  is here. The time to be happy is now. The way to be happy is to make  others so.
<p>
<p>ROBERT G. INGERSOLL
<p>
<p>What more felicity can fall to creature, Than to enjoy delight with  liberty.
<p>
<p>EDMUND SPENSER <I>THE FATE OF THE BUTTERFLY</I>
<p>
<p>Happiness is always a by-product. It is probably a matter of temperament,  and for anything I know it may be glandular.
<p>
<p>ROBERTSON DAVIES
<p>
<p>True happiness is of a retired nature, and an enemy to pomp and noise;  it arises, in the first place, from the enjoyment of one's self; and,  in the next, from the friendship and conversation of a few select  companions.
<p>
<p>JOSEPH ADDISON
<p>
<p><I>INTERVIEWER:</I> Ever meet a man that could make you happy? <I>MAE  WEST:</I> Several times.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>Happiness is the most powerful of tonics.
<p>
<p>HERBERT SPENCER
<p>
<p>Happiness consists in activity: such is the constitution of our nature:  it is a running stream, and not a stagnant pool.
<p>
<p>JOHN M. GOOD
<p>
<p>A merry heart doeth good like a medicine.
<p>
<p>PROVERBS 17:22
<p>
<p>It is the chiefest point of happiness that a man is willing to be  what he is.
<p>
<p>ERASMUS
<p>
<p>No man chooses evil because it is evil; he only mistakes it for happiness,  the good he seeks.
<p>
<p>MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY
<p>
<p>It's good to be just plain happy; it's a little better to know that  you're happy; but to understand that you're happy and to know why  and how and still be happy, be happy in the being and the knowing,  well that is beyond happiness, that is bliss.
<p>
<p>HENRY MILLER
<p>
<p>Mirth is like a flash of lightning, that breaks through a gloom of  clouds, and glitters for a moment; cheerfulness keeps up a kind of  daylight in the mind, and fills it with a steady and perpetual serenity.
<p>
<p>JOSEPH ADDISON
<p>
<p>Full of love for all things in the world, practicing virtue in order  to benefit others, this man alone is happy.
<p>
<p>BUDDHA
<p>
<p>In about the same degree as you are helpful, you will be happy.
<p>
<p>KARL REILAND
<p>
<p>Getters generally don't get happiness; givers get it. You simply give  to others a bit of yourself—a thoughtful act, a helpful idea,  a word of appreciation, a lift over a rough spot, a sense of understanding,  a timely suggestion. You take something out of your mind, garnished  in kindness out of your heart, and put it into the other fellow's  mind and heart.
<p>
<p>CHARLES H. BURR
<p>
<p>The roots of happiness grow deepest in the soil of service.
<p>
<p>ANONYMOUS
<p>
<p>Happiness lies in good health and a bad memory.
<p>
<p>INGRID BERGMAN
<p>
<p>When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look  so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has been  opened for us.
<p>
<p>HELEN KELLER
<p>
<p>The best advice on the art of being happy is about as easy to follow  as advice to be well when one is sick.
<p>
<p>ANNE-SOPHIE SWETCHINE
<p>
<p>Happiness depends, as Nature shows, Less on exterior things than most  suppose.
<p>
<p>WILLIAM COWPER
<p>
<p>Some day people will learn that material things do not bring happiness  and are of little use in making people creative and powerful.
<p>
<p>CHARLES STEINMETZ
<p>
<p>[We look] for happiness in possession of the external—in money,  a good time, somebody to lean on, and so on. We are impatient, hurried  and fretful because we do not find happiness where we look for it.
<p>
<p>JOHN DEWEY
<p>
<p>Happiness depends upon ourselves.
<p>
<p>ARISTOTLE
<p>
<p>The man who makes everything that leads to happiness depend on himself,  and not upon other men, has adopted the very best plan for living  happily.
<p>
<p>PLATO
<p>
<p>He that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.
<p>
<p>PROVERBS 15:15
<p>
<p>Happiness is in the taste, and not in the things.
<p>
<p>FRANÇOIS LA ROCHEFOUCAULD
<p>
<p>The happiness of your life depends on the quality of your thoughts.
<p>
<p>MARCUS ANTONINUS
<p>
<p>It is not in doing what you like, but in liking what you do that  is the secret of happiness.
<p>
<p>JAMES BARRIE
<p>
<p>Happiness is not having what you want, but wanting what you have.
<p>
<p>RABBI HYMAN SCHACHTEL
<p>
<p>The Constitution of America only guarantees pursuit of happiness—you  have to catch up with it yourself. Fortunately, happiness is something  that depends not on position but on disposition, and life is what  you make it.
<p>
<p>GILL ROBB WILSON
<p>
<p>Perfect happiness, I believe, was never intended by the Deity to be  the lot of one of his creatures in this world, but that he has very  much put in our power the nearness of our approaches to it is what  I have steadfastly believed.
<p>
<p>THOMAS JEFFERSON
<p>
<p>Happiness seems to require a modicum of external prosperity.
<p>
<p>ARISTOTLE
<p>
<p>It is not the rich man you should properly call happy, but him who  knows how to use with wisdom the blessings of the gods.
<p>
<p>HORACE
<p>
<p>May we never let the things we can't have, or don't have, or shouldn't  have, spoil our enjoyment of the things we do have and can have. As  we value our happiness let us not forget it, for one of the greatest  lessons in life is learning to be happy without the things we cannot  or should not have.
<p>
<p>RICHARD EVANS
<p>
<p>No enjoyment, however inconsiderable, is confined to the present moment.  A man is the happier for life from having made once an agreeable tour,  or lived for any length of time with pleasant people, or enjoyed any  considerable interval of innocent pleasure.
<p>
<p>SYDNEY SMITH
<p>
<p>Happiness is the sense of having worked according to one's capacity  and light to make things clear and get rid of cant and shams.
<p>
<p>T. H. HUXLEY
<p>
<p>Happiness is itself a kind of gratitude.
<p>
<p>JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH
<p>
<p>We must select the illusion which appeals to our temperament and embrace  it with passion if we want to be happy.
<p>
<p>CYRIL CONNOLLY
<p>
<p>Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the  joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort.
<p>
<p>FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
<p>
<p>If a man is happy in America it is considered he is doing something  wrong.
<p>
<p>CLARENCE DARROW
<p>
<p>A great obstacle to happiness is to anticipate too great a happiness.
<p>
<p>BERNARD FONTENELLE
<p>
<p>To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part  of happiness.
<p>
<p>BERTRAND RUSSELL
<p>
<p>Our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life in  which chance has placed us, but is always the result of a good conscience,  good health, occupation, and freedom in all just pursuits.

<p>
<p>When an emotional injury takes place, the body begins a process as  natural as the healing of a physical wound. Let the process happen.  Trust that nature will do the healing. Know that the pain will pass  and, when it passes, you will be stronger, happier, more sensitive  and aware.
<p>
<p><I>HOW TO SURVIVE THE LOSS OF A LOVE</I>
<p>
<p>Pleasant words are a honeycomb sweet to the soul and healing to the  bones.
<p>
<p>PROVERBS 16:24
<p>
<p>Happiness, grief, gaiety, sadness, are by nature contagious. Bring  your health and your strength to the weak and sickly, and so you will  be of use to them. Give them, not your weakness, but your energy,  so you will revive and lift them up. Life alone can rekindle life.

<p>W. H. AUDEN
<p>
<p>Positive attitudes—optimism, high self—esteem, an outgoing nature,  joyousness, and the ability to cope with stress—may be the most  important bases for continued good health.
<p>
<p>HELEN HAYES
<p>
<p>The first wealth is health.
<p>
<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON
<p>
<p>Without health, life is not life; it is only a state of languor and  suffering.
<p>
<p>FRANÇOIS RABELAIS
<p>
<p>A healthy body is a guest-chamber for the soul; a sick body is a prison.
<p>
<p>FRANCIS BACON
<p>
<p>Look to your health; and if you have it, praise God, and value it  next to a good conscience, for health is the second blessing that  we mortals are capable of; a blessing that money cannot buy.
<p>
<p>IZAAK WALTON
<p>
<p>O, health! health! The blessings of the rich! the riches of the poor!  Who can buy thee at too dear a rate, since there is no enjoying the  world without thee?
<p>
<p>BEN JOHNSON
<p>
<p>Measure your health by your sympathy with morning and Spring. If there  is no response in you to the awakening of nature, if the prospect  of an early morning walk does not banish sleep, if the warble of the  first bluebird does not thrill you, know that the morning and spring  of your life are past. Thus may you feel your pulse.
<p>
<p>HENRY DAVID THOREAU
<p>
<p>There's lots of people in this world who spend so much time watching  their health, that they haven't the time to enjoy it.
<p>
<p>JOSH BILLINGS
<p>
<p>I've never met a healthy person who worried much about his health,  or a good person who worried much about his soul.

<p>
<p>Hope is a good breakfast, but it is a bad supper.
<p>
<p>FRANCIS BACON
<p>
<p>A gentleman who had been very unhappy in marriage, married immediately  after his wife died: Johnson said, it was  the triumph of hope over experience.
<p>
<p>JAMES BOSWELL
<p>
<p>There is nothing so well known as that we should not expect something  for nothing—but we all do and call it Hope.
<p>
<p>EDGAR WATSON HOWE
<p>
<p>Hope is the feeling you have that the feeling you have isn't permanent.
<p>
<p>JEAN KERR
<p>
<p>It is natural to man to indulge in the illusion of hope. We are apt  to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of  that siren, till she transforms us into beasts.
<p>
<p>PATRICK HENRY
<p>
<p>In the factory we make cosmetics; in the store we sell hope.
<p>
<p>CHARLES REVSON
<p>
<p>Hope is the most treacherous of human fancies.
<p>
<p>JAMES FENIMORE COOPER
<p>
<p>Just as dumb animals are snared by food, human beings would not be  caught unless they had a nibble of hope.
<p>
<p>PETRONIUS
<p>
<p>Hope in reality is the worst of all evils, because it prolongs the  torments of man.
<p>
<p>FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE
<p>
<p>I suppose it can be truthfully said that Hope is the only universal  liar who never loses his reputation for veracity.
<p>
<p>ROBERT G. INGERSOLL
<p>
<p>A man will sometimes devote all his life to the development of one  part of his body—the wishbone.
<p>
<p>ROBERT FROST
<p>
<p>Many of us spend half of our time wishing for things we could have  if we didn't spend half our time wishing.
<p>
<p>ALEXANDER WOOLLCOTT
<p>
<p>Hope springs eternal in the human breast. Man never is, but always  to be blest.
<p>
<p>ALEXANDER POPE
<p>
<p>This wonder we find in hope, that she is both a flatterer and a true  friend. How many would die did not hope sustain them; how many have  died by hoping too much!
<p>
<p>OWEN FELTHAM
<p>
<p>The man who lives only by hope, will die with despair.
<p>
<p>ITALIAN PROVERB
<p>
<p>He that lives upon hope, dies fasting.
<p>
<p>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN The prestigious <I>Harper Book of American Quotations</I> had one  of the most amusing typos we've discovered. It quoted Mr. Franklin as saying, "He that lives upon Hope, dies farting."
<p>
<p>Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.

<p>
<p>Most people live, whether physically, intellectually or morally, in  a very restricted circle of their potential being. They make use of  a very small portion of their possible consciousness, and of their  soul's resources in general, much like a man who, out of his whole  bodily organism, should get into a habit of using and moving only  his little finger. Great emergencies and crises show us how much greater  our vital resources are than we had supposed.
<p>
<p>WILLIAM JAMES
<p>
<p>What one has to do, usually can be done.
<p>
<p>ELEANOR ROOSEVELT
<p>
<p>The truth is that all of us attain the greatest success and happiness  possible in this life whenever we use our native capacities to their  greatest extent.
<p>
<p>DR. SMILEY BLANTON
<p>
<p>When people say to me: "How do you do so many things?" I often  answer them, without meaning to be cruel: "How do you do so little?"  It seems to me that people have vast potential. Most people can do  extraordinary things if they have the confidence or take the risks.  Yet most people don't. They sit in front of the telly and treat life  as if it goes on forever.

<p>
<p>Human beings yield in many situations, even important and spiritual  and central ones, as long as it prolongs one's well-being. 
<p>
<p>ALEXANDER SOLZHENITSYN
<p>
<p>Man is slightly nearer to the atom than to the star. From his central  position man can survey the grandest works of Nature with the astronomer,  or the minutest works with the physicist.
<p>
<p>ARTHUR STANLEY
<p>
<p>Man is his own star, and the soul that can Render an honest and a  perfect man Commands all light, all influence, all fate.
<p>
<p>JOHN FLETCHER
<p>
<p>Men are not against you; they are merely for themselves.
<p>
<p>GENE FOWLER
<p>
<p>We are made out of oppositions; we live between two poles—you  don't reconcile the poles, you just recognize them.
<p>
<p>ORSON WELLES
<p>
<p>We are the products of editing, rather than authorship.
<p>
<p>GEORGE WALD
<p>
<p>Give them great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will eat like  wolves and fight like devils.
<p>
<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
<p>
<p>He was a poor weak human being like themselves, a human soul, weak  and helpless in suffering, shivering in the toils of the eternal struggle  of the human soul with pain.
<p>
<p>LIAM O'FLAHERTY
<p>
<p>It is possible that our race may be an accident, in a meaningless  universe, living its brief life uncared for, on this dark, cooling  star: but even so—and all the more—what marvelous creatures  we are! What fairy story, what tale from the Arabian Nights of the  Jinns, is a hundredth part as wonderful as this true fairy story of  simians! It is so much more heartening, too, than the tales we invent.  A universe capable of giving birth to many such accidents is—blind  or not—a good world to live in, a promising universe. We once  thought we lived on God's footstool; it may be a throne.
<p>
<p>CLARENCE DAY
<p>
<p>The tendency of man's nature to good is like the tendency of water  to flow downwards.
<p>
<p>MENCIUS
<p>
<p>From a distance the earth looks blue and green and the snow-capped  mountains white. From a distance the ocean meets the stream and the  eagle takes to flight. From a distance there is harmony and it echoes  through the land. It's the voice of hope. It's the voice of peace.  It's the voice of every man.
<p>
<p>JULIE GOLD
<p>
<p>I love humanity; it's people I can't stand.
<p>
<p>ANONYMOUS
<p>
<p>MR. SPOCK: May I point out that I had an opportunity to  observe your counterparts quite closely. They were brutal, savage,  unprincipled, uncivilized, treacherous—in every way, splendid  examples of Homo sapiens. The very flower of humanity. I found them  quite refreshing. CAPTAIN KIRK [To Dr. McCoy]:</I> I'm not  sure, but I think we've been insulted.

<p>
<p>Adam was human; he didn't want the apple for the apple's sake; he  wanted it because it was forbidden.
<p>
<p>MARK TWAIN
<p>
<p>Is not man himself the most unsettled of all the creatures of the  earth? What is this trembling sensation that is intensified with each  ascending step in the natural order?
<p>
<p>UGO BETTI
<p>
<p>Joy, interrupted now and again by pain and terminated ultimately by  death, seems the normal course of life in Nature. Anxiety and distress,  interrupted occasionally by pleasure, is the normal course of man's  existence.
<p>
<p>JOSEPH KRUTCH
<p>
<p>The deepest principle in human nature, is the craving to be appreciated.
<p>

<p>Consider that people are like tea bags. They don't know their own  strength until they get into hot water.

<p>Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator,  but among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh.

<p>W. H. AUDEN
<p>
<p>Humor is something that thrives between man's aspirations and his  limitations. There is more logic in humor than in anything else. Because,  you see, humor is truth.
<p>
<p>VICTOR BORGE
<p>
<p>One is healthy when one can laugh at the earnestness and zeal with  which one has been hypnotized by any single detail in one's life.
<p>
<p>FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE
<p>
<p>Humor is emotional chaos, remembered in emotional tranquility.
<p>
<p>JAMES THURBER
<p>
<p>Humor is an affirmation of dignity, a declaration of man's superiority  to all that befalls him.

<p>
<p>OSCAR WILDE

<p>The one important thing I have learned over the years is the difference  between taking one's work seriously and taking one's self seriously.  The first is imperative and the second is disastrous.

<p>MARGOT FONTEYN
<p>
<p>Laughter is an orgasm triggered by the intercourse of reason with  unreason.
<p>
<p>JACK KROLL
<p>
<p>Humor is vague, runaway stuff that hisses around the fissures and  crevices of the mind, like some sort of loose physic gas.
<p>
<p>JONATHAN MILLER
<p>
<p>Laughter is man's most distinctive emotional expression. Man shares  the capacity for love and hate, anger and fear, loyalty and grief,  with other living creatures. But humor, which has an intellectual  as well as an emotional element, belongs to man.

<p>Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and  pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to  your brother, "Let me take the speck out of your eye," when  all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first  take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly  to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
